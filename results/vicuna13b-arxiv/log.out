["* The problem of properties of short-term changes of solar activity has been studied for about 20 years.\n* Several periodicities have been detected, but the 155-day and 180-day periodicity are mentioned most often.\n* The 155-day periodicity was first detected in the occurence rate of gamma-ray flares and was confirmed for other solar flares data and for the same time period.\n* It was also found in proton flares during solar cycles 19 and 20 but not in solar flares data during solar cycles 22.\n* Several authors confirmed the 155-day periodicity for the daily sunspot area data.\n* The 155-day periodicity is always characteristic for one of the solar hemispheres and is present only during epochs of maximum activity.\n* The power of the 155-day periodicity started growing at cycle 19, decreased in cycles 20 and 21, and disappeared after cycle 21.\n* Similar analyses were performed for sunspot number, solar wind plasma, interplanetary magnetic field,", "<ol>\n <li>It is believed that the direct detection of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physical-sciences/gravitational-waves\">gravitational waves</a> (GWs) will bring the era of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physical-sciences/gravitational-wave-astronomy\">gravitational wave astronomy</a>. </li>\n <li>Interferometer detectors are now under operation and awaiting the first signal of GWs. </li>\n <li>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) can also be used as a detector for GWs. </li>\n <li>PTAs are most sensitive near the lower edge of observable frequencies, where the lower limit of the observable frequencies is determined by the inverse of the total observation time. </li>\n <li>The main target of PTAs is the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a large number of unresolved sources with astrophysical or cosmological origins in the early universe. </", "The tunneling through a potential barrier plays an important role in the microscopic world and has been extensively studied since the birth of quantum mechanics. The quantum tunneling effect governs many other nuclear processes such as fission and fusion, and a new formula for the barrier penetration formula is derived based on the WKB approximation. This new formula is used to study the @xmath0 decay half-lives of atomic nuclei, and the results are compared with the experimental results, which are reproduced well, especially for spherical nuclei.\n\nIn the present work, a new barrier penetration formula is derived based on the WKB approximation, and it is applied to evaluate the @xmath0 decay half-lives of atomic nuclei. The formula is reduced to a simpler form below the coulomb barrier and above a certain energy, below which the parabolic approximation is not valid. The WKB approximation is used to calculate the penetration probability, and the new formula is applied to spherical nuclei. The results are compared with the experimental results and found to be consistent.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. [Sec.", "Aim: to find a numerical scheme for the hybrid monte carlo algorithm (hmc) which provides a high acceptance rate while not increasing the simulation time excessively.\n\nMethods: the authors compare the performance of several numerical time integration schemes commonly used in hmc with a new approach, the adapted nested force-gradient scheme. They use the 2-dimensional Schwinger model as a test case and investigate the computational costs and effort required to achieve a satisfactory acceptance rate during the hmc evolution.\n\nResults: the authors present results of a comparison between the commonly used algorithms and the new approach. The new approach provides a higher acceptance rate while not drastically increasing the simulation time.\n\nConclusion: The authors conclude that the new approach is a promising numerical scheme for the hmc algorithm and could be used in more computationally demanding problems such as QCD calculations."]
