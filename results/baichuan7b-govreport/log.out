["--- FDA and USDA do not regulate how cell-cultured meat firms obtain tissue samples. --- FDA --- FDA and USDA do not regulate the use of fetal bovine serum, a known vector for transmissible diseases, in cell-cultured meat. Turning the cells into a product. How will producers turn the cells into a product? One firm\u2019s representative stated that the technology will be the biggest challenge, but one of the more fundamental issues cell-cultured meat firms are facing, particularly because most of these firms are still in the early stages of development. Other questions are likely for early-stage developers as well, but remain unanswered at this time. For example, according to one federal regulatory official, cell-cultured meat firms are likely to focus initially on chicken because it is the lowest risk in terms of safety (e.g., the chance that cells will start dividing without proper containment). Questions about the path to commercial production of cell-cultured meat remain in both the food industry and with government regulation. Government officials have said that commercial production technology development is underway, and firms that produce cell-cultured meat have indicated that they are considering different scaffolding methods when the science and technology allow. For example, several firms told us that they are researching the use of a new type of edible scaffold that is biodegradable at the end of the product\u2019s shelf life. Cell-cultured meat firms also state that they are looking at how to produce products with fewer environmental impact, such as by using renewable energy and reducing their carbon footprint. However, FDA and USDA officials stated that they do not have information on whether cell-cultured meat firms are pursuing any of these technologies as commercial production proceeds. For example, one USDA official said that it is not known whether the use of edible scaffolds, which could enable cell-cultured meat firms to scale up production, will reduce environmental impact. 3. Environmental impact. Information about the emissions of greenhouse gases from processing cell-cultured meat is unclear. However, cell-cultured meat firms said that their technology was designed to generate less greenhouse gases than conventional livestock products; cell-cultured meat firms told us that their production methods are based on technology used in the pharmaceutical and bioscience industries. A cell-cultured meat company told us that it is developing methods for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by using renewable energy and removing carbon from the atmosphere to be used in production instead of in the atmosphere. Another question for federal officials will be the potential for regulatory oversight to ensure that this cell-cultured meat is safe from any contamination of chemicals that could alter the characteristics of the final product (e.g., nutrients or microbiological contaminants). FDA officials have indicated that agency officials are preparing to draft guidance to help the industry address this issue. Specifically, FDA indicated that it has been working on a draft guidance that will focus on how to control chemical contamination in cell-cultured meat. These efforts demonstrate the agency\u2019s commitment to providing assistance to cell-cultured meat firms as they consider product safety issues. The agencies also told us that they are starting to consider how they could regulate cell-cultured meat if it receives GRAS status or FDA approval as a food additive. This could require additional discussions between agencies and experts in these particular areas. Similarly, FDA officials stated that they are drafting guidance on the labeling process for cell-cultured meat in coordination with USDA. The current law concerning labeling for cell-cultured meat may change as a result of an ongoing FDA public hearing that focuses on the law\u2019s requirement concerning the labeling of food products derived from cell cultures. We have not received any response to our request for information on whether, or how, agencies are looking at product labeling for cell-cultured meat or for other cell-cultured meat product-related questions. As we reported in our prior work, FDA has created a new legal framework for regulating new methods of food production. Based on that legal framework, FDA issued a proposed statement of the FDA\u2019s policy on approving a new food. Specifically, we identified legal provisions that have the potential to increase flexibility in how FDA decides to regulate these novel methods. We also identified issues that have the potential to limit flexibility for FDA and other agencies to decide how to oversee new products. If FDA approves cell-cultured meat, there will most likely be a transitional period for the industry. The law does", "291398.431    EPA\u2019s FACA process                                                                                    EPA\u2019s approach changed during the course of any given fiscal year; therefore, we did not conduct an analysis of any one fiscal year\u2019s FACA process in a vacuum.                                                                                                             18 17 14 17 17 15 13                                                                           30th January 2018.

Specifically, officials stated that the Navy currently tracks storm-induced damage on the installation and incorporates the results into its annual damage assessment and budget preparation for the installation. On a regional scale, the installation and two nearby Navy bases conduct stormwater drainage studies and construction projects to manage the effects of stormrunoff. The installation is also studying the possibility of relocating the installation\u2019s sub-station. Installations generally had information on extreme weather and climate change effects integrated across their project planning process. For example, according to a former official at Langley Air Force Base, the base\u2019s operations division and project management division integrate information on extreme weather and climate change effects into the planning process for new installations or other facility projects. At Fort Irwin, we interviewed officials at the installation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Officials at each office stated that the other office\u2019s information on climate is often included in the installation\u2019s information to planning officials. The officials stated that the extent of the integration of climate information varies across the installation. In addition, the installation works with the Corps of Engineers on planning projects that could have potential effects from sea level rise. Langley Air Force Base has developed, and continues to update, the DOD Joint Base Operating System (JOBS) for development and operation of its military installation. At the installation, project managers use information in the JOBS guidance to help plan for long- and short-term base projects and conduct short-range projects on an as-needed basis. Langley Air Force Base used JOBS for the construction of the Joint Base Inlet Control System to protect the main inlet from storm runoff. Weaknesses in the way DOD manages budgetary and maintenance risk from extreme weather and climate change effects pose challenges for planning facilities, infrastructure, and sustainment operations. Although DOD and the military services manage the risks associated with extreme weather and climate change effects on their budgets by funding projects in a timely manner under the DOD acquisition framework, these factors can make identifying cost efficiencies more difficult, as the military services and DOD must allocate a portion of their overall funds to specific budget lines. While it may be difficult to estimate the full extent of costs associated with climate effects, we found ways that DOD and the military services are considering those effects in some budget and budget preparation processes and at the military service organizational levels. At the Department of Defense level, the department\u2019s Office of Budget\u2019s acquisition guidance, in accordance with the requirements specified in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017, requires the secretarial representative of the Military Services, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the military services\u2019 Assistant Secretaries for Acquisition, Program Executive Officers, and the Director of Defense Research and Engineering to prepare a joint report as soon as practicable after each fiscal year for which they receive an appropriation and annually for the past fiscal year regarding the use of their funds for science, engineering, and systems development programs and projects, the effect on department acquisition programs of climate change, whether climate change is being addressed across their respective acquisition programs and whether or not DOD development programs have identified climate change as a risk, and any other information they deem appropriate. We made four general recommendations to correct the weaknesses in the management of budgetary and maintenance risk resulting from extreme weather and climate change effects. Based on a review of our response to the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, we considered his comments but recommended that the recommendations in our report remain as written. Additionally, given the Department of Defense\u2019s overall concerns regarding the appropriateness of the information used in the Master The Plan: An Assessment of Selected Selected Installations Master Plans DOD.gov, we recommended that this master plan include detailed information on DOD\u2019s activities at these installations in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 20 years that describe expected changes in the range of future climatic conditions that a particular installation would experience and, separately, for both the climate and budgetary risk the installation could potentially face. We are forwarding our report to the Senate Committee on Armed Services and Congress, for follow-up on our recommendations if they determine that this information should be included in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Master Plan, as directed by the SecDef. Additionally, we shared our report with the National", "112 SENATE HELP COMMITTEE REPORT MARCH 2019 found that CMS\u2019s penalty for not coming into compliance on the date of implementation was almost always the same as the penalty for not correcting all deficiencies after a deficiency has been implemented. For example, the most commonly imposed penalties for abuse deficiencies occurred after the deficiency had been identified through one of the mechanisms described above; that is, a deficiency was enforced that did not have an implementation date, and a deficiency with an implementation date was enforced without an implementation date. Specifically, a nursing home could have its Medicare and Medicaid payments immediately suspended even if the deficiency with the most severe penalties had not been implemented to correct all deficiencies. Thus, an enforcement action is most likely to affect nursing homes after the deficiency is corrected. We found that a significant increase in the rate of deficiencies cited for certain components related to abuse and neglect were observed from 2013 through 2017. Specifically, we found that while rates at the nationwide level remained level or decreased for all the nursing home components, rates for abuse and its subcomponents rose substantially, particularly from 2013 to 2015. We found rates at the nationwide level to have been relatively stable from October 2016 through September 2017 for all but two components: facilities with deficiencies and inspections. When we examined these changes against the increase we found in the rate at which the state had already identified deficiencies that had been cited, we noted a negative correlation between the two trends: for almost all components, a more rapid increase in the rate of cases at the national level resulted from the state already having identified a higher proportion of cases at the state level than they had in years past. Moreover, the rate of deficiencies cited also increased in areas considered to be more frequently abusive, including the areas of physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or psychological abuse, and neglect. (See figs. 5 and 6.) In 2017, at the national level, the rate of deficiencies for facilities\u2014and therefore, the rate of deficiencies for all components\u2014increased slightly compared to 2013. Specifically, while deficiencies decreased from 2013 to 2014, deficiencies remained steady between 2014 and 2016, at .75 deficiencies per 1,000 Medicare and Medicaid beds. In 2017, the number of deficiencies rose to .76. The year-to-year change in the number of deficiencies was, on average, more in favor of deficiencies\u2014i.e., more instances of deficiencies over time\u2014for most nursing home components, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or psychological abuse, and neglect. (See fig. 7.) With the 2017 data, we were able to break down nursing homes for the first time into public, private, and"]
