["Federal agencies have overlapping jurisdiction over some aspects of food safety  inspection functions, and those functions are carried out in different  ways. FDA, as the national food safety agency, has responsibility for  ensuring that, among other provisions, the products it regulates are safe,  are produced under sanitary conditions, do not contain any filthy,  decomposed, or putrid substances, and are processed in whole or in part in an  inspected facility. USDA, as the national inspection agency with responsibility  for assuring the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products, is charged with  inspecting these facilities. In addition, as noted in the above text, Congress  has given FDA the responsibility for overseeing the labeling of all foods,  regardless of jurisdiction. Flavor is a critical component of the taste and mouth  feel of any food product. The flavor industry plays an increasing and essential role  in developing new and exciting foods with exceptional flavor and taste  profiles. The foods consumed by Americans are increasingly flavored with  exotic or novel ingredients, such as fruits, nuts, spices, and other  floral sources. Such flavorings, whether natural or synthetic, can be  complex. To meet the needs of the flavor industry, the flavor chemist must  isolate, purify, identify, synthesize (if not naturally available), and develop  novel flavor chemicals and aroma chemicals. Synthetic flavor chemistry is  one aspect of the flavor industry that has been evolving for many years.  Synthetic flavor manufacturing is complex. A large number of volatile  substances may require purification before a suitable flavoring oil can  be obtained. Many of these molecules have no smell and are identified by  spectroscopic means. Sometimes the chemical properties of a substance  can be predicted by their molecular weight and functional groups present  on the molecule. However, in other cases the chemist must rely on the skill  of prediction based on the experience with similar compounds. Often, the  predicted properties do not agree with the actual physical properties  obtained. To predict the behavior of a flavor molecule, the chemist must  understand the role it would play in the flavor system. To create a new  flavor molecule, chemists are turning more and more to natural substances  and trying to copy them. These natural substances are complex and must  first be reduced to their main functional groups that can be assembled into  smaller repeating units. These units are the building blocks that can be  manipulated into various flavors. For those flavor chemicals that are not  obtained in the laboratory, the flavor chemist must first isolate the  compound from its source. Once purified, its physical and chemical  properties can be studied. Once the structure of the product is determined,  it is then synthesized to ensure its use in the flavor industry.\n14. 14 This section focuses on the U.S. food flavor industry. Food flavor companies  provide flavorings for use in foods, both for processed foods and also  for products to be sold in their natural state. They provide flavors for use  in many ways, including direct flavoring of a specific product, product  line, or brand, or for use in an experimental kitchen for testing of both  new products or new flavors of existing products. Some of the larger companies  manufacture flavors for both the industrial market and for home use.  Chemical flavors play a large part in the flavoring industry. There  are several major flavoring agents that may be used alone or in  combinations according to formulation. Some are not used in combination  with other flavors because of the unpleasant character of the compound,  such as butyric acid or 2-furaldehyde. Other compounds are  much nicer by themselves but can be more easily handled by adding  a very small amount of another compound, or a blend, to improve  the sensory profile. Such a mixture is referred to as a \u201cfruit complex,\u201d  such as \u201cbanana, strawberry, orange, pineapple, etc.\u201d For some of  these combinations, a synthetic chemical, an enhancer, can be added  so that in blending they become more sensitive to flavor profiles.  Synthetic chemicals are used to produce flavor and/or aroma  compounds that are difficult to obtain or obtain in only small  quantities.  Enhancer \u2013 a small quantity, often in the form of oils, of a  compound added", "The EPA's Federal Advisory Committee Management Division helps the agency to manage its advisory committees and to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 (FACA). FACA sets forth the minimum procedural requirements for the formation and operation of federal advisory committees, including federal advisory committees.

Among its goals is to maintain access and freedom of action in areas of current or future military importance; deter, delay, deny, and degrade efforts by state or non-state actors to harm U.S. interests by projecting U.S. power in areas of current or projected military operations; and counter threats posed by long-range precision strikes and counterspace capabilities. Climate-driven environmental changes have the potential to diminish the U.S. military\u2019s capability to fulfill the functions of its defense strategy and adversely affect the achievement of U.S. security objectives in a number of ways. A 2010 review by the Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and\nDecision Support Program, which is responsible for providing DOD with environmentally and climate-related information and analyses, concluded that climate-related impacts threaten the achievement of all 10 of the program\u2019s identified goals, which include ensuring the availability of installations and sustaining their use for training and testing, as well as ensuring the reliability and availability of energy sources necessary for defense functions. In October 2009, the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center developed a tool to assess climate change risks to military installations that could help address these risks. The center developed the tool by combining three types of information: climate projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Change Science Program, climate change adaptation strategies for DOD installations developed by the U.S. Army Environmental Policy Institute, and specific vulnerability assessments for each military installation. This information can inform master planning and environmental compliance processes, and facilitate integration of climate change adaptation planning across the DOD environment and safety workforce. Climate change puts U.S. national security at risk in two broad ways: It degrades the effectiveness of American forces, and it gives rise to destabilizing consequences for people and governments in other regions of the world. A recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan policy research center in Washington, D.C., concluded that climate change could exacerbate instability in areas affected by competition for power, resources, and access, which could in turn threaten the flow of natural resources and energy on which American and global economic prosperity relies. These developments could trigger conflict, which could in turn require U.S. military intervention to address the consequences of climate change. Moreover, the military\u2019s own climate change policy concluded that climate change, and U.S. military activities contributing to it, could cause global environmental and public health consequences in the future that could endanger national security. For instance, as a result of climate change, U.S. military facilities could face more frequent and intense weather events, which could degrade their mission sustainability. In July 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published its Climate Adaptation Strategy, which provides a framework for addressing the effects of climate change on natural resources and wildlife populations. The strategy recommends maintaining resilient, dynamic, and diverse natural systems that incorporate climate change risks through conservation and management actions. Among the strategy\u2019s identified adaptation approaches are improving management practices, expanding habitat connectivity, planning for resilience under changing conditions, and collaborating with adjacent land owners and other partners to provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing conditions. Improved management practices aim at maximizing biodiversity, carbon sequestration, other ecosystem services, and adaptation potential.\nProvide information and education to installations on climate change risks and adaptation efforts\nDevelop and assess options for climate change adaptation that consider potential risks to mission sustainability\nTo protect U.S. military installations from the impacts of climate change, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to evaluate the effects of flooding and other weather events on military installations and determine whether installations are vulnerable to climate change impacts. The assessment should include a determination of whether military installations are prepared for and equipped to adapt to climate change and what changes might be needed to adapt to these impacts.", "Nursing homes are required to keep residents safe\nMUST HAVE: APA RULES\nSUMMARIZATION ANALYSIS\n(Rhetorical Analyses) Rhetorical Analysis\nRhetorical Analysis: This type of analysis focuses on the persuasive aspects of a piece of writing: the author's reasons for writing, the way the author's argument is constructed, the evidence the author offers in support of his or her argument, and so on.\nIdentify a passage that best demonstrates the author's ability to build an effective argument, use good examples, and offer appropriate supporting evidence.\nThen, explain how the author supports his or her central claim.\nSummarizing the text effectively can often involve paraphrasing, quoting, or summarizing\n(in the form of your rhetorical analysis) from multiple parts of the text; as a result, you will need to do some work with attribution.\nThe most complete form of attribution is parenthetical citation, which places the author's last name and the page number where the text appears on the right-hand side of the page, as close as possible to the actual words that are being paraphrased.\nThe idea is to make it clear which parts of the text are being used and to help people who come along later to examine or refute the analysis.\nWhen the attribution is parenthetical rather than complete, all that is required is the name of the author and the page or paragraph number.\nIt is also important to put the attribution on a line by itself -- do not use any special symbols or italicization.

(BOLD TYPE): TEXT:\nOur December 2017 report identified a number of safety management deficiencies at INL. These included not having a comprehensive accident prevention program and managing safety as a support function, allowing senior managers to oversee operations despite safety concerns, and a deficient approach to managing safety performance. INL senior managers had not taken steps to address concerns related to safety, or to hold employees accountable for safety performance shortfalls. As a result, employees had not received safety training, the hazardous materials management program had not been fully implemented, and inspections with violations had been completed without documented corrective actions. (BOLD TYPE): TEXT:\nWe have made numerous recommendations aimed at addressing problems identified in earlier reviews. The contractor\u2019s current plan for remedying the issues identified, approved by EM, includes commitments to complete all 182 corrective actions and implement other improvements. The contractor also is developing a site-wide safety plan that will include the performance of some corrective actions in fiscal year 2019 or later even though they are currently on the list of corrective actions that have to be completed before the end of fiscal year 2018.

In addition, although we found that the contractor had an oversight process for safety, we further determined that EM\u2019s oversight of the systematic process to ensure that safety tasks are being completed was ineffective. As a result of these weaknesses, the Idaho Cleanup Project\u2019s safety plan relied on uncompleted corrective actions and did not ensure the required safety controls were in place.

The act was reauthorized in 2014 and the reauthorization included a focus on improving the over-all quality of child-Care Services and development of participating children. In September of 2016, the Office of Child Care published new rules (CCDF regulations) to provide clarity to states on how to implement this law and administer the program in a way that best meets the needs of children, child-Care providers, and families. The CCDBG Act and CCDF regulations allow states flexibility in developing CCDF programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within that state. The Office of Child Care is a program office within the Admin-istration for Children and Families (ACF) that works with state governments to administer the CCDF program. The Office of Inspe-ction General (OIG) performed this review to assess the effectiveness of the OCC\u2019s oversight of the improper payment risk identified in the CCDBG\u2019s state estimates.", "The purpose of PMIAA is to improve program and projectmanagement in certain larger federal agencies.

Rationale: GAO reported in June 2019 that many nursing homes had facility-reported incidents (including some that are allegations of potential abuse) that had not been captured in CMS\u2019s incident databases because nursing homes and State Survey Agency officials were not certain of the data elements to include in these reports.\nFor more information on this recommendation, and HHS and CMS\u2019s response, see pages 41-46 in attachment 2.\nCMS\u2019s enforcement weaknesses put residents at risk Nursing home regulators and law enforcement must take actions to protect residents from abuse in nursing homes. However, we found numerous gaps in CMS\u2019s process for detecting, evaluating, and investigating facility abuse concerns\u2014specifically, from facility-reported incidents (FRIs) and state survey agency (SSAs) reports. As a result, FRIs may not receive appropriate attention and referrals to law enforcement may be delayed or missed for abuse reports that meet referral criteria. In June 2019, we found that CMS has not consistently followed requirements to refer state survey agency (SSA) reports alleging abuse or possible abuse to law enforcement. According to GAO\u2019s review of randomly selected FRIs from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, approximately 43 percent of identified FRIs did not include sufficient data to meet the requirements of CMS regulations for an SSA report. Additionally, in June 2019, CMS estimated that in fiscal year 2018, the most recent data on which GAO based this evaluation, the agency did not complete an appropriate investigation of at least 30 percent of FRIs and closed without an investigation at least 18 percent of SRIs. Accordingly, CMS did not perform an appropriate investigation for more than 10 percent of all reports and took no timely regulatory action for at least 18 percent of abuse and potential abuse reports that met investigation criteria.. Because of these gaps, abuse and potential abuse reports that meet investigation criteria may not receive appropriate attention and FRIs may not receive appropriate attention. Therefore, CMS cannot address all reports of abuse in its facilities. CMS officials agreed with the recommendations and HHS concurred with the four recommendations for CMS. HHS did not fully address two of the recommendations and plans to take additional actions on these recommendations:  RECOMMENDATION: HHS should require CMS to take appropriate regulatory or legal actions, including conduct timely and thorough investigations, against those nursing homes that do not comply with the regulations that apply to abuse cases. Rationale: Without enforcement actions that CMS takes against nursing homes that are noncompliant with regulations specific to facility abuse investigations, CMS\u2019s facility abuse investigations can continue to perform inappropriately and expose residents of nursing homes to abuse or neglect. For more information on this recommendation, and HHS and CMS\u2019s response, see page 55 in attachment 2. HHS and CMS said that additional actions to respond to the recommendation would depend on actions they take in response to our second recommendation.  SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATION 3: HHS should require CMS to develop an automated process that would identify and prioritize facility-reported incidents that meet investigation criteria so CMS could address those reports appropriately.  Rationale: We found numerous opportunities to use an automated process to expedite a facility-reported incident investigation. As an example, we found a  facility-reported incident in November 2016 stating that one resident reported that another resident attempted to rip out her tube while the victim was hooked up to a pole used as a means of transportation in the nursing home. The facility report stated, \u201cthe resident reported this in a joking manner.\u201d Nursing home staff said they do not believe it was intentional, and the incident report was closed for lack of information. Despite the clear potential for harm, this was among the incidents closed without appropriate consideration. As a result of the lack of information, the facility\u2019s investigation was not as detailed or comprehensive as it should have been. Moreover, we found that nursing home staff in some cases were unfamiliar with or uncertain about investigation criteria in their nursing homes\u2019 policies and procedures for abuse cases. Consequently, CMS nursing home surveyors should not continue to investigate cases until a facility report meets", "TEXT The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation program is the fastest-growing disability program in the federal government, providing tax-free monthly payments for disabilities caused or aggravated by military service. This program has several key features but the primary consideration in a determination of eligibility for benefits is the nature of the service-connected condition. VA provides an estimate of a veteran\u2019s monthly compensation payment by assigning a percentage rating (from 0 to 100 percent) to the veteran\u2019s service-connected medical condition(s) and multiplying the percentage by a monetary figure (called a monthly rates schedule) for each condition. A veteran generally must be rated at 10 percent or greater in order to qualify for compensation. The compensation payment depends on the sum of these disability ratings. Figure 1 is an example of the compensation ratings schedule, but it is important to remember that individual compensation payments will add other monthly compensation amounts based on whether the disabled veteran has dependents and whether the veteran has a special-circumstances disability rating. Figure 2 is a chart that shows how the average compensation payment changed from approximately $14,000 in fiscal year 2013 to approximately $17,000 in fiscal year 2018. 44\tGAO-19-24  Table 1 provides data showing the number of disability compensation claims and the percentage of compensation claims involving a service- connected condition with an average and combined disability rating.

DREAM ACT ISSUE: Ineligibility to Apply for DREAM Act benefits (Form I-821D) \u2013 (a U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident Parent) Deferred action does not confer legal status. Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal action that is not a form of relief or protection from removal for non-LPR students who meet specific criteria. Therefore, under current regulations, eligible students cannot apply for DREAM Act benefits, which apply to those who: have lawful permanent residency or U.S. citizenship; are currently enrolled and have been in the U.S. since June 15, 2007; and entered the U.S. under the age of 16. Students who are approved for DACA relief also cannot change, extend, or adjust their nonimmigrant status in the U.S. under this policy change. Therefore, DREAM ACT benefits cannot be extended to include USCIS deferred action students who are eligible for the DREAM ACT based on the June 15, 2012 Policy Change.\nStudent status under DACA does not give students authorization to work lawfully in the U.S. or access state and federal benefits.

Background Forced labor is considered by many to be \u201cmodern slavery.\u201d The use of forced labor is condemned internationally and has been prohibited for decades, with the first international treaty against forced labor being established by the League of Nations in 1931 and later adopted by the United Nations.1 Forced labor refers to any type of work imposed involuntarily upon an individual through the use of force or other forms of coercion under which, among other things, the worker is required to perform services without pay or at pay below minimum wages, without compensation, or against his or her will or without choice or consent or direction.2 In addition to international and national-level laws, companies often have internal policies in place to provide some assurance that their merchandise is produced in accordance with acceptable labor standards. For example, Wal-Mart announced its supplier code of conduct in 2005, which specifically prohibits \u201cforced labor\u201d and \u201ccompulsory labor.\u201d3 A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2002 describes \u201cforced labor\u201d as \u201can employer\u2019s unlawfully and involuntarily compelling its workers, including through direct or implied threats of violence or by fraud or other deception, to remain on the employer\u2019s [sic. \u201cin\u201d] premises beyond the duration or terms of their work contract or without adequate remuneration.\u201d4 According to an International Labour Organization report, \u201cThe United Nations estimated that, [b]ased on ILO estimates, some 12 million persons in forced labor of that 22 1 See generally, Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, June 28, 1930, 32 A.T. 165 (entered into force on May 1, 1932), at http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/BlobServer/LibraryFiles/standards/UN454714206587535684_web.pdf (last viewed Nov. 20, 2018). 2 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and International Labour Organization, Model Legal Framework on Forced Labour, at https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/commission-on-narcotic-drugs/Paper_3_Model_Legal_Framework_EN.pdf (last viewed Nov. 20, 2018.) 3 For more information about Wal-Mart\u2019s supplier code of conduct, see https://corporate.walmart.com/article/code-suppliers-english. 4 United States Government Accountability Office, International Labor Rights: Federal Efforts and Opportunities to Enhance Compliance with International Labor Standards, GAO-03-109, http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03109.pdf (last viewed Nov. 20, 2018). 4 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights at 9, available at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/WCFA.aspx (last viewed Nov. 2", "SFC is an expert at summarization. Please proceed with the following text. SOCOM, a combat supporting component of the military departments, is responsible for providing Special Operatives to the Unified Combatant Commanders (UCINCs) and other joint force commanders tasked with national security operations. SOCOM fulfills this responsibility by directly employing, in a Title 10 capacity, its own SOF, augmenting other SOF, and providing other SOF support. SOCOM\u2019s SOF provide unique skills, equipment, and expertise to combat a broad range of conditions to achieve mission accomplishment. The mission sets include unconventional warfare (UW), counterterrorism (CT), security assistance (SA), counter-improvised explosive devices (C-IED), information operations (IO), and direct action/special reconnaissance (DA/SR). SOCOM\u2019s SOF are composed of the active forces of the services and U.S. Coast Guard, augmented by selected personnel from the National Guard, Reserves, foreign nationals, and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies. These SOF conduct operations across the spectrum of conflict, from routine border missions to large-scale contingency operations, and can be found working in the most austere of environments. SOF often operate under intense, multidimensional, high-risk conditions to successfully perform their missions. Their primary strengths are speed, agility, and precision. SOF are unique and play a different role in the national security apparatus than other members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Unlike other military forces, SOF generally are not tasked with supporting the defense of the nation during a large-scale war or conflict. Rather, SOF maintain a posture that provides an offensive platform to project specialized forces anywhere in the world. SOF also possess advanced technical capabilities that are more easily transitionable and adaptable to meet the rapid pace of change needed to address the many different and evolving operational requirements around the world as directed by the UCINCs and SOCOM. SOCOM\u2019s capabilities are diverse and encompass the complete complement of SOF activities. Its mission includes support to the national security strategy and its ability to project SOF, augment the nation\u2019s counterterrorism, and CT; DA/SR/intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance efforts and their ability to integrate air, ground, and maritime SOF; support operations; and cyber warfare. SOCOM also supports the development capacity of allied nations and the establishment of a persistent and global presence by employing and integrating its SOF and their activities into the multidomain, multifunctional Joint Force operations.", "While UNRWA is in agreement with U.S. policy to support moderation and non-violence within the content of its curriculum, it is limited in its authority over what goes into the curriculum developed by Palestinian textbook agencies and approved by Palestinian Authority (PA) educational authorities for implementation. The process by which UNRWA curricula will or will not adhere to U.S. policy depends on whether or not issues relevant to the policy are included in the relevant textbooks, which is at the PA\u2019s discretion. UNRWA also lacks sufficient resources and capability to implement curriculum revisions at its schools in a timely manner, especially during periods of political change or upheaval when PA educational authorities decide to introduce new textbooks.\nAs such, no matter how much UNRWA may wish to do so, UNRWA will not be a key component of the U.S. policy initiative to influence Palestinian Authority curricula to promote moderation and a non-violent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The U.S. should therefore devote more resources to the project of directly influencing Palestinian Authority Educational Agencies to ensure that textbooks reflect moderation and non-violence. With respect to educational assistance provided with U.S. funds and implemented under the auspices of USAID, the U.S. should require USAID to be more involved in vetting relevant curriculum in order to ensure that American policy is implemented in the classroom. The U.S. can work to help bring about these changes by providing the PA with financial and technical assistance, with emphasis on the implementation of such assistance as may be necessary to meet U.S. policy requirements.\nThe U.S. should also endeavor to ensure that adequate resources are provided to relevant educational agencies so that existing curricula may be revised without delay and textbooks may be affordably replaced as needed. Finally, in terms of education, the U.S. policy initiative should also include the provision of scholarships for outstanding Palestinian-administered students whose career interests would be consistent with promoting U.S. policy objectives, including moderation and non-violence, and the professional development of Palestinian educators and administrators through the provision of scholarships, workshops, and academic courses.", "The Deputy Under Secretary for Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation (DAE) has a responsibility under Secretary\u2019s Order 3037-03 to implement the President\u2019s Management Agenda and OMB\u2019s Program Assessment Rating Tool, and perform strategic analyses of Mission Areas, business centers, and programs. DAE also has responsibility to assess the mission areas against the criteria established by OMB in the Performance.gov and to perform strategic analysis of the mission areas. DAE\u2019s Office of Data, Analysis, and Strategic Initiatives (DASI) provides program management expertise to support the mission areas and their business centers. However, mission are and business centers that provide similar or same services operate independently. As a result, the missions aren\u2019t always focused on how the Department can implement the President\u2019s Management Agenda or provide the best service. Without a Department-wide set of standards and measurement to focus the mission areas effort, services may be provided in a duplicative or redundant manner. DAE lacks documentation to demonstrate consistent implementation of a strategic vision for mission areas, business centers, or programs. Specifically, DAE lacks documentation or a tool to show the Secretary of Agriculture how performance of the business centers and programs affects the overall performance of each mission area. DAE has re-evaluated it roles in each mission area (i.e. Rural Development, Economic, and International Development, Natural Resources and Environment, and Research, Education, and Economics) to determine if it can improve its oversight roles to better support mission achievement. DAE has made progress in re-evaluating those roles in one of the five mission areas (i.e. Rural Development). However, DAE has not developed an approach to evaluate roles in the remaining mission areas or business centers. Specifically, DAE has not developed processes to identify roles for each mission area and/or business center, and to develop and validate performance metrics based on roles that will drive performance. The DAE is responsible to develop strategic plans and workforce plans that show how the individual mission area and business centers will align with the Secretary\u2019s overarching strategic plan and Department performance goals. However, DAE lacks documented evidence of its approach on how it develops its strategic plans or develops its workforce plans. We believe that the DAE\u2019s reforms to show how mission areas and business centers contribute to overall Mission Area performance can only be successfully implemented if accompanied by efforts to show how the Department\u2019s workforce contribute to performance. For this reason, we recommend that DAI establishes an approach to develop and document strategic plans for mission areas and business centers under a Department-wide strategic planning process designed to drive performance. Specifically, we recommend: \u2022 Determine the mission area(s) or business center(s) responsibilities and/or roles in delivering the mission; \u2022 Develop and validate performance metrics that are directly linked to the mission areas and business centers responsibilities or roles; \u2022 Develop a department-wide strategic planning framework that show how individual mission area strategic plans and workforce plans are inter-related for improved performance and contribution to mission; \u2022 Document the results and lessons learned on the roles and responsibility for the mission areas and business centers. These lessons learned should inform the department-wide strategic planning process. \u2022 Document and share the strategic plans and linkages for business centers and mission areas to the overall mission areas and strategic objectives. RECOMMENDATION: We recommend the Deputy Under Secretary for Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation (DAE) take steps to use a Department-wide strategic planning process to develop strategic plans for mission areas and business centers under a Department-wide strategic planning process designed to drive performance.", "This is not an end-to-end test that tests accessibility of a product.

OIG is making two recommendations to MSHA: require an operator\u2019s safety director to submit annual reports to the operator\u2019s CEO and ensure the reports to the CEO include an annual assessment of the mine\u2019s compliance with all seven requirements. The Agency\u2019s comments on our proposed recommendation are included in the report. In response to our prior reviews and the MSHA request in the recent audit plan, we conducted a review to assess MSHA\u2019s oversight of coal mine operators\u2019 compliance with seven federal requirements for mine examinations. The audit objectives were to evaluate the Agency\u2019s oversight of coal mine operators\u2019 compliance and to assess the effectiveness of MSHA\u2019s internal oversight audits of the enforcement process. To achieve the audit objectives of our review, we (1) selected eight operators chosen randomly from the MSHA national database of 3,778 active operators; and nine operators chosen based on certain MSHA enforcement patterns that reflected noncompliance.1 We also interviewed MSHA safety and field personnel at MSHA headquarters and District 17 field offices; the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Mine Safety and Health and an Assistant Director of Mine Safety and Health in the Office of Assessments and Standards; and an MSHA Regional Solicitor and Associate Solicitor in Region 3. MSHA contracted with a nationally recognized accounting firm to provide contractual oversight for its internal oversight audits. We reviewed the report of the auditor to evaluate whether the firm had complied with federal contracting requirements and the terms of the written contract. We also provided a limited scope of services by reviewing the terms of contract between the Agency and accounting firm to determine if MSHA\u2019s internal oversight of the enforcement process was effective, and interviewed several audit team members. Our objective for the scope of our work was not to form an opinion on the internal oversight audit process or the internal oversight audit team.

We noted that the Agency\u2019s solicitor, however, acknowledged that federal law does not expressly prohibit the Office of the Inspector General from performing performance audits of enforcement agencies. Because the Office of the Inspector General has the statutory authority to conduct performance audits and we intend to perform such audits if allowed, the Agency\u2019s solicitor advised us to request that the Agency add this issue as \u201cAudit Matter\u201d into the FY 2019 audit plan that MSHA provided in July 2018. We consider this recommendation open and may pursue it in FY 2019 if requested by MSHA. FINDING 2. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has significant oversight challenges in conducting reviews of MSHA\u2019s enforcement of federal mine safety and health regulations, particularly reviews that focus exclusively on enforcement, but the Agency\u2019s comments did not address the specific issue cited in this finding. To conduct this review, OIG requested, and received, MSHA\u2019s data on citations, violations, and orders. OIG requested samples of 500 operators\u2019 data on examinations. Our sample methodology was based on two variables: whether the mine produces coal or not, and whether a mine had a pattern of noncompliance with the seven exam requirements from FY 2015 through FY 2017. OIG requested the data sample based on the number of mines the Agency produced, not the number of mines in", "The fiscal condition of state and local government\nWhat are the fiscal condition trends for state and local government?

However, little is known about the number of veterans who are also AI/AN and who are eligible to concurrently enroll in both IHS and VA healthcare system, or how many of them actually do. VA and IHS lack any administrative mechanism to determine the number of individuals enrolled in both of their systems. Also, there is no systematic, national oversight of data reported by the healthcare providers administering care to individuals concurrently enrolled in the IHS and VA systems. Both VA and IHS do not require data on the number of concurrent enrollments from their healthcare providers. Consequently, VA and IHS cannot determine whether their healthcare providers are concurrently enrolling Veterans in these two program. VA and IHS do not have any reliable information on the number of Indians who are concurrently enrolled in the VA and IHS systems or whether these concurrent enrollments reflect veterans with an AI/AN background versus other AI/AN Americans who are not veterans. These concurrent enrollments may affect the quality of veterans\u2019 care, the availability of healthcare providers, and/or the cost of Veteran\u2019s care to the U.S. Government. Thus, the IHS and VA OIG recommended that the IHS OIG look into this matter and perform this evaluation. FINDINGS: Our review found the total number of concurrent users was difficult to determine due to the following: \u2022 Lack of data in both VA and IHS electronic medical record systems/information sharing (EMR) \u2022 Mixed eligibility between VA and IHS \u2022 Lack of clarity on tribal services provided by tribal providers \u2022 Mental health providers have access to more extensive data that include concurrent enrollees than other healthcare providers \u2022 Members of IHS and VA healthcare teams were unable or unwilling to answer important questions METHODOLOGY: \u2022 We reviewed the laws and regulations governing VA and IHS; VA and IHS enrollment cards; VA and IHS electronic patient records and billing systems; U.S. Census Bureau Indian Tribal Classification; and VA OIG and Indian Health Service OIG audits. \u2022 Using data from HHS\u2019s FY2017 FY Cost report, FY2017 VA-IHS Interagency Agreement and VA-IHS Tribal Contracts, we estimated an IHS-funded cost of $6,187,630 for concurrent enrollments in the IHS System, the vast majority of which is VA Veterans (65%). \u2022 Our methodology for identifying concurrent enrollments was to obtain case counts for Indian-Veteran clients, for which our review focused on IHS Tribal Contract Providers.

According to officials from OFAC and other partner agencies, key goals of the Kingpin Act include disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations and blocking designees&#39; access to the U.S. financial system. The Kingpin Act mandates the participation of certain agencies in the Kingpin designation process. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with partner agencies, is authorized to designate a foreign national or entity as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker. The partner agencies participating in Kingpin Act designations are the Department of Justice (DOJ), State, DHS, DOD, CIA, FBI, and DEA. For Treasury to designate a foreign individual or entity under the Kingpin Act, it must identify that individual or entity as either a significant foreign narcotics trafficker or part of a designee&#39;s network. OFAC and its partner agencies have grouped these Kingpin Act designation categories into two tiers, Tier 1 and Tier 2, based on the procedures required for identification and designation under the act. (See tab. 1.) All identifications and designations under the Kingpin Act are subject to the same asset blocking, prohibiting transactions, denying visas, and penalties. Assets. Treasury blocks (i.e., denies access to) a designated individual or entity&#39;s property and interests in property within the United States, or within the possession or control of any United States individuals or entities that are owned or controlled by the blocked individual or entity. Prohibiting transactions. Treasury generally prohibits United States individuals and entities from engaging in transactions in property or interests in property of designees. Denying visas. Treasury provides information to State so it can decide whether to cancel existing visas and deny visa applications of Kingpin Act designees. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act are described. On July 1st of each year, the OFAC Director, as delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to designate a foreign national or entity as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.

This capability did not exist previously. Therefore, prior to beginning production of 350nm technology nodes, Sandia had to purchase and install new $millions of \u201cmicrofabrication\u201d production equipment (\u201cmicro\u201d in this case, being a term of measurement). This production equipment was needed to fabricate new advanced 350nm technology nodes from wafers of material, where the wafers were typically cut up into \u201cchips\u201d or small sections after the microfabrication, which could then be inserted into a device for final assembly. Sandia began purchasing this new equipment in 2005 and received the remaining parts in 2006, which included a single wafer cleaning station, chemical mechanical polishing equipment, as well as electron beam deposition equipment.\nSandia was not the only National Lab to upgrade its capabilities, but was one of the earliest to implement its technology. As a nation wide goal other labs began planning for their upgrades. While the cost to build and the time needed to bring such equipment online was measured in years, the need to fabricate microchips was a relatively short term concern.\nThe process of microfabrication (in which micro devices at the 350 nm level were produced) was not the only need for such equipment. After the process of production, a microdevice required final packaging. With this in mind, we found new equipment which would allow us to package those chips more efficiently for delivery to other agencies including DOD. Sandia purchased these packages in 2006 and had them installed at the MESA complex in 2008. However, this too would not be the last of the upgrades. As we neared that 350 nm level, plans were drawn up for the next level.", "Generally, Congress provides budget authority to agencies through the passage of appropriations acts each fiscal year. Appropriations allow agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specified purposes. When an appropriation expires, and a new one is not enacted, a lapse in appropriations, also called a funding gap, results and the affected agency or program may lack sufficient budget authority to continue operations. Funding gaps can occur at the beginning of a fiscal year when new appropriations, or a continuing resolution, have not yet been enacted. Funding gaps also can occur any time during the year when a continuing resolution expires and may affect a few agencies or all agencies across the federal government.

The following sample Issue/Argument essay shows how successful argumentation should be organized and presented. Although the essay may not be perfect, it does represent an excellent rendition of the skills necessary to excel on the GRE Writing section. SAMPLE PROMPT: Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, nearly 5,000 American service members have been killed. In your judgment, what explains the United States\u2019 reluctance to withdrawal from Iraq? In other words, is it due to public opinion, economic factors, inadequate intelligence, or other reasons? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Your response to the issue must be at least 350-400 words. RESPONSE: The United States has been reluctant to withdraw from Iraq because of the uncertainty about Iraq\u2019s future, the possibility of al-Qaeda regaining its previous strength, and the fear of instigating more tension among Muslims and American citizens. The future of Iraq is an important factor to think about while pulling our forces out of Iraq. Although public opinion on the war no longer justifies the war in Iraq, there are no solid alternatives to help Iraq. If the United States pulled their forces out altogether, Iraq would likely become a hub for the insurgent group, al-Qaeda, to reestablish a foothold in the country. In late July, General Ray Odierno explained that the United States was considering redeploying 5,000 troops in Iraq because of the growing instability and the reemergence of al-Qaeda. Furthermore, Odierno warned US troops to expect further battles with insurgents that control Iraq\u2019s major cities. The fear of instigating more tension among the Muslims and American citizens due to the US withdrawal from Iraq, a country in which Islam is the predominant religion, is also a factor that the United States must consider. Even though the people in Iraq did not support the previous administration and the war in Iraq, there may be fear from the United States\u2019 continued presence in Iraq. The fear is that the continued presence will ignite more tension between the two groups. Additionally, the US forces are not equipped to combat the increasing strength of the rebels or al-Qaeda. Although the US forces have significantly lowered the number of casualties as the war continues, the United States has not been able to successfully keep the insurgents and al-Qaeda at bay. Therefore, the future of Iraq and the US forces that may help Iraq are reasons why the United States has been reluctant to withdraw its forces from Iraq. On the other hand, however, the fear of instigating more tension among Muslims and American citizens does not justify the United States\u2019 continued presence there. With the 150,000 deaths between 2003 and 2012 in Iraq, which is attributed in part to the US involvement, the United States has a duty to protect innocent civilians. Furthermore, the US government and the media have a responsibility to the citizens of the United States to inform them on the effects of the war. Consequently, the public should be informed of the costs of the war. Ultimately, because of the concerns about the future of Iraq and the fear of instigating more tension among Muslims and American citizens, Iraq has not been able to stabilize because the United States remains involved in the country. To ensure the protection of innocent civilians and the stability of Iraq, pulling the US troops out completely from Iraq is the right action to take.\n19 Posted by A. Llama\nBy A. Llama\nBy A.

Llama in Re: GMAT", "The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that refunds 99 percent of the original customs duties, taxes, and fees on exported, or destroyed, goods imported into the United States is known as a drawback refund. In fiscal year 2009, an estimated $1.23 billion was refunded under the U.S. Customs (USC) and Border Protection (CBP) drawback refund program as of April 30, 2010. In fiscal year 2010, approximately $2 billion was refunded as of April 30, 2010. There were 5,447 new drawback entry filings in 2009, and 4,469 in 2010. The cost of auditing the drawback refunds was $110 million in 2009. In addition, in our review of a sample of drawback refunds for 2009 and 2010, we identified more than 4,700 potential errors in refunds. This testimony is based on our prior work reviewing CBP\u2019s drawback program as implemented pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). 2. HISTORY: The AJCA was passed into law on October 3, 2004. Title V, Subtitle A, section 5201-5214, known as the drawback provisions, amended section 313(j) (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (TA30), which allows CBP to collect drawback refunds on certain types of goods. 3. U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND ITS ROLE: According to its website, CBP: \u2022 controls the flow of goods and people across U.S. borders; \u2022 secures trade across its international border and with its partners around the world; \u2022 facilitates the legal international movement of goods and people, while protecting the security of the United States. \u2022 The trade flows over 300 million passengers, 12 million trucks, busses, trains, and vessels and 270 million tons of cargo in and out of over 200 international air, land, and sea ports of entry with total trade value over $3 trillion. CBP is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Since its founding in 1789, CBP has grown from the collection of duties on imports to its more complex role as an important element of U.S. border protection. The Office of the Commissioner is headed by the Commissioner of CBP, who may be assisted by the Deputy Commissioner. (See fig. 7 for a flow chart of CBP organization.) 4. U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION\u2019S DRAWBACK REFUND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES: The statutory amendments implementing the drawback refund program were originally authorized by the AJCA, which was incorporated into section 313(j)(3) of TA 30 in section 303 of the Trade Act of 2002. The amendments to the drawback refund program were included in subtitle A of Title V of the AJCA, which President George W. Bush signed into law on October 3, 2004. After the AJCA, CBP revised its regulations and created a new refund entry process for drawback refunds. The original date for the drawback program implementation was July 1, 2006, when filing for 99 percent refunds was allowed on dutiable goods exported/destroyed after June 30, 2003. Subsequently, CBP modified this regulation on December 20, 2010, to extend the implementation date for drawback filings to exportations/destructions of goods on or after June 1, 2004. CBP then revised its regulations, which govern the drawback refund program, effective January 23, 2011 (76 FR 3805). CBP\u2019s regulation 19 CFR, Part 191 is known as the drawback regulation. According to the drawback regulation, \u201c", "Traumatic experiences during childhood can affect future emotional and physical health. These experiences, or adverse childhood experiences, may overwhelm a child\u2019s natural ability to cope and can cause stress reactions in children, including feelings of intense fear, terror, and helplessness. A trauma-informed approach recognizes the harmful effects of trauma and is sensitive to their occurrence and to the effects they may have on mental, physical, and social well-being. This document describes what is known about the impact of child trauma, provides examples of trauma-informed strategies, and identifies relevant federal resources and programs. This document addresses adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed approaches in schools, which often serve as an entry point to the child welfare system. In a 2017 report on child well-being, GAO reported that an expert noted that health and human service agencies are not the only entities needed to address child well-being and suggested that community stakeholders work together to determine what resources are needed for the children in their community. A trauma-informed school, characterized by an understanding and a commitment of teachers and staff to an awareness of how trauma affects students\u2019 behavior, their relationships, their ability or inability to self-regulate behavior, and how it contributes to their classroom behavior. Source: GAO trauma-informed interventions to child trauma could benefit children exposed to trauma. For example, one study found that children in high quality, trauma-informed Head Start and family day care centers had better health than children attending lower quality centers. Federal agencies, academic institutions, and community-based treatment centers have developed evidence-based trauma treatments that clinicians and therapists can use when working with children and their families.

The 2017 GAO report on child well-being documented the need for additional research on this topic and noted the need for research focused on the benefits of trauma-informed care as well as on the challenges and barriers to its adoption. According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, as of April 2018 there are more than 75 trauma-informed initiatives or programs in nearly half of the states. For more information, see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families Fact Sheet available at: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/resource/trauma-informed-child-welfare-practices-faq In addition, 11 states or territories have trauma-informed initiatives; 15 states, or more, have adopted legislation, issued executive orders or established action plans that call for implementing trauma-informed practices; and 14 states and territories have trauma-informed initiative partnerships.\nTrauma-Informed Care and Child Welfare\nKey Questions for Trauma-Informed Care in Schools\nTABLE II: FEDERAL RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT TRAUMA-INFORMED CLASSROOMS\nTABLE III: CHILD WELFARE SERVICES\nNational Center for Adoption and Permanency (NCAP): This organization provides states, counties, and child welfare providers with resources about trauma-informed practices.\nNational Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN): The NCTSN is a national network of academic institutions, community based treatment centers, and federal partners whose mission is to raise the standard of care and increase access to services for traumatized children, adolescents, and families.\nEducational Services and Trauma\nPsychology Information for Children with High-Functioning Autism and Other Children who are Dealing with Trauma\nTrauma and the Affected Classroom: Child Welfare, Education\nMental Health in the Classroom\nA Trauma-Informed Classroom: Trauma and Stress in Preschools\nThe Trauma-Informed Classroom: How Teachers and Schools Are Helping Traumatized\nClassroom Management Strategies in a Trauma-Informed Classroom\nUsing Trauma-Informed Practices to Enhance Learning\nFraming Child", "The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. OSC\u2019s mission is to safeguard the merit system by protecting employees and applicants who report violations of laws, rules, and regulations, as well as providing relief for employees wrongfully disciplined, removed, or discriminated against. This report focuses on the protection from employment discrimination afforded to whistleblowers in the federal government. In an effort to protect employees who report wrongdoing, Congress has enacted whistleblower protections and procedures over the years. This report describes the OSC\u2019s current work on whistleblower protection and its past work examining the use of the probationary period to remove federal employees. Aspects of whistleblower reprisal allegations and the probationary period were included in GAO\u2019s 2013 high-risk list. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) plays a critical role in ensuring that federal employees who report wrongdoing face no retaliation. For both past and current complaints filed with OSC, this report examines whistleblower allegations of reprisal by comparing (1) whistleblower files from fiscal years 2008 to 2014 to identify trends, (2) allegations of retaliation between 2011 and 2014 using OSC\u2019s annual reports, and (3) reprisal investigations as a percentage of retaliation investigations between fiscal years 2012 and 2014. The report also examines OSC\u2019s current work on whistleblower reprisal and describes its past work examining the use of the probationary period to remove federal employees. Aspects of whistleblower reprisal allegations and the probationary period were included in GAO\u2019s 2013 high-risk list. Our prior reviews have examined OSC's efforts to address these issues. Our prior work has shown that OSC has made progress but faces continued challenges in addressing whistleblower retaliation and using the probationary period. Federal managers have the responsibility and duty to identify and address employee misconduct. However, when employees raise concerns about misconduct or wrongdoing they may face retaliation. OSC helps employees identify whistleblower reprisal issues. OSC\u2019s efforts have resulted in numerous cases being remanded to the agency for corrective action. As part of its work to protect whistleblowers, OSC also takes legal action on the behalf of aggrieved whistleblowers. However, OSC has found some retaliation claims to be not credible. OSC takes all whistleblower complaints seriously. The mission of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is to protect federal employees who \"blow the whistle\" on wrongdoing. OSC has taken action to protect whistleblowers when they have been retaliated against. OSC also helps identify instances in which reprisal may have occurred and notifies agency personnel and management. However, there has been some controversy over OSC\u2019s handling of claims about reprisal. To better address reprisal claims, OSC examined the underlying laws, regulations, and agency policies, as well as conducted a comprehensive review of OSC\u2019s work on retaliatory cases, in part to see if additional steps could be taken to strengthen the Whistleblower Protection Act. It also launched a pilot program to provide a more streamlined means of evaluating certain whistleblower reprisal allegations. Further, OSC has taken steps to further clarify the definition of reprisal to ensure agencies and managers would be held accountable. OSC\u2019s oversight of the probationary period comes from its work as special counsel. OSC has investigated hundreds of cases involving the discipline and removal of probationary employees. OSC\u2019s current efforts concerning the probationary period are aimed at improving managers\u2019 performance on the probationary period and holding managers accountable. Further, OSC reviewed its probationary case review process and developed a uniform process to address alleged probationary violations. As part of those efforts, OSC developed its first-ever training courses for managers and employees involved in managing probationary federal employees. Further, the training has become available to all managers and employees within 1 year of its implementation in December 2014. In its review of OSC\u2019s role in protecting whistleblowers, GAO found OS", "", "The federal government spends over $200 billion per year providing for the dual-eligible population\u2019s prescription drug coverage and long term-services and supports (LTSS). For many dual eligibles, their Medicaid costs are more than double their Medicare costs. This dual-eligible \u201coverlap\u201d population presents a significant challenge to the current, fragmented system of services for dual-eligibles. Given the rapidly aging population, we find it imperative that payors and provider groups work together to ensure that patients are able to get the right care in the right place at the right time and at the right cost. Medicare Accountable Care Organizations are able to apply to Medicare and become an accountable care organization as of January 1, 2012. As noted, these ACOs or Pioneer ACOs will be at financial risk insofar as they receive monthly payments of all their beneficiaries within their geographic area. The Pioneer ACOs may receive 50% of monthly payments from Medicare on the primary care side and 50% from the Medicare Advantage side, if the ACO has both types of contracts. Thus, if 100 beneficiaries are assigned to the Pioneer ACO for primary or specialty care on the Medicare fee-for-service side, the ACO would now not only be responsible on the Medicare fee-for-service side for the beneficiaries, but would also be responsible for the Medicare Advantage side, that is the 200 beneficiaries assigned to the ACO in total, if the ACO signed both contracts. The Pioneer ACO will get 50% of the total monthly payment in fees-for-service and 50% in the capitated rates of the Medicare Advantage patients assigned to the ACO. At this time a maximum cost/thrifthold (7-8%) is in place for cost, and quality is based upon 33 measures and reporting. These three factors (quality, cost, and risk) make the Pioneer ACO financial and accountable for every Medicare beneficiary assigned to the ACO, which is based upon the average monthly costs per beneficiary over the past 8 months, averaged, where the patient has been assigned to the ACO within the geographic area. In addition, quality is based upon the average monthly clinical data and the results of a composite of measures, averaged for all the beneficiaries within the geographic area. Each accountable care organization will determine the benchmark for cost/quality with regards to which data, based upon the Medicare beneficiary assigned, the ACO will have to meet in order to stay on the contracted fee-for-service side or the Medicare Advantage side, as it relates to beneficiaries and their quality/cost performance as compared to its peers. Each ACO will use its own benchmark, or goal. If the ACO\u2019s benchmark is achieved, they earn a percentage of their monthly fees. If the ACO\u2019s benchmark is NOT achieved, the ACO earns a small percentage of its monthly fee. There is still an incentive for the ACO to improve the quality/reduce costs, since they may earn a little on each end of the spectrum. It is hoped that the benchmark should be at least enough to cover the ACO\u2019s fixed expenses associated with their infrastructure (or overhead), since they have to be profitable at the end of the year. On the primary/specialty care Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries they will have quality ratings based upon 33 clinical measures and quality will be monitored on a month by month basis. On the Medicare Advantage side, the ACO will have to meet quality and the ACO will have to meet minimum quality on quality measures and quality/reduction of costs. If they meet the benchmark, they earn a percentage, and if they do not meet the benchmark, they earn a little. If they earn the percentage of the fee-for-service monthly payments, they can take that amount out of the capitated revenue pool. If they do not earn a percentage of the fee-for service from one month, that is all that is taken out of the reimbursement pool for that month, and the ACO shares the residual capitated pool with the other ACOs. This pool is known as the Benchmark Adjustment Revenue Accrual or BARA pool. Each month, based on the previous month, a report will be run and analyzed so that there will be a new quality/cost target for the next month, and the percentage of the quality/", "In addition to retirement benefits to older individuals and their families, SSA administers the nation\u2019s largest disability benefit program, the Disability Insurance (DI) program. DI generally pays benefits to individuals if they are unable to work due to qualifying impairments that are expected to last at least 1 year or result in death. In fiscal year 2018, SSA paid DI benefits to more than 10 million beneficiaries each month for a total of about $144 billion that year. In addition to monthly financial benefits, which averaged about $1,234 per disabled worker in 2018, those eligible for DI also gain access to Medicare after a 2-year waiting period, which can help pay for their medical costs, including prescription opioids. Disabled workers claiming DI benefits must meet work and other requirements to be considered eligible for DI. First, they must have worked for a specified amount of time covered by Social Security as well as worked within a specified timeframe before becoming disabled, based on their age, education, and prior work history (see fig. 1). DI claimants may also apply concurrently for SSA\u2019s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides income to individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled with limited income and resources. Such claimants may be deemed eligible for both programs if they meet certain income and resource requirements in addition to those for DI. Under SSI, they may receive additional financial benefits as well as access to Medicaid. Several different program staff are involved in processing DI claims. First, staff in SSA field offices receive applications and determine whether claimants meet nonmedical eligibility requirements, such as having a sufficient work history. Claims for those who meet these requirements are then forwarded to state government Disability Determination Services (DDS) offices, where DDS examiners review the claimant\u2019s eligibility based on the medical and vocational requirements outlined in figure 1 above. DDS examiners use all this information to  determine whether claimants are eligible for DI. Claimants who are dissatisfied with the initial DDS decision have several opportunities to appeal. First, they generally may request a reconsideration of the claim, which is conducted by a DDS examiner who was not involved in the original decision. Next, they may request a hearing before an SSA administrative law judge, who may collect new evidence and ask other witnesses, such as medical and vocational experts, to testify at the hearing. If their claim is denied at this hearings level, federal law requires beneficiaries\u2019 cases to be periodically reviewed within the designated timeframes to ensure the beneficiary continues to meet DI requirements. DDS examiners conduct such reviews, called continuing disability reviews, conferring with medical consultants and making a decision regarding a beneficiary\u2019s disability in comparison to the evidence from when the claim was allowed to determine if medical improvement has occurred.\nTABLE 1: Disability Insurance Awards by Age Group(Millions of Dollars) Age Group Disability Insurance Awards Under Age 551 Under Age 552 Income-Disabled3 Dividend-Disabled4 Other5 Income-Disabled3 Dividend-Disabled4 Total Income-Disabled3 Dividend-Disabled4 Other5 Total 1950 - 1959 1.6 0.8 0.2 3.6 0.3 0.1 3.9 a Includes lump sum settlement awards. 2 Includes retirement-insured awards.

SSA evaluates income-disabled applicants under a strict medical definition of disability, without reference to the duration of the impairment. 4 Disability is based on a combination of the age at or before which the impairment will cause death and the severity of the impairment. SSA evaluates dividend-disabled applicants under a strict medical definition of disability and uses a 5-year period for determining whether the impairment will cause death. Nonmedical eligibility requirements are also met under these disability categories. 5 Medical issues not severe enough to be disabled are reviewed for awards under the Other category. Medical eligibility for the award depends on the existence of a severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) and the claimant's vocational in", "You have been assigned to investigate whether Export-Import Bank, Bureau of Financial and Management Operations (EXIM) has effective antifraud controls, including whether it conducts preauthorization and postauthorization investigations before it approves loan, insurance, and guarantee transactions. Because fraud could take place at any time, it is important for EXIM to identify the types and likelihood of fraud that could occur in its transactions and take the appropriate antifraud actions. Specifically, you have been asked to (1) identify and describe the fraud risks in the transactions that EXIM manages, (2) evaluate and provide observations and recommendations on how fraud risks identified are managed, and (3) explain and provide observations and recommendations regarding how EXIM manages fraud risk, including whether its controls and practices are compliant with the leading practices of GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. We used a methodology based on the Fraud Risk Framework principles for this report and found that the following (1) EXIM\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework is not mature, (2) the extent of fraud controls in place at EXIM to limit residual fraud risks is unclear, and (3) EXIM\u2019s practices could be strengthened to comply with the leading practices of GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework in certain areas. Because of these findings, we made recommendations in the areas of mitigating fraud risk, managing fraud risk, and aligning controls and practices with the Fraud Risk Framework.", "Our report found that SBA\u2019s STEP grants management process does not provide reasonable assurance that STEP grant recipients meet two of the three TFTEA requirements we reviewed before the grant is closed out. 2  \u00a9 2018 Government Accountability Office GAO-18-371 July 5, 2018 34    identify and/or recover federal funds when states had insufficient matching fund sources before receiving the federal grant. SBA has a process to recover STEP funds before SBA pays out federal funds. First, officials review information SBA has collected about a grantee to determine the likelihood that it will be able to expend all of its cash match funding prior to the start of the grant. Officials have determined that states that cannot expend the majority of their total matching fund requirement before grant award do not have sufficient financial resources to ensure that the intended goals of grant-funded activities will be accomplished and grant funds will be utilized efficiently and effectively. Officials reported using available STEP matching share information collected in the two most recent application years with the most current estimates of state economic data available. Officials report providing this matching share information for each state to a panel consisting of SBA program staff and a program analyst from OIT. This panel reviews matching share information against the total match requirement, and makes a recommendation to the grant manager. SBA also has a system to issue a Notice of Intent to Suspend or Reduce Payment (NOISRP), which allows them to halt payments until funds have been recovered. OIG found that the SBA grant suspension process has led to $147,100 in recovered federal funds. OIT\u2019s matching sources documentations does not  document whether states were able to expend 50 percent of requested total match sources prior to receiving grant funding. As a result, it does not have the information needed to determine whether to recover federal funds. We found no documentation indicating whether SBA assessed the matching share information available for the recipient states. Without such information and processes, it is difficult to assure that SBA is assessing the information needed to make reasonable assurance determinations and that federal funds are not at risk.4", "NASA awarded contracts for designs and development of space vehicles that could meet NASA\u2019s crew transportation requirements. The contracts included requirements for safety certification milestones that the two contractors (Boeing and SpaceX) were expected to complete prior to beginning operational flights. Through ongoing NASA reviews of contractors\u2019 safety certification milestone submissions, several risks to these milestones were identified. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reviewed NASA\u2019s management of the Commercial Crew Program contracts, focusing on progress in meeting safety certification milestones and whether NASA was effectively managing the program. This report (1) discusses findings related to the status of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, (2) discusses findings related to the history of Commercial Crew Program certification milestones, (3) describes actions taken by the program to improve its progress in meeting the certification milestones, and (4) discusses what we think are important program management considerations for the future. To understand the effect of schedule uncertainty on NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, we interviewed NASA personnel, analyzed technical data, and reviewed NASA safety certification milestone reports. In addition, we interviewed a Boeing contract officer to learn about the firm\u2019s progress toward meeting the certification milestones and to gain an understanding of NASA\u2019s management of the program. \u2022 Boeing CST-100 Starliner uncrewed test flight: Boeing\u2019s test events have occurred, but its Starliner spacecraft has not yet met the Commercial Crew Program safety certification milestone requirements. NASA agreed to Boeing\u2019s December 2018 request to defer several safety reviews associated with its uncrewed test flight. During the deferral of NASA reviews, Boeing made changes to the Starliner\u2019s design, which have not been reviewed by the FAA or NASA. \u2022 Boeing CST-100 Starliner crewed test flight: Since July 2018, Boeing has faced challenges with the Starliner\u2019s parachute and other systems after several failures in testing. The development of these systems has continued since the parachute failure. Boeing has not yet met NASA\u2019s safety certification milestone requirements for the Starliner. \u2022 NASA Space Systems Review Board safety certification milestones: NASA set safety certification milestones for the program beginning in February 2015. The milestones were scheduled for a 5-year period and were intended to ensure that the contractor provided NASA with adequate evidence that each of their spacecraft was safe for human spaceflight. We noted that several milestones for the safety certification milestones were missed due to technical challenges and schedule delays. \u2022 Boeing Spacecraft Systems Reviews: To support Boeing\u2019s progress toward meeting the safety certification milestones, the agency conducted Spacecraft System Reviews (SSRs) in 2016 and 2018. Following the second SSR review in August 2018, Boeing revised its schedule to complete uncrewed and crewed test flights after a series of other uncertainties\u2014such as delays in the uncrewed test flight or if the FAA did not approve the uncrewed test flight, the potential need for a second Starliner to conduct the uncrewed test flight, and delays in the crewed test flight program. \u2022 Capsule escape test: We learned that Boeing was uncertain about when the crewed test flight could occur if the capsule escape test did not occur before June of this year. This uncertainty and the lack of adequate funding to execute the escape test led Boeing and NASA to consider the possibility of conducting an uncrewed test flight before the crewed test flight. However, a crewed test flight may still occur before the capsule escape system is tested. \u2022 Delays in the certified human rated spacecraft ground segment: The Spacecraft Systems Reviews noted certification and verification risks associated with delays and deficiencies in the Commercial Crew Program ground systems. The report states that delays in receiving hardware for these systems has also contributed to delays in meeting the safety certification milestones.

MAC-MO contracts specify an indefinite quantity of firm-fixed-price availabilities for a period of up to a 5-year. In addition to contract administration, contract management support services and planning support, MAC-MO contracts also cover related contract requirements for CMAVs including cost reimbursement availabilities. However, MAC-MO contractors must be prepared to compete for the actual availability orders which must be released through limited competition procedures under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5.\n(iii) The company has not received more than thirty percent of the value of Federal contracts issued for the three years prior to the solicitation.\n(ii) the offeror certifies that it is a small business concern owned and controlled by a member of a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe, and that the offeror will comply with the 8(a) requirements set forth in 13CFR 124.51 if the requirements apply.", "VA lacks fully developed succession plans across its administrations that include current employees who could be promoted to fulfill future mission requirements.  In the absence of a single planning process across VA, administrations have succession plans that are not coordinated, potentially leading to gaps and a hodgepodge effort. These plans also do not include performance standards or criteria to identify potential successors and those employees' developmental needs. The plans also lack a process to review and update on a regular basis. As a result, the plans cannot sufficiently meet VA\u2019s future requirements such as anticipated increases in demand for services and a smaller workforce.  VA has not met four of the six key leading practices for succession planning, such as identifying future mission requirements and incorporating them into its succession plans (see table 1). It has partially met one\u2014identifying high potential employees who have the capability to develop the skills needed for higher-level positions.  Table 1 shows that VA has partially met another\u2014identifying successors and their developmental needs. For example, in July 2017, VHA\u2019s Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Human Resource Management sent a message to human resources staff stating that the agency was developing training that the employees will have an opportunity to complete. The training is intended to educate employees to help make decisions about their development and career growth. We have reported on succession management. For example, our May 2016 report found that VHA partially met three of the six leading practices for succession planning. We reported that VHA did not conduct periodic succession management reviews of its staff\u2019s critical core positions to ensure it had the qualified staff necessary to perform mission- critical work. As a result, VHA could not properly identify future leadership personnel needs or fully develop its human capital plan. However, by performing the reviews, VHA would be better able to identify its employees\u2019 developmental needs and plan for their future succession.    Succession planning best practices highlighted in this report and found in OPM guidance are based on several published reviews from the private sector and from the federal executive branch that have led to best practices being adopted by organizations in both sectors. One of the most widely recognized reviews of succession planning in the public sector is a 2006 study sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management, the National Academy of Public Administration, and the Society for Human Resource Management, entitled, \u201cMaking Succession Planning Work: Insights from Leading Practitioners and Research on Organizations\u2019 Capacity for Change.\u201d The study identified six succession management \u201cleading practices\u201d that we adapted to our assessment of VA\u2019s succession management.

Leading Succession Planning Practices\u2014A National Survey of Organizational Approaches, 2014 Report to Stakeholders, OPM, April   41 Management Report Series: Staffing Challenges and the Risk of Delays in VA Claims Processing A VA report from July 2013 reported that the agency was operating a staffing plan for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 that had been approved by leadership. This agency plan did not include a 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year 5 year timeline. Instead, VHA\u2019s report showed that from fiscal years 2012 to 2015, it had planned to hire between 11000 and 15000 claims processors. The report did not include any information on whether VHA or VA had developed a 4 year hiring plan for claims processors beyond fiscal year 2015. In the absence of a staffing plan, we assessed succession and hiring plans\u2014current and future\u2014for claims processors, who work in the Appeals Management Staff in VHA, VBA, and VHA\u2019s Decision Review Officers offices (see fig. 1).   Figure 1: Actual and Projected Claims Processing Staffing, Fiscal Year 2015    OPM guidance on succession management states that succession plans must incorporate succession management into all activities and processes of an organization. They should include current employees who appear to meet the requirements of the positions and who have demonstrated the capabilities needed for the positions. These plans should include current employees\u2019 developmental needs and training requirements. This guidance further states that development plans that focus on current employees\u2019 development needs can lead to employees\u2019 advancement and ensure positions are filled with employees having the skills and abilities necessary to meet current and", "MATERIALS NEEDED FOR SPEECH: MOST POWERPOINT SLIDES.

Zybyk (B.A. 1964) worked in international marketing for a number of companies before creating TMI Services Ltd. (TMI), a leader in outsourced call center services for the telecommunications industry. Beginning in 1994 with a single account, 50 seats, and three employees in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, TMI grew to more than 3,000 seats and 28 U.S. facilities when the company was acquired by Alcatel. Prior to becoming Chairman of the Board in 1999, Zybyk had served as CEO for ten years, growing TMI and its affiliates sevenfold. After retiring from Alcatel, Zybyk pursued his lifelong passion for horses, both breeding Arabian horses and traveling the world to compete.\nZybyk was recognized for his role as Co-Founder of the American Arabian Youth Association and as Chairman of the Board for the Arabian Horse Association. Zybyk has three children: Sarah, Brian, and Amy\u2014all 1976 graduates of The University of Texas at Austin. Upon his death in 2008, he was survived by his wife Nancy.

Further, the act: (6) requires the Secretaries of the military departments, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of National Intelligence to notify OMB monthly of planned rescissions or impoundments. (7) requires OMB to notify Congress monthly regarding rescissions, impoundments, and unobligated appropriations. (8) requires the Secretaries of the military departments, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of National Intelligence to notify Congress regarding rescissions at least 60 days before funds can be deobligated or transferred to other projects. (9) requires the Secretaries of the military departments, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of National Intelligence to notify Congress no later than 30 days prior to transfers of funds provided in an appropriations act or prior to any rescission that could result in a funding gap (that is, a situation where a required expenditure exceeds the funds made available). While grant funds can be used for the same purposes specified in a funding period during the current fiscal year, each year\u2019s SBA funding must be used for that specific year\u2019s eligible activities, and federal funds may not be obligated or expended before the start of the next fiscal year.

The FCC data show that in 2015 there were 9 million non-English speakers in the United States, and half of these individuals live in California, New York, Florida, and Texas. The FCC defines non- English speakers as someone who uses English \"less than extremely well\" or, in the case of children, who uses only Spanish or another language at home and is not fluent in English. However, the FCC notes that there can be a large difference in non-English household language and non-English speaking individuals.  FCC's data show that the vast majority of non-English speaking individuals use English at home. In 2015, half of non-English speakers used English at home, and only 3% did not use any English at all in their homes (see fig. 2).  This means that half of individuals who do not use English as their primary language at home and who, according to the FCC, have difficulties communicating in English, are not non-English speaking in FCC's own data.  Although individuals may or may not use English at home, the FCC still considers all households where at least one person does not speak English to be \"English- language households\" or a \"non-English speaker households.\" The FCC also identifies the Spanish language as the other language spoken at home. However, as FCC data show, most individuals who do not speak English at home are foreign born. Specifically, the FCC reports that of approximately 9 million Hispanics aged five or older, only 4 million (44%) were born in the United States and fluent in both English and Spanish (see fig. 3); an additional 4 million (44%) were born in the United States but reported having Spanish as their dominant language and speaking \"less than extremely well\" English; and 1 million (approximately 10%) were born outside the United States and not fluent in either 3 language. Thus, even though the FCC identifies Spanish as the other language spoken at home, half of all Hispanics aged five or older are native- born speakers of English.", "During our audit, we examined federal financial assistance to two publicly funded transportation systems serving the Puerto Rico metro area. We performed the audit from June 27, 2016 through March 18, 2018 in accordance with standards for audits of governmental entities, nonprofit organizations, and state, local, or Indian tribal governments. We conducted our work at AMTRAK\u2019s offices in Oakton, Va. and interviews by telephone. We reviewed the audits of the other two grantees from prior federal audit work. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted this review under authority of the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App.) and in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspections. The review was not done as part of a planned or other comprehensive review in the area covered by the audit. Our conclusions are limited to the issues identified and described in this report which should not be read to extend to related issues. We did not conduct a comprehensive review of AMTRAK\u2019s program or internal controls. Accordingly, the results of the review do not necessarily constitute the opinions of AMTRAK. The review\u2019s finding are not a statement of AMTRAK\u2019s internal control or operating procedures. This report is made solely for the information and use of the FTA Inspector General and the FTA Administrator in connection with carrying out their statutory responsibilities.\nWe conducted this performance audit to determine the accuracy and reliability of AMTRAK\u2019s reported financial assistance obligations; we did not audit AMTRAK\u2019s compliance with federal laws and regulations with respect to financial assistance obligations under the AMTRAK Improvement Acts of 1998-1999. The audit was not intended to provide an analysis of AMTRAK\u2019s financial practices nor an accounting of receipts and disbursements made in connection with specific federal assistance obligations.  AMTRAK and FTA have established internal controls designed to ensure that financial assistance obligations are accurately recorded, allocated and reported. However, inadequacies in AMTRAK\u2019s and FTA\u2019s existing processes were also noted during our evaluation. These processes identified weaknesses, which may reduce the integrity and reliability of the data, reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of the AMTRAK\u2019s implementation of AMTRAK grants, disbursement and collection of invoices, and potentially impact AMTRAK\u2019s and FTA\u2019s ability to make timely management decisions.  As a result of identified control weaknesses, AMTRAK and FTA were unable to provide assurance that the accuracy and reliability of reported financial assistance obligations, program revenue, and indirect cost. In addition, our report included a review of AMTRAK\u2019s compliance with federal laws, statutes, regulations and related requirements in the following areas: 1) the AMTRAK Improvement Acts of 1998-1999, and 2) AMTRAK\u2019s indirect cost rate application process.\nThe audit objective was to determine whether AMTRAK\u2019s public financial assistance awards, costs disbursed, revenue amounts, and indirect cost rates were accurately and reliably recorded. Specifically, we assessed AMTRAK\u2019s internal controls related to the procurement process and AMTRAK\u2019s financial management of disbursements, invoices collection and submission, and the process for application of its indirect cost rate.\nAMTRAK\u2019s internal control weaknesses associated with the procurement and financial disbursement processes did not affect the accuracy and reliability of financial assistance obligations, program level revenue, invoices, or indirect cost rate application disclosed in AMTRAK\u2019s FY 2017 Federal Financial Assistance Information Report, which is used by FTA to calculate financial assistance payments to AMTRAK. Accordingly, no adjustment of reported financial assistance obligations was deemed necessary or appropriate for the year of  and subsequent years.\nSummary of Recommendations and AMTRAK\u2019s Response\nFTA\u2019s Management Decisions\nAMTRAK\u2019s Federal Financial Assistance Information Reports FUTURE ACTION:\nPlease forward this report to the FTA Administrator for appropriate action and provide brief written comments no later than 60 days from the date of this transmittal.

Many of those with private coverage are enrolled in plans purchased from state-licensed or state-regulated issuers.  Others are covered by plans where their employer sets aside funds to pay for employee health care, known as self-funded plans.  In general, those who obtain private health coverage do so in one of three market segments:  individual, small group, or large group.  Enrollees in the individual market purchase private health coverage directly from state- regulated issuers\u2014not in connection with a group health plan.  In the small group and large group markets, enrollees generally obtain health coverage through a group health plan offered through a plan sponsor (typically an employer).  Prior to the implementation of the MHPAEA, health plans offered through employers covering MH/SU often used plan design features that were more restrictive or provided lower levels of coverage for MH/SU benefits than for medical/surgical benefits.

FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMY MANAGED AND OPERATED CMP. IN 1990, WE REPORTED THAT CMP WAS OF LIMITED VALUE TO MILITARY PREPAREDNESS BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CMP\u2019S OBJECTIVES AND GOALS WERE NOT LINKED TO ARMY MOBILIZATION AND TRAINING PLANS AND PROGRAM-TRAINED PERSONNEL WERE NOT TRACKED. THE NDAA FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996 MOVED CMP OUT OF THE ARMY AND ESTABLISHED CMP AS A FEDERALLY CHARTERED, NONPROFIT CORPORATION. THE ACT ALSO REQUIRED THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY TO TRANSFER ALL FIREARMS, AMMOUNITION, AND FUNDS FROM SALES PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARMY PROGRAM TO CMP. CMP IS REQUIRED TO GIVE PRIORITY TO ACTIVITIES THAT BENEFIT FIREARMS SAFETY, TRAINING, AND COMPETITION FOR YOUTH AND THAT REACH AS MANY YOUTH PARTICIPANTS AS POSSIBLE.

AS A NON", "In 1999, DOE issued a report stating that, based on experience from a decade of planning and conducting cleanup work at the sites for which it was responsible, complete restoration to levels acceptable for unrestricted use could not be accomplished at many of its sites. According to the report, a variety of hazards would remain at many DOE sites after these sites had been cleaned up in accordance with applicable requirements. These hazards include long-lived radionuclides left in place in soils or contained in on-site disposal cells and residual contaminants in surface water and groundwater. The report cited technical challenges\u2014such as lack of available technology for completely removing some types of waste\u2014and economic limitations\u2014such as prohibitive costs to employ available technology\u2014as reasons why these hazards would remain. As a result, DOE reported that long-term management would be needed at these sites to ensure that the cleanup remedies\u2014i.e., the actions, systems, or other measures put in place to clean up a site\u2014would protect human health and the environment from these hazards into the future. Several DOE organizations, including the Office of Environmental Management (EM), were responsible for long-term management of post-cleanup sites until the department established LM in 2003. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, LM had assumed responsibility for 100 sites across the United States, including sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico (see fig. 1). Several different entities conducted cleanup of these sites before LM assumed responsibility for cleanup. These different entities conducted cleanup under a variety of authorities: EM. EM was primarily responsible for cleaning up sites that are now under LM\u2019s portfolio. EM is generally responsible for financing the cleanup work of LM sites. EM cleanup work for LM sites consists mostly of deactivation work for former nuclear or uranium plants. The Office of Legacy Management (LM)\u2014a component of EM \u2014 was created in 2003 to perform long-term cleanup and maintenance work, such as radiation protection at deactivated nuclear sites. EM also conducts cleanup work for LM sites. In addition to being responsible for cleaning up DOE\u2019s portion of federal sites, EM conducts work at LM sites financed through the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) reactor waste fund. EM cleanup work for LM sites consists mostly of site characterization for deactivation work at former nuclear or uranium plants. When the NRC\u2019s reactor waste fund provides funding for cleanup work at a LM site, the NRC usually also becomes involved in a significant way in determining whether completion activities have been accomplished, in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements. This LM report examines the extent of LM\u2019s responsibility for 100 sites nationwide. Sites eligible for and currently in remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) and monitored natural attenuation (MNA) for groundwater cleanup were excluded. These sites\u2019 cleanup processes and cost estimates are beyond the scope of this report. Also excluded are sites for which EM has assumed ownership but has yet to establish the boundaries of DOE\u2019s area of responsibility. The 1999 report stated that long-term management would be needed at these sites to ensure that the cleanup remedies would protect human health and the environment from the hazards. This report is in response to your request for information on the extent of DOE\u2019s involvement with the cleanup of contamination in groundwater that came from DOE sites. The report focuses on groundwater contamination that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has addressed and that is managed through NRC-approved groundwater monitoring programs at LM\u2019s 100 sites. While NRC-approved groundwater monitoring programs, which are required by law for licensed sites, are designed primarily for safety purposes, monitoring results that may be considered evidence of residual contamination may be used to establish whether cleanup of these contaminants has been successful. This report does not discuss the extent of DOE\u2019s cleanup responsibility for groundwater contamination at LM\u2019s 100 sites. 6 The objective was to determine the extent of DOE-EM\u2019s involvement with the cleanup of groundwater contaminated by DOE. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed EM policies on cleanup of groundwater contaminated by DOE sites, interviewed representatives across the EM organization, reviewed EM cleanup contract proposals and task", "This section highlights information on TSA\u2019s 56 surface security inspection sites, as presented in TSA\u2019s most recent annual report, which is required by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. TSA\u2019s most recent report, which described TSA surface security inspections performed in fiscal year 2016, showed that 56 of TSA\u2019s 87 surface inspection sites were classified as active or \u201cfull-time active\u201d sites. TSA does not require specific frequencies for surface inspections. In addition, TSA has not estimated the work hours required nationwide for surface inspection personnel. We reported in January 2018 that TSA\u2019s surface security inspections were conducted at 87 sites: 30 foreign air carrier security checkpoints, 34 foreign air carrier preclearance locations, and 23 cargo operations sites. Each of these sites maintains its own set of security procedures for evaluating security compliance with foreign air carrier operators and other regulated entities. TSA is currently operating all 34 preclearance sites, and 33 of the 30 foreign air carrier inspection sites are currently operated. TSA currently conducts security oversight and enforcement functions in the remaining foreign air carrier inspection sites and cargo operations sites. To determine whether TSA\u2019s current set of surface security inspection sites is sufficient, we need to gain more information about the work hours associated with TSA\u2019s surface security inspections; if TSA has developed a methodical process for determining the number of inspection sites needed nationwide; and how TSA compares its current set of surface security inspections sites with work performed by other similar federal agencies using their resources (such as the Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) and work practices. We plan to review these factors, as well as other factors, such as TSA\u2019s plans to hire additional surface inspectors to perform surface inspections nationwide.", "The U.S. electric grid is an increasing focus of potential attack, with grid infrastructure being increasingly targeted by malicious actors around the world. This report is part of an ongoing series of GAO reports focused on increasing awareness and understanding of the need to protect the nation\u2019s electric grid. It discusses the roles and relationships of the major stakeholders responsible for protecting the grid from cyber and physical threats. The report is based on the results of interviews conducted with grid experts and reviews of relevant documents and other sources.", "Since the early 19 th century, commercial maritime shipping has played an integral role in national defense. However, commercial maritime ships are now in competition with government-owned assets for commercial use during peacetime and, in times of war, may be diverted to military missions unless the U.S. maritime workforce is sufficiently large and well staffed. According to DOD, U.S.-flag commercial ships may not be available for the sealift needs and requirements identified since 7 percent of the fleet has refused to carry military cargo. As a result, DOD has relied on a government-owned reserve fleet for emergencies. In fiscal year 2017 , MARAD reported that its reserve fleet had approximately 12 empty ships for civilian use. DOD officials told GAO that it is difficult to find U.S. citizen mariners to crew reserve ships, and it must rely increasingly on foreign nationals to crew them. DOD officials also pointed to MARAD's failure to staff its reserve fleet at adequate levels due to budget cuts and staffing shortfalls. They said these shortfalls have forced them to rely on foreign ships to carry the cargo of U.S. national interest. GAO found that the maritime workforce had a history of providing excellent support to the nation. But it also raised questions about mariners who served during times of war, citing concerns that some mariners refused to serve in the Vietnam War and more recently in the Gulf War due to security concerns. Therefore, we made eight recommendations that should be considered by DOD and MARAD to address weaknesses and limitations in the use of existing resources and to meet the future needs of the military's sealift operations.\nFederal law requires that a portion of all government cargo be transported domestically and internationally on U.S.- flagged commercial vessels. Accordingly, DOD, among others, has used this capacity, primarily for logistics-related operations. However, in fiscal year (FY) 2017 , for example, 7 percent of commercial shipping contracts for DOD sealift operations were refused in advance by civilian mariners due to concerns about the security of personnel and goods. In addition, in fiscal year FY2018 DOD's sealift capacity will decrease further due to the expiration of the U. S. Maritime Administration\u2019s (MARAD) Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA)\u2014an agreement with commercial vessels that gives preference to U.S. vessels when military cargo must be moved quickly or in case of war or national emergency. Due to this loss, DOD has begun to use two U.S. government-owned ships which have been inactive since fiscal year FY2014. Further, at the same time, MARAD's fleet has not kept pace with DOD's stated needs, increasing the risk of a disruption in U.S. maritime assets. For example, in recent years, the reserve fleet had excess cargo capacity while at the same time, 12 government-owned vessels remained inactive, with five of such ships still scheduled to be decommissioned for recycling. Moreover, concerns have been raised that MARAD did not place a sufficient premium on enlisting U. S. citizen mariners for government use, thus reducing the size of the general U.S. merchant mariners pool. This and other weaknesses have led some to worry that DOD has become dependent on foreign government shipping vessels, with which it has less leverage because they do not rely solely on DOD. With this background, GAO was asked to assess (1) the extent to which the U. S. maritime industry is capable of providing sealift assets to meet the DOD's requirements to move personnel and equipment in times of emergency or war; (2) the extent to which the maritime industry meets the government's sealift requirements to move government cargos of national importance in times of peace, both in terms of U.S. ships and U.S. citizen mariners, and (3) the extent to which the government\u2019s reserve fleet of ships is adequate to support DOD requirements. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws governing DOD's sealift capacity, data on capacity, U.S. flagged vessels, government-owned vessels, and citizen mariners; and interviewed officials at DOD, MARAD, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Maritime Administration, and the Maritime Administration\u2019s National Mar", "Develop and implement a border security metrics system that includes no less than 43 border security metrics. TEXT: Metrics are numbers, statistics, or measures of a quantity typically used to describe or compare aspects of a process or activity. According to the GAO Dictionary of Federal Terms, \u201cborder security\u201d is the concept of safeguarding U.S. borders\u2014land, air, and sea\u2014against the illegal entry of people, drugs, and other contraband. The Obama Administration implemented the NDAA by developing and publishing a first-ever set of border security metrics\u2014 35 of 43 metrics\u2014under the auspices of an interagency process organized by the DHS Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), which was created by the NDAA. These metrics were designed to inform the Department\u2019s annual budget submissions to Congress on the metrics\u2019 ability to ensure public safety and the successful execution of the border security mission. The metrics\u2019 inclusion in the DHS budget submission is intended to inform the public debate, as well as facilitate the legislative discussion of the border security budget items. In fiscal year 2017, I&A, in the Office of the Under Secretary within the National Protection and Programs Directorate, was tasked by the NDAA to develop and implement a border security metrics system that includes no less than 43 border security metrics, as listed in the bill (see table). However, the metrics\u2019 inclusion in the DHS budget submission for fiscal year 2017 only included 21 of the 35 metrics. Since then, the metrics\u2019 inclusion in the DHS budget submission for fiscal year 2018 only included 23 of the 35 metrics. The GAO study, which was conducted in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, examined whether all of the metrics called for in the NDAA were being implemented in the border security metrics system. The GAO concluded that all 43 metrics were called for in the NDAA; however, none of the 43 metrics were implemented in the fiscal year 2017 border security metrics system. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis\u2019 fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, as published in November 2016, included only 21 of the 35 metrics. Moreover, 6 of the 12 metrics remaining in the list of metrics were not published in the report. The metrics\u2019 omission in the fiscal year 2017 report primarily resulted from I&A determining that 3 metrics were unobtainable, so they were not included in the report. In addition, the list of metrics published in the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2018 congressional budget justification shows that DHS omitted 23 of the 35 metrics from both the current fiscal year (fiscal year 2017) and future fiscal year (fiscal year 2018) border security metrics. For example, DHS removed 2 metrics from the list of those currently implemented. Notably, the metrics DHS has thus far reported on include 3 (the current year implementation), 4 (the next fiscal year implementation), and 4 (a future fiscal year metric set), respectively. Table I shows these metrics for comparison with the NDAA metrics. For example, as published in the 2017 metrics report, the DHS included a metric\u2014total drug seizures at POEs\u2014which is an estimate and represents the sum of three metrics\u2014seizures of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana at POEs. In contrast, the NDAA required a metric\u2014total drug seizures at POEs\u2014to be based on data recorded in the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s System to Retrieve Information on Drug Evidence (STRIDE) database, which shows the number of seizures of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. Additionally, DHS published two metrics in its fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report that were not specified in the NDAA. Although no current metric is a measure of border security, the metrics in all four NDAA domains aim to provide information that may help facilitate the U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s mission. Border Patrol agents perform this mission under various conditions with varying resources, some of which are detailed within this report. For example, the number of apprehensions at the land border between POEs that were referred for charges in a federal court, in fiscal year 2016, is an outcome measure of the Border Patrol", "Choosing among Medicare options - United States Government Accountability Office (GAO): 2019 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Fair Multifamily Housing of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Office of Rural Development (ORR). In our last report on this topic, we reported that HUD ORR provided very little technical assistance to owners of Section 515 properties because they had limited staff to assist, and the assistance would conflict with their administrative functions. As of February 2019, HUD ORR\u2019s efforts to provide training and technical assistance to owners of Section 515 properties, and our prior recommendations, remain incomplete. Specifically, HUD has yet to develop comprehensive written training and technical assistance plans that would assist owners in (1) identifying and addressing safety and security issues to protect seniors living in assisted-living facilities; (2) addressing management gaps that contribute to problems common in assisted-living facilities; and (3) assessing the financial viability of multifamily housing projects. (See appendix for more information on Section 515 property-management issues.) In fiscal year 2018, HUD provided training and technical assistance to several multifamily housing projects, such as reviewing proposed budgets; assisting with the development of written management plans; and providing on-site management and maintenance reviews. The extent of this assistance varied among the projects, partly due to HUD\u2019s reorganization during the time of the review. HUD\u2019s efforts to address multifamily housing-related issues were not completed prior to the reorganization, which caused temporary disruptions in training and technical assistance to the properties. In 2018, HUD hired eight additional staff to support multifamily housing projects, but some properties have not received the same or as much help as before the restructure HUD completed. Without formal written plans to guide training and technical assistance, HUD staff members have difficulty understanding all of its obligations for training and technical assistance. HUD staff members reported that multifamily housing training and technical assistance are not adequately supported by policies and procedures. As a result, multifamily housing properties may have inconsistent experiences with training and technical assistance. HUD staff told us that HUD\u2019s ORR is in the process of developing guidance material and manuals for training and technical assistance. However, HUD staff are concerned about maintaining their current positions because of changes in HUD\u2019s organizational structure. HUD has taken some initial actions to address recommendations from our prior review. In 2018, HUD formed a working group that includes owners of Section 515 properties to share best practices and information about assisting residents in the event of an emergency, as well as identifying effective approaches to manage Section properties in rural areas. However, the working group is not designed for training and technical assistance purposes. Our review further found that one Section 515 project was able to improve project finances through the support of the Housing Counseling Training and Technical Assistance center in partnership with HUD ORR. HUD also provided technical assistance to several Section 515 properties that increased the efficiency of the projects through management plans for these properties. GAO\u2019s report on this topic made 11 recommendations. HUD agreed with 6 of the 11 recommendations and partially agreed with 2 of the 11 recommendations. For 2 of the 11 recommendations, our objective has been met and no other recommendations remain open. In addition, HUD provided information from another HUD team that supports management of Section 515 projects through training and technical assistance. This office was not under ORR at the time of our review and not included in our report. As our recommendation to HUD, this information should be included in HUD ORR\u2019s plans for training and technical assistance of Section 515 properties.\nPRIORITY OF DISPOSITION\n273.126(f) says that a REO asset manager shall develop a list of real estate owned properties to be disposed.

An auditor has discovered fraud in the company. B. An audit staff member makes a critical mistake in judgment. C. A company manager refuses to cooperate in an audit. D. An auditor has a conflict of interest in the audit engagement.\nAnswer (d) is correct. An auditor should refuse to provide assurance services if any doubt arises about independence.\nAnswer (a) is incorrect. An auditor should not use a workpaper to document an incident, such as fraud, which calls into question the company\u2019s ability for reasonably assured financial statement preparation.\nAnswer (b) is incorrect. An auditor does not necessarily have a conflict of interest when the company manager is also the audit client\u2019s president.\nAnswer (c) is correct. An employee\u2019s refusal to cooperate in an audit does not necessarily mean that the employee has incriminating information about a company\u2019s potential illegal activity.\nAnswer (d) is correct. If the auditor determines that a client has committed fraud or other illegal acts, the auditor should contact management and legal counsel to discuss the matter, but an investigation should not begin until the proper authorities have been notified about the situation.\nAnswer (a) is correct. The auditor first should notify the engagement partner so the partner can inform the client before the auditor begins an investigation.\nAnswer (b) is correct. Unless the matter is minor, the auditor should notify engagement management when an illegal act is uncovered.\nAnswer (c) is incorrect. There may be times that an auditor must obtain additional evidence to establish an understanding of client\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, and so on; even so, if the issue is not critical, the audit team should delay its investigation until after the audit has been performed.\nAnswer (d) is correct. The auditor has a responsibility to report any illegal acts to federal regulatory agencies.\nAnswer (a) is correct. Because audit evidence is more useful as the investigation is ongoing, the investigation should be performed as the auditor gathers evidence, which should occur during the engagement.\nAnswer (b) is correct. Most times, when an auditing principle conflicts with a legal principle, the auditor should follow, audit principles.\nAnswer (d) is incorrect. An auditor\u2019s liability is often greater for not performing audits that is not being performed for a reason other than as required under the auditing standards, i.e., a failure to perform agreed-upon procedures.\nAnswer (c) is correct. The auditor must consider whether performing the agreed-upon procedures may cause other auditors to make professional judgments that are in conflict with those made by the performing auditor. However, if the auditor discloses the existence of the conflict in writing to the client\u2019s management, the client\u2019s management will have the responsibility for deciding whether to disclose the conflict to clients.\nAnswer (a) is correct. In most cases, the conflict is insignificant and the auditor should explain the situation and perform the agreed-upon procedures.\nAnswer (b) is incorrect. An auditor audits a company client rather than its parent.\nAnswer (c) is correct. Audit documentation is needed to support opinion workpapers, not evidence.\nWhen does the auditor need to modify his or her evidence to meet the requirements of an assertion?\nAnswer (a) is incorrect. If internal control appears to be ineffective, the auditor should gather evidence from external sources in addition to those obtained the company\u2019s records.\nAnswer (b) is incorrect. If management is not cooperating and the auditor finds evidence supporting an assertion, the auditor should document the existence of the evidence and the need to modify evidence.\nAnswer (c) is incorrect. If the auditor has evidence to support an assertion but finds significant control deficiencies, the auditor should modify or discount the evidence.\nAnswer (d) is correct. An auditor should document all of the above issues so other members of the engagement team understand the evidence\u2019s impractical", "begin system development. Milestone C is the decision to begin system development testing and prototype production for an acquisition program. Acquisition programs also have a decision gate early in the technology maturation phase, known as the Technology Readiness Assessment. The Technology Readiness Assessment is the decision when acquisition program officials can confidently assert that relevant technologies for program development are mature enough to proceed to the next phase based on a series of quantitative and qualitative criteria. The Department of Defense (DOD) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts reviews of all phases of major defense acquisition programs at the major acquisition decision point. Table ES-1 lists the total and individual amounts of the Office of the Inspector General 2019 annual audit plan\u2019s defense-wide initiatives where we will seek to provide relevant information and observations of acquisition programs in the technology readiness assessment phase and the program\u2019s transitions across the major acquisition decision points. https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019/10/04/2019-2020_defense-wide_aap.pdf https://dod.gov/pubs/foi/dod-2019-000044-20161027/view https://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/manual/html/d-mshf.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The major acquisition program that the Office of the Inspector General will review in 2019 is as follows:\n\u2022\tAir Land Mobile Tactical Systems (ALMTS) - The $11.6 billion ALMTS will equip warfighters with state-of-the-art equipment and capabilities to ensure their survivability and the free flow and use of data. The program will develop the equipment, equipment-support networks, and services needed to support an integrated air and ground tactical system that will enhance the survivability of warfighters and enable them to use data in a free-flow environment. The ALMTS program will focus on two integrated areas:\n-\tThe Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) will deliver ground tactical vehicles that can withstand battlefield threats and incorporate advanced technologies to enhance capability and survivability.\n-\tThe Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) program will provide airborne common tactical data links (CTDLS) to enable the safe transmission of data in the complex, contested, and congested war battlespaces. The CTDL linkages will enable airborne CTDLS to secure the free flow of data, unrestricted by technology boundaries, thereby improving the tactical effectiveness of aircraft and unmanned air systems. The GMV and TCDL programs were integrated into the ALMTS program by the Army in February 2013. The ALMTS program is executed by the PM Tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (Tactical C5I), and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) will act as the principal systems command. The ALMTS program director is currently the PEO for C5I, C4, and Networks. https://pm-tactical-c5i.webodt.net/pm-tactical-c5i/about", "Signed into law on May 9, 2014, the DATA Act is designed to standardize and improve the quality of government financial data on USAspending.gov. Through this audit, we determined that the majority of the data that agencies submitted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for inclusion on the site were not accurate. In addition,  we observed a significant number of issues in the agencies\u2019 internal controls and determined that some agencies were not consistently following DATA Act definitions or requirements. Consequently, while agencies were required to submit their records on award and assistance spending, some of the submissions did not correspond with actual spending. These deficiencies hinder the usefulness of award and assistance spending information on USAspending.gov, and, as a result, limit the ability of the public and Congress to monitor federal spending. We recommended that the U.S. Office of Management and Budget develop and begin using official definitions for data elements within the DATA Act to ensure consistency in the reporting of award and assistance spending information across agencies. We also recommended that the Department of the Treasury provide guidance to agencies on identifying and documenting problems in the recording of transactions related to award or assistance spending. To address the problems of agencies not following DATA Act definitions and requirements, and the lack of internal controls, we made five recommendations to: (1) the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, (2) the Treasury\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (3) the Justice Department, (4) the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security, (5) the Environmental Protection Agency, and (6) the Federal Reserve Board.\nRecommendation: The Director of OMB should provide guidance to agencies that have identified errors or omissions in their award or assistance spending data to make official changes to their spending reports before FY2020 for the following three reasons: (1) to ensure more timely publication on USAspending.gov; (2) to ensure all data in each spending report are accurate; and (3) to ensure awards and assistance spending is properly classified and accounted for in audited financial statements for the U.S. Government as a whole.\nAgency Affected: Executive Office of the President\nRecommendation: The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, through FSOC, and the Secretary of the Treasury should assess whether the agencies\u2019 spending reporting weaknesses identified in this report have a current and substantial impact on the ability of the U.S. Government to meet its reporting requirements to FSOC or any other regulatory authority and, if necessary, work with these agencies to address these weaknesses.\nRecommendation: The Attorney General should direct the Department of Justice to review and update its policies, procedures, controls, and guidance to ensure that (1) the DATA Act requirements are followed at the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices\u2019 parent component, and (2) award and assistance spending information can be accurately reported on USAspending.gov to ensure effective monitoring of U.S. Attorney spending and assist agencies and Congress in making better informed decisions that are based on accurate data.\nRecommendation: The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Management should work with Treasury officials to ensure that award and assistance spending data are recorded as appropriate in the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Sub-ledger, which feeds into FSAP and supports the USAspending.gov Data Center. In addition, the Assistant Secretary should develop and implement a plan that provides a systematic approach to (1) updating award and assistance spending information in FSAP as agencies submit official changes to the data, and (2) reporting errors or corrections in award or assistance spending in USAspending.gov that do not involve changes to the official financial data maintained in FSAP.\nRecommendation: The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Management should direct officials in the Offices of the Comptroller of the Currency to work with the agencies in their respective Districts to determine whether agencies within these districts are properly classifying awards and assistance spending as either assistance or grants. If needed, the Assistant Secretary should work with agencies and the OCC to improve these agencies\u2019 processes for classifying awards and assistance spending.\nRecommendation: The Inspector General of the Department of Justice should update its internal policies and procedures that define award and assistance spending activities under the DATA Act and also specify guidance for reviewing award", "The military services have highly trained EOD personnel to eliminate explosive hazards such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

EOD forces are prepared to execute these missions in accordance with interservice agreements and guidelines. According to a DOD official, the services consider multiple factors to determine the manpower needed for their EOD forces, including the combatant command\u2019s requests, wartime missions, and available resources. To fulfill wartime requirements, the services determine EOD manpower through a manpower planning process that includes wartime mission tasks.", "1) Define same-day service in primary and mental care. 2) Develop same-day services operational and policy guidance. (a) VA medical centers should establish a single point of entry system for veterans to receive same-day services. (b) VA medical centers must develop clinically appropriate processes for providing timely and effective care to veterans who present for care on evenings, weekends, and federal holidays. 3) VA medical centers must train all primary care, mental health, and telehealth providers on use of same-day service options. 4) Implementation should occur in 3 phases. Phase 1 should be implemented in FY 2017. Phase 2 should be implemented in FY 2018. Phase 3 should be implemented by FY 2020.  VHA also identified several factors that would guide same- day services implementation, including same-day service definition, a process that provides a single point of entry for veterans to get care during normal business hours, same- day services triage and telephone screening processes, a process that tracks veterans seen after normal business hours (or a process that addresses care requirements during evenings, weekends, and federal holidays), training and education in the same-day services process, and a same- day policy handbook. The latter consisted of a policy that addressed the VISN director\u2019s role in leading same- day initiatives and for defining and ensuring oversight of same-day initiatives. As in previous years, VHA also published VA Directive 6110 from the VHA Access Operations Office for VHA Same-Day Service Initiative. VA Directive 6110 provided a standard process for VA medical centers to implement and operate same-day services. VHA also provided training and education in same- day services, including a set of online training and education modules. VHA also provided a policy handbook to VISN directors. These materials instructed VISN directors to implement and operate same- day services. It also instructed VISN directors to conduct monthly monitoring reviews of individual medical centers and review data on same-day services implementation. In April 2017, VHA updated its patient-aligned care teams (PACT) and same-day services handbooks. The update also provided additional training to VISN directors on the new PACT handbook. VHA\u2019s same-day efforts have been supported with additional funding to hire staff, improve scheduling, and provide veterans with same- day services. The additional funding was provided through VA\u2019s FY 2017 Medical Sessions for a total of approximately $24 million. In November 2016, VHA hired a National Scheduling Office director to lead this new national effort. VA medical centers also hired patient schedulers and additional support staff when necessary to implement and operate the initiative. VHA officials told us that they provide ongoing training and education to staff on the same-day services initiative. Additionally, VISN directors oversee training and education on same-day services, including VA Directive 6110 VISN training that focuses on leadership commitment and staff buy in, the importance of improving patient experience, and the importance of being customer service focused. VHA officials also noted that VA\u2019s new PACT handbook provided clinicians with additional training on same-day services, including the role of clinics and access issues. VISNs have developed training programs for veterans\u2019 health advisors as well as nonclinical staff. A VISN official we spoke with discussed his same-day services responsibilities in his quarterly meetings with VA medical center directors, and his assessment of their current state of implementation. He noted his efforts have made an impact on the number of patients returning no shows. We will describe VA medical center efforts to implement same- day services in the next section. VISNs have provided varying levels of support and oversight of the same-day services initiative. A VISN medical center director we spoke with stated that his VISN provided one-on-one guidance and held meetings to support ongoing same- day services initiative implementation. He noted his VISN has monthly meetings with individual VA medical centers to provide ongoing support and guidance. In May 2017, VHA issued VISN Directors\u2019 Same Day Services Monthly Status Report. The guidance stated that VISN directors were responsible for the monthly submission of 20 clinical data elements and 3 access elements. The elements included: \u2022", "10 mm calibre and shotguns that meet the performance  criteria in the proposed rules. However, non-automatic firearms and shotguns with a calibre greater than or equal to 12 mm calibre, military style semi- automatic firearms, automatic firearms, certain grenade launchers, and launchers not otherwise specified, would remain on the USML. In addition, USML Categories I, II, and III do not include other types of projectiles. If enacted, the proposed transfer would affect USMLs categories IV(a) \u2014 V(iv), which are not relevant for the purposes of this report (see table 1).\nUSML Categories I, II, and III (firearms, artillery, and ammunition) have not changed since the inception of the AECA. Since the enactment of the AECA, Commerce expanded its export jurisdiction to include the CCL. However, over time, the items remaining on the USML have only increased in their types and categories. Commerce\u2019s 2010 Export Administration Regulation (EAR) Modernization program, which began implementing the 2010 ECRA, sought to update and consolidate the CCL. However, it did not reorganise the categories within the CCL, it only changed the specific items that were controlled. Following passage of the CFIUS-focused provisions of the ECRA, Commerce undertook a review of other aspects of the ECRA and identified a number of additional issues for Congress to consider, including the revision of the USML and CCL. State and Commerce then issued a report, 2017 Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 17, to Congress on export control reform, which included the proposal to modify State\u2019s export control jurisdiction. This proposal sought to restrict State\u2019s export  jurisdiction to those controlled items that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States and to streamline firearms control by modifying the USML\u2019s structure and limiting the types of firearms USML coverage to those that meet the performance criteria in the proposed rules. In addition, to increase transparency and ensure alignment between the jurisdiction of State and Commerce, PDD 17 called for a review of the CCL and associated case law.\nThe report concluded that modifying the jurisdiction of State will better align State\u2019s export control responsibilities with its counterparts at DOD, DHS, and DOJ. In addition, modifying the  jurisdiction of State will help streamline administration, increase efficiency, and align the  with other jurisdictions in the government. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of  will be beneficial to the firearms industry and ultimately serve as a tool to protect the United States from unintended supply chain diversion.\nIn their analysis, State and Commerce note that firearms are often transferred to, sold, or stored by foreign persons located outside the United States. As a result, in some cases, US law may not cover the acts of transfer, sale, or storage of certain firearms that are subject to the provisions of the AECA and EAR. For example, under EAR provisions, a non-US person who, within the Territory of the United States, acts on a firearm or other item on the CCL and is not a US person, is subject to a civil penalty notwithstanding Section 2778 of the AECA, which penalises acts violating the AECA and EAR for acts within the Territory the US done by US persons or within the US by foreign persons. As a result of this analysis, State and Commerce also propose to move the legal controls for such firearms to the CCL, which is administered by Commerce. The transfer of these firearms jurisdictions would align the legal controls for such firearms with current industry norms, thereby providing benefits to industry. Additionally, US companies will no longer be subject to a risk of dual jurisdiction by the United States or by a foreign government acting outside of the United States. Moreover, foreign persons will be subject to full enforcement of non-disclosure and licensing requirements for US technology and US technology items.\nThe current system has several drawbacks and inefficiencies. First, many non-US firms have multiple supply chains, and in some cases, components and accessories manufacturers are not in the United States but are instead in foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, many manufacturers of US firearms, components, and accessories may have portions of foreign-owned subsidiaries subject to foreign export controls in jurisdictions outside the United States. Second", "Federal agencies conduct a variety of procurements that are 5 reserved for small business participation through small business 6 set-asides. These set-asides can be for small businesses in 7 general, or they can be specific to small businesses. According to SBA these are: 1. Historically Underutilized Business Zone; 2. Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB); 3. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; 4. 8(a) Business Development. These set-asides aim to ensure that government contracts benefit small businesses. 9 Federal agencies have long struggled with oversight of 10 small business set-aside procedures. In a 2015 report, the 11 SBA Office of Inspector General reported fraud in SBA\u2019s 12 management of the WOSB program. The report highlighted 13 deficiencies in SBA\u2019s third-party certification system. Although SBA 14 responded to the recommendations in that report, GAO believes that small 15 businesses participating in the federal marketplace would benefit from 16 additional oversight of small business set-asides, which are subject to 17 fraud and abuse. To further assess federal oversight of small 18 businesses and prevent fraud and abuse, GAO examined the 19 extent to which 1. (a) four federal agencies are using SBA\u2019s Central 2. Data Portal, or CDR, before awarding contracts for set-asides; 3. (b) SBA is assessing the extent of small business 4. set-aside compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5. requirements; and 6. (c) agencies are verifying whether small businesses that 7. participate in the WOSB program are eligible on small award 8. contracts. According to SBA, the SBIR and SBIC programs 9. have procedures in place to support their intended purposes; 10. however, weaknesses in SBA\u2019s procedures for assessing the 11. impact of these two programs may make SBA unable to meet its obligations under Title V of the Small Business Investment Act. GAO recommends that SBA conduct additional analyses of the long and short-term impact of the SBIR and SBIC programs in order to determine what, if any, impact has occurred over time. To develop the recommendations, we used relevant statutes 13 related to the responsibilities for SBA, the four agencies, and. the Office of Inspector General to review contracting programs and policies for set-aside procurements; the SBIR and SBIC program management regulations and policies; and the extent to which contracting personnel have access to SBA\u2019s CDR. GAO reviewed and assessed the information from the four agencies that is required for award of a set-aside contract, interviewed contracting personnel from those agencies, and met with program managers. Our analysis was informed by previous GAO reports and SBA reports. We also performed additional research during site visits at contracting offices with small business set-aside functions at the departments of Agriculture, Education, and Health and Human Services. We also held telephone discussions with program managers at SBA and the departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Justice. We compared the extent of compliance information provided by these agencies with the documentation provided by SBA and used the criteria in the FAR to assess the compliance. We conducted additional research on program evaluations at the agencies, and we interviewed evaluators about the methods and tools they use to assess a program at the conclusion of the evaluation. We also reviewed guidance and regulations for program evaluation, interviewed program evaluators at federal agencies, and met with small business stakeholders to discuss program oversight and compliance. To understand the processes and policies for selecting small 17 businesses for acquisitions in the CDR, we analyzed the. SBA\u2019s Acquisition Management System documentation to determine the system\u2019s functionality and assessed the functionality with agency personnel. We relied on contracting requirements from the applicable statute, OMB Circulars, and SBA policy. We also interviewed procurement officials from the four federal agencies and from SBA for our review of the processes and procedures for selecting small businesses for contract awards. We also review", "The Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate have jointly proposed amendments to implement certain provisions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. The proposed amendments involve changes to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to (as determined by us and specified in LD-1 and LD-213): increase the threshold under which lobbying firms must register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House to more than $3,000 in compensation; clarify the registration threshold for lobbying firms representing foreign corporations, foreign associations; clarify who must disclose lobbying activity under the LDA, whether or not they are registered; align the lobbying disclosure registration requirements with statutory requirements; allow lobbying activity related to government ethics to be disclosed on LD-2s; and require registration of individuals who meet certain thresholds related to lobbying activities. In addition, the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House have proposed amendments to the definition of lobbyist to: clarify that certain individual are not registered lobbyists under the LDA; and clarify certain individual are registered lobbyists under the LDA. We have found that this rule is not a major rule as defined at 5 U.S.C. Chapter 8, because it will not result in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. In determining whether a rule is a \"major rule,\" Congress considers four statutory factors, often referred to as the \"four criteria,\" and an agency may consider factors that it deems relevant. The first criterion is whether a rule has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million; the second is whether a rule will cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic region; the third is whether a rule will significantly (or uniquely) affect small entities; and the fourth is whether the rule will create a substantial (or unique) effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. According to agency records, these proposed regulations will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic region, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.

She had implemented an aggressive sales and marketing program, had developed several new business products and had acquired five additional firms.\nConstantino had taken steps to improve T.N.F.M.\u2019s earnings. She had implemented an aggressive sales and marketing program, had developed several new business products and had acquired five additional firms.\nThe second section of the case will focus on the three financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Cash is an important asset for almost all business organizations. For some businesses, the source of earnings can change. The most basic source of earnings is cash, which results when a firm sells a product or service, either directly to another organization in an arm's length transaction (called cash collections), or to a finance company. From a cash basis, a firm calculates net income or earnings, which is defined as earnings before interest and taxes.\nTable 1 summarizes the conditions and rates applicable to progress payments based on costs and performance-based payments. Several offices and agencies within DOD have a role in managing contract financing. The office of DPC, within DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, is responsible for all pricing, contracting, and procurement policy matters. This office formulates and oversees DOD-wide analysis of contract data to support DOD-wide decision making.\nThe next section will take a detailed look at cash flow analysis and the sources and uses of cash. Cash flow is the most frequently used measure of performance for a business. While earnings measure a firm's performance, cash flow is the amount of money in the organization's bank account. Cash flows are classified as operating, investing, and financing activities, which is based on generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe next section in the case will calculate the free cash a firm possesses. Free cash is equal to cash flows from operations, plus proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment, less the amount of cash flows needed for the maintenance of the property. It represents the cash available for reinvesting, repaying long-term debt, acquiring other businesses and paying dividends. The free cash method of analyzing a firm's performance is a good measure because it excludes the capital expenditures that are necessary for growth.\nThe balance sheet lists an organization's assets, liabilities, and shareholder's equity, and is often in the form of a company balance sheet. The balance sheet gives an overview that reflects the company's performance and financial status for one historical and a given point of time, normally for one year. The balance sheet reflects the state of a firm's financial activity as of a very specific point in time (the end of the firm's accounting period). For example, if in a given accounting period, the firm purchased new machinery for $600, but then depreciated it over next 3 years for $220, the firm should report the new machine on its balance sheet as a $380 asset.\nThe balance sheet includes the following accounting entries: the cash and cash equivalents section, the accounts receivable section, and accounts payable, which represents the financial liabilities of the firm. In addition, the balance sheet includes the following sections: investments, fixed assets, and shareholder equity, and liabilities and reserves for the following items (which is referred to as non-current liability).\nInvestments are the amount invested to the company by either shareholders or creditors. Fixed assets are the physical assets of a business. This includes items such as buildings, equipment, and inventories. Equity is the cumulative amount of dividends given to current and past shareholders in a firm. Shareholder\u2019s equity is the difference between a firm's total assets and total liabilities. The balance sheet includes the following sections: revenue and expense, reserves, and unassigned income account.", "THE STORAGE PROBLEM", "0930 0940 1020 1045 1100 1115 1245 1330 1400 1430 1700 1730 1735 0700 0710 0730 0820 0850 0940 1045 1120 1200 1230 1235 800 1610 1650 1745 0430 0940 1130 1245 1330 1430 1545 1015 1155 1300 1415 1445 1515 1610 The Guidelines do not incorporate GAO's leading practice on having an evaluator prepare a report that includes conclusions on how the program\u2019s objectives were met and conclusions on whether agency personnel effectively implemented the program before providing final payment of foreign assistance funds to the implementing partner.

Specifically, DHS's OCIO should evaluate contractor risk assumptions to ensure they are reasonable when used to calculate the appropriate level of performance risk for a contract. In addition, OCIO should develop and implement processes to improve the monitoring of contractor performance, because many of the contracts we reviewed did not clearly outline performance expectations. Further, management should monitor contractor performance by reviewing the accuracy of contractor work completed, and verify that the work was reviewed by the contracting officer or government representatives.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  1. To better align the contract structure and associated performance incentives to program goals, management should determine which service contract components are critical to achieving program outcomes by identifying measurable goals and performance objectives, and provide those programmatic details to appropriate contracting officials.     2. To help ensure that DHS officials are using the proper amount of performance risk in their contracts, management should consider whether risks in the contract terms and conditions are properly supported by risk assessments that show the specific performance risks that may affect the overall contract performance.   3. To better identify the risks inherent in the services and the factors impacting performance, DHS's OCIO should consider how well DHS understands its needs; how they have been determined, defined, and documented; and the extent to which the products or services required meet a public or mission need. In addition, OCIO should evaluate whether the services proposed for the contracts meet DHS's needs and objectives, and the specific capabilities needed and desired in order to assess the degree to which the services meet DHS's expectations. In order for the proposed services to meet DHS's needs and objectives, OCIO should ensure performance objectives for the required services identified in contract solicitations are measurable, and performance factors are identified, in light of the specific services being contracted for.            3         Figure 1: DHS Categorizes Contracts Based on Risk  Source: Audit workpapers.", "FDA approves REMS for 232 drugs, including 25 biological products, as of March 2015.

As of September 2018, DOD\u2019s civilian acquisition workforce comprised about 157,000 civilian personnel. We have, among other things (see appendix A for additional information), been involved in examining DOD\u2019s efforts to attract, hire, and retain qualified civilian acquisition workforce personnel, identifying challenges that DOD has faced with managing its acquisition workforce, and issuing recommendations to DOD and the Office of Personnel Management for consideration. For example, we testified in March 2017 before the Senate Committee on Homeland Securities Governmental Affairs\u2019 Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management on challenges associated with the federal hiring process, and in October 2018 we testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government on the need to improve the quality and workforce planning and management efforts of the federal government\u2019s financial management systems and other related practices. This testimony was incorporated into our October 2018 report on agencies\u2019 processes for hiring and placing accountants. Based on our ongoing work, we have made the following new recommendations to assist DOD in strengthening its hiring capabilities and improving its efforts to manage its acquisition workforce: (1) issue policy guidance to agencies to address inconsistencies between agencies\u2019 guidance for hiring civilian acquisition personnel and OPM guidance, and make related OPM guidance clearer and more specific, and (2) require that the acquisition workforce inventory OPM collects annually include a minimum set of data elements, as discussed separately below. In response, DOD concurred with our recommendation on issuing policy guidance to agencies. However, DOD did not concur with our recommendation on requiring the acquisition workforce inventory that OPM collects annually to include specific data elements. 60 percent of DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce, but as of December 2017 it had 16,000 unfilled positions across the acquisition workforce.  These positions remained vacant because DOD  These acquisition workforce positions have been vacant because DOD (1) lacked knowledgeable acquisition workforce to fill the positions and hire appropriately qualified candidates, (2) needed to fill the position under a more restrictive authority, and/or (3) had established a priority for the position due to mission requirements, as discussed previously.  In response to our February 2019 recommendation, DOD concurred and noted that they had plans to implement the recommendation, but did not provide a timeframe for when it intended to implement the recommendation. In addition, 116 positions for which DOD had identified hiring authorities were still vacant in September 2018, and DOD continues to struggle to fill those positions.  This demonstrates the importance of ensuring that the hiring process is efficient and effective. As mentioned previously, we believe improving the hiring process could help DOD attract qualified candidates into the acquisition workforce. Specifically, we found that DOD uses a competitive examining process to hire civilian personnel. The process includes, among other things, identifying job requirements, identifying vacancies, advertising vacancies, and advertising positions in order to recruit the most qualified candidates. In addition, the process involves assessment of candidates\u2019 competency and performance against established job qualifications standards, ranking candidates, and selecting candidates. We have found these processes to be cumbersome and inconsistent, as noted in the chart below. Our observations on some of these inconsistencies include the following: A. Acquisition Workforce Inventory: In January 2017, OPM began collecting information from agencies on vacant positions in the acquisition workforce for the first time, but limited OPM\u2019s data collection to certain acquisition career fields, such as contracting and engineering, which comprised about three-fourths of DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce in fiscal year 2017. As part of this process, OPM asked agencies to identify vacant positions for certain acquisition career fields, but did not provide explicit guidance on determining whether a vacant position was in fact vacant based on the agencies\u2019 needs. As a result, the agencies may have interpreted the OPM requests differently, as evidenced by inconsistent data. Therefore, our comparison of our data to OPM\u2019s data indicated that while OP", "In fiscal year 2019, DoD\u2019s 36 fixed-wing aircraft spent a combined 1,771 days longer in depot maintenance or in queue (see figure 4). Since fiscal year 2014, selected aircraft have spent a total of 47,896 more days in depot maintenance or in queue.

VA\u2019s disability compensation claims process starts when a veteran submits a claim to VA. A claims processor then reviews the claim and helps the veteran gather the relevant evidence needed to evaluate the claim. Such evidence includes the veteran\u2019s military service records, medical exams, and treatment records from VHA medical facilities and private medical service providers. If necessary to provide support to substantiate a claim, VA will also provide a medical exam for the veteran, either through a provider at a VHA medical facility or through a VBA contractor. According to VBA officials, VBA monitors a VHA facility\u2019s capacity to conduct exams, and in instances when the facility may not have capacity to conduct a timely exam, VBA will send an exam request to one of its contractors instead. Once the contractor accepts the exam request from VBA, it assigns a contracted examiner to conduct the exam and complete an exam report designed to capture essential medical information for purposes of determining entitlement to disability benefits. The contractors send the completed report to VBA, which uses the information as part of the evidence to evaluate the claim and determine whether the veteran is eligible for benefits. In 2016, VBA established an exam program office to manage and oversee contractors, monitor their performance, and ensure that they meet contract requirements. For example, in 2018 we reported that the contracts require that contractors develop plans outlining how they will ensure examiners are adequately trained. We also reported that contractors are required to provide VBA with monthly exam status reports, which include the number of canceled, rescheduled, and completed exams, among other things. VBA has not fully resolved issues in collecting information on contractors\u2019 quality and timeliness, which continues to hinder its oversight of contracted examiners and contribute to other challenges in managing the contracts. We previously reported that VBA measured timeliness as the number of days between the date the contractor accepts an exam request and the date the contractor initially sends the completed exam report to VBA. However, we previously found that the exam management system VBA used until spring 2018 did not retain the initial exam completion date when VBA sent an initial exam report back to a contractor for clarification or correction. In such a situation, according to agency officials, VA would not always be able to accurately assess a contractor\u2019s timeliness as outlined in the contracts. Similar to our findings, the VA Office of Inspector General\u2019s June 2019 report on VBA\u2019s oversight of contracted exam cancellations also identified deficiencies due to staffing shortages and exam management system limitations, among other reasons. According to VBA officials, VBA is currently working with contractors to fix the deficiencies we previously identified. VBA claims process and performance data can be found on pages 26\u201327 of the June 2013 GAO report, which is available at the following URL: https://www.gao.gov/assets/600/591829.pdf.\nTo help monitor the quality of contractor medical exams, VBA\u2019s exam program office collects the timeliness of contractor exam reports, along with other quality information. For the first 5 months of 2018, VBA reviewed contractors\u2019 timeliness data and identified 9 contractors who had not yet established a pattern for completing exams in a timely matter by the end of May 2018, and in some cases, had not provided an acceptable number of completed exams.\nThe contractors that VBA identified as requiring additional attention for issues such as completion rates, staffing levels, and timeliness included the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center\u2019s contract medical team and contracted examiners, QTC Management, LLC, and GSS Medical Solutions, LLC.\nAs a result of the 2018 GAO review, VBA is taking actions intended to strengthen its contract oversight activities.

The Attorney General\u2019s April 2018 memorandum, also referred to as the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, directed DOJ prosecutors to accept all referrals of all improper entry offenses from DHS for criminal prosecution, to extent practicable. In these cases, DHS referred parents who were apprehended with children to DOJ prosecutors for criminal proceedings and separately transferred these children to the custody of HHS/ORR. HHS then placed these children in one of its shelters, in accordance with HHS policy. In response to the public outcry regarding the separation of families, the President issued an executive order on June 20, 2018, which directed DHS to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. As of January 31, 2019, this litigation is ongoing. DHS and HHS both have processes for addressing UACs, but these processes vary significantly. Pursuant to the TVPRA, HHS is responsible for UAC medical care, for the timely placement of the unaccompanied children with qualified sponsors, and for determining whether they have a credible fear of persecution or fear of torture, in an effort to establish their eligibility for humanitarian relief benefits. DHS\u2019s UAC process is designed to address its responsibility for ensuring that UACs do not remain in DHS custody for extended periods and to facilitate their early reunification with parents or placement with other sponsors in the United States as quickly as possible. HHS had approximately 4,200 unaccompanied alien children (UAC) in custody on a typical day in 2018, but its data showed an increase in UACs shortly after the establishment of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on April 6. From April 19 to September 30, 2018, HHS averaged nearly 11,000 UAC in its custody per day and as high as 2,400 on one day. To address the capacity limitations on the number of children ORR can accommodate, its acting director had announced that ORR intended to transition children 5 and older out of its unaccompanied-children care system, called the Unaccompanied Alien Children program (UAC), to the custody of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which houses and cares for unaccompanied children\u2014in the custody of ICE\u2014in the facilities of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nOn May 5, 2018, we initiated our audit at the request of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, because of congressional and public concern about DHS\u2019s and HHS\u2019s handling of the UAC family separation policy and subsequent efforts to reunify families. Our audit objective was to determine the number of UAC families that were separated, and to assess the implementation and effectiveness of DHS\u2019s and HHS\u2019s efforts to ensure the humane and proper care and treatment of UAC after they were separated and transferred to HHS custody. HHS, HHS/ORR, DHS, ICE, and DHS/CBP are all responsible for ensuring that the separated children were properly cared for and that there were procedures in place to reunite them with their guardians.\nFrom October 2013 through July 2018, more than 2,600 children between the ages of 0 and 4 years were separated from their families. DHS and HHS have no policy or process guidance for identifying which children should be separated. DHS officials stated they rely on their", "Different aviation industry employers have distinct workforce needs and may require workers with specific skillsets depending on the type of work performed. BACKGROUND: Aviation is a major industry and consists of aircraft operators, maintenance facilities and manufacturers. The Aviation Safety Administration (ASA) provides safety oversight and regulatory requirements for operators while the FAA certifies that manufacturing facilities, airframe and engine repair stations, and aircraft maintenance technicians comply with applicable FAA regulations and standards. Mechanics and repairmen maintain and repair aviation equipment such as aircraft, engines and other aviation components. For certain mechanics to meet the FAA standards to do specific repair or maintenance jobs, they must become certified. There are three different categories or certifications, airframe, powerplant, and airframe and powerplant. Some mechanics and repairmen may have additional certifications based on job requirements. A certified mechanic or repairmen must also meet certain FAA experience requirements to maintain or renew a certificate; however, certified mechanics or repairmen may work under supervision of another certified mechanic or repairman to meet experience requirements. Mechanic and repairman employment may vary by region, season, and type of company. Non-certified mechanics and repairmen are expected to perform aircraft maintenance tasks under supervision of a certified mechanic or repairmen. Non-certified aviation maintenance workers can increase their skills through on-the-job training or specific classes at a trade school. AMT Schools provide formal training for mechanics and repairmen while also providing a job placement resource and career information. There is no FAA test prescribed for certified repairmen and some airframe-rated certified mechanics may seek airframe-related avionics technician certification depending on the task performed. In addition, FAA has not prescribed a test required of non-certificated aviation maintenance workers. OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Aviation is a major industry and consists of aircraft operators, maintenance facilities and manufacturers. The Aviation Safety Administration (ASA) provides safety oversight and regulatory requirements for operators, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies that manufacturing facilities, airframe and engine repair stations, and aircraft maintenance technicians comply with applicable FAA regulations and standards. Maintenance technicians perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, and repair, on airframes and aircraft parts, such as electrical and mechanical systems, piston engines, turbine engines, propellers, wheels, brakes, and pneumatic, hydraulic and deicer-type systems. Maintenance technicians also assemble, test, service, and repair guidance, communications, navigation, and flight-control computers, sensors, and instruments. Maintenance technicians repair parts or perform unscheduled maintenance, and conduct routine inspections of an aircraft or perform scheduled maintenance. Technicians work in various places, including aircraft hangars, repair stations, terminals, ramp rounds, and flight line. Aviation maintenance technicians hold various work titles or job responsibilities depending on their duties and the company employing them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not collect employment and wage data for aircraft maintenance technicians or repairmen; however, the BLS does collect data on the aviation industry overall. FAA provides industry data about the number of technicians and the number of companies and establishments (e.g., aircraft operators, maintenance stations, and airframe and powerplant shops) in aviation, but this agency data is not broken down into specific job types or the type of operation for each establishment. In addition, while FAA maintains data on the number of repair stations and the number of airframe and powerplant ratings for each repair station, FAA does not maintain data on the number and qualifications of repairmen nor how aviation repair stations hire their repairmen nor does FAA collect data on the aviation industry with regards to aviation mechanics and repairmen. Although certified mechanics and repairmen must be certified to work on certain parts of an aircraft\u2019s systems and components (e.g. airframes, and flight controls), there are no standards to measure their certification skills and they need not have a minimum of work experience to maintain or renew their certificates. FAA does not collect data on non-certificated aviation maintenance workforce, so that data is not available from FAA. AMT School\u2019s provides formal training for maintenance technicians while also providing a job placement resource and career information. FAA has not prescribed a test required of Certified Repairmen. The community college system in the United States includes public institutions that provide instruction that may vary from one campus to another.

To accomplish this, the FAA oversees the air traffic control system, coordinates voluntary safety programs and regulates the aviation industry. Over the past several years, there has been a heightened focus on aviation safety as evidenced by airlines conducting extensive investigations into previous accidents, and regulatory actions including new rules on pilot training, improved safety equipment, and new procedures to reduce the risk of collisions between aircraft and wildlife. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018, enacted by Congress on October 5, 2018, directs the FAA Secretary to establish a Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Oversight Committee to enhance oversight of FAA NextGen (National Airspace System) air traffic operations and systems capabilities. The FAA is now implementing an advanced air traffic control system designed to optimize the movement of aircraft. The FAA is also enhancing its management system to oversee oversight programs, and the FAA is implementing a plan to modernize the infrastructure critical to carrying out its safety mission. As a result, the FAA\u2019s management systems have evolved to focus on safety oversight, including its management and oversight of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system. The FAA recently started the process to modernize the National Airspace System air traffic control system by issuing a request for information related to the development of a future air traffic control system. In addition, the FAA recently published its national policy for unmanned aircraft systems and, according to the FAA\u2019s 2018-2022 strategic plan, the FAA aims to lead the effort to integrate civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system. Moreover, the FAA\u2019s strategic plan and strategic initiatives align with the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) Most Wanted List of transportation safety improvements \u2013 to reduce hazards by 70 percent in the next 5 years. As a result, we plan to assess whether the FAA is effectively using SMS to oversee its efforts, including the National Airspace System (NAS) air traffic control system, with the following objective: Determine if the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s safety management system enhances oversight, risk management, and decision making to meet safety goals. We will determine whether the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s safety management system enhances oversight, risk management, and decision making  to meet safety goals. To assess FAA\u2019s SMS efforts we will 1. Assess FAA\u2019s oversight of risk and 2. Assess how FAA assesses performance. To address these objectives, we will review a sampling of FAA\u2019s processes for safety oversight of air traffic control systems, airports, and the operation of aircraft to identify whether FAA uses these processes in a systematic and consistent manner to determine and o 61-00392 PAGE: 3 PUBLIC RELEASE DATE: 9/10/19 TYPE OF REPORT: Performance Report COMMITTEE CONTACT(S): HR SUBJECT- MATTER EXPERT(S): Rear Admiral (RADM) Katherine Dwyer (860) 268-8015 RADM Dwyer, Retired U.S. Nuclear Submarine Officer, will review the report\u2019s findings with FAA officials as well as the Department of Transportation Inspector General.

Interior also distributes nearly $5 million to each country in annual economic assistance payments. Interior uses U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and State Department funding to help with public works projects. Overseas, it uses Interior funding to provide public works help in each country.\nInterior will be submitting to Congress a combined $94.5 million in requests for federal funding, which will fund a series of projects in each country. State will provide funding for trust funds and annual economic assistance programs. Congress approved funding of $127 million under six different authorizations, $105 million for public works projects, $6 million for the Palau trust fund, $6.5 million for the Marshall Islands trust fund, and $200 million for annual funding of the FAS national trust fund for 2019.\nThe FY 2020 budget requested $550 million for ongoing costs relating to the compacts of free association. In the FY 2020 budget, Interior requested $827 million in new funding for a number of programs related to the FASs. The request was for $450 million for public works in each country and the national trust fund. It also requested nearly $350 million to fully fund the national trust fund. The budget also requested $98 million for grants under the Compacts\u2019 public policy provisions and $20 million to fund the Marshall Islands subsidiary, which administers all activities related solely to Kwajalein Atoll. The FY 2020 budget also requested nearly $17 million for U.S. visa waiver programs. The budget also included a series of requests for U.S. Coast Guard funding for the Marshall Islands.\nCONSIDERATIONS/ISSUES: Interior has authority to execute compacts of free association and manage many aspects of U.S. involvement in the FASs. U.S. law does not allow FAS citizens to work in the U.S., and U.S. territories ban migration on a different date. The Compact with the Republic of the Marshall Islands was negotiated in 1986 and entered into in 1986. Its original effective date was 1986. It has since been amended several times. The Compact is scheduled to end after 2023. The Compact was renegotiated and signed in 2010 and its effective date is now September 19, 2018. It is in effect through 2019. It will need to be renegotiated to extend its life, as its effective date expires on September 18, 2024.

After the war, the U.S. Congress approved a trusteeship agreement making the United States responsible to the United Nations for the administration of the islands. In 1976, the District of the Mariana Islands entered into a Covenant with the United States establishing the island territory's status as a self-governing commonwealth in political union with the United States. The Covenant granted the CNMI the right of self-governance over internal affairs and granted the United States complete responsibility and authority for matters relating to foreign affairs and defense affecting the CNMI. The Covenant also preserved the CNMI's exemption from certain federal laws that had previously been inapplicable to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, including certain federal minimum wage provisions and immigration laws, with certain limited exceptions. In 2008, the CNRA amended the joint resolution approving the U.S.-CNMI Covenant to generally apply federal immigration law, including the INA, to the CNMI, with a transition period for foreign workers and investors. Through the program, employers petition for nonimmigrant CW-1 permits that allow foreign workers who meet certain requirements to work temporarily in the CNMI. The CNRA limits the number of permits available for each fiscal year through the end of the transition period and reduces the permits available annually until the end of the transition period. In addition, the INA provides authorization for several types of visas for nonimmigrant workers and their families that became applicable to the CNMI with the passage of the CNRA.

One commissioner is designated by the President to serve as the Chair, who, among other things, serves as the official spokesperson of the Commission. The Commission is responsible for, among other things, revising budget estimates and determining the distribution of appropriated funds according to major programs and purposes.\nNRC staff from program offices in headquarters and four regional offices implement the agency\u2019s programs for developing regulations, licensing, inspection, enforcement, and emergency response, among other responsibilities. In addition, NRC\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer establishes, maintains, and oversees the implementation and interpretation of the agency\u2019s regulatory user fee policies and regulations and is responsible for assessing annual and service fees to licensees for each license they hold and sending invoices to licensees. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer also leads the agency\u2019s budget formulation and execution processes. NRC\u2019s authority to charge user fees or charges to identifiable beneficiaries through regulation is derived from two laws: the independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended. The independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 provides broad authority to federal agencies, including NRC, to assess user fees or charges to identifiable beneficiaries through regulation. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires that NRC first use its authority from the \u201c independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952\u201d to collect service fees or charges from licensees for specific services provided. NRC has established nine fee classes: (l) construction permits for nuclear power plants; (2) design certifications and operating licenses for nuclear reactors; (3) nuclear safety analysis reports for nuclear reactors; (4) combined licenses for small modular reactors; (5) operating licenses for nuclear materials enrichment, (6) uranium enrichment facility licenses; (7) uranium enrichment registrations and licenses for equipment under export control; (8) renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses; and (9) requests for action on administrative completeness and content of license amendment requests, including issuance, renewal, and amendment of licenses.\n1\t Includes amounts that NRC collects from licensees via user fees and annual fees under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n2\t The Office of the Chief Financial Officer develops fee rates and other requirements for regulated entities under the independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended; the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended; and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended.\nSource: NRC budget data, GAO analysis, and agency documentation. The amounts NRC collected through service and annual fees increased by approximately 6. 7 percent over a 5-year period, from about $390 million in fiscal 2014 to $420 million in fiscal 2019. Increased annual fees resulted from several factors, including new requirements to strengthen safety culture, revised regulatory requirements and guidance, and increases in inflationary pressures\u2014a portion of NRC\u2019s annual fee base is tied to general inflation rates. However, overall revenue collected from annual fees and service fees in fiscal years 2014 through 2019 was approximately the same as total expenditures authorized in the President\u2019s Budget during the same timeframe.\nthe amount of the fee.\nIn addition, NRC\u2019s regulations do not establish clear criteria for how it determines the final fee rates or the process through which it sets the amount of the service or annual fee. According to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, its current budget process has been in place since the 1980s. NRC\u2019s budget office establishes fee rates and develops fee rule language in support of NRC operating activities, which include licensing of nuclear power plants and ensuring its adequate staffing to address challenges facing the nuclear reactor industry.

First, many automation-related advances were made during the era of the first industrial revolution, beginning in\nthe 18th century. For example, researchers have noted that automation has replaced tasks performed by workers and also made firms more efficient, creating a greater demand for other types of workers. Although automation has historically been a labor disrupter in manufacturing and physical work, recent research has shown that recent advancements in fields, such as  automation, and robotics are enabling [machines/robots/machines] to perform cognitive tasks that were once performed by humans. For example,  AI refers to robots and machines that are programmed to mimic [human] intelligence\u2014and we have reported on  [AIs]/[AI]s advancing to a state where they have begun to learn and make [inferences/decisions/progress/progress/changes/choices]  by themselves without [humans/a human] directly [programming/instructing]/[programmimg/programming/instructing]/[programmming].  [AI]s are generally programmed with algorithms, such as machine learning, training on data collected from past tasks to automate future ones. This type of automation is referred to as task [replication/repetition/replacement]/[replication/repetition/replacement] or task [reproduction/repetition/reproduction/repetition/replication/reproduction/repetition/repetition]. For example,  [AI]s trained to recognize images and perform [objective/object-based]  [targeting/recognition] are examples of task repetition. Another example of task repetition is  robotic assemblies that learn to perform precise movements in the assembly line. While these AI systems have automated a wide variety of physical and cognitive tasks during the past 160 years, they have not displaced humans entirely.  However, new applications of AI seem to have an [immediate/inimitable]  [impact/affect/effect/effected/effect/affected/effected/effect/effect/impact/inimitable/immediate] effect, at least in the short term [due to the fact that/because/since/because the fact they that], as the pace of innovation has accelerated in the last 50 years. Additionally, the development of AI is no longer isolated to research universities and large enterprises. Rather, the availability of AI-related data for the public and increasing availability of cloud-based computing has made AI accessible to a wide range of organizations and has been facilitated by the accessibility and lowering of prices [of] of [machines/devices/hardware/equipment]/[hardware/equipment/devices/machines] [powered by/within] [machines/devices/hardware/equipment]/[hardware/equipment/devices/machines]. For example, the accessibility of cloud computing has spurred growth of the start-up community as firms take on a more bottom-up approach to develop AI. For example, machine vision/learning (i.e., software capable of analyzing images) that enables machines to see and  understand  what is going on around them has facilitated advancements that have transformed the field of image recognition. Image recognition is a type of pattern recognition where computer vision is used to recognize  patterns [in images] based on the use of models and algorithms [involving deep learning/neural networks].  The development of image recognition software has changed our everyday lives, impacting businesses  and/or  industries and/or  jobs that had not previously been touched by automation, such as [medical/medical professionals]/[image/image professionals] who use diagnostic technologies, and other industries that require an eye for aesthetics, like [fashion/beauty/apparel] and [film]. Other examples of AI-related impacts in these areas include medical image processing, which has created more accurate and faster diagnoses for [medical/medical professionals]/[image/image professionals].

For example, the Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1976 directed the secretaries of the military departments to, among other things, take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to insure that women were eligible for assignment to all positions for which they were qualified, but excluded female servicemembers from assignment to units below the brigade level whose primary mission was to engage in direct combat on the ground.\nAs noted in the first paragraph, today, women have more opportunities to serve on the front lines in the military.\nTo fully address the gender issues in these two questions, however, one should ask: 1) have the advances in education helped to prepare the best and brightest females for these roles, and 2) will the advances in training, combined with education, be enough for success?\nAnswer the following question from the perspective of the woman servicemember.\nHow will female military servicemembers be supported in their efforts to adapt and perform in this new role?  How well prepared are they for the new combat jobs, and for overseas combat deployment?  What does the military services\u2019 current data reveal about female servicemembers\u2019 military readiness in the new roles?  Is the women-in-combat effort really about equality and success, or is it merely about image and failure?\nAnswer the following question from the perspective of the male servicemember.\nHow will male military servicemembers be integrated and supported in these new roles?  How well prepared are they for their new combat and occupational specialty jobs?  Have their current training programs kept up with the necessary skills required to maintain combat proficiency over the past 30 years?  Will their training programs for current and future soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and Coast Guardsmen be adequate to ensure their competency in combat with women servicemembers?\nAnswer all the following questions: 1. What are the possible, and likely adverse effects of women in combat for the servicemember's readiness, safety, and operational effectiveness?  Will servicewomen be subject to sexual harassment and worse, just as servicewomen are subject to sexual harassment in the ranks as they are today? 2. How will integration of female servicemembers into combat affect servicewomen\u2019s lives now and in the future? 3. How well prepared are the current and future male servicemembers to function effectively in combat on the front lines, in the back areas and in bases far removed from the front lines; and is the training adequate for the combat operations of today and tomorrow?\nAnswer: While I believe that women can perform the functions of combat soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen, to a degree of proficiency equal to their male counterparts, I am not optimistic about the chances of a successful implementation of this policy over an extended combat deployment.\nThere have been numerous reports that many, if not most, military male personnel are not confident they are able to fight effectively along side females, with or without sexual harassment; and many male servicemembers are reluctant to train females in their units in combat skills, including marksmanship.  These reports suggest that the negative effects of the lack of readiness and training could become problematic, and possibly a liability for the services, with the attendant risk for failure in combat.  This is not about gender, it's about readiness and the effectiveness of combat operations.\nMale recruits from the current generation will not be trained in some of the same tactics currently used in combat. These male recruits may be assigned to work closely with females in their units, sometimes one-on-one.  These male rec", "Education administers several programs that provide student loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( HEA) . It oversees billions of dollars in federal student loan programs. In fiscal year 2014, Education made approximately $47 billion in federal loans for undergraduate, graduate, and parent borrowers (Table 1). The primary recipient of federal student loans is approximately 17 million students, including those enrolled in traditional postsecondary education programs as well as individuals pursuing certificate programs or career and technical education. The Department of Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), the Agency for International Development, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) distribute additional billions in student loans on various federal student loan programs. Education also assists borrowers with outstanding federally owned student loans by offering income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs.  TABLE 1. AWARDING OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS, FISCAL YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2014 Year Awards Aid Amount FY 10 $46,183 million FY 11 $66,938 million FY 12 $107,841 million FY 14 $119,735 million Source: Education's data. Notably, loans totaling more than $100 billion are originated and held in Education's General Funds Account, commonly referred to as the central subsidy fund. For these programs, Education contracts with nine loan servicers to perform administrative and call center operations, collect monthly payments from borrowers, and disburse funding to participating institutions. As of March 2015, Education estimated that it pays approximately $1.3 billion each year in servicer contracts. Education has contracted these servicers since the 1970s to provide the required borrowing and repayment services. For the servicers participating in this contract for the first time, it is impossible to determine the quality of the services they provided Education's prior-year performance audit, conducted in June-July 2014, reported that two of the servicers did not have adequate internal controls to ensure the safeguarding of borrower information and that Education issued untimely payments to servicers, which may have increased the servicers' costs to operate.[1] The audit assessed Education's administrative controls. It did not assess how effective the servicers were in enabling the Education to effectively disburse federal student aid. It is important to note that Education's administrative controls for overseeing servicers are limited because those entities perform the bulk of the financial and operational management roles for their specific federal student loan programs.  Education also maintains a number of student loan forgiveness programs. These programs include two general forgiveness programs: the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program created from the College Cost Reduction and Affordability Act of 2007 and the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) program, and other programs focused on specific public service fields, including the Health Professions Loan (HPL) program, the Nursing Education Loan (NEL) program, and the Indian Health Professions Loan (IHPL) program. Each of these programs and the forgiveness eligibility criteria used by Education are discussed below. PSLF allows borrowers who meet various eligibility requirements, including the requirement that they have made a minimum of 120 on-time payments after a single, indefinite repayment period, to be eligible for total loan forgiveness after 10 years for PSLF. HPL, NEL, IHPL, and TEACH also allow borrowers who remain in good standing to be eligible for partial or total forgiveness of their federal student loans. In total, approximately 800,000 borrowers are participating in these loan repayment and forgiveness programs as of March 2015. The combined amount of these borrowers' outstanding balances was $836 billion at that time.  FINDING 1 EDUCATION IS NOT ACCURATELY REPORTING PSLF AND TEACH BORROWER INFORMATION  Prepared by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General. EARLY RESULTS FROM THE FIRST PSLF LOAN APPLICATION AND FORBES REPORT  After enactment of", "In November 2018, Delta filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) an antitrust immunity application asking DOT to allow Delta and Korean Air to engage in a deeper level of cooperation. Among other actions, Delta asked DOT to allow Delta and Korean Air to jointly set prices for some of their flights, with Delta requesting an exemption from the prohibition on collusive pricing set forth in section 41712 of title 49, United States Code. In February 2019, DOT denied Delta\u2019s application. Specifically, DOT determined that \u201cDelta and Korean Air have not established that the proposed cooperation would be in the public interest\u201d and accordingly, DOT prohibited Delta and Korean Air from engaging in the proposed level of cooperation. Delta subsequently filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging DOT\u2019s determination. Korean Air has intervened in Delta\u2019s suit. In a letter brief filed on March 26, 2019, Delta argued to the court that DOT\u2019s denial of Delta\u2019s antitrust immunity application resulted in an injury to Delta; specifically, by preventing Delta from engaging in price cooperation with Korean Air to reduce costs\u2014and by extension\u2014to improve its competitive position vis-a-vis competitors. According to Delta, the lower court should therefore allow Delta to pursue its antitrust immunity claims against DOT. Delta\u2019s amended complaint alleges four counts for judicial review of DOT\u2019s decision, under DOT\u2019s enabling statutes, the International Air Transportation Act (IATA) and the International Derivatives Transactions Act (IDTA), and under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In the IATA and IDTA cases, Delta contends that DOT\u2019s decision was contrary to law under the IATA and IDTA. In Delta\u2019s APA claim, Delta argues that DOT made its decision with an eye towards a particular result, i.e., denial of the antitrust immunity application without regard to the relevant regulation. The court has not yet decided whether to let Delta prosecute its antitrust immunity claims. DOT\u2019s public interest determination is only the first step of DOT\u2019s antitrust immunity review process. DOT has the exclusive jurisdiction to review each request for antitrust immunity. In its subsequent administrative adjudications, DOT must apply the IATA standard, under which DOT reviews whether it is against the public interest for an applicant and its foreign-based cooperating airline to use cooperative agreements that would result in the following: (a) substantial lessening of competition, (b) tending to create a monopoly, (c) increasing air transportation prices, or (d) increasing fares and charges for air transportation. After this IATA analysis is completed, DOT must apply the IDTA standard, which requires DOT to weigh the public interest benefits of the requested cooperation, including the public interest benefits of reduced costs to consumers and increased global competition, against any anti-competitive harm resulting from the requested cooperation, including potential harm to entry and global competition. DOT\u2019s adjudication of the public interest must include DOT\u2019s own analysis and consideration of various relevant factors, as well as an evaluation of the public\u2019s benefit, if any, for its decision, including whether the agreement would help consumers, and whether the agreement is likely to enhance U.S. competitiveness. DOT must state its findings on these factors in an order issued after 30 days\u2019 notice and opportunity for public comment. At the summary judgment stage, DOT must demonstrate that the applicant\u2019s cooperative agreement with an airline based in a foreign country is not against the public interest, and specifically that the agreement would not provide an unfair competitive advantage because of anticompetitive sharing of commercial information. If DOT issues a final order that is not supported by the record, those arguing that the DOT order was unsupported can introduce \u201cfurther evidence . . . to the extent that such evidence would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d On its own, DOT can review its decisions on remand. Specifically, DOT can address an order to \u201cshow cause why the order should not be reopened or revised.\u201d However, DOT\u2019s jurisdiction could be foreclosed if there is no material, new, and substantial evidence for DOT to consider. Under", "This report reviews the current natural gas storage landscape in the United States. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Obama administration called for a ban on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and imposed a six- month moratorium on certain types of deepwater drilling while the Department of the Interior re- examined the safety of all deepwater drilling and evaluated whether to revise the existing regulations. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred when the semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) Deepwater Horizon, which was drilling at the time for BP on a development known as the Macondo Prospect, exploded, leading to a massive 87-day oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Efforts to plug the flow of oil were unsuccessful and additional efforts to control the leak met with only partial success. As a result, the U.S. Government estimates that between 3.19 million and 4.0 million barrels of oil spilled into the water, making the Deepwater Horizon spill the largest offshore oil spill in American history. This volume was greater than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill until early 2014, when the Deepwater Horizon spill was surpassed by the 2010 Brazilian oil spill. The majority of this volume was released into the ocean by gas and oil escaping from the wellhead. In response to the disaster, the U.S. Government initiated the largest offshore oil spill cleanup in U.S. history. By May 21, 2010, BP reported roughly $350 million spent on cleanup efforts, while the overall cost of the spill is still under investigation and will probably grow to billions of dollars. Efforts to clean oil from the surface of the water and contain the flow of oil did not result in capping the well. On July 15, 2010, the temporary cap was replaced by a tighter fitting one. By the 12th of August, the oil flow through the riser was halted, and by the 19th, the wellhead was permanently sealed. Overall, 2.54 million barrels (134.3 million US gallons) of methanol-based dispersants were used in 3298 operational shots, including 120 shots that were used to attempt to kill the well after it blew up. It has been estimated that the use of these dispersants has prevented about 830,000 barrels (35,000,000 US gallons) of crude oil from reaching the surface. A report by the Flow Rate Technical Group, a team of scientists commissioned by the United States government, stated that there were 4.9 million barrels (210,000,000 US gallons) discharged during the 87 days the well was uncontrolled.\nThis page was last modified on 12 November 2018, at 11:47.", "DOT has not finalized any rulemaking on whether single-aisle aircraft should be required to have at least one wheelchair-accessible lavatory. TEXT: While the department had not yet determined a course of action to address the issue, it determined in June 2009 that it had time constraints in which it needed to issue a final rule to meet the requirements of the ACAA. As a result, DOT issued a final rule in September 2009 that, among other things, required single-aisle aircraft to have at least one wheelchair-accessible lavatory onboard that is at the front of the cabin, or at the rear, if the aircraft has fewer than 125 seats. The rule would require foreign airlines that fly to the U.S. to comply with the requirement within 1 year of the date the final rule became effective, or April 29, 2014. DOT stated, however, that even before the final rule took effect, the airlines had begun installing accessible lavatories on certain single-aisle aircraft, though on a voluntary basis. As a result, DOT is no longer considering this action.", "In the primary market, lenders originate mortgage loans to borrowers to purchase homes. To evaluate the creditworthiness of a potential borrower (called underwriting), the lender considers the borrower\u2019s credit scores and history, monthly debts including mortgage payments relative to income (debt-to-income ratio), and the amount of the mortgage loan relative to the home\u2019s value (loan-to-value ratio). Borrowers with strong credit histories typically receive prime mortgages with the most competitive interest rates and terms. Lenders generally require borrowers to purchase private mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio is higher than 80 percent. Some borrowers also may qualify for federal mortgage insurance programs (discussed later in this section). Mortgage lending creates certain risks: Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will default on the mortgage by failing to make timely payments. Prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers will pay off the principal of the loan before the mortgage term ends. Prepayment reduces or eliminates future interest payments. The lender must relend or reinvest the prepaid amount and may have only lower-interest options available for lending or investing the funds if interest rates have decreased. Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. For example, firms can be exposed to liquidity risk by funding longer-term asset purchases with shorter-term debt obligations. Lenders hold mortgages in their portfolios or sell them to institutions in the secondary market. Private institutions, primarily investment banks, may issue mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are backed by mortgages not federally insured and not conforming to the enterprises\u2019 requirements.\nThe federal government participates in the primary and secondary mortgage markets as both an actor and a regulator. In the primary market, the federal government operates mortgage guarantee and insurance programs to promote homeownership for certain types of borrowers. For example, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Housing Service, and HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing offer programs that insure mortgages against default or guarantee lenders payment of principal and interest. FHA-insured MBS consist entirely of mortgages insured by federal agencies and are issued by financial institutions HUD approves. The federal government also regulates the housing finance system through the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the enterprises; the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB); and other federal regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The federal government generally does not directly purchase mortgages from lenders in the primary market, although some programs, such as FHA, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee lenders payment of principal and interest if the borrower defaults.\n32 | The federal government, through its housing regulatory roles, influences the primary mortgage market by overseeing the enterprises and federal-government-created firms. In addition, federal guarantees and insurance programs can lower the costs (and, hence, the prices) of mortgage loans. The federal government also affects the mortgage process during the underwriting and closing of the loan and the sale of the mortgage on the secondary market. For example, the CFPB provides for private litigation against banks that underwrite mortgage loans that are \"abusive\" \u2014 that is, involve hidden costs or excessive fees, unclear or deceptive mortgage terms, or the use of a borrower's income for qualification purposes without verification that the borrower can repay the loan. The SEC influences the mortgage process by administering the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related provisions of federal law. The Act allows the SEC to regulate the securities markets, which include the secondary mortgage market.\n22 | Government agencies create, monitor, and enforce rules that affect the housing finance system in the U.S.. For example, federal regulators can:\n\u2022 regulate the activities of private firms creating mortgage assets that MBS investors may acquire on the secondary market;\n\u2022", "The Federal Reserve Board has expressed concern that asset prices at the time of retirement are excessive and that savings rates are too low for a comfortable retirement for individuals. Many people will also rely on Social Security (SS) to provide the bulk of their retirement income. Our results reinforce previous studies\u2019 and reports\u2019 findings that Americans\u2014more specifically middle class Americans\u2014are not saving enough to support themselves in retirement. This lack of saving is partly attributable to the fact that workers are relying on SS for future income.\nNevertheless, most surveys find that Americans believe they are saving enough for retirement and that they will not need the help of SS to retire. We find this belief to be unrealistic, as it is more and more likely based on our findings. It is important to note that SS was designed and originally funded in such a manner that each generation should be able to support itself out of its own work and taxes. This is not the case. SS will only be able to benefit the current workers if the Feds decide to raise the current Social Security taxable limit to $160,000; this amount is over double the number we used in our calculation of SS benefits.\nRetirement security is becoming an increasing problem and a major concern as well as the lack of retirement savings and assets among Americans.", "FFRDCs arose from partnerships between the federal government and academic researchers and scientists during World War II. These partnerships were later restructured into federal research centers to retain scientists and became known as FFRDCs by the mid-1960s. Since that time, FFRDCs have continued to perform tasks such as technical studies and analyses, research and development, and systems engineering on behalf of federal agencies, such as DOD.

Introduction, (a) In October 2003, Executive Order 13287, entitled \u201cPreserve America,\u201d established a program and process for the preservation of cultural resources owned by the Federal government. The Executive Order provides that each federal agency is required to coordinate and support the preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of the cultural resources under their custody or control in a manner that is consistent with the agency\u2019s mission and to take specific actions to accomplish these purposes. Furthermore, the Executive Order also directs that each Federal agency head will appoint an officer or officers to serve as the coordinator for the preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of cultural resources owned or controlled by the Federal Government. The following policy, as established by this Director\u2019s Memorandum, will fulfill the goals of Executive Order 13287.\n(b) The National Park Service Act provides that, \u201cfor the general benefit of mankind,\u201d the National Park Service (NPS) is authorized to \u201cpromote and regulate the use of the ... historical and other national park resources...\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 and 9; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.4(a).\nAs a federal agency, the NPS\u2019s preservation responsibilities are set forth by the National Historic Preservation Act (herein, \u201cNHPA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d) (16 U.S.C. 470a et seq.) and the NPS\u2019s regulations codified at 36 C.F.R. Part 800. In particular, the NPS must assure and review the preservation and maintenance of historic properties on NPS lands, including those under development as units of the National Park System. Specifically, under Section 110 of the NHPA, the NPS has the obligation to \u201cadvance the preservation, maintenance, and use of...historic properties by private parties and public and quasi-public entities.\u201d 16 U.S.C. 471(i).\nThe NPS National Register of Historic Places Program (herein, \u201cNPS\u201d or \u201cthe Program\u201d) is charged by Section 1 to identify and evaluate historic properties of all types, including historic districts, throughout the country and maintain a detailed inventory of these properties. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470a-4. Under the auspices of this Program, NPS develops and manages an annual program of work consisting of individual historic property projects, which are prepared through a federal - state partnership known as a state and territory historic preservation plan, as codified in 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.1. Under Section 2, for each historic property project identified and entered into a project nomination database, the NPS must enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the SHPO or ACHP representative from the state or tribe over the property and, in coordination with that representative, identify appropriate preservation, conservation, and management objectives for that property. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470a-3. The NPS is then responsible for meeting these objectives, while the SHPO or ACHP representatives coordinate the work with the local preservation community. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470a-5.

In 2018, Congress appropriated $5.8 billion for three rental assistance programs. The rental assistance programs can be categorized in two main groups: rental assistance programs that provide assistance directly to households and programs that target developers to build rental properties and provide assistance to households. The difference between the two categories of programs reflects more of a difference in policy intent than a difference in the mechanisms used to provide assistance. The largest rental assistance program, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, is an example of a program that provides assistance directly to households and has grown in its size each year, as shown in table 1. The Housing Choice Voucher program uses housing vouchers to assist households in paying their rent, and in fiscal year 2007 the program provided approximately 3 million households an average of $864 in rental assistance per month. There are other federal programs that directly provide renters with assistance by subsidizing the rent of a specific household. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is an example of a program designed to provide assistance to low-income households, rather than incentives for the construction of new rental properties with below-market rents. These programs are operated by public housing agencies (PHAs) that select participants from a waiting list. In a few cases, assistance is provided to a defined group of households. The PHAs can vary in who they serve and the amounts of funds received to pay for the rental assistance. For example, one PHA could operate its rental assistance program, which serves a specific group of households, in a different manner than another PHA serving a different group of households. The Section 811 Program is not an example of these three categories of programs because it directs funds to PHAs, with the funds then being used to provide long term rental assistance in permanent housing that is integrated in the community and accessible for people with disabilities. The federal government also assists private developers by providing various forms of public assistance. One example of using public assistance to induce private developers is through project-based rental assistance. With this assistance, the government provides subsidies directly to private developers in return for the government\u2019s ability to leverage this rental assistance for lower rents to low-income persons. This type of program is designed to provide rental assistance and incentives for the construction of rental properties with below-market rents. Two examples, the Public Housing Capital Fund and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, are a major part of the housing and development incentive package, but the government provides several other types of programs that aid private developers. These programs are designed to provide incentives for the development of rental properties with below-market rents for assisted households. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is an example of this type of program for assisting construction because an apartment developer uses tax credits to build affordable housing and rents it to eligible tenants at below-market rates. The other categories of federal funding for rental assistance are limited to project-based rental assistance. We previously reported that the share of households, including the elderly and families, that are assisted through project-based rental assistance has substantially decreased since the mid-1970s (see fig. 4), from more than 20 percent in 1977 to less than 5 percent in 2009, although there was a slight uptick between 2010 and 2016 (see fig. 5). These programs target rental properties and provide rental assistance on a unit-specific rather than unit-based basis. Rental properties receive project-based rental assistance based on the rents they charge eligible tenants. There are also projectbased rental assistance vouchers that are unit-specific vouchers, where households in a specific unit receive rental assistance on a per-unit basis within that unit. The most recent estimate of the number of rental assistance projects is from 2014, which found that only 5.1 percent of rents were project-based rental assistance, meaning 94.9 percent of the funds were provided through vouchers (see table 4). This means that when the estimated 128,100 multifamily properties were analyzed, there were 1,250 multifamily housing projects providing assistance through vouchers and 8,550 projects providing assistance through project-based rental", "CERCLA (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) established the Superfund program to clean up contaminated sites to protect human health and the environment from the effects of hazardous substances. A site qualifies for remedial action when there is:  \"no reasonable likelihood that the hazardous substance release will cause substantial harm\" to human health and the environment, the hazardous substance release is of sufficient volume to require a remedial action, and the hazardous substance release has a potential for adverse effect to human health and the environment. Under the statutory provisions related to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (the National Contingency Plan, or NCP), EPA generally acts as the lead Federal agency. Removing contaminants is the most common method of remedial action, where the process involves:  collection of soil and/or water,  separation of the contaminants through chemical processes and/or disposal to landfill, and  safe use of the contaminated soil or water or disposal to a landfill. A less common method of remedial action is to rebuild contaminated soil through regrading or reintroducing soil horizons. There are also inactive monitoring and maintenance where the long-term solutions are not available. Under the NCP, EPA has developed specific regulations and guidance that apply to federal Superfund sites. This includes:  requiring site owners to conduct all appropriate inquiries regarding possible releases of hazardous substances or conducting these steps on EPA's behalf,  defining EPA's scope of involvement in cleanups, such as requiring that parties with interests in potentially contaminated sites provide to EPA their site-characterization information, obtaining and maintaining access to property, coordinating site cleanups, or requiring parties who are conducting releases over a long period of time or threaten the public health and/or welfare to undertake cleanup steps, and  requiring parties to cleanups to conduct operations in a manner that protects the environment and public health from contaminants in air, soil, surface water, or groundwater. CERCLA also authorizes the President to issue regulations regarding the liability, compliance, and remedial actions for response to the release of hazardous substances. EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management enforces CERCLA compliance, and EPA's Office of Emergency Management oversees EPA's incident-response activities.

In addition, the Army is taking actions to improve its oversight of the contract\u2019s performance. Specifically, it has developed a marketing and advertising playbook that identifies the Army\u2019s mission and priorities, it is finalizing work rules for the media buying agency that are designed to ensure it meets the Army\u2019s requirements, it is drafting policy documents to guide the agency in its advertising strategy development, and it is drafting performance metrics and performance standards to guide its assessment of the agency\u2019s performance. The Army also is assessing its awareness and recruiting marketing plan to determine what, if anything, is needed to strengthen its plan and then will implement that plan once the Army approves it. (See figure below.)  AAA recommended that the Army direct the primary advertising agency to relocate its digital media team to close the gap between the number of advertising professionals and the volume and importance of the Army\u2019s digital media work.  AM NOTE:   AAA has concluded that the Army has made progress in executing the recommendations outlined above, but more work needs to be completed to achieve our desired results.  A. Army established a governance structure  a. Work rules to the primary media buying agency, drafted work rules to be implemented through the oversight governance structure; and drafted new performance work statements for the primary media buying agency and developed performance standards (for e.g., how much traffic must go to an Army recruiting website, how many views must a video generate, etc.) AAA 4  b. In-person and online training for the primary media buying agency; and held a media summit between the primary and supporting media buying agencies and the Army Recruiting Command for senior Army and agency officials to collaborate on the development of the Army\u2019s advertising strategy.  c. Playbook for the primary media buying agency to identify how to achieve the Army\u2019s advertising strategy; and created a marketing and advertising playbook to provide guidance to the oversight governance structure for steering the Army\u2019s efforts to improve overall recruiting.  B. Army taking actions:    a) Drafting policy documents; held workshops for senior officials to formulate policy guidance documents to assist the primary media buying agency in executing the advertising strategy.  These documents can be applied to the use of other advertising agencies.    b) Finalizing playbook and performance; the primary media buying agency and the oversight governance structure are working to finalize the policy guidance mentioned in our previous recommendations.    c) Drafting performance metric and performance standard, AAA recommended the Army develop performance metric and performance standard for the Agency to help them in achieving Army objectives.

Given the limited budget resources available to GAO, there is a growing need to make efficient use of federal dollars by developing evidence-based knowledge on the latest developments on the subjects of study and the policy needs and options to address technological challenges. It is crucial that technical information presented in GAO reports meets specific policy challenges and provides sound, unbiased, balanced, and reliable information to policy-makers. A central part of GAO\u2019s role is to provide the public with information on which to base informed judgments. GAO is often asked by decision-makers in Congress about emerging technologies that could affect public welfare. To address emerging topics, GAO may conduct a technology assessment whereby GAO teams evaluate and analyze the state of the art in a particular technology or emerging technology development and/or present possible future options to address challenges in this area. Technology assessments are non-routine reports, conducted to assist in understanding and addressing the implications of new technology and its associated processes, and may or may not result in legislation and/or future programs. This report presents what the body of knowledge has to say about the process of technology assessment design that addresses the policy context and stakeholders\u2019 needs in a timely and balanced way, and is based on the best available information. While it is necessary to be realistic about the time needed to conduct sound TAs, and while the design process should be inclusive of stakeholders and be iterative, it is possible to conduct many TAs in 2 to 8 weeks. In addition to improving timeliness, inclusive approaches to planning and executing TAs may produce more useful information. GAO teams conduct a technology assessment to understand trends and issues, to explore future possibilities and potential options, and to provide information to make better policy decisions, by answering the question, \u201cHow might a new technology be utilized to address challenges?\u201d For example, GAO has engaged with stakeholders to conduct TAs to learn whether specific innovative technologies are likely to make a difference for public or private sector needs and how to make use of these new developments to best meet the needs of the public. GAO has examined a variety of technologies, including drones with sensors, wearable biosensors with health information for individual management and potential implications for federal health care policy, emerging genomics technology, next generation DNA sequencing, new nanotechnology for water treatment, and advanced manufacturing technology, among others. When GAO designs a TA, it is important for the GAO team to consider how the results are anticipated to be used by stakeholders and by the GAO Congressional clients and to design an appropriate approach that will ensure that the resulting evidence and conclusions are independent and credible. However, it is always necessary for GAO to work within project-specific time and resource constraints. It can be helpful to begin thinking early about how to incorporate the views of various stakeholder groups into a TA design. For example, early engagement can help to anticipate or prepare for roadblocks that arise and may lead to delays throughout the project. When developing a design, it is helpful to balance the need to work within time and resource constraints with anticipated stakeholder needs and the GAO requirement to produce independent, objective, credible, and defensible results. This is not an easy task and may be even more challenging as the scope of the design changes. While stakeholder engagement is important to conduct sound TAs, GAO\u2019s commitment is to provide policy-makers with evidence-based knowledge on current developments relevant to current and emerging technologies that are intended to serve as a basis for making informed decisions, not simply to inform a policy discussion.  QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER: \u2022 Does this design align with the objectives of the request? \u2022 Does this design align with the stakeholder communities and anticipated users of the resulting TA? \u2022 Does this design align with the stated timeframe? \u2022 Is this design approach likely to result in a thorough and objective GAO TA report or product? \u2022 Will any specialist or advisory stakeholder groups be critical to the success of the TA? If so, what is the anticipated timeframe to conduct outreach to these groups? \u2022 Are there opportunities for enhanced stakeholder involvement and engagement in the TA process with specific questions/themes for discussion? \u2022 Does the design address the full policy context and stakeholder needs? \u2022 Is the proposed TA feasible and will it generate answers that will", "Eligibility criteria for disability designations under IDEA. \uf041 \uf0d7 Text \u00a9iStockphoto.com/cynthiaisacat, modified. 2122873 \u00a9 istockphoto.com/zvonimir535, modified. \uf041 \uf0d7", "The Coast Guard\u2019s Specialized Forces are 11 statutory missions, coastal search and rescue, Drug 2010, 11 statutory missions, such as homeland security and non- homeland security missions.

School districts can typically use this funding for a wide range of purposes, including school maintenance and operations. Maintenance may include routine replacement of lighting, filters, or building system parts, as well as emergency repairs to building systems. According to Education, maintenance and operations may also cover care and upkeep of grounds and equipment, vehicles (other than student transportation), and security. When school districts need to construct, renovate, replace Sources: Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2016 and Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Education, OIG-00A-00-0052.\nHVAC system needed. However, none of the 55 schools we visited had reported issues with their roofs. Among the other 46 schools we visited, only 13 had reported issues with interior lighting, and 15 reported other issues. Our survey of the 89 school districts we visited also shows that about a quarter (24 percent) need to replace or renovate their schools\u2019 HVAC systems. Although we did not review the condition of all HVAC systems in these 89 districts, our findings are similar to our previous HVAC-focused audit reports, in which we found about 25 percent of districts needed to update or replace HVAC systems in at least 30 percent of their schools. The remaining 11 percent of the districts we visited had identified that their schools needed to replace or renovate at least two other building systems. The results varied depending on the school district\u2019s needs, but 4 percent of the school districts we visited reported an overall need to replace or renovate more than half their schools\u2019 building systems and 9 percent said they needed to renovate or replace at least 30 percent of their schools\u2019 systems. These findings are likely influenced by the size of the districts. Medium-sized districts, typically having about 25,000 to 99,999 students, were more likely to indicate that they needed to replace or renovate at least one building system, more likely to indicate that they needed to replace or renovate at least two building systems, and more likely to indicate that they needed to replace or renovate two or more building systems than smaller or larger districts. Further, our survey of 89 school districts shows that about a quarter (29 percent) of medium-sized school districts were likely to report at least one building system in need of replacement or renovation in about half their schools. Further, among medium-sized districts, 34 percent were likely to report at least two building systems in need of replacement or renovation in at least 30 percent of their schools. Further, among districts that we visited, about 60 percent reported at least one building system in need of replacement or renovation in 42 to 74 percent of their schools. We also conducted a review of school inspection data reported to state education agencies in California, Florida, Missouri, and Texas. In these states, school districts are generally required to conduct annual facility inspections, and the information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying systems that might need improvements or replacements. Education encouraged states to make the school inspection data public. Our reviews indicate a large number of districts that had reported issues with building systems in at least 43 to 97 percent (medium and large districts) and 42 to 94 percent (small to large districts) of their schools. The findings among states varied, but the results tended to be similar to the nationwide survey results, indicating that, in California, Florida, and Texas, at least a quarter of the districts we surveyed reported building systems in their school needing replacement or renovation. The districts we surveyed in Missouri did not report a clear need to replace or renovate building systems in most of their schools\u2019 facilities. For example, among the 16 districts in Missouri we surveyed for our report, one identified 92 percent of its school facilities as needing upgrades and 72 percent of the Missouri districts had reported three or more HVAC problems in their schools over the previous five-year period. However, the districts tended to have smaller student populations, ranging from 633 to 1,692 students. Because a quarter of districts nationwide indicated that they needed to replace or renovate at least 30 percent of their schools\u2019 HVAC systems, our findings in Missouri might not be representative of all districts in the state. Our survey of 877 school districts also found that two-thirds", "CBP reports that there is little difference in the extent of security between the northern and southern borders, but that the two borders also benefit from different resources. As of March 2008, CBP reported having 20,180 Border Patrol agents working at the eight land borders in the United States, including 1,191 agents at the Northern Border. Border Patrol reported that it was using 17,000 Remote Video Surveillance Systems at the borders and 1,000 unattended ground sensors. In addition, Border Patrol is planning to increase its number of agents along the Northern Border.\nAs of June 2008, AMO reported owning 164 vessels and having 837 personnel located at eight bases, eight Air Stations, and one Marine Activity Station, including the Great Lakes Air Station and Houlton Air and Marine Base in northern states. AMO also reported owning 95 aircraft, two of which are currently in the process of being acquired. AMO reported spending about $323.5 million on Air and Marine Operations (AMO) during FY 2007, including $113.1 million from the Department of Homeland Security, $146.2 million from the Department of Defense, and $64. 2 million from other sources. Additionally, as of June 2008, AMO reported working with the U.S. Coast Guard on joint border security patrols and enforcement operations in the 1,500 miles of the coasts of Washington, California, Texas, and Florida. AMO uses a variety of surveillance equipment and is planning to expand its number of patrol vessels, aircraft, and agents.\nIn 2008, DHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported on the security of CBP Border Patrol stations and bases. DHS noted that border agents generally are not given information about the presence of contraband in their area; rather, field managers choose which areas to focus on based on intelligence\u2014that is, which areas to dedicate to securing\u2014and the types of contraband agents should look for. DHS also reported that its Border Security Operations Center uses a system called eAPIS, which allows officials to see on a map contraband seizures at U.S. land borders. DHS further reported that eAPIS also includes data from CBP\u2019s Office of Intelligence, which reports the presence of cross-border drug smuggling routes, to help CBP allocate patrol resources and help CBP plan operations in specific areas. Other border security issues are discussed in this document, starting with physical security.\nBackground Physical security is the condition or state to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access to people, buildings, networks, computers, facilities, systems, and information.\nThrough the Northern Border Counternarcotics Initiative, the Secretary of Homeland Security may, under certain limited circumstances, temporarily modify or exempt border crossings or designated ports of entry from certain security requirements. Security at land border crossings involves multiple entities, including those involved in immigration and customs processing (such as INS inspectors and CBP officers), those performing transportation and security functions (such as the U.S. Border Patrol, the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies), and the public. In fact, CBP estimates that roughly 40 percent of the daily traffic at U.S. land borders consists of people who are not traveling for commercial purposes but rather for recreation and leisure, work, and family reasons. In 2008, GAO reported on certain aspects of physical security at northern border land ports of entry. It noted that CBP has developed a plan to ensure that ports of entry are physically secure, but that the plan has not yet been fully implemented. For example, in 2007, CBP\u2019s Office of Infrastructure and Funding Operations had only completed physical security assessments for 32 of the 205 POEs along the Northern Border and had not yet conducted assessments for the other 173\u2014although CBP\u2019s most recent plan, referred to as PER-2007, calls for assessments at all 205 POEs.\nPerforming security assessments is a first step in physical security at the border. The security assessments are to include identification and classification of potential threats and vulnerabilities at each POE, based on data, interviews of key informants, and on-site observations. For example, GAO noted", "THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, ITS FUNDING SOURCES, AND HOW THE TRANSFER OF COSTS HERO PROGRAM AND VOIDS POINTS FUNCTION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT-FUNDED DISASTER RECOVERY SYSTEM\nEssays on the Public Assistance Programs\nThe Public Assistance (PA) Program is a FEMA program \u201cthat provides Federal funds to State, tribal and local governments, and certain types of private nonprofit organizations, for the expenses incurred responding to and recovering from certain emergencies or disasters declared by the President\u201d (FEMA 1994).\nThe PA Program falls under FEMA\u2019s mission to reduce loss of life and property due to disasters. Public Assistance provides the Federal government an effective vehicle for providing disaster assistance to State and local governments and to qualified types of private non-profit organizations through funding of response costs, reimbursements for emergency work, and reimbursements of certain costs of permanent repairs to the damaged infrastructure and facilities of State, tribal and local government and private non-profit organizations. This assistance is provided after a Presidential disaster declaration is made for those specific purposes under the Stafford Act (Section 428).\nEssays on The Public Assistance\nThe Public Assistance program was designed to provide eligible substate or non-profit organizations with a way to recover expenses while also helping to limit the use of federal tax dollars in covering expenses. To date, the total obligations in the Public Assistance program are over $70 billion (FEMA 2012) and the total obligations to date in Georgia alone are over $990 million. The Public Assistance program is used to help provide a method for assistance in a time of need while protecting the taxpayer from unreasonable spending.\nPublic Assistance is broken down into three categories:\nCategory A \u2013 \u201c\u2026activities performed by State and local governments and all other governmental entities when a declared disaster occurred and (1) the performance of those activities is eligible for FEMA funding or (2) the eligible activities are necessary to save lives and protect public health, safety, or property and are beyond the response capabilities available in the disaster area.\u201d (FEMA 2012, G.1) These activities may include, but are not limited to, search and rescue, tree removal, the protection of infrastructure from any hazard or protecting and supporting evacuees.\nCategory B \u2013 \u201c\u2026the restoration of essential governmental services that are not covered by category A as a direct result of a disaster (Category A activities are not considered essential governmental services).\u201d (FEMA 2012, G.1) These expenses include, but are not limited to, the transportation of government employees and officials, the use of rented premises for operating the governments services, and expenses relating to the handling of hazardous debris within a government facility.\nCategory C \u2013 \u201c\u2026activities not eligible for funding under category A or B but that relate to the restoration, reconstruction, replacement, or repair of facilities damaged or destroyed by the disaster when the activities are supported with an appropriate cost estimate.\u201d (FEMA 2012, G.1) A cost estimate may be \u201c\u2026an appraisal, an estimate of the cost of performing a given function through on-site visits, written reports or discussions, engineering or architectural estimates, or any other method acceptable to FEMA.\u201d (FEMA 2012, G.2) These expenses include, but are not limited to, \u201c\u2026the following activities eligible for Public Assistance: the installation of temporary facilities, the restoration of essential utility facilities, the repair of damaged roads, debris removal, and direct costs of contracts\u2026\u201d (FEMA 1994) The repair, restoration, and reconstruction of government buildings and publicly-owned facilities may also be eligible for funding in this category.\nWhile the Public Assistance program itself is the same between the two states, the procedures are not only different but also governed by different rules and regulations. As with all federal aid programs, however, even while the states are free to make their own decisions, the federal rules and procedures have their basis in the law\u2014the Stafford Act. Even so, the law itself is silent as to the process by which states apply for federal disaster assistance (Rozell 2007). While the states can work within the law to meet their", "At the federal level, CMS, within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for overseeing the design and operation of states\u2019 Medicaid programs, and states administer their respective Medicaid programs\u2019 day-to-day operations. As a comprehensive health benefit program for vulnerable populations, each state Medicaid program, by law, must cover certain categories of individuals and provide a broad array of benefits. Within these requirements, however, states have significant flexibility to design and implement their programs, resulting in more than 50 distinct state-based programs. These variations in design have implications for program eligibility and services offered, as well as for how expenditures are reported and services delivered. In administering their own programs, states may provide Medicaid services under a fee-for-service delivery model or a managed care service delivery model. Under a fee-for-service model, states make payments directly to providers for services provided, and the federal government generally matches state expenditures on the basis of a statutory formula. Under a managed care model, states pay MCOs a capitation payment, which is a fixed periodic payment per beneficiary enrolled in an MCO\u2014typically, per member per month. MCOs pay health care providers for the services delivered to enrollees. In contrast, ACOs are organizations of health care providers and suppliers that come together voluntarily to provide coordinated care to patients with the goal of reducing spending while improving quality. States vary in terms of the types of managed care arrangements used, the populations enrolled, and the parts of the state covered by managed care. We previously reported that a small share of beneficiaries in each state collectively accounted for almost half of the total Medicaid spending. Examining beneficiaries who were enrolled only in Medicaid, we also found that while beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid constituted about 15 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in 2005, they accounted for about 38 percent of Medicaid spending. Care management programs can be used as efforts to manage the cost and quality of health care services delivered to high-expenditure Medicaid populations, with the aim of improving outcomes and achieving cost savings. We focused on care management programs and initiatives as a means of coordinating care for high-risk beneficiaries or individuals in need of a wide spectrum of health care services or individuals with multiple chronic conditions. Care management programs or initiatives aim to mitigate the complications of multi-drug therapy for dual-eligible beneficiaries, for example, by working with both the MCO and prescribers; managing utilization by providing the most current and clinically appropriate information and tools for physicians and other medical professionals treating individuals with multiple and varying conditions; and developing plans that focus on patient-related behaviors, such as engaging patients to develop and follow treatment plans.\nDownload Fee-For-Service Medicaid Beneficiaries And Managed-Care Plan Enrollees: Spending Patterns Differently Across Selected States And Plans.", "VA\u2019s mission is to serve America\u2019s veteras, and on of the way it does so is by providing veterans with medical services. To help meet the health care needs of veterans, VHA is planning ate aote new major medical projects between 2020 and 2024. Activation is one of the key steps that must occur before veterans can access care at these facilities.

The 2015 Public Transit Agency Safety data is gathered through DOT Form F 4827. These survey results were used by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and its partners to identify the safety challenges that public transit agencies face and to provide the agencies with the resources needed to improve their practices. Furthermore, Safety Management System (SMS) Guidance has been developed and released to public transit agencies to assist them in creating, maintaining, communicating, and continually improving safety in the agencies\u2019 operations and in other workplaces owned and controlled by the agencies. These SMS guidance documents for public transit agencies outline key steps for implementing safety management systems. The Public Transportation Safety Improvement Act of 2015 Public Law 114-94, November 25, 2015 requires all public transportation agencies with operations and capital projects of more than 50 million dollars in Federal funds to implement a SMS (public law 114-94, section 2012). An SMS is a comprehensive and systematic approach to managing safety on a day-to-day basis. The SMS is based on a continuing process, integrated into the existing agency management and business system, for assessing levels of safety risk in the operations of commercial and commuter bus agencies, light rail operators and ferry operators. A risk-based decision-making process is used to prioritize safety problems based on severity, to control those risks that present the greatest safety issues (risk management). The SMS requires agencies to take steps to address the safety risks identified. FTA has worked in partnership with industry stakeholders to provide Public transportation safety certification programs to assist public transportation systems with the implementation of SMS. As noted in FTA's Public Transportation Safety Program Guide, FTA will use information collected through the selfassessment to determine agency eligibility for FTA Operating Assistance and Passenger Ferry program funds.", "Medicare pays physicians and other health care professionals for evaluating beneficiaries, developing treatment plans, prescribing medicine, or providing other treatment services. Physicians and other health care professionals bill Medicare for services provided to beneficiaries under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). The PFS is divided into payment codes known as Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes. E/M codes provide payment for the work performed in medical encounters with beneficiaries. These encounters are categorized into five levels of service, based on the amount of time and complexity of care. Each level of service has associated fees determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These codes are established and developed by a non-governmental AMA Physician Payment Update Committee (PPUCC), with support from CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). CMS pays physicians and other professionals based on the codes developed by the AMA PPUCC and does not alter any code values. Based on the time spent performing the service and the complexity of the service, each code is given a value.  CMS has acknowledged that there have been requests from groups such as the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative and the Alliance of Specialty Medical Professionals to review and adjust E/M codes to account for increased care coordination and the increased time spent on care planning outside of the office setting. CMS has also acknowledged that the AMA has recently requested that CMS work in partnership with the AMA to develop a fee schedule for care coordination and care planning between beneficiaries and their primary care physicians. In addition, CMS announced that they have recently released an Advanced Alternative Payment Model (Advance APM) called the Primary Care First Initiative. The Primary Care First Initiative focuses on the primary care setting in response to current payment methodology which may hinder the ability for physicians to practice in that specific setting. In addition, CMS also announced that it will be releasing an Alternative Payment Model (APM) Innovation Center Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) seeking Advanced APM ideas, which have the potential for beneficiaries to receive more primary care and have lower costs over time. The Medicare APM and primary care payment reforms seek to address the fact that the current physician fee schedule does not provide enough support to physicians working in primary care while also providing some physicians with incentives to participate in APMs.  HHS OIG RECOMMENDATIONS:  The OIG recommends that (1) CMS conduct a review of all current E/M codes to identify instances where E/M codes may not fully reimburse primary care physicians for their time spent providing service to beneficiaries; and (2) CMS develops new billing codes for care coordination that may provide additional payment rates to physicians that are not being reimbursed by current E/M codes.  CMS RESPONSE:  OIG SUPPORT:  This is HHS OIG's only response to the OIG recommendations.", "TEXT: In late September 2017, Equifax, one of the 3 largest national CRAs, publicly announced that it had been the victim of a data breach that may have compromised the personally identifiable information of at least 145.5 million US consumers. According to information that Equifax provided to its customers, the breach was discovered on the evening of July 29, 2017, by system administrators for the company. The breach, which occurred over the course of several weeks, gave an unauthorized third party access to the databases that Equifax used to compile and maintain files on US consumers. These databases contained files on approximately 800 million consumers and roughly 10 percent of global credit files. As a result of the breach, Equifax has been subject to a variety of investigations by, among others, FTC, numerous state attorneys general, and the US House Financial Services Committee (Committee). In early January 2018, the Committee\u2019s majority and minority staffs of the Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade released a staff discussion draft of a bill to amend various US banking statutes that, among other things, would allow for bank regulators to impose civil money penalties for data breaches involving banks and their thirdparty vendors. FDIC\u2019s Quarterly Banking Profile, released in June 2018, shows that cyberattacks represented 78 percent of all reported and substantiated breaches at FDIC-supervised institutions from 2007 through the 1st quarter of 2018.", "I am an expert at summarization.

According to DOD\u2019s Automatic Enrollment Program website: Servicemembers will be enrolled into TSP unless they opt-out or do not respond. However, after enrollment, it is the servicemember\u2019s responsibility to understand the enrollment process and the different components of the Thrift Savings Plan. DOD guidance emphasizes that servicemembers, regardless of age, should be encouraged to save early and often. However, servicemembers who do not read the enrollment brochure about TSP could easily think that enrolling in TSP is mandatory and believe they have no choice. In March 2018, an Army chief warrant officer at the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) was given his initial BRS enrollment brochure to share with his subordinates. However, his subordinates had no control over when they were going to join the Army. The chief warrant officer said that he believes if his subordinates read the brochure before joining the Army, they might feel they are forced to invest 5 percent of their pay in TSP. In response, DOD stated that the automatic enrollment process emphasizes the optional nature of TSP enrollment, allowing service members to opt-in or opt-out of the program. TSP enrollment is not mandatory and new enrollees are given a minimum 60-day period of \u201cfree look\u201d to cancel their enrollments. DOD agreed it is reasonable to assume that new entrants who are assigned to the U.S Army, the U.S. Navy, or the U.S. Air Force and enrolled in automatic enrollment, have no control over the timing of their enrollment, and that they were given no notification prior to entering military service that they could be automatically enrolled in TSP. DOD also agreed that the automatic enrollment criteria could lead service members to believe they are forced to join the plan, unless they opt-out of automatic enrollment; however, the guidance also emphasizes the optional nature of TSP enrollment, allowing service members to opt-in or opt-out of the program. Since April 2010, DOD has required service members within one year prior to retirement or separation from the service to attend a financial readiness brief, whether they are eligible for retirement or not. The briefing discusses the many different military and federal retirement systems such as the legacy retirement system and the CRSC. However, DOD has not informed military servicemembers in the active-duty component who were automatically enrolled in BRS of the following options: 3 \u2022 Retirees with a DB benefit under the legacy retirement system can choose to waive this benefit if they are eligible for a CRSC. \u2022 Upon retirement from the armed forces, eligible veterans can receive a CRSC of basic pay only. \u2022 Any retiree, regardless of the type of retirement benefit received, can opt-in or opt-out of TSP at any time. \u2022 At the CRSC eligibility age, which could be before or after retirement or separation, retirees can receive a CRSC of 40 percent basic pay for an unlimited period of time or receive the reduced amount of CRSC of 25 percent basic pay. \u2022 In addition, retirees can receive either a full-time annuity of 50 or 40 percent basic pay if they serve more than 20 years, while receiving CRSC when they are under age 60 until their FRA. \u2022 Veterans over 60 and over their FRA can elect to receive CRSC of 30 percent basic pay until their death. \u2022 All military retirees are also required to be enrolled in the Federal Employees\u2019 Health Benefits (FEHB) program. \u2022 Any retiree can receive TSP contributions from the military retirement deductions for the same 60-day \u201cfree look\u201d to opt-out as those who have joined TSP, but will receive a reduced retirement annuity if they opt-out. \u2022 Additionally, as servicemembers begin to transition out of the service and begin to consider an early retirement, they can apply for the Temporary Early Retirement Duty Pay (TERDUP) program, which is a form of early retirement. The TERDUP program gives premium pay to service members who meet certain age and service requirements and", "\u2022\tIn the United States, authority to regulate elections is shared among federal, state, and local officials. \u2022\t10,300 local election jurisdictions manage the administration of elections in the United States. \u2022\tLocal election officials register eligible voters, open and close polling locations, and count ballots. \u2022\tEquipment failures and human errors are examples of unintentional threats to the elections infrastructure. \u2022\tCriminal groups, hackers, disgruntled employees, foreign nations, and terrorists are examples of various types of threat actors that can threaten elections\u2019 infrastructure. \u2022\tCyber threats may exploit weaknesses in an organization\u2019s computers or networks. \u2022\tSocial media may be used to disseminate false information that may target election officials, voters, or the general public.

The Health Center Program, authorized in Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, is administered by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care and makes grants\u2014known as Section 330 grants\u2014to four types of health centers that primarily serve low-income populations: \u2022  Community health centers. These health centers serve the general population with limited access to health care. They are required to provide primary health services to all residents who reside in the center's service area. More than three-quarters of health centers are community health centers. \u2022  Health centers for the homeless. These health centers provide primary care services to individuals who lack permanent housing or live in temporary facilities or transitional housing. These centers are required to provide substance abuse services and supportive services targeted to the homeless population. \u2022  Health centers for residents of public housing. These health centers provide primary care to residents of public housing and individuals living in areas immediately accessible to public housing. \u2022  Migrant health centers. These health centers provide primary care to migratory agricultural workers (individuals whose principal employment is in agriculture and who establish temporary residences for work purposes) and seasonal agricultural workers (individuals whose principal employment is in agriculture on a seasonal basis but do not migrate for the work). HRSA's Section 330 grants are funded by a combination of discretionary appropriations and, since 2011, mandatory appropriations provided from the Contraception and Infertility Mandate. From fiscal years 2010 through 2017, total funding appropriated for Section 330 awards in fiscal year 2017\u2014or about $3.5 billion\u2014was funded by the CHCF. HRSA officials also told us that the total amount of CHCF appropriations may differ from the total amount of awards funded because, for example, appropriations may be (1) used for administrative costs, (2) reduced because of sequestration, or (3) carried over between fiscal years. Health centers are required to provide comprehensive primary health services, including preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency health services. (See table 1.) All services that health centers provide must be available to patients at the center regardless of patient payment source or ability to pay and to be governed by a community board of which at least 51 percent of the members are patients of the health center. HRSA determines whether health center grantees meet these and other health center program requirements when making award determinations. According to HRSA officials, an assessment of health center program services and operations and the health center program's internal control is also required before an award determination is made. HRSA officials stated that these assessments may be conducted as part of site visits\u2014 which are unannounced on-site reviews\u2014conducted by health center programs staff. Further clarifying the health center program, GAO's analysis shows that (1) total revenue received by health centers nationwide more than doubled from calendar years 2010 through 2017, (2) the types of sites utilized by health centers have not changed significantly over the same time period, (3) most health centers received funding from both mandatory and discretionary sources, (4) mandatory funding for community health centers grew the most of all other types of health centers during the same time period, and (5) health centers were required to submit annual reports to HRSA from which GAO analyzed health center performance. In addition, in order to be awarded grants under the health center program, according to HRSA officials, health centers must attest to their ability to meet health center program requirements at the time the award determination is made. HRSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) also conducts audits and investigations of health centers and issues reports on the findings of those audits and investigations. These reports raise questions about health centers' compliance with health center program requirements. For example, in a 2015 HRSA OIG audit, HRSA OIG reported that five of the 33 health centers sampled for the audit's assessment of general financial statements audit did not meet the certification requirement to have a qualified, licensed clinician on site at least 50 percent of the time (see fig. 3).", "Enforcement has documented procedures for recording and verifying case-related data in its central database; however, national CMS do not always review and verify key data elements, such as dates and primary classifications or nature of actions, and national CMS do not always verify or track data elements recorded by other CMS within the system. Consequentially, the central database may contain inaccurate or unreliable data elements, and Enforcement\u2019s databases cannot be trusted. This reduces the reliability of case-related data reported by the Enforcement division. 8 ENFORCEMENT HAS RECORDING PROCEDURES, BUT USES NO CONTROLS TO VERIFY ENFORCEMENT DATA Enforcement has documented procedures for recording and verifying key case-related data in its central database. Specifically, the Enforcement database user guide has step-by-step procedures for recording and verifying Enforcement data, such as the dates and primary classifications of enforcement actions. The guide instructs staff to compare data elements against documentation in primary documents, such as court documentation. In addition, Enforcement conducts weekly quality checks and data quality exercises to ensure data elements recorded in the central database and database-reported metrics are reliable. We examined a sample of the data elements most often used to report key performance and resource-related metrics\u2014such as primary classification code and case status\u2014to determine the extent to which Enforcement staff follow these procedures. We tested the accuracy of key case-related data elements for cases in an enforcement database field list and that had dates from January 1, 2018, through August 31, 2018, the end of SEC\u2019s 2018 fiscal year. We found that national CMS do not always verify data elements in the database, such as primary classification code and case status date, before or during processing, and do not always document that they are relying on another CMS\u2019s information to process or verify a case record. Instead, national CMS often change data elements in the central database, such as a case status date, and do not indicate in the record that they did so. National CMS do conduct quality checks on case data and have documented quality assurance procedures. However, the procedures do not require national CMS to verify or track certain data elements, such as dates or classifications. Thus, even with review procedures in place, inaccurate or unreliable data in the database cannot be detected because of no system of controls to verify or track data elements recorded in the database. This reduces the overall reliability of case-related data reported by the Enforcement division. Figure 2 illustrates the quality assurance process used by the national CMS for case data entry and recording. As illustrated in figure 2, for example, there are no procedures to verify or document the dates or classification records of a case as input by national CMS or other CMS in the database. 9 Figure 2: National Case Management and Systems (CMS) Entering Data to the Enforcement Database Case Status Date Classification National CMS Initially Enter and Record Data Local and National CMS QA Procedures Local CMS Verify Relevant Data Before or While Processing National CMS Quality Assurance Procedures National CMS QA Procedures Record QA Findings In addition, CMS and Enforcement staff are expected to review the database for possible data errors and identify and report any identified errors. However, there are no documented procedures for Enforcement or CMS to review cases or record data quality issues when inconsistencies are found; rather, Enforcement has ad-hoc procedures to identify and report data quality issues. In one example, Enforcement CMS found errors in the original entry of an investigation case status date in the database that were not documented in the database. In addition, in January 2017 SEC issued an advisory memorandum to Enforcement staff about case status date changes, which instructed staff not to change the case status date on the database if an enforcement action was filed, even though the memorandum did not instruct staff to review existing record entries in cases. Thus, CMS and Enforcement staff must rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the data entered into the Enforcement database, but they cannot be confident that the data entered is accurate without a system of checks to verify input. Because there is no system of checks to verify input of case dates and classifications, we concluded that the data Enforcement produces is not sufficiently trustworthy to provide assurance that data elements in the database support reporting. We recommended that the Office of Inspector General conduct an audit to validate Enforcement data reporting.", "", "Puerto Rico\u2019s governor and FEMA have established recovery partners (Recovery Entities) that are funding a great variety of public utility upgrades and rebuilding infrastructure.

The plan also provides a schedule for the completion of these reform initiatives with some cost estimates identified. However, it does not include all the reform efforts of the CMO, nor does it fully reflect many of the reform efforts of other DOD acquisition organizations. Until these additional efforts are reflected in the plan, DOD will not have an integrated plan to measure and show the progress of its reform initiatives.\nWhy Is it Important to Address the Concerns?\nGAO\u2019s prior work has identified potential fragmentation and overlap of oversight responsibilities and lack of standardization in defense supply chain management among the military departments and defense agencies. These same reports also identified specific challenges that the military departments faced in delivering military items that DOD needed in order to execute its mission. In addition, this report identifies instances wherein key functions in both supply chain management and contract management are being performed by multiple organizations within the department. These concerns raise the prospect that fragmentation of acquisition functions among defense suppliers within DOD may weaken the department\u2019s ability to maximize efficiency in the procurement process and may inadvertently facilitate inefficiency and duplicate efforts.\nThe DOD Inspector General has reported deficiencies with DOD\u2019s acquisitions and its supply chain management including, among others, inappropriate acquisition methodology, a lack of oversight in the acquisition process, and poor compliance with its acquisition rules. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has repeatedly documented material weaknesses in DOD contract management. In a separate report, GAO found a range of deficiencies related to DOD\u2019s oversight over its contractors and grantees, most notably related to the department\u2019s monitoring of contractor past performance.\nThere is concern among some observers of the defense acquisition system that DOD\u2019s current culture may be a barrier to implementing these reforms. One 2016 analysis of the department\u2019s acquisition policies and practices concluded that it \u201cwill take years for [the DOD] to begin to show consistent improvement in the [acquisition] process and the results achieved.\u201d These concerns were corroborated by another analysis that, in 2018, asserted that the department\u2019s current budgeting process did more to obstruct acquisition reform than support it.\nAdditionally, DOD has struggled for many years to modernize its processes and technology. It has long operated systems that were obsolete and, in most cases, unable to collect and process information needed to conduct its business efficiently. Recent reports suggest that this deficiency persists.\nIn addressing these challenges, there are opportunities to introduce acquisition reforms. For example, DOD may improve the use of data by adopting consistent business-intelligence and reporting standards. The department may also improve the allocation of funding by developing an integrated program assessment tool, such as a performance-based budgeting system, to guide reallocation of unspent funds. A system such as this would provide objective information so that resources are moved to areas that demonstrate the best performance.\nAdditionally, a performance-based budgeting system that provides more specific targets and more transparency at various funding levels would improve the effectiveness of acquisition management by facilitating accountability and providing the information necessary to manage the reform process. DOD officials indicated recently that they have begun to develop a baseline for a performance-based budgeting system that will enable decision makers and stakeholders to track performance more reliably while improving acquisition management\u2014a process that has seen success with other federal agencies.\nDOD has implemented a departmentwide acquisition reform plan. In 2018, it established the 921 Initiative to implement acquisition reform across the department. The 921 plan sets 10 broad goals under three main categories: contract management, supply chain management, and acquisition process improvement. The plan identifies more than a dozen initiatives, assigns responsibility to different defense acquisition organizations, and sets goals and expected outcomes. It also provides specific performance indicators to measure the success of each initiative at stated time frames and milestones. The plan also addresses, in part, the areas highlighted in this report, such as acquisition workforce capacity and training and supply chain modernization. Additionally, the plan has assigned responsibilities for contract management activities at the deputy level of the department and is expected to result in DOD\u2019s taking greater ownership for its total acquisitions process.\nSource: GAO review of the 921 plan for acquisition reform issued September 20,", "CPA Professional Education Partners is the leading provider of self-paced, online CPE, CLE and CPP credit courses, study courses, and exam seminars for professionals from Deloitte and more than 150 national and regional accounting, financial, and legal professional associations.

GSA plans for EIS to address agency needs. In addition, GSA is considering extending the expiring contracts through five-year extensions. BACKGROUND: GSA manages federal agencies\u2019 telecommunications acquisitions via the FTS program to support the administration\u2019s efforts to better manage and modernize federal information systems GSA\u2019s existing government-wide telecommunications program is called Networx. As part of this program, in 2007 GSA awarded two sets of Networx contracts, which had an estimated combined value of $20 billion. These sets of contracts had differing characteristics: GSA awarded Networx Universal contracts to AT&T, Verizon Business Services, and Qwest Government Services. Networx Universal offers voice and data services, wireless services, and management and application services, including video and audio conferencing, as well as mobile and fixed satellite services, with national and international coverage. Networx Universal contracts were set to expire in March 2017; however, GSA has twice extended these contracts. According to GSA officials, the most recent extension, which GSA announced in November 2018, is to include one base year and two 1-year options, plus an additional option for the number of months required for the contracts to reach May 31, 2023. If the extension is executed and all options are exercised, the contracts will expire in May 2023. In addition, GSA provides telecommunications services through programs called Washington Interagency Telecommunications System 3 and Regional Local Service Agreements. Washington Interagency Telecommunications System 3: these contracts support a variety of telecommunications services available to all federal agencies in Washington, D.C., and surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties. For example, among other things, these contracts provide data and voice services, as well as cloud services. These contracts were set to expire on or before May 2020. As of December 2019, GSA planned to extend these contracts. In particular, GSA officials reported that certain contracts had already been extended to May 2023, and the officials planned to extend the remaining contracts through May 2023, as well.

The issue of the use of animals  in research has been debated in Congress with some proponents taking the stance that it may be time to discontinue the practice of using live animals in medical research. Supporters of the ban state that it is time to consider alternatives to the use of live laboratory animals. Some scientists and health organizations oppose the proposed ban because they believe that alternatives to live research animals will not be effective in the development of health and safety tests and drug development and evaluation testing.\nDescription The use of animals to teach various topics, for entertainment as well as for scientific research, has been a controversial issue since the 70's.\nDigitization Specifications Scanned using Epson Expression10000XL as 600 ppi, 48-bit grayscale\nFilename CHEMUNVEI-ALTERNATIVESINRESEARCH-1979-2.pdf", "A company is responsible for the safe operation of its vessels. To comply with federal regulations, the company must implement an effective system to identify hazards and reduce risk. In its review, auditors observe that, during an ongoing inspection, a vessel has multiple safety deficiencies and has failed to correct or address the deficiencies. Therefore, before renewing the vessel\u2019s certificate of inspection, the auditors will conduct an initial SMS review to examine whether the company has developed and implemented an effective SMS. The auditors are interested in examining SMS compliance, as well as how well the vessel\u2019s SMS complies with ISM Code standards. They also want to ensure the vessel\u2019s SMS addresses potential safety issues. Therefore, the auditors will examine a variety of key elements needed for a SMS, including the following: how SMS compliance will be monitored, evaluated, and maintained; procedures for identifying, recording, and investigating accidents; and procedures to plan and provide emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. The auditors will also examine whether crew members receive training, which includes understanding the vessel\u2019s SMS and how to properly correct its findings based on vessel inspections, among other things.

IDEA is the country's special-needs education law, and it ensures that schools and school districts provide special- needs students with a free, appropriate, public education that meets their unique needs and prepares students with disabilities for further education, employment, and independent living. IDEA was first enacted in 1975; however, Congress amended IDEA five more times by 2004. Among other things, the 2004 amendments improved protections for children with disabilities and their parents, and improved the quality and utility of the data collected by states about special-needs educators and students. Specifically, the 2004 amendments required SEAs to collect data on the use of mediation and due process procedures under IDEA Part B to address any complaints that parents have of their child\u2019s school or with the school district. The 2004 amendments also prohibited schools and school districts from using aversive behavioral interventions, such as restraint and seclusion.  However, despite the amendments and SEAs\u2019 required data reporting, our report found that some SEAs do not meet the data collection requirements mandated by IDEA. Additionally, we found that federal data on state compliance with special education data reporting requirements are incomplete. Although education agencies at the federal, state, and local levels have a central role in supporting students with disabilities, OSEP\u2019s IDEA data collection efforts lack sufficient transparency. In this report, we describe IDEA requirements, review the 2004 amendments\u2019 requirements, and analyze the data schools and school districts are required to collect and report on due process and mediation procedures under IDEA Part B.\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) established that all SEAs and LEAs may use, if allowed by state law, any of the data reporting categories of IDEA Part C, which are also the only required categories under the ESSA reporting law, to determine district compliance under ESSA. Consequently, school districts have used the category codes used under Part C of IDEA for LEA accountability reporting purposes. Accordingly, education agency data on these LEAs are mixed with data from education agency reporting that includes the category codes used under Parts A and B of IDEA.\nThe 2018 IDEA Part B regulations state that the reporting on use of mediation and due process procedures is an optional state-level data reporting requirement under IDEA Part B.  In our report, we found that some states, which are responsible for the collection of data pertaining to Part B, may interpret the IDEA Part B regulation to mean that data reporting for mediation and due process procedures is no longer mandatory. As a result, all states are not complying with the IDEA data reporting requirements pertaining to mediation and due process procedures.  However, OSEP could help to ensure state compliance with the IDEA data reporting requirements under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7300.664. According to the most recent IDEA regulations, federal money may not be obligated or expended for state agencies that violate IDEA regulations. In its report, GAO found that, in the three fiscal years from fiscal year (FY) 2016 through FY 2018, it obligated 784 Title I funds (a total of $373,084) for special- needs students to states that did not complete the required survey, which includes questions on IDEA data reporting requirements. In addition, if SEAs do not collect and report data on the use of mediation and due process procedures under IDEA Part B, federal, state, and local special-needs education data will be incomplete because the 2004 IDEA amendments require school districts and states to report this data on the annual special-needs education (IDEA) Part B reports. School districts that rely on inaccurate data to measure compliance with IDEA\u2019s requirements could be wasting their resources by focusing on the wrong problems. For example, data on the use of mediation and due process procedures under IDEA Part B and SEA compliance with data reporting requirements under Part B could help to identify areas of improvement for SEAs to further support students with disabilities.", "Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Indian Health Service partially met four of the five criteria for High-Risk List removal: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, and monitoring.

Further, the existing evidence from the CDC/DOJ BIP reveals the need for health care providers to take notice of behaviors that indicate that an individual is vulnerable to intimate partner violence.  The research is clear that anoxic brain injuries are caused by oxygen deprivation from repetitive choking or strangulation. According to DOJ, such repetitive behavior can demonstrate a history of intimate partner violence, which may culminate in a severe brain injury or death. Finally, according to a CDC/DOJ survey, intimate partner violence is relatively common in the United States and has far reaching consequences, such as increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases, pre-term births, miscarriage, intimate partner homicides and injuries. Furthermore, it is unclear from the record before us whether NHS has adopted and implemented specific patient screening and treatment policies in response to its awareness of the risks associated with intimate partner violence and with anaxxic brain injuries suffered due to such violence. Accordingly, we recommend that NHS:     (1) Develop a written protocol to educate staff at all locations as described in Recommendation 1 for health care providers participating in the BIP. The protocol should specify that patients affected by intimate partner violence should be questioned concerning: (a) physical abuse symptoms, such as bruises, scratches or broken bones, and (b) mental abuse symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Patients should be encouraged to report any physical or mental abuse symptoms they experience to their health care providers, even if the patient or perpetrator believes the abuse to be minor (a so-called \u201cminor injury\u201d can still cause brain injury and require further medical evaluation), and even after the abuse has stopped. Nurses or medical assistants should be available to assist patients to report any such symptoms they experience while at NHS. NHS should also consider the adoption and implementation of a uniform patient screening and data entry protocol regarding a patient\u2019s history of intimate partner violence and/or anoxic brain injury. Specifically, NHS should amend the data entry protocol for the Electronic Patient Record to include a standardized check box for providers to identify whether a patient should be screened for intimate partner violence. The data entry protocol should also include standardized sections for providers to enter information regarding whether a patient is experiencing intimate partner violence and, if so, the  extent of such abuse. The check box and data entry protocol can also help support an anonymous reporting system at NHS, in addition to encouraging providers to recognize and appropriately treat patients affected by intimate partner violence.     (2) Provide its existing workforce with a copy of the CDC publications on intimate partner violence at 1-800-CDC-INFO for review and/or reference. A copy of CDC\u2019s publications on intimate partner violence can be obtained by calling 1-800-CDC-INFO or at http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/. NHS should also take the additional step of providing its workforce with specific education regarding intimate partner violence, including relevant statistics and warning signs, so that providers understand the extent of the problem, when intimate partner violence is occurring, or has occurred, and who is at risk (such as teens and women ages 18-24).     (3) Provide adequate education to its providers and staff so they can recognize the signs of intimate partner violence and anoxic brain injuries caused by such violence. NHS should consider providing its workforce with copies of its data entry protocol, specifically in regard to recognizing and reporting information for patients exposed to intimate partner violence. This protocol should ensure providers are aware of the types of patients and/or incidents that they should identify with the protocol. NHS should also provide its nurses and medical assistants with sufficient information to assist patients who report having experienced intimate partner violence.     (4) Properly educate its workforce regarding its responsibilities under New York State law, to report suspected maltreatment of a child or an incapacitated adult. NHS should also ensure that its workforce uses the CDC\u2019s toll-free number 1-800-CDC-INFO when they have a question or concern about such a report. NHS should consider sending a memo to its physicians when these recommendations are implemented, reminding the health care staff that they have a legal responsibility to report child or elder ab", "DOCUMENT TITLE: Hearing on Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) Program: The Impacts of Recent Changes in the Military Entry Program.

It will provide observations not possible from the ground or from the Hubble Space Telescope that will help address the two big questions: How did our universe begin and what is the future of our universe? The JWST project is overseeing the procurement of the major subsystems and the integration of these subsystems into JWST that will allow the observatory to meet its science and space environment requirements and support the spacecraft\u2019s long life in space. The observatory is planned to be deployed in a stable configuration approximately 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from Earth. It is designed to be controlled and operated from remote offices at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. The JWST will observe and map the structure and composition of gas and dust in the infant universe in order to find the stars, planets, and galaxies that constitute the universe into which we are born. The JWST program is working toward a new class of astronomy focused on learning where the first stars were born, finding planetary systems orbiting other stars, and unraveling the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. The JWST is intended to carry out thousands of scientific investigations during its 10-year mission, requiring the observatory to operate in space for 5 to 10 times longer than any other telescope has operated. The JWST is a flagship mission\u2014the largest and most complex telescope ever built by any country. Its technical challenges include a 6-meter (22-foot) mirror and a 50 square-meter (538 square-feet) sunshield that must be folded by its own weight. Furthermore, the JWST\u2019s instruments must be cooled to a temperature below \u2013427 degrees Fahrenheit (\u2013253 degrees Celsius)\u2014the coldest temperature ever achieved for any NASA mission\u2014in order to enable the telescope to operate in visible and infrared light without being overwhelmed by its own heat. As of May 2018, the JWST is over the $8 billion budget cap. This is largely due to the fact that the project is currently 30 months behind schedule and overlooking its budget cap. The JWST project uses more than 10,000 subcontractors, nearly half of which have more than one contract. This is an increase from 8,100 subcontractors in 2011. As of May 2018, the JWST had more than 100 open contracts for the observatory\u2019s 10 science instruments. As of February 2018, the JWST project had purchased more than 2.6 parts worth more than $1.3 billion to facilitate project efforts. JWST contractor personnel work in multiple locations in the United States, as well as 85 subcontractor facilities and businesses in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Many subcontractor personnel and facilities in the original prime contractor network support JWST. A few original subcontractors have relocated to better support the JWST program, and some subcontractor support has been reassigned to subcontractors. Some subcontractors have ceased performance due to business uncertainties or financial distress. The JWST program has more than 400 employees, including 270 prime contractor staff and 160 prime contractor subcontractor staff located in California, Colorado, Maryland, and Texas. The JWST is currently operating on a $3.5 billion budget, 27 percent of which is for science instrument development\u2014the balance is for spacecraft development, assembly, integration, and test. The JWST\u2019s funding structure allocates the prime contractor and its two primary subcontractors 78 percent of the spacecraft development budget and provides them some flexibility to manage the design, performance, and cost challenges they face. The prime contractor and its subcontractors make up 60 percent of the observatory\u2019s staff work hours and have received $4.6 billion or 64 percent of the total observatory budget as of May 2018. The remaining 36 percent of the budget has been provided to 995 individual NASA contracts with 337 unique organizations. While most of these 995 contracts are for small amounts of work, the total 36 percent represents approximately $1.5 billion and is", "FAA\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Office, located in the Office\nof Aviation Safety, seeks to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace\nsystem, while ensuring their safety and integrity.

In addition, to ensure that limited taxpayer funds are used in the most cost-effective ways to promote democracy and human rights globally, the United States established the U.S. Global Democracy Strategy to guide how federal agencies support democracy and human rights activities. For fiscal years 2015 through 2018, State, the lead agency assigned to address democracy and human rights for all U.S. foreign assistance, allocated more than $8.8 billion in democracy assistance funds to DRL, INL, and other foreign assistance offices that support democracy assistance. State has estimated that it and other federal agencies spent about $12 million in fiscal year 2019 to promote democracy.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 DRL and USAID have missions to promote democracy around the world, while INL works to counter drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and related instability in the Western Hemisphere. Table 1, which summarizes State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s fiscal years 2019 allocations for democracy assistance through July 14, 2019, does not include democracy activities undertaken through the Department of Defense and certain other agencies.

In 2017, for example, Congress acted to address the threat of C. auris infections, but the legislative response was targeted at a single pathogen, rather than the wider problem of emerging infections and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, current law does not include explicit federal funding for activities related to emerging threats. P.L. 115-27 is intended to make it easier for FDA to regulate antimicrobial drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, while P.L. 115-332 is primarily intended to facilitate the development of treatments for certain types of rare diseases. According to CBO, both bills would have no significant impact on the federal budget. enacted laws that explicitly authorized certain FDA-related activities for the development of antimicrobial drugs. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-52), for example, expands FDA authorities by authorizing development and approval of limited-population antibiotics. In 1796, Congress passed the first U.S. quarantine law to help guard against the spread of infectious diseases, and according to a CRS report, quarantine law authority is now provided in various statutes. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 grants health departments in the 50 states limited authority to enforce various \u201cquarantine laws.\u201d Furthermore, in 2003, Congress enacted a comprehensive quarantine and inspection authority law to provide authority to FDA. According to the CRS report, P.L. 110-352 amended several federal laws to provide a clear regulatory framework for the development and licensure of biosimilar products, including through an expedited review process. It amended the Public Health Service Act to require FDA to establish standards of identity with respect to biological products intended to treat any human disease or condition; and it added drug pricing transparency requirements to existing statutes. According to CBO, those provisions would result in no significant increase in direct spending for the Department of Health and Human Services. P.L. 115-27 (Section 904) and P.L. 115-332 (Section 107) include provisions related to the development of and access to biological products and antimicrobial drugs. P.L. 115-27 also directs FDA to develop regulation on animal antimicrobial drugs intended for use in a food-producing animal, and it prohibits the use in any federally inspected food-producing animal of an antimicrobial drug for which overuse has been identified as contributing to drug resistance. P.L. 115-332 is generally intended to facilitate the development of treatments for rare diseases and advance precision medicine by expediting the development of new drugs for rare diseases. In addition, P.L. 115-27 and P.L. 115-332 include provisions related to drug pricing. According to an administration official, P.L. 115-27 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. According to a CBO estimate of P.L. 115-332, it would reduce direct spending by $260 million over ten years. In 1983, Congress passed a federal quarantine law to control the spread of certain infectious diseases, and in 2014, FDA promulgated its second quarantine rule related to quarantine and custody. For example, as a result of the most recent quarantine rule, foreign vessels entering the United States port of Virginia are subject to sanctions if they do not report any human illnesses onboard. According to FDA officials, the agency is considering whether to further refine the rule to take into account public health and other considerations, such as impacts on commerce. ACTION POINTS: Develop a more comprehensive and coherent strategy to combat the spread of infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance. Focus efforts on pathogens, such as C. auris, that appear to be evolving to become increasingly resistant to available antibiotic treatments.

This program\u2014located within the Office of Research, Development, and Information\u2014 funds research projects related to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases or injuries that affect veterans. This program contributes to VA\u2019s mission to provide world-class health care to veterans. VA uses an array of grant mechanisms to fund intramural research\u2014such as contracts, cooperative studies, and career awards. This program funds up to 120 VA research projects (called \u201cprojects\u201d in this report) per year, which can have a budget up to $1.2 million per project. By contributing to VA research, this program helps VA to improve treatments and patient outcomes. In fiscal year 2018, VA spent an estimated $555 million on this program (not including appropriations from other accounts), which is estimated to support up to 2300 researchers and staff. This program has a formal review process for individual projects, called the Merit Review Program. In 2017, VISN 9, 10, and 21 produced the most research projects through the Merit Review Program\u2014including research to address a variety of veteran health needs such as prosthetics, spinal cord injuries, postpartum depression, breast cancer, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease. VA uses an array of grant mechanisms to fund these projects\u2014such as contracts, cooperative studies, and career awards. This program uses appropriations from VA\u2019s medical and prosthetic research account\u2014 $543.8 million in fiscal year 2018. This is estimated to fund 47 percent of the Merit Review Program. The other 49 percent comes from appropriations from other accounts. VA research\u2014including research funded through the Merit Review Program\u2014contributes to VA\u2019s mission to provide veterans with high quality healthcare. For example, one study showed an impact on the quality of life of veterans suffering from Parkinson\u2019s Disease. One study also showed an impact on the cost of care for veterans receiving care for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). GENERAL COMMENTS: \u2022 The report is a continuation of our prior work on the VA Intramural Research Program (IRP), which examined how VA supports medical and prosthetic research. This report provides more detail on ORD and its funding mechanisms for medical and prosthetic research. We used a mix of methods to review the information: \u2022 We reviewed available budget justifications, agency-wide documents, policy and procedural documents, and websites \u2022 To gather project information we used VA Research Currents, an internal VA publication that described the VA merit review awards for intramural research \u2022 For additional context, we reviewed relevant scientific literature. We conducted interviews with VA and selected nongovernment experts, and performed site visits to VA facilities where staff could speak freely. We also reviewed available VISN data, and contracted expertise to help us analyze the VISN funding data .", "States have three options for designing their CHIP programs: Medicaid expansion CHIP, separate CHIP, and combination CHIP.

Under Medicaid expansion CHIP, states expand income eligibility levels for children beyond those of the state\u2019s Medicaid program.", "Nuclear explosives are the main ingredients of nuclear weapons. Scientists and technicians at the Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and the national nuclear weapons complex that is operated by the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) create these explosives using synthetic and natural high explosives. Explosives such as TATB are not sensitive to mechanical shock, temperature and electrical energy, meaning that it is less of a risk when used compared to conventional high explosives. However, scientists are still not able to synthesize TATB in bulk and it remains relatively expensive compared to other explosives. This has resulted in a lack of confidence in the use of TATB and a desire to develop other synthetic explosives, resulting in a decrease in demand for TATB from the NNSA in the future. The DOD is, however, interested in developing alternative explosives that will be cheaper and more reliable. In this context, DOD scientists will need to develop the technical capabilities to synthesize TATB, which will be the key to its success. RESEARCH GOALS: 1. Developing TATB Synthesis: We aim to improve our understanding of the synthesis of TATB by conducting experiments on single crystals. 2. Improved Methodologies: We aim to develop methodologies that will lead to lower cost synthesis of TATB by modifying the TATB synthesis route with a goal of decreasing the amount of starting materials required and increasing the rate of the reaction; or by investigating alternate but more convenient synthesis routes. 3. Improved Characterization: We aim to characterize TATB using state-of-the-art electronics and other means with the goal of finding ways to improve purity, consistency, and yield. 4. Alternate Substitutions: We will develop new explosives with the goal of finding and investigating high explosives that are cheaper and more reliable than TATB. RESEARCH PLAN: We will synthesize TATB using single-crystal methods to develop a fundamental understanding of the TATB molecule, the TATB synthesis route, and other reactions. This will allow us to use our new insights to modify the TATB synthesis route, thus reducing the amount of starting material required to make TATB; increasing the rate of the TATB synthesis reaction; or to identify alternative synthesis routes. We will increase our knowledge of the crystal structure of TATB by using electron diffraction techniques. We will also study its polymorphism using single and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and the surface morphology of TATB crystals by scanning electron microscopy. We will use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to understand the synthesis route and the factors that control the TATB synthesis reaction.

The Small Business Act requires federal agencies\u2019 SBIR and STTR programs to review applications within prescribed time periods and notify applicants of outcomes so as to \u201cmaximize the potential for program applications to result in commercial products and services.\u201d Federal agencies have a responsibility to help ensure that SBIR and STTR outcomes are reported and tracked. GAO studied the time frames between when proposals were received and when applicants were notified of outcomes. The agencies involved in GAO\u2019s analysis (see tables) collectively spend about half of federal R&D funding. From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the 28 agencies reviewed received over 40,000 SBIR and STTR proposals. Of those proposals, we identified 3,433 that requested that the agency notify them before their application was reviewed\u2014such as a request not to publicly disclose the proposal to third parties. Our analysis found little evidence that agencies met the time frames required, but data limitations could affect the reliability of our findings. For example, we found little evidence that an agency exceeded the time frames if only one application was requested to be notified early, but we could not determine if the agency exceeded the prescribed time frame in other years if only one application was requested to be notified early in that year. Also, a lack of access to applications submitted allowed the use of proxies to find the 3,433 applications we identified. The time frame we used may be different from the time frame the agencies use to review proposals and notify applicants. For example, agency officials may add a small amount of time to the required time period to allow a margin for review extensions. Furthermore, GAO found that agencies notified less than half of 1\n2 TABLE: TIME REQUIRED: SBIR AND STTR programs may not know exactly when the review time period will begin, as federal agencies do not set aside funds during the 1-year budget period in which they commit to review proposals. Therefore, agencies must ensure the number of reviews assigned to each reviewer meets 1 year requirements (e.g., at least 40 peer reviews completed by a midyear anniversary in the 1-year budget period). 10 days and 5 days to notify some awardees, which were below the required time period, and a median of 6 months to notify awardees for one agency. Overall, GAO found that the median number of days between proposal receipt and notification ranged from 35 to 67\u2014considerably less than 90 for SBIRs and 1 year for STTRs. Our analysis also found that the percentage of applicants whose proposals were identified as peer reviewed ranged from 56 to 81 percent. We determined that four agencies\u2014NSF, DoD, USDA, and HHS\u2014reviewed 95 percent of the proposals we were able to identify in fiscal year 2018, potentially giving those agencies more incentive to meet the time frames required. Our results may not be generalizable, as our study did not include data on all federal SBIR and STTR programs. Furthermore, GAO could not verify how many agencies meet the time frames, because agencies rely on their own systems for notifying awardees. However, our results raise concern that a lack of visibility, or lack of awareness, of the time frame requirements for SBIR and STTR review and notifying awardees existed at some federal agencies. Federal agencies should monitor their processes for complying with the time frames required to review SBIR and STTR applications and should notify agencies whose process to comply with the time frames is not effective. Agencies should inform GAO of how they are monitoring their SBIR and STTR processes and any actions they have taken to improve outcomes. RECOMMENDATION: ACF, CDC, DOD, DOE, and NIH should review their processes for complying with the time frames required to review SBIR and STTR applications and notify agencies whose process to comply with the time frames is not effective. The 4 agencies whose processes may be inefficient should inform GAO of how they are monitoring their SBIR and STTR processes and any actions they have taken to improve outcomes.", "Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: In its fiscal year 2017, CMS estimates that Medicaid enrolled almost 74 million individuals and covered some portion of the births for nearly 97 percent of infants born in the United States. Total Medicaid expenditures in FY 2017 were estimated at $580.4 billion. In FY 2017, states covered almost $244 billion, or 50 percent of, Medicaid expenses or the total $580.4 billion. Of the $240.2 billion the federal government covered in FY 2017, states\u2019 fiscal general funds covered $90.6 billion, federal funds covered $138.6 billion, and state match covered $17.8 billion. The federal government matched state claims at an average rate of 58.3 percent for expenditures in FYs 2014 through 2017. (See table 2.) Some states are more dependent on the federal government\u2019s share of Medicaid financing than others, with the ratio of federal funds to state funds ranging from 91 percent in Mississippi to 51 percent in Texas. Additionally, some states experienced disproportionately higher increases in their federal share of Medicaid expenditures, on average, from 2007 to 2016 than did other states; for example, states in the southwest region experienced average annual percentage increases in their federal share of Medicaid expenditures ranging from 8.8 percent in Nevada to 12.8 percent in Texas. According to CMS officials, states\u2019 total expenditures per enrollee, which vary based on coverage, have not significantly increased since approximately 2012, although total expenditures per enrollee are higher in FY 2017 compared to previous years. Expenditures per month per individual enrolled can vary based on factors such as demographics, income, employment, eligibility status, and geographic location. (See table 3.) For example, in FY 2017, total expenditures for children were almost 1.5 times higher compared to seniors: approximately $9,100 per child compared to $6,100 per senior. Moreover, per enrollee spending for individuals residing in noninstitutional long-term care facilities ranged from $43,636 per enrollee in New York to $11,971 per enrollee in Arkansas. In addition, of the top 10 states with the highest expenditures per enrollee for individuals with disabilities in FY 2017, the average difference in expenses between states ranged from $71 ($43,885 in Illinois and $42,094 in Iowa) to $1,578 ($42,175 in South Dakota and $40,597 in Oklahoma). Expenditures per enrollee for individuals with physical disabilities generally exceed expenditures per enrollee for individuals with mental health disabilities and substance use disorders by a relatively similar margin in most states\u2014for example, $10,112 per enrollee for physical disabilities compared to $5,672 per enrollee for mental health disabilities and $4,350 per enrollee for substance use disorders in South Dakota, which had the highest disability-related expenditures among these disabilities.

This enhanced federal financial participation means CMS pays a greater percentage of these plans\u2019 reimbursements than the costs of providing care for", "In fiscal year 2018, the total funding for the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program was $490 million. MIECHV funds are allocated to states according primarily to the percentage of lowincome families with children under age 5 in order to ensure that communities with the biggest needs have the greatest access to home-visitation services. HHS has determined that 18 of the 27 home-visitation programs listed in its national Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices qualify as evidence-based and therefore eligible for MIECHV program funding. This means that states have the flexibility to select from the list of 27 home-visitation programs a small subset of programs for funding. HHS has also determined that states must demonstrate how they will use their MIECHV funds in combination with other state and local funding to supplement, not supplant, their existing child- welfare programs.", "NNSA is responsible for managing national nuclear security missions to ensure the availability, safety, and reliability of a nuclear weapons deterrent and delivery systems, and to maintain a central role in national security affairs. NNSA largely relies on management and operating contractors (M&O) to provide enriched uranium to the U.S. Navy and uranium-related components for nuclear bombs, and to conduct other nuclear security missions. For example, at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the facility\u2019s main building was built around 1945 and its current primary function is to store and enrich uranium, a process that includes removing impurities from the uranium metal, converting the metal in to uranium oxide, and further processing of the oxides. Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium production processes pose the second highest nuclear safety risk among the five nuclear security sites.\nM&O contractors manage certain functions at the five DOE nuclear security sites and provide a wide range of support, including facility operations, maintenance, information technology, and engineering support. The nuclear security enterprise employs roughly 90,000 people.\nY-12\u2019s enriched uranium operations have several key shortcomings, according to officials. For example, Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium operations have problems with an inefficient workflow, which results in continually rising operation and maintenance costs. An inefficient workflow occurs because enriched uranium is transferred throughout the site after processing without adding to the site\u2019s overall productivity.\nThe report did not identify risks posed by Y-12\u2019s uranium processing equipment. The report did identify risks associated with the uranium production facility, including that, \u201cduring normal operations, uranium hexafluoride processing produces hexafluorine gas that could be released to the environment during a release of contaminants\u2026 Hexafluorine is very toxic\u2026 [and] would not be acceptable in groundwater, soil, or air.\u201d Additionally, the report did not identify issues associated with operations at the Uranium Processing Facility.\nThe U.S. government continues to pay for construction of the UPF, which, according to the Government Accountability Office, cost an estimated $11 billion in fiscal year 2019. On August 28, 2018, NNSA announced it is considering several alternative solutions to cost-effectively complete the UPF project, as well as an exit strategy for existing operations at Y-12. For example, the agency is analyzing options for completing the UPF at a reduced scope and schedule and for managing the transfer of the current operations from Building 9212 to the UPF and to Building 9215. In addition, NNSA is conducting a cost analysis of shutting down Building 9212.\nAccording to the agency\u2019s implementation plan for the UPF revised solution, which was included in the agency\u2019s 2018 plan for its enrichment operations, \u201cPhase 1 will be initiated through a combination of shutdown or conversion of mission capability with little to no movement of mission-capable equipment or personnel. Phase II will include limited movement of mission-capable equipment or personnel for limited processing and finishing functions to new UPF infrastructure. Phase III will include consolidation of remaining mission capability from Y-12 to either new UPF infrastructure or from Building 9215.\u201d The Y\u201112 site will be reduced to the smallest necessary physical size, given operational needs and cost\u2011effectiveness, and will include demolition of buildings and structures determined to be beyond their service lives. The UPF\u2019s implementation plan does not identify when the UPF project is expected to be completed.\nThe U.S. government completed the UPF in October 2015, and the agency is currently reviewing plans for operations of the UPF. However, NNSA is deferring a decision on whether to fully ramp up operations at the UPF due to cost concerns. Concurrently, Y-12 is preparing an enriched uranium fabrication cell in Building 9215, located about eight miles from the UPF. Building 9215 is part of a complex that will be used for enriched uranium operations, which will occur in both of the buildings for several years until the UPF is completed. Building 9215 is not yet in operation. During fiscal year 2018, Y-12 processed approximately 50", "Priority and Standard Review For a priority review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directs its resources to applications for new drugs that prevent, diagnose, or treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in safety or effectiveness compared to available drugs. A drug may also receive priority review if the drug sponsor redeems a priority review voucher, among other things. FDA\u2019s goal is to complete the review of a priority application within 6 months. Drugs that do not receive priority review receive standard review. FDA\u2019s goal is to complete the review of a standard application within 10 months. FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the safety and efficacy of drugs and biological products, such as vaccines, sold in the United States. While FDA reviews most drug applications using its standard review process, FDA\u2019s priority review designation is intended to reduce the review time needed to bring a drug to market for certain drugs that treat serious conditions. A drug application typically receives a priority review designation if the drug would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to available drugs, among other things (see sidebar). FDA reviews all applications to determine if they qualify for priority review. However, to be awarded a PRV and thus shorten FDA\u2019s review time for a future drug application from 10 months to 6 months, certain criteria must be met. For example, for all three PRV programs, the drug application must be eligible for priority review and a drug may be disqualified if its active ingredient has been previously approved by FDA in another drug application. If a drug application is approved by FDA, it includes its decision regarding whether to award a PRV. FDA includes this approval decision in its approval letter. Figure 1 provides a general overview of the PRV programs. PRVs may be transferred any number of times before they are used. FDA regulates drugs and biological products. Drugs are approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and some of these drugs can also receive regulatory approval under the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. However, this report focuses on drugs and biological products that meet CDER\u2019s approval standards. When a drug sponsor redeems a PRV, FDA determines if they are eligible for priority review. If the drug sponsor is eligible for a PRV, FDA will award the PRV (if it is unused) to the drug application. The priority review designation includes a goal review time of 6 months, in addition to the goal review time of 10 months for the standard review. If FDA does not award the PRV to the drug application, the review time remains at the 10-month goal review time for standard review. Thus, the priority review option can shorten FDA\u2019s review time of 10 months if FDA awards the PRV but can also lengthen the review time of 10 months if FDA does not award the PRV. FDA has also established the three PRV program designs. The rare pediatric disease PRV program is a permanent program; the tropical disease and medical countermeasure PRV programs were created as short-term measures to facilitate the development and availability of new drugs meeting an unmet need. To be eligible to be awarded a permanent rare pediatric disease PRV, FDA has certain criteria. For both the temporary tropical disease and temporary medical countermeasure PRV program, FDA has its own criteria for eligibility. However, the temporary tropical disease and medical countermeasure PRVs can only be used with FDA-approved applications for drugs and biological products addressing high-burden infectious diseases, which are diseases that impose a significant cost or burden on individuals, communities, or the health care system. The tropical disease and medical countermeasure PRV programs were expected to expire following the calendar year of 2018 but were extended to expire within the calendar year 2020.\nThe first drug sponsor to redeem a rare pediatric disease PRV was Retrophin for a drug used to treat a rare pediatric disease\u2014a kidney disorder. The first drug sponsor to redeem a tropical disease PRV was GlaxoSmithKline, for the treatment of infections caused by the Zika virus. The first drug sponsor to redeem a medical countermeasure PRV was Adaptive Biotechnologies for the diagnostic", "State and federal Medicaid staff have the primary responsibility to assure the accuracy of Medicaid eligibility determinations, CMS does not oversee states\u2019 eligibility reviews. However, CMS does perform federal eligibility determinations\u2014through its direct oversight role of the federal marketplaces\u2014and states\u2019 responsibilities for overseeing eligibility determinations are not dissimilar, providing an opportunity for CMS or states to identify ways to improve accuracy or to determine whether inaccurate determinations are isolated or systemic. Because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have oversight over how state and federal Marketplace enrollees are verified, CMS lacks this knowledge for the Marketplace population. Specifically, CMS does not perform verifications for those not enrolled in traditional Medicaid, nor do its reports reflect this population. Without access to such data, verification errors that might involve federal funding are not addressed. Specifically, the accuracy of eligibility verifications should be addressed as part of a review of the accuracy of expenditures reported by CMS. Therefore, this initiative meets the intent of the recommendation.\nFederal and state staff will continue to review state actions to ensure eligibility determinations are accurate. With regard to CMS, FTI plans to monitor whether CMS addresses reporting of inaccurate matches as part of a new review process.", "VA\u2019s Spending for Veterans\u2019 Long-Term Care Is Projected to Increase SIGNIFICANCE", "IHS was established within the Public Health Service in 1955 in order to meet federal treaty obligations to provide health services to members of federally recognized AI/AN tribes primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS oversees its provision of health care services through a decentralized system of 12 area offices, which are led by area directors and located in 12 geographic areas. IHS\u2019s headquarters office is responsible for setting national health care policy, ensuring the delivery of quality comprehensive health services, and advocating for the health needs and concerns of AI/AN people. The area offices are responsible for monitoring federally operated IHS facilities\u2019 operations and finances, and providing guidance and technical assistance. IHS\u2019s 12 area offices oversee 168 service units which provide care at the local level through a total of 742 federally operated and tribally operated hospitals, health centers, and other health facilities. The types of services offered by these facilities vary, but most commonly include primary care and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services. Table 1 displays the number of federally operated and tribally operated facilities as of February 2019. If federally operated or tribally operated facilities are unable to provide needed care, they may contract for health services from private providers through the PRC program. Patients must meet certain eligibility and administrative requirements in order to qualify for this care\u2014 including having exhausted all other health care resources available to them and living on a federally recognized Indian reservation or within a designated PRC delivery area. The PRC program is funded through the annual appropriations process and administered at the local level by individual PRC programs that are often affiliated with local facilities. IHS\u2019s five PRC medical priority levels are 1. Emergent and acutely urgent care services, which include treatment for threats to life, limb, or senses; 2. Preventive care services, which include prenatal care and 3. Primary and secondary care services, which include scheduled ambulatory services for non-emergent conditions, and specialty consultations; 4. Chronic tertiary and extended care services, which include rehabilitation care, skilled nursing facility care, and organ transplants; and 5. Excluded services, which include cosmetic and experimental procedures. Beginning in 2014, PPACA allowed the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to a category of non-elderly, non-pregnant adults, though states were only required to cover adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. IHS also offers non-Medicaid health benefits for enrolled AI/AN through programs including S(I)CHIP and Medicare, along with a non-Medicaid health assistance program for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI(ANs)) in need of hospital care. All together, IHS serves roughly 2 million unique AI/AN enrollees. Our analysis of IHS data shows that from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018, the percent of patients at 73 federally operated IHS hospitals and health centers who reported having health insurance coverage increased an average of 14 percentage points, from 64 percent in fiscal year 2013 to 78 percent in fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 2). The increase occurred despite the fact that Medicaid expansion was limited to 28 states, that Medicaid eligibility was only expanded to include childless adults in 25 states and the District of Columbia, and that 9 of the 11 states for which fiscal year 2018 data are available chose not to expand Medicaid. Additionally, the average annual growth rate in this measure\u2019s percentage points was smaller in the four later years (fiscal years 2015 through 2018) than in the first six years (fiscal years 2013 through 2018)\u2014with the average growth rate for fiscal years 2013-2014 being statistically significant (p=<0.001), while the growth rates for fiscal years 2016-2018 were statistically insignificant.", "The President signed Executive Order 13834 \u201cEfficient Federal Operations\u201d on May 14, 2018.\nExecutive Order 13834 requires federal agencies, to the extent permitted by law, to (1) divert from waste disposal 40 percent of excess and surplus supplies and materials to reuse and recycling programs, with a goal of diversion of 50 percent of excess and surplus supplies and materials in fiscal year 2019; (2) donate 100 percent of unsold excess and surplus property to state and local governments and eligible organizations; (3) incorporate recycled products into acquisitions and establish an environmental requirements clause to be included in contracts for the purchase of goods or services; (4) implement waste prevention policies or procedures when purchasing, using, or disposing of materials; and, (5) divert from landfills 75 percent of the total amount of organic waste at federal facilities where it is appropriate for the facility, food waste disposal and source reduction activities.\nIn addition, the order directs the Administrator of the United States Government Accountability Office to study food waste at federal agencies.\nOur analysis of the federal government\u2019s FLW reduction efforts found that EPA, DOD, FDA, USDA, and GAO have taken steps that could help achieve the FLW reduction goal, although not specified by statute. The federal government\u2019s current actions do not address the full scope of the challenge, and agencies face hurdles that may impede their ability to fully implement the order\u2019s food waste-related policy directives.\nThe order does not designate a single organization to oversee implementation.\nThe FLW reduction goal, while laudable, was not subject to oversight. The President could use the order as a vehicle for developing oversight mechanisms to hold agencies accountable for reporting on implementation of the order\u2019s policy directives as well as achieving the goal. However, the order does not designate a single organization to oversee implementation. Further, the order is exempted from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) so agencies have no obligation to obtain public comment. Thus it is unclear how GAO\u2019s study will be carried out.\nThe order does not require agencies to consider environmental justice when developing strategies to address FLW or establish specific policy directives related to food waste at federal facilities in communities of color.\nThe President should use the order to direct federal agencies to consider environmental justice in reducing FLW and to collaborate with local governments that are disproportionately affected by FLW to address the inequitable distribution of resources and burdens. Specifically, this could be achieved by strengthening statutory requirements related to FLW.\nEPA does not have statutory authority to collect and report on federal landfill waste data in collaboration with other agencies. A 2009 law called for EPA to update its \u201cFederal Landfill Data System,\u201d but without statutory authority, the data system was not fully deployed before being discarded. As such, the federal government currently lacks a national source of FLW management data from the public and private sectors. We believe that the order\u2019s requirement for agencies to divert from landfills 75 percent of the total amount of organic waste at federal facilities could provide data that could be useful for policymakers. It is an opportunity for federal agency leaders to collaborate with private-sector stakeholders to identify and pursue opportunities to collect waste reduction data. Further, there is an opportunity for federal departments to analyze these data, using, for example, a social cost-benefit analysis.\nWhile we recognize that the federal government does not own or operate all landfills in the United States, we noted three federal programs that could be used to promote FLW reduction.\nDOD\u2019s Environmental Compliance Assessment is a tool for assessing compliance with DOD environmental statutes and regulations.\nUSDA\u2019s Agricultural Conservation Enhancement Program allows producers to implement conservation practices as part of the program requirements and to develop and implement a conservation plan in exchange for payment. The plan may be based on sound biological principles, site-specific characteristics or related information, and should involve the producer and a third-party facilitator, such as an accredited or certified conservation professional.\nGAO conducted a performance audit of DOD\u2019s solid waste program and found waste volume reduction opportunities at more than $875 million worth of DOD waste recycling and reuse facilities, but the services have not conducted", "VA has been providing veterans educational VA has provided over $50 billion total in education and training benefits to veterans and dependents in fiscal years VA\u2019s Post-9/11 GI Bill has been the single largest federal program for education and training in recent years. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is currently VA\u2019s single largest program, which has provided benefits to over 1.8 million recipients since its inception in September While federal student financial aid administered by Education is separate from VA education benefits, student veterans receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are also eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans. According to Education data, just over 6% of the 919,000 student beneficiaries of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits had received some combination of federal student aid in academic year 2015-16. However, we note the potential for student veterans to have received aid under a variety of different federal programs that Education administers in addition to Pell Grants and Direct Loans. Finally, VA has contracted with a number of schools to offer non-college or non-traditional VA Post\u20139/11 GI BILL EVALUATION 1 training on technology and skills required by many modern industry jobs. As such, these schools did not have undergraduate, graduate, or professional programs, and the vast majority of enrolled veterans attended without using Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fees. These other schools received $111 million in tuition and fees from VA in fiscal year 2017 for a total of nearly 3,600 student veteran beneficiaries. This represents over 1.8% of all students who received education benefits from VA in fiscal year 2017. Finally, students receiving VA education benefits have the choice to attend any school that offers programs that are eligible for GI Bill payment, including public, private, nonprofit, for- profit, and foreign. VA provides Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments to nearly 729,000 veterans and beneficiaries (see following table).11 For fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and fiscal year 2018 (the most recent data we accessed) and a collective total of approximately $50 billion in VA education benefits were provided to assist veterans to pursue college degrees. VA has paid over $9.3 billion in tuition and fees to attend college for over one million beneficiaries in fiscal year While we estimate that over 531,000 student veterans have used some combination of education benefits, this estimate was drawn from Department of Veterans Affairs data for enrollment for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, and is expected to be an overestimate. 11 The data are for fiscal year 2017. 12 1 FIGURE 1. VA HAS PAID OVER $4 BILLION IN POST\u20139/11 GI BILL TUITION AND FEES FOR OVER 1.4 MILLION BENEFICIARIES SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2009 The figure above shows the number of beneficiaries who received education payments from VA from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2017 totaling nearly $9.3 billion (adjusted for inflation to fiscal year 2019 values). 13 2 FIGURE 2.

The Veterans Health Administration spent almost $33.5 billion using FSS from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. The federal government has established the Schedules Program as an efficient and effective means of procurement for the acquisition of supplies and services. Our audit objective was to determine whether VA established an acceptable level of assurance that procurement through the Multiple Award Schedules program is conducted in a legal, economic, efficient, and effective manner. The federal government has authorized VA to award and administer contracts in order to ensure that VA programs acquire the goods and services that are needed quickly, efficiently and in the best interest of the federal government.", "The TSA Act established a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) to carry out a highway safety program. It authorizes NHTSA to establish and enforce Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) applicable to new motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, and other safety-related regulations. To oversee its implementation and enforcement of the FMVSS, it established 12 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations. For example, FMVSS 126 specifies requirements for occupant crash protection in passenger cars, multi-purpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. FMVSS 121 specifies requirements for theft protection and rollaway prevention. In addition, it oversees the New Car Assessment Program, which provides vehicle information for consumers to use when purchasing new vehicles.", "Our experience has shown that the key element needed to make progress in high-risk areas is top-level attention, and that high-level attention without corrective actions means that high-risk areas remain on the High- Risk List. Given the importance of sustained and reliable satellite data for day- to- day weather forecasting and warnings, the NOAA and the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research under the Department of Commerce should collaborate with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and DOD, as appropriate, to help reduce the risk that substantial gaps in this data will occur. The NOAA, Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and DOD are to develop and implement an appropriate plan that would define responsibilities to prevent gaps in satellite data and would provide reliable information on how NOAA and NASA would prevent gaps in satellite data. This action plan should also address the potential impacts of such gaps. It should include a time frame for addressing each item of the action plan, and also address how the successes of the plan will be measured and reported. \u2022 Since our 2015 update, NOAA has taken steps to reduce the risk of substantial satellite data gaps, such as reestablishing its satellite data policy and reaffirming its role as the provider of climate, navigation, weather, and search and rescue information by rebuilding its satellite ground infrastructure, restoring some satellite services, and obtaining new satellite and launch capabilities. However, until NOAA obtains new polar-orbiting satellite capabilities in late 2026, the only viable operational weather satellite will have been in operation for more than 18 years. According to NOAA, a longer-term plan would be developed after the new polar-orbiting satellites are launched. \u2022 NASA\u2019s recently announced Fiscal Year 2017 budget request includes $1.5 billion in new commercial space transportation capabilities, including two launches of new cargo vehicles during the request period and continued development of a heavy-lift rocket for crew transportation. We will consider the need for NASA to take its own action, in accordance with the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5101 et seq.) (otherwise referred to as the Space Act), to protect our nation\u2019s national security and economic health as well as the safety and security of our population. Our 2017 annual update identified potential additional actions needed from DOD so that the high-risk area was able to be removed from the High-Risk List. We are encouraged by the recent congressional and DOD actions to address the high-risk area. In September 2017, Congress passed an amendment authorizing DOD\u2019s space programs to develop advanced satellite capabilities to ensure the continuity and resilience of DOD\u2019s satellite programs. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established that funds up to $130 million may be used for a competitive launch services program and funds up to $300 million can be used for a competitive launch services program. In April 2018, DOD, in coordination with space activities, initiated a review of the Defense Space Program and National Security Space Program. Space activities, as the executive agent for DOD space systems, will implement DOD\u2019s mandate in the 2018 NDAA and lead and manage the process to acquire new launch services, including the launch services for the future missile tracking satellites and the advanced missile-tracking satellites. We will continue to collaborate with DOD until all areas of the high-risk area have been removed from the High-Risk List. Appendix V describes the actions required to resolve the related areas on the High-Risk List.", "risk to security.

In the UCMJ jurisdiction extends to all places and applies to all active-duty servicemembers. A person who is guilty of military offenses must be tried and if found guilty must be punished accordingly. Three types of military courts hear criminal matters: the summary courts-martial, the special courts-martial and the general courts-martial. Each of these courts has the authority to conduct trial proceedings, to determine whether a servicemember committed an offense, whether the servicemember is guilty of that offense, and to impose a sentence that is consistent with punishments set out in the UCMJ. Nonjudicial punishment (also known as Article 15 punishment) is a tool that servicemembers can use to take action in response to minor offenses committed by enlisted personnel. In addition, servicemembers may be referred to the Commander of their unit for discipline under that commander\u2019s authority.

Those challenges are: (1) threat recognition, (2) detection capabilities, (3) the response process, and (4) biosurveillance. We reported that DHS has since made progress on three of these four key challenges identified in past reports. In 2010 we reported that DHS, DOD, and HHS were all taking steps to address challenges in biosurveillance. Specifically, we reported on several initiatives such as the CDC\u2019s BioSense 2 program and HHS\u2019s National Biosurveillance Integration System that aimed to improve the nation\u2019s biodetection capabilities and build awareness of public health threats by sharing data among government agencies both at the federal and state level. In 2006, we recommended that DOD and health agencies work together to improve information sharing. Furthermore, we reported that DOD programs had addressed some of the detection challenges in responding to biological events: for example, through new detection technologies and improved coordination on detection capabilities among military departments and the services of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. We also reported that DOD and HHS are working together to address the challenges of preparedness through initiatives such as Project BioWatch and BSL-3 facilities. However, in 2010 we reported that there were still significant challenges to DOD and HHS coordinating preparedness and response activities and in addressing the challenges presented by the nation\u2019s public health and medical capabilities. The EBOLA outbreak and its spread to numerous countries has demonstrated the important role that public health and medical personnel play in helping control the effects of an incurable pandemic, and the challenges presented by not ensuring an adequate supply of personnel and medical supplies; not training healthcare workers sufficiently; and a lack of effective communication, collaboration, and coordination between these personnel, as well as with other healthcare personnel in the U.S. We have reported that DOD and HHS have also not clearly defined roles and responsibilities in response activities.", "Over the next 10 years, the Navy plans to continue developing critical technologies, complete detail design, and begin construction of the lead Columbia class submarine. In December 2017, we found that the schedule to deliver the lead submarine was aggressive, with extensive overlap (or concurrency) between development and construction, as shown in figure 1. Our prior work reviewing shipbuilding programs has shown that programs with the greatest amount of concurrency often have the highest cost and schedule growth, as well as quality and performance issues. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included reporting requirements for the Columbia class program. As part of these requirements, the Navy must submit matrices annually to Congress that identify (1) key milestones, events, and performance goals for design and construction of Columbia and (2) costs associated with design and construction of Columbia. The Navy submitted its initial matrices to Congress in February 2018 and an update to these matrices in October 2018. The next matrices update is due in March 2019 and annually, thereafter, until the lead Columbia submarine is delivered. The Navy is developing a number of new technologies related to submarine propulsion, missile tubes, and survivability that are planned to ensure that Columbia will remain operationally relevant throughout its planned 40-year lifespan, as shown in figure 2. In 2015, as part of its technology readiness assessments, GAO identified two technologies as critical\u2013\u2013the advanced carbon dioxide removal unit and the stern area system\u2014which were not identified by the Navy as critical technologies. In addition, several of these critical technologies are immature and exist at technology readiness levels (TRLs) of less than 7. See appendix II for a description of TRLs. As part of its matrices to Congress, the Navy is required to report on the TRLs of the integrated power system, nuclear reactor, propulsor, coordinated stern features, stern area system, and common missile compartment. Two shipbuilders\u2013\u2013General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News\u2013\u2013design and build nuclear submarines, however, only the design work for Columbia has begun. In 2015, Electric Boat completed a preliminary design of the lead Columbia. As of October 2018, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (ATL) reported that design efforts were ongoing, with Electric Boat designing the super modules. The Navy has initiated construction activities for Columbia. In September 2017, the Navy awarded a contract to Electric Boat for the lead Columbia detail design. In October 2018, the Navy awarded contract modifications to increase the scope of detail design work for Columbia. Electric Boat is also building a testing facility to simulate submarine operations. Additionally, the Office of Naval Research funded a research and development project to build at least one scale model of Columbia. GAO\u2019s prior work on acquisitions shows that successful programs are generally those that set realistic expectations, demonstrate sound system engineering, and have program officials working together to solve problems as they arise. Effective communication and oversight between the Navy, Electric Boat, and Newport News also are important. This testimony is based on GAO-19-229.

In March 2017, the President issued an executive order requiring comprehensive reorganization plans for executive branch agencies. In April 2017, OMB provided guidance to federal agencies for developing their respective reform plans. According to this guidance, the government-wide reform plan was to have been based on the agency reform plans, OMB-coordinated crosscutting proposals, and public input. In addition, OMB\u2019s guidance indicated that OMB would track the progress of the reforms in coordination with the President\u2019s Management Council. OMB\u2019s guidance also stated that it would track progress of the reforms by leveraging the federal performance planning and reporting framework that was originally put into place by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), and significantly enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). Accordingly, OMB\u2019s guidance explained that progress would be tracked through the use of cross- agency priority (CAP) goals, agency priority goals, and Performance.gov. In June 2018, the administration released its government-wide reform plan, Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations (reform plan). In July 2019, the administration reported on the first year of progress toward its reform proposals. OMB officials said that they are not planning to move forward with the customer experience improvement capability reform during fiscal year 2020 because they are pursuing other customer experience activities, such as those included in the CAP goal for Improving Customer Experience with Federal Services. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 included provisions that resulted in the transfer of the remaining background investigation operations from OPM to DOD. The executive order also called on the Secretary of Defense to establish a DOD-wide personnel security and suitability system, and it further directed DOD to develop and issue DOD-wide policies to govern the personnel security and suitability policies, as well as DOD\u2019s personnel security and suitability oversight, responsibilities, and authorities. OMB and DOD subsequently published this guidance through two interagency memoranda, as well as accompanying guidance. For background investigations transferred to DOD, OPM still continues some functions \u2013 primarily related to its investigations of DOD personnel \u2013 as OMB directed. Additionally, in line with the intent of the executive order, OPM transferred all personnel who formerly performed background investigations for the federal government to DOD-managed positions. As such, OPM retains only a handful of employees to perform its own personnel security functions. For OPM, the new organization structure includes 450 personnel security positions, including approximately 250 positions that perform the personnel security clearance evaluations and adjudications functions. In early May 2019, OPM published an organization structure for its Security and Suitability Directorate, and, as discussed in this recommendation, OPM still intends to establish a centralized personnel suitability adjudicatory unit within the Directorate. For DOD, the organization structure includes 1,797 positions related to personnel security and suitability functions for all of its military, civilian, contract, and reserve forces. As of", "In the Santa Cruz River Basin and Tijuana River Valley watersheds, which straddle portions of the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border, water flows north from higher elevations in Mexico into the United States. Both countries have infrastructure along the border to manage, divert, and treat wastewater, including sewers, pipelines, and treatment plants, in addition to the two international wastewater treatment plants in the United States. The Nogales and South Bay plants are located in the middle and lower end of the Santa Cruz River Basin and Tijuana River Valley, respectively. Figure 1 shows the location of the international wastewater treatment plants along the border. In 2018, USIBWC treated more than a combined 14 billion gallons of sewage at the Nogales and South Bay international wastewater treatment plants. At the Nogales plant, USIBWC treated 4.5 billion gallons of sewage\u2014an average of 12.45 million gallons per day from the city of Nogales in Sonora, Mexico. In addition, the plant treats an average of 2 million to 2.5 million gallons per day of sewage from the Arizona cities of Nogales and Rio Rico. The Nogales plant discharges treated wastewater through a pipeline, called the South Bay Ocean Outfall, into the Pacific Ocean. Both watersheds are located in arid regions characterized by infrequent but sometimes intense precipitation that forms short-lived streams or washes that fill with water during such events but may be dry at other times. These high-precipitation events lead to high levels of stormwater runoff. IBWC\u2019s mission is to provide binational solutions to issues that arise during the application of U.S.-Mexico treaties regarding, among other things, water quality and flood control in the transboundary rivers. In the 1944 treaty, Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande, the United States and Mexico agreed to apportion their shared waters and authorized construction of various infrastructure to manage and control the rivers. As part of this effort, USIBWC is responsible for operations and maintenance of the International Outfall Interceptor from the Nogales wastewater treatment plant (that conveys the treated wastewater through the border area) and for flood control in the Tijuana River Basin. In addition, USIBWC monitors waters along the U.S.-Mexico border to ensure U.S. standards are met, and maintains certain equipment (such as pumps and valves) along the border necessary for wastewater treatment and/or flood control. 2. USIBWC Is One of a Number of Agencies That Operates or Maintains Wastewater Infrastructure along the Border A number of federal, state, and local agencies operate or maintain sewage infrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico border. The International Outfall Interceptor that carries treated wastewater through the U.S.-Mexico border from the Nogales wastewater treatment plant is owned by the State of Arizona through the International Interceptor Committee (IIC). USIBWC and the IIC have an agreement whereby USIBWC takes responsibility for operating and maintaining the interceptor from the Nogales plant. USIBWC and EPA, as authorized by the 1944 treaty, will operate and maintain two additional interceptor outfalls and treatment plants that will be located in the Santa Cruz River Basin and the Borderlands region, respectively. A sewage pipeline is currently being built along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Santa Cruz River Basin to carry treated wastewater from the Santa Cruz County (Tucson) wastewater treatment plant to Mexican treatment plants. Once the new sewage pipeline in the Santa Cruz River Basin is completed, it may be operated and maintained jointly between the IBWC and EPA, as authorized by the 1944 treaty, or it may be operated and maintained by the International Joint Commission. 3. IBWC and EPA Are Jointly Operating and Maintaining the Tumac\u00e1cori Wastewater Treatment Facility and its Associated Outfall Pipeline Along the U.S.-Mexico Border As also authorized by the 1944 treaty, IBWC and EPA are jointly operating and maintaining the Tumac\u00e1cori wastewater treatment facility, which serves the city of Nogales, Arizona.

Our recent work has shown that OJP\u2019s OAM can strengthen its oversight of grantees by taking steps such as implementing a common-format desk review process, applying more rigor in risk assessing the desk review process, and conducting regular reviews to monitor performance. Further, our work has determined that OAM has not consistently conducted all of the desk reviews that it was required to perform and that it lacks documentation showing that desk reviews were conducted as intended. Without proper controls, weaknesses in oversight could increase the risk that federal dollars are misused and abused, leaving them vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, while OAM and OJP have taken some steps to strengthen the Title II Formula Grant Program, others are still needed to ensure that the funding is used as intended. As a result, the following is one of two mandated audits that the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) will conduct of oversight efforts to help ensure program integrity and that Title II formula funding is efficiently and effectively spent. To accomplish our objective, we will interviewed OAM officials and analyzed relevant information provided by OAM, including desk review plans and financial summary reports. Moreover, we will validate certain items in OAM\u2019s database to confirm that appropriate oversight desk reviews have occurred with Title II Formula Grant Program financial awards. Objective: To help ensure that OJP/OAM implements effective oversight controls, we will determine whether desk reviews are properly conducted on Title II Formula Grant Program financial awards by (1) determining the extent to which OAM implemented a desk review process consist of a form that identified the basic information being reviewed for desk review purposes; (2) determining the extent to which all of the desk reviews required by the relevant policies were properly and consistently conducted; and (3) determining the extent to which OAM consistently maintained records verifying that the desk reviews of financial awards were conducted as intended. Methodology: For this performance audit, we focused our evaluation of OAM Oversight controls on desk reviews of financial awards to states administered by OAM\u2019s Financial Audit Section (FAS). We selected our sample in conjunction with the office of State and Local Oversight Coordination (SLOC) and OAM FAS officials. A more detailed explanation of our evaluation procedures are presented in appendix IX. We assessed OAM\u2019s implementation and administration of its desk review policies, procedures, and performance expectations from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Specifically we evaluated: (1) the extent to which OAM implemented a desk review process that was in accordance with relevant policies; (2) the extent to which all of the desk reviews of financial awards, identified in those policies, were properly and consistently conducted; (3) the extent to which OAM maintained records verifying that those desk reviews of financial awards were conducted as intended; (4) challenges and risks associated with OAM\u2019s oversight, related to program integrity, resulting from the lack of a common data and process for reviewing financial awards; and (5) the accuracy and reliability of financial summary reports maintained in OAM\u2019s database for those desk reviews. Results: Our evaluation determined the extent to which OAM implemented a desk review process that was in accordance with relevant policies, whether all desk reviews of financial awards, identified in relevant policies, were performed, and the extent to which OAM maintained records verifying that those desk reviews of financial awards were conducted as intended; however, we did not determine the accuracy and reliability of OAM\u2019s financial summary review findings and conclusions. In summary, for the desk reviews we reviewed, we determined: OAM implemented a desk review process that was in accordance with OAM\u2019s related policies. Overall, 48 percent of the desk reviews identified in the policies OAM reviewed were not conducted within the timeframe specified (i.e., within 12 months of the start of a fiscal year or within 3 or 6 months after a financial award\u2019s closeout date, depending on the policy), according to the financial summary reports maintained in OAM\u2019s database. We validated that a majority of these reviews were not conduct by noting that the majority of the non-performing reviews could be found in the reports submitted either via email or as an audit narrative in the database. The extent of review performed varied from review through review; all reviews performed according to OAM policy did not necessarily follow a similar methodology in completing", "For many people, the term \"financial statement\" usually refers to an organization's balance sheet, profit and loss (P&L) statement (otherwise known as an income statement), statement of cash flows, or other statement reporting information about the organization\u2019s financial activities.

Text: You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Within the executive branch, both OMB and GSA provide leadership in managing federal real property. OMB, among other things, issues policies and memorandums, including the RTF policy discussed below. GSA has dual roles with regard to the management of federal real property. First, GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy supports the implementation of OMB\u2019s real property policies, including RTF, by collecting and analyzing federal real property data and providing agencies with guidance on leading practices. According to GSA officials, GSA and OMB coordinated to develop data analysis methods to monitor agencies\u2019 performance in meeting OMB\u2019s real property policies, and OMB approved the methods that are used. Second, as the federal government\u2019s principal landlord, GSA\u2019s PBS acquires, manages, and disposes of federally-owned real property for which it has custody and control on behalf of agencies that occupy it, and leases commercial space on behalf of agencies. In these cases, GSA manages the lease agreements. We refer to both of these types of properties as GSA-managed space. All of the agencies obtain at least some of their office space through GSA\u2019s PBS; in fact, two-thirds of the 23 agencies\u2019 office space is made up of GSA-managed space. Agencies pay rent to private landlords when directly leasing space and are responsible for operating and maintaining directly-owned property. Agencies must report, among other things, the square footage and costs to rent, operate, or maintain such properties to the FRPP database, which GSA maintains. As part of the Efficiency Plans, GSA reports these performance measures on performance.gov and to Congress in annual reports, and provides measures for agencies to use in their Efficiency Plans. According to these data, the 23 civilian agencies reduced more than 6 million square feet of office space from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018. *This was done at the time I was an intern.\nQ.

GSA requires agencies to establish programs for managing their excess property, but is not required to provide oversight of how agencies meet property warehousing requirements. For example, GSA does not require agencies to secure property by installing locks, although a majority of the agencies we reviewed had performed or planned to perform locks. Our review of agencies\u2019 warehouses that receive federal excess property found many in need of repairs and renovations. All of the agencies we reviewed reported problems meeting the property warehousing requirements, and only EPA had established an interagency office for excess property management.", "While VHA has policies to disqualify providers who have a negative licensure background, as well as requirements to complete periodic credentialing reviews,  providers may be employed if not aware of current policies or if unaware of a provider\u2019s history.

In both cases, Russian \u201chybrid war\u201d techniques were used to intimidate targeted countries. These strategic operations are a mixture of conventional and unconventional tactics, target the political, economic, and psychological dimensions of potential adversaries, and use plausibly-deniable sources of military action to achieve political goals.\nThe hearing\u2019s focus was not limited to Russia\u2019s activities, however, and the committee\u2019s leaders also directed their remarks toward the current tensions between Turkey and NATO. In 1999, Turkey joined the alliance to defend itself against Russia, but by the turn of the century, the European Union (EU) appeared to be a greater threat. This shift of priorities contributed to the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq and continued to dominate NATO\u2019s response to the turmoil in Syria. The hearing called for the EU to reinvigorate its relationship with Turkey to deter further Russian aggression in the Middle East.\nIn both case studies, NATO\u2019s lack of an adequate deterrence strategy was a crucial factor. As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) noted, the 2014 takeover of Crimea is a \u201cclassic example\u201d of Russian military aggression in Europe, as is its involvement in Donetsk\u2019s breakaway from Ukraine. Similarly, the recent war in Syria is \u201can example of Russia\u2019s willingness to leverage its influence and use its military power to change the strategic reality in Europe, which puts NATO in a very difficult position.\u201d NATO, however, has not learned from its actions in the past to develop an adequately strong deterrence strategy for these confrontations.\nNATO\u2019s weak counterproposal when faced with an adversary aggressor, like Russia, is one reason for this shortcoming among the 29 countries that make up the alliance. If the threat is severe, as in the case of Syria, NATO may respond by sending troops. However, because membership in NATO is not compulsory, the alliance needs to make membership worthwhile in order to generate an effective defense against an aggressor. Currently, the benefits of membership seem weak, and the European allies have begun pulling their financial commitment from the alliance.\nAs a result of the recent Ukraine-Russia conflict, NATO is beginning to change its attitudes and become less trusting of Russia. However, one of the members of NATO, Turkey, is leaning toward Russia. One example is the S-400 surface-to-air missile system that Russia provided to Turkey and has been used during the Syrian conflict. NATO had refused to admit Turkey because of its refusal to recognize the State of Israel, but it appears that the alliance will be forced to change its stance, since the S-400 sale has solidified Russia\u2019s and Turkey\u2019s cooperation in fighting in Syria. Russia will also assist Turkey in upgrading its F-16V fighter jets and will continue to allow Turkey to use its facilities for training and logistics.\nIf Turkey continues to strengthen its relationship with Russia to the point at which it is no longer integrated in NATO\u2019s defense system, the alliance will be faced with another challenge to its strength. At first, NATO\u2019s defense will be undermined through its diminishing capability to carry out air-defense missions. It is difficult for a single nation to provide air defense, but 29 countries are even less able to do", "The platform economy is relatively new. Its rise has been tied to the development of the iPhone and Apple \u2018s app store, which launched in 2008. Smart phones and apps made it easier for people to develop online marketplaces where buyers and sellers could connect to exchange goods. Since then, more platform companies have emerged, expanding into marketplaces for a host of services. This expansion has increased the ways in which people could sell their services or goods and lowered the barriers to entering this type of work. Platform companies generally facilitate the match, transaction, and payment between those seeking goods or services online and those providing them. Platform companies can be divided into marketplaces for services or goods and can be further divided into two types of services\u2014transportation or other types of services\u2014and two types of goods\u2014retail or short-term rental. See figure 1 for a description of the different platform company marketplaces. Transportation platforms comprise the largest sector of the platform economy\u2014by revenue and number of workers\u2014and include companies like Uber and Lyft. Examples of platform companies providing other types of services include Care.com (child or senior care) and Upwork (a range of freelance services). Retail platforms like Etsy and eBay provide an online marketplace for goods. Companies that facilitate short-term rental include Airbnb (property) or Kerb (parking spaces). Platform companies also vary by the number and degree of specialization of services offered. For example, platform companies could be differentiated by the range of services offered, from those that offer a single service, such as transporting people and goods, to those that are a one-stop source to access workers specializing in an array of fields such as legal, information technology, marketing, writing, design, and accounting. Further, Companies also do not have to withhold and remit Federal Income or employment taxes for independent contractors. Instead, the worker is responsible for estimating, saving, and remitting these taxes each quarter to IRS. SB/SE oversees taxpayers filing tax returns as self-employed individuals with business income, such as independent contractors, and businesses with less than $10 million in total assets. SB/SE also takes enforcement actions such as audits to pursue non-compliance, although with budget cuts, the number of audits has dropped considerably over time. While the nature of the work may be similar, key differences exist among these workers. Traditional independent contractors directly provide their services to and receive payments from a business or an individual customer. Employees provide their services through an employer who pays them wages. Unlike the other two types of workers, the platform worker provides his or her services to a customer through a marketplace and his or her income comes from fees paid by the customer to the marketplace. Companies have classified and marketed platform workers as independent contractors, which is the focus of our report. 4 Figure 1 describes the marketplaces for services and goods. Figure 2 summarizes the key information and tax differences between the traditional independent contractor, platform worker, and employee, as well as the different payment arrangements\u2014marketplace (platform company), platform company/marketplace (marketplaces that the platform company has facilitated), and business. A traditional independent contractor enters into a contract with a customer (business or individual) and provides services directly to the customer, often with the assistance of an accountant or agent. The independent contractor is self-employed (not an employee) and receives remittances from the customer for payroll taxes, unemployment taxes, and income taxes as an individual. In addition, most independent contractors operate through small unincorporated businesses (partnerships or sole proprietorships). These businesses have a business license but no employees, make payments to contracting workers and subcontractors for services, and may or may not have a payroll department. Platform workers and their employers are engaged in long-term business relationships with an expectation of continued and recurring service work. This makes the platform worker\u2019s employment relationship similar to that of an employee\u2019s (as distinguished from the independent contractor\u2019s) relationship with her customer. The only exception is that the customer is no longer the worker\u2019s employer; instead, the platform company (marketplace operator) is the employer. While the nature of the work may be similar, the customer is no longer entitled to direct or control specific aspects of the work but merely buys the workers\u2019 services and directs the type of worker needed (such as driver versus nurse or general laborer). As a result, the platform worker is paid per time", "Airline Customer Service Agents Have Difficult Jobs and Face Patient and Clients Can Have a Rough Flight Page 1 of 8 August 2019.\nSummary/Abstract: FAA\u2019s 2018 Federal Aviation Regulation Part 125 Aircraft Operators, Continued Airworthiness, and Flight Crew Member Rest Requirements final rule did not include some of the information required by section 125 of the Vital Aviation Act of 2010 to establish crewmember rest periods and to provide the necessary authority for the FAA.\nAudit and Inspection Coverage of Comptroller General Findings and Recommendations\nEvaluation of DOT\u2019s Procedures for Processing Consumer Claims and Its Process for Handling Claims Processed by the Wage and Hour Division\nInspector General's Semiannual Report: Semiannual Report for the Period Ending: March 31, 1998\nAviation-Related Recommendations Included in Prior OIG Reports Issued within the Past Fiscal Year, and Management's Plans To Address These Recommendations\nImplementation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\nImplementation Of Procedures Adopted Under Executive Order 12777, July 2, 1991, \u201cImproving Regulation And Regulatory Review\u201d\nEvaluation - OIG 1 7.2.1, 2 8.6.1\nEvaluation - OIG M 3. 9.9\nFAA's Process For Obtaining Ownership And Operating Information On Aircraft Manufactured To Date", "NNSA is executing, and plans to carry out, nine major weapon programs and a range of other efforts involving billions of dollars and decades to complete. These programs are complex, require technical innovation, and have encountered significant delays\u2014for example due to technical challenges\u2014in the past. NNSA has plans to consolidate its nuclear production at two new cleanup sites, Los Alamos and Pantex, but no comprehensive plan that includes needed safety and security upgrades, and could result in additional cost and delay to NNSA programs. To meet its weapons responsibilities today, NNSA must maintain its infrastructure and capabilities to produce plutonium, highly enriched uranium, and tritium. However, NNSA\u2019s facilities and capabilities to produce such materials are aging and require new infrastructure for safety and security and technical efficiency. NNSA plans to manage these projects through its Cleanup Project and CAP, but is at risk of failure to adequately fund them. NNSA must also meet its stockpile obligations while addressing numerous operational risks that could lead to further delays, including potential impacts to NNSA\u2019s production infrastructure. To address these risks, GAO recommended that the Secretary of Energy improve project management. DoD partially concurred with the recommendation, noting ongoing actions it is taking to implement GAO\u2019s recommendations. For the 2020 President's budget, NNSA sought a $2 billion increase over 2019 enacted levels, but only a $545 million or 2.6 percent increase was funded. DoD partially concurred with our prior recommendation to track the cost increases for the LEPs. However, DoD did not concur with our recommendation for NNSA to document the reasons for its current project assumptions. NNSA plans to continue the production of the B61-12 while addressing several program risks, but its plans for other LEPs were unclear. Although the Department of Energy (DOE) has planned for continued support for the Weapons Activities mission, NNSA\u2019s long-term budget planning remained insufficient because NNSA only projects 5 years ahead due to the volatility of the stockpile, which is insufficient to mitigate risk for many aspects of the mission and NNSA programs. The Department of Defense (DOD) agreed with our recommendations to track long term program costs, to document the basis for specific cost assumptions, and for DOD and NNSA to consider long-term budget plans when identifying program risks. ACTION REQUESTED: We request that the Secretary of Energy (DOE), as part of the NNSA FY 2020 President\u2019s budget, provide information about how NNSA will address the risks associated with its future LEPs, the current status of its W76-1 LEP, and its schedule for developing a new, science and technology-driven life extension strategy, as well as the associated costs to conduct these LEPs. We also request more detailed information about the technical feasibility and challenges associated with NNSA\u2019s new consolidated nuclear production complexes. In addition, we request information about the scope and purpose of the Pantex Life Cycle Program, and about NNSA\u2019s approach to manage the technical difficulties associated with the reconstruction and renovation contractor\u2019s construction timeline. We also request information about the basis for NNSA\u2019s W78 LEP estimate to meet the stockpile requirement. ACTION REQUESTED: We recommend the Secretary of Energy establish a budget process to ensure it can adequately support NNSA\u2019s long-term stockpile stewardship and management responsibilities while preparing for all hazards and natural catastrophes, including those hazards that may increase substantially beyond historical norms. Specifically, for projecting funding levels for the next 10 years, we recommend using a time horizon long enough to adequately account for the long-term nature of these programs and challenges, as well as for identifying and mitigating program risks.\nRisk-based assessment of program funding needs could lead to better decision making for program planning (see GAO-15-571).\nSee all 7 recommendations\nAction requested\nThe Secretary of Energy should 1) determine the rationale for selecting the specific time horizons employed; 2) document the basis for any cost assumption; and 3) evaluate the risks associated with its LEPs to help mitigate these risks, including how potential budget uncertainties are incorporated into its baseline.", "IRA owners are not permitted to engage in certain prohibited transactions involving IRA assets.

Procede to summarize the following text.\nTEXT: In 2017, three sequential hurricanes\u2014Harvey, Irma, and Maria\u2014created an unprecedented demand for federal disaster response and recovery resources. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), these hurricanes ranked among the top five costliest on record, costing $125 billion (Harvey); $90 billion (Maria); and $50 billion (Irma). As a result of these storms, Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico faced hardships, including devastation to infrastructure, such as highways and bridges. The island of Puerto Rico in particular was severely affected, which created multiple challenges for federal response efforts. Specifically, within a 2-week period Puerto Rico was hit by both hurricanes Irma and Maria, resulting in power outages that lasted up to 11 months and the need for commodities, such as food and water, and requiring one of the largest recovery efforts in history.\nThe federal response was complicated by several factors, including the remoteness of the island, limited local preparedness, outdated infrastructure, and workforce capacity constraints.\nThe Emergency Relief Program provides assistance to repair or reconstruct highways and bridges on federal-aid highways and roads and bridges on federally owned public lands that have sustained serious damage from natural disasters or catastrophic failures. FEMA is responsible for providing funds to repair and replace roadways damaged as a result of disasters that are not eligible for federal-aid highway funding. Accordingly, FHWA may obligate up to $100 million of funds from the Highway Trust Fund in any one fiscal year for the program. FHWA\u2019s Emergency Relief Program regulations further define policies for the program and the eligible and ineligible costs and activities that are funded under the program. FHWA\u2019s 2013 Emergency Relief Manual is a guide for FHWA and state and local agency personnel for requesting, obtaining, and administering emergency relief funds.\nDamage to highways must be severe, occur over a wide area, and result from the same disaster. Eligible projects include repairing and reconstructing highways, including the approaches, roadside, and bridges to a state of normal functionality and stability, repair of culverts and bridges, and restoration of access and connectivity through temporary roads. Ineligible activities under the Emergency Relief Program are activities for which there is an existing maintenance program; activities for which contracts are completed in advance to be funded with emergency relief funds and no longer considered emergency in nature once funds are obligated; activities where the highway agency has already spent a substantial sum or where the costs associated with the activity are anticipated to be high; activities involving local roads with a rural population of less than 5,000; and reconstruction of facilities on the highway system that are scheduled to be replaced, using other funds, within five years of a disaster or with a planned reconstruction project with substantially the same scope.\nBecause the statute and its regulations are, by necessity, broad, FHWA has published its revised Emergency Relief Manual (ERM) for the 2019 hurricane season, in which the agency outlined its specific processes for preparation and use of emergency relief funds and a review of existing policy, based on the lessons learned from use of prior emergency funds.", "Military recruiting and retention for physicians and/or dentists is very difficult.

Further, even the students, who have served in the reserves, are being treated as outsiders, and often not given a full residency, as well, to credential themselves in their chosen field of specialization. This creates a problem in the future growth of this field. The Military Dental Specialists are being sent over to active duty, as opposed to remaining in a reserve position. This cutback in dental personnel is being made, as there is a movement to have the actual treatment of the infiltrated dental material removed by the actual dentist, rather than making a crown to cover up the fractured tooth, which is what is usually done now. While there is no need for a specialist to do the actual surgical removal, there will be specialist, who will be sent to active duty, thus reducing the numbers of dental personnel being in reserve capabilities. This also contributes to a shortage of specialized military trained dental personnel. There is a need for better management of these dental personnel, rather than having so much of them scattered all over the world. A better use for the non-dental specialist would be in the civilian sector, rather than in the US Military. There seems an overabundance of such personnel in the Army, in particular, and the use or retention of such personnel would be better served in the civilian section, such as in hospitals. A better management of these dental personnel would result in a better use of their training in this field. This also applies to the military doctors. The use in general practice, rather than in the capacity of a military specialist gives the opportunity to utilize special knowledge that they have acquired during their military training. Thus, the utilization of the military doctors is much preferred in general practice, to the use in specialized training. Better utilization in this field has been achieved by establishing, or re-establishing, some of the military field hospitals in the civilian field. This allows for the military personnel to participate in the general health care of this field. A better participation of the military in the general health care would allow for better health care through the country. This would be better for the country, and also be a financial benefit to the military. This is in accordance with the mission of the military, rather a financial benefit. If the misson is to take care of our own military, then establishing and re-establishing the use of military personnel in the civilian field is consistent with that mission. The other alternative to utilize the training and knowledge of the military personnel is as a teacher, or professor, in a civilian medical school. This is in addition to general practice. Military doctors, as well as dental personnel, can be of much benefit to the civilian population by taking part in the teaching of a civilian medical school. By doing this, they can also benefit, rather than having to be sent out to war, or in the process of being trained for \u201ccontingencies\u201d. This is more in line with the mission of the military. It is being done, but there is a need to expand this role or involvement of the military in this capacity. SUMMARY of: Dental Service Officers: Shortfalls and Strategies  The recruitment and retention of Dental Corps officers is a current concern for the Department of Defense. The Dental Corps is experiencing a shortfall in the numbers of doctors who have active-duty military service obligations. With no formal recruiting program in place, Dental Corps leaders feel the shortfall exists because they have become competitors with the medical profession. The current Dental Corps recruiting program is no more than a series of informational meetings and presentations directed at highly qualified students. This method of recruiting is ineffective. The Dental Corps leadership must increase its commitment to Dental Service Officers (DSOs), who are military commissioned medical doctors. Through an official recruiting program, DoD must recognize that all active-duty medical personnel are part of the Dental Corps, and are the future of the Dental Corps. Only then will the Dental Corps regain its strength among the other medical professions. Recently, there have been several initiatives directed at recruiting both medical and dental officers. Some of these initiatives have been: 1. Estab", "This audit was initiated on April 2, 2019. The report was issued by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and was published in October 2019.", "SBA oversees a number of programs designed to provide small businesses with resources and tools, including access to capital, help with federal contracting opportunities, and entrepreneurial counseling and training. Federal procurement regulations generally define a small business as one that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field and that meets the size and criteria or standards established by SBA. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized SBA to establish size standards for determining eligibility for all procurement programs in which small business status is required or advantageous. SBA uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as the basis for its size standards. The standards vary by industry and are generally expressed as the average number of employees over a 12-month period or average annual receipts in the previous 3 years. As of August 2019, employee\u2011based size standards for federal procurement purposes ranged from 100 to 1,500, and revenue\u2011based size standards ranged from $1.0 million to $41.5 million. The number of employees or average annual receipts indicates the maximum size allowed for a business and its affiliates to be considered small. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 required SBA to review at least one\u2011third of all size standards during every 18\u2011month period from the date of its enactment and all size standards at least once every 5 years thereafter. SBA completed the first 5\u2011year review in 2016. According to SBA officials, for industries with $20 million or more in federal contracting annually, SBA also examines the small business share of federal contract dollars relative to the small business share of total industry receipts. \u2022\tAgencies have limited monitoring procedures for the majority of their contractors and small business subcontractors, which may result in increased risk to the government if contracts are not performed as agreed. We reported that we observed significant deficiencies in a cross\u2011section of contractor monitoring plans and procedures for more than half of the contracts we reviewed from 26 contracting agencies. We reported that for 15 of the 25 agencies with whom we discussed the plans and procedures, they told us that they did not have any plans to monitor contractors and that the deficiencies prevented them from detecting poor contractor performance, determining whether requirements were being implemented as intended, or whether performance was being performed within contract time frames. In some cases, we found agencies did not have the plans and procedures in place to monitor contractor performance. For example, a contractor was not required to provide progress technical reports or submit contractor\u2011verified cost data to the agency, which could have resulted in an agency not being aware that some contractual requirements were not being met. Another agency did not make contracting officers accountable for reviewing vendors\u2019 past performance. In another instance, a contractor could not perform requirements required in the contract due to lack of funding and it also inaccurately reported its contract expenditures to the agency. If it had not made these inaccurate reporting of expenditures, the agency would likely have increased its oversight and monitoring of the contract. \u2022\tAgencies need to use a mix of tools in contract management and should rely on metrics to track contract performance. To be effective in managing contract performance and to understand the status and health of the contract, there should be a mix of monitoring and oversight tools. For example, while agencies have used invoice reviews and progress technical reports, some agencies may need to also increase their use of other monitoring and oversight tools, such as more unannounced contractor site observations, to help them better manage contracts. A variety of data tools may be helpful to track contract status, and some agencies have not had metrics in place specific to contract performance monitoring or tracking of contract deliverable timeliness. \u2022\tSBAs subcontracting plan requirements are not effective for monitoring whether contractors are complying with SBA subcontracting goals. While the FAR has requirements to assist agencies in monitoring subcontract commitments, it does not have requirements for contractors to establish specific plans to meet these commitments. SBA requires contractors that subcontract over $100,000 to provide subcontracting plans to demonstrate that they have complied with the Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business, respectively, subcontracting goals. The plans must specify the time period for which the goals are set, including the target for each category of small business subcontracting, and how subcontracting goals will be met. However,", "To receive FEMA assistance under FEMA\u2019s Individuals and Households Program, through which disaster survivors can receive help with housing and other needs, individuals must register by answering a standard series of intake questions. In our May 2019 report, we found that some individuals with disabilities may have faced long wait times and unclear registration questions, and that FEMA\u2019s internal communication across its programs about survivors\u2019 disability-related needs was ineffective. Long wait times: Individuals who tried to apply for assistance using the helpline confronted long wait times, which may have posed greater challenges for those with disabilities. In the days after Hurricane Maria affected Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 when survivors from Harvey and Irma were concurrently contacting the helpline \u2013up to 69 percent of calls went unanswered and the daily average wait time for answered calls peaked at almost an hour and a half, according to our analysis of FEMA data. While long wait times could be burdensome for all individuals, state officials and disability advocates we interviewed said long wait times were especially burdensome for people with certain disabilities, such as those with attention disorders or whose assistive technology prevents multitasking while waiting on hold. In addition, we noted that wait times can be more onerous for survivors without personal transportation or reliable communication or internet connectivity to seek other assistance, even if a friend or neighbor is nearby or at home. Unclear registration questions: FEMA\u2019s registration process did not give individuals a clear opportunity to state they have a disability or request an accommodation because the registration did not directly ask registrants to provide this information. For example, FEMA\u2019s registration form asks specifically whether an individual has a disability, but the question uses \u201cimpairment\u201d language, which some disability advocates told us may not include many people with disabilities who may not think of themselves that way but who could still require or benefit from some accommodations. As a result, the registration process may have under-identified people with disabilities. Ineffective communication across FEMA programs: Individuals may have faced challenges receiving necessary assistance because FEMA did not effectively track and communicate information about individuals\u2019 disability-related needs across FEMA programs after such needs were identified. FEMA officials we interviewed for the May 2019 report explained that in May 2017 the agency launched an initiative to make its data exchange format standard across the agency, so that a \u201cone-stop\u201d FEMA case file can be sent to all FEMA programs, allowing FEMA officials to provide survivors with seamless assistance and for all FEMA programs to be aware of any applicable disability-related needs or requested accommodations. In order for this initiative to improve communication among FEMA programs, officials stated that FEMA must first determine what type of information will be shared across the agency and will later implement such determinations. As FEMA moves ahead with its initiatives to improve data, we encourage it to consider and ultimately implement FEMA officials stated that they recognize how communication across FEMA programs could potentially improve assistance for survivors with disabilities. FEMA officials also stated that the agency expects to issue guidance to its field forces with this initiative, but that such guidance will be issued after FEMA\u2019s case file data exchange standardization initiative has been completed. We expect that FEMA eventually issue such guidance once the initiative is completed. As FEMA works to improve communication and awareness of disability-related needs across its programs, it will be important to not only consider the data-driven efforts outlined above but also to emphasize the importance of including, as appropriate, the specific requests or accommodations indicated in the relevant registrant\u2019s case file. Including these requests and accommodations in the registrant\u2019s case file could help ensure that such needs or requests are addressed.  As an initial step, FEMA should also consider whether the registration process should contain questions specifically asking about accommodations needed during application for assistance.   3", "1.

The number of terminations rose from about 24,000 in fiscal year 2014 to a peak of roughly 82,000 in fiscal year 2016, before declining to about 60,000 in fiscal year 2018. In recent years, a growing percentage of HECMs have terminated because borrowers defaulted on their loans. While death of the borrower is the most commonly reported reason why HECMs terminated, the percentage of terminations due to defaults increased from 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 2). Most defaults were due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or failing to pay property charges. For about 30 percent of terminations, we were unable to readily determine a termination reason from FHA\u2019s data. We also found that servicers\u2019 use of foreclosure prevention options for HECM borrowers was limited or FHA did not have readily available data to assess the extent of use. For example, since 2015, FHA has allowed HECM servicers to offer borrowers who are behind on property charges repayment plans to help prevent foreclosures, but as of the end of fiscal year 2018, only about 22 percent of these borrowers had received this option. Additionally, it is difficult to estimate the universe of HECMs potentially eligible for mortgagee optional election assignments\u2014an option to help nonborrowing spouses stay in their homes after a borrowing spouse dies. Under this option, if required conditions and time frames are met, the servicer can assign the HECM to FHA. The assignment defers repayment of the HECM as long as the nonborrowing spouse fulfills certain conditions. As a result, FHA has begun reaching out to HECM borrowers to inform them of the mortgagee optional election process and ask them to self- identify whether there is a nonborrowing spouse associated with their loan. FHA\u2019s monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the HECM program have weaknesses. Since fiscal year 2013, FHA has used the Home Equity Reverse Mortgage Information Technology (HERMIT) system to collect data on the servicing of HECMs, but the system does not contain comprehensive and accurate data about the reasons why HECMs terminate, a key servicing event. For example, HERMIT data did not always accurately capture termination reasons or non-borrower data from FHA/Ginnie Mae HECM records. Our review of 24,918 terminations found 82 out of a total 305,057 HECMs had different discrepancies in terminations and non-borrower data fields that reflected a potential $2.5 million in financial harm to FHA and borrowers. As a result, we downgraded the reliability of HERMIT data on servicing to limited. Secondly, HERMIT data do not include all the termination reason codes in fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017 that the HERMIT user guide describes. Thirdly, FHA is aware of these and other issues impacting HERMIT data reliability but its monitoring and validation processes for this data system were insufficient and resulted in FHA using inaccurate data. FHA also has not validated HECM servicing activity since it instituted new requirements in fiscal year 2016, and our own analysis shows that there have been HERMIT data errors involving HECM servicing activities over the past several years. Finally, in 2011, FHA began developing and implementing a mortgagee foreclosure/collection performance measure to capture when mortgagees foreclose and collect on HECMs. FHA did not fully develop this measure despite four reports recommending improvements to the FHA\u2019s oversight of HECMs since fiscal years 2007.", "You were great at summarizing those words. Goodjob! Now, let\u2019s test some of the ideas that you wrote down on your summarizing worksheet above. For instance, \u201cthe department produces monthly status reports\u201d.\n29. PROOFREADER/EDITOR \uf075 A good proofreader will be able to analyze the whole piece of text and be able to recognize and correct any mistakes. \uf075 A proofreader is in charge of correcting any errors in the grammar and spelling of the text. \uf075 Once you\u2019re done writing, do a spell check and grammar check. \uf075 Do a final read through to make sure that all necessary information is in there and that everything flows together well.\n34. HISTORY \uf075 History is a critical part of any document, you need to summarize, interpret, and comment on trends. \uf075 It is important to include the history of an argument because the argument is better understood when one is aware of where it is coming from. \uf075 When you are finished making your summary, you need to go back and fill in missing pieces or clarify points with examples or illustrations.\n35. HISTORY \uf075 Here\u2019s some examples of ways that the historical context can help inform your audience about your topic: \uf075 It can explain the source and background of an issue \uf075 It can make up the main point of a report and give readers a better image of the situation \uf075 Example 1: The Vietnam War has a long and complicated history. \uf075 Here you would cite a few events or things that occurred before the war and that made it happen.\n41. FUTURE \uf075 To make the best summary: \uf075 Focus not on facts, but on the main points \uf075 Focus on what the argument tries to prove and its logic \uf075 Focus only on the key words from the article that you have highlighted \uf075 Only include that information is important to grasping the main point of the argument \uf075 Read the entire document over and take notes as you read.\n46. FUTURE \uf075 The only change from the present day is that: \uf075 Everyone has to be paid the same wage for the same job: the same thing can be said about health care. \uf075 Now, the workers will still have competition for their jobs; however, the employers will need to pay them better because they are no longer vulnerable to the threat of being laid off if they complain about their jobs. \uf075 This will lead to more people being able to afford the education that they need, which is a strong tool in order to help change the world.\n53. SOURCES \uf075 How do you know what to include in your summaries? \uf075 As part of your summary, you need to tell your audience or readers where the information is coming from. \uf075 For your sources, use both the author\u2019s name and the actual word. For example: \u201cCarlin (2007)\u201d or \u201cCarlin states that\u201d \uf075 The best place is from a reputable scholar, a professional in the field, and/or a reliable website.\n59. WRITING METHOD \u2013 SECTION \uf075 It is important to find different ways to say the same thing. It helps to be more diverse in your wording. \uf075 When you\u2019re trying to say a lot, say it in a variety of different ways. \uf075 Use parallelism to avoid any run-on sentences or convoluted sentences.\n63. METHOD \uf075 Now that you have found different ways to say this information, you need to make sure that your sentences all work together! \uf075 This means to try and make the sentences follow each other in a natural flow. \uf075 It\u2019s okay to stop a sentence short- don\u2019t keep it going if it makes no sense to you and is not necessary. \uf075 Try not to start out sentences with prepositional phrases or other things. \uf075 Make a sentence that is complete in meaning and meaningful words for communication with the audience. \uf075 Try to avoid fragments.\n69. METHOD \uf075 Another way to express an idea is through the use of an example. \uf075 It is important to not just copy and paste what the author has done unless it is necessary for the summary. \uf075 You should strive to think of examples that are applicable to your case. \uf075 The simplest way to present an example is just using a statement", "We have previously reported on how federal agencies were planning to protect their federal workers during a pandemic, as well as lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic, the most recent pandemic experienced by our nation prior to COVID-19.  As a first step, please summarize the following text in your own words. I used the first paragragh of the text. Agencies should maintain continuous communication with employees, and their representatives, during a pandemic. In particular, agencies should identify employee concerns and communicate human capital guidance such as pay, leave, staffing, and other human capital flexibilities to employees to help to ensure the continuity of agencies\u2019 operations and mission essential functions. Agencies should also decide how to handle a variety of other human resources policies, such as those which allow personal and sick leave, annual leave, advanced annual leave, and unscheduled leave, and compensatory time, as well as retirement, and work-life balance and flexibility policies. As agencies consider reorganizing their workforces, they should understand how the various human resources policies impact employees. It can be helpful for agencies to update policy and procedure guidance as new human resources policies come into play. Agencies can also conduct training and use other methods of communication to educate employees and their representatives on what agencies expect from them and what employees and their representatives can expect from agencies.", "Excess defense articles are items that are no longer needed by the DOD that meet various eligibility requirements determined by the State Department and are transferred to other countries.

Objective planning is normally for a specific program or individual case. The planning is a function of the Case Team, CTF, CPO, DCS and/or DAC and is reviewed by IMA. Objective audits typically focus on one or more performance or compliance issues, and objectives are stated in terms of specific criteria. The auditor must be clear in stating objectives for an objective review. Objective audit criteria are derived from established program and case audit plans, agency inspection criteria, or program risk assessment results. Objectives are more specific than audit objectives. Objective audit criteria should be expressed in measurable terms (e.g., number of actions taken or not taken, corrective action implemented or not implemented). Auditors should use clear, measurable criteria and perform audit tests related to the criteria defined. For example, if the objective is \"competition in full and open bidding for defense procurements,\" auditors should test on the extent of competition and not whether a procurement was done openly or not. Compliance audits address whether an activity is operating in", "The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is tasked with coordinating national efforts to address drug use. ONDCP is also required to provide Congress with annual progress reports detailing the efforts involved in drug control and the results. Our prior work has highlighted many of the challenges that ONDCP has experienced in ensuring that its plans for drug control align with the laws that create these responsibilities. Since 2015, ONDCP has not timely released or provided to Congress a clear plan for the overall National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS), and has made inconsistent drug policy changes without any guidance or information.  Further, ONDCP has not effectively carried out the NDCS, and our work has consistently recommended improvements in this area. As a result, we recommended that ONDCP issue its 2019 NDCS by March 1 and update Congress in a timely manner on its progress in making changes to the NDCS. This is the second of three reports that will discuss our findings. We are also reviewing ONDCP\u2019s execution of the NDCS through a follow-up performance audit to assess ONDCP\u2019s implementation of the NDCS, which is summarized in the first report.

Medical providers assess victims\u2019 clinical conditions; provide appropriate treatment and medical referrals; and, given consent by the victim, collect forensic evidence through a sexual assault forensic examination that may follow steps and use supplies from a sexual assault evidence collection kit. Under its protocol for sexual assault forensic examinations, the Department of Justice (DOJ) recommends that medical providers collect a range of physical evidence. In addition, sexual assault forensic exams typically include documenting biological and physical findings such as cuts or bruises and a victim\u2019s medical forensic history, such as the time and nature of the assault. Once the exam is complete, medical providers preserve the collected evidence, which may include packaging, labeling, and sealing evidence collection kits and storing kits in a secure location. Medical providers typically perform such exams only for acute cases of sexual assault, such as in cases where the assault occurred within the previous 72 to 96 hours, when the physical and biological evidence on a person\u2019s body or clothes is considered most viable. DOJ, IAFN, and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommend that sexual assault forensic exams be performed by specially trained medical providers\u2014known as sexual assault forensic examiners (examiners). These examiners include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other advanced practice nurses who have received specialized education and have fulfilled clinical requirements to perform sexual assault forensic exams. Examiner programs have been created in hospital or non-hospital settings whereby specially trained examiners are available to provide first-response care and examinations to sexual assault victims. DOJ administers several grant programs that aim to, among other things, improve response to and recovery from four broad categories of victimization\u2014domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. In our March 2016 report we describe three key grant programs administered by DOJ\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women that could be used by grant recipients\u2014including states or other eligible entities\u2014to fund or to train sexual assault forensic examiners. While IAFN reported that, as of September 2015, there were 1,182 nurses with an active IAFN SANE certification in the United States, such data do not represent all practicing examiners nationwide. For example, 703 examiner programs nationwide voluntarily reported to IAFN\u2019s examiner program database; and some health care settings where sexual assault forensic exams are conducted, such as child advocacy centers, are not represented. IAFN officials stated that this is a result of a voluntary surveillance effort by a limited number of voluntary examiner programs that have volunteered their names and information on their SANE programs via a survey. Given that many medical providers performing sexual assault forensic examinations are not certified examiners, DOJ does not have reliable federal data on the total number of medical providers certified as examiners. Furthermore, we reviewed key DOJ documents related to the certification of examiners, such as those related to certifying organizations, and found no documentation of guidelines or time frames from which we could develop recommendations. IAFN officials told us that they had not formally evaluated the quality of their curricula but did report that some examiners have received training from IAFN and other organizations and are able to provide first-response sexual assault forensic examinations. Moreover, they stated that IAFN and state organizations that have training curricula will often certify examiners trained in their training programs and/or from training programs by other state organizations and/or IAFN. We reviewed IAFN\u2019s current certification procedures. As of September 2015 IAFN allowed IAFN\u2019s certifying organizations to determine their own certification requirements. Furthermore, IAFN did not formally evaluate the quality of their training curricula; rather, they relied on the certifying organizations to do so. In addition, we noted that the certifying organizations, which have been credentialed by IAFN, can vary widely in size and scope, and may conduct less intensive training than other states or organizations. For example, two examiner programs that had been certified by IAFN conducted training programs that, according to IAFN officials, lasted 8 hours", "A passenger who is a U.S. air carrier eligible air passenger (i.e., a passenger with a valid ticket for a regularly scheduled USDOT-certificated air carrier) may be denied boarding by an air carrier under the following conditions: [i.e., for non-safety reasons]- The flight on which the space is needed for boarding is an oversold flight. [ii.e., the flight has more passengers booked than seats on the flight.]-The passenger does not present for boarding when required as indicated on their ticket. [iii.e., a passenger is tardy for boarding and misses the boarding process by the air carrier. A new rule, effective in April 2019, requires airlines to notify passengers more than 2h. prior to scheduled departure if an involuntary denied boarding will occur.]-One or more crew members need to fly on the flight to begin work. [iv.e. this crew duty rule does not apply to passenger flight segments where the flight segment was sold with the inclusion of the crew members and the crew members are not required to begin service on the flight. See below.]-The maximum available incentive offer made by the airline in exchange for a passenger\u2019s relinquishing his or her seat and voluntarily denied boarding- The passenger has a ticket for travel on one carrier that is interlining with another carrier. [i.e., the passenger has a ticket purchased for travel on one airline and is traveling on that airline, then due to a substitution of equipment or delays or cancellation, transfers from one airline to another airline at the same airport or a nearby airport. The new rule does not apply in cases of substitution of equipment but does apply if the passenger has a non-expedited itinerary or an unexpedited itinerary where one or more itinerary segments is on the same air carrier and the passenger\u2019s ticket was purchased at least 24 hours before departure. Also not included are airlines where a passenger switches on an itinerary where all the air carrier segments are on the same carrier.]-The passenger is traveling on a code-sharing flight (a flight operated by one carrier but marketed by another under a code-sharing agreement). [i.e., the passenger\u2019s itinerary includes any flight segments that involve one airline but is marketed under the name of either carrier, and both airlines share the flight.]-A passenger has a non-refundable ticket and the space can be used for operational use. [i.e., a business/operational flight need which the air carrier did not anticipate and will not be used to provide a substitute flight. See below.]-A passenger has a non-refundable ticket and the space can be used for operational use, but the flight segment to which a passenger is ticketed is cancelled due to a mechanical problem prior to the departure time on the ticket. [i.e., this provision applies if the air carrier is using the substitution to transport crew.]-The passenger travels on a code-sharing flight and the flight on which the passenger is denied boarding is cancelled due to a mechanical problem prior to the departure time the passenger was assigned to that flight. [i.e., this provision applies only if the substituting carrier is using the substitution to transport crew.] A new rule, effective in April 2019, requires airlines to notify passengers more than 2h. prior to scheduled departure if an involuntary denied boarding will occur. Further, the rule requires the compensation be offered at the gate prior to boarding. As for airlines that board through the mobile-boarding, the rule requires that this be done via mobile phone during the mobile-boarding process. Air carriers may not proactively seek out individuals with confirmed bookings on flights with oversold space for the purpose of offering compensation. The air carrier must first open the booking process-of-choice to eligible passengers (i.e., passengers who qualify as ticketed travelers or who voluntarily check in for a reservation), and then provide the compensation offer when the booking process-of-choice has reached its capacity. In addition, if a passenger purchases, or otherwise receives compensation and decides to fly another air carrier, the passenger must be compensated at the same level the first air carrier provided. The rule limits compensation to 20% of the price of a one-way economy fare. For the flights that are purchased in bundle (i.e., round trip), including bundle flights that connect, the rule limits the compensation to the 20%", "Text has been summarized.\nSERVICES FOR FAMILIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS", "A VA fact sheet was published on the summary and analysis of the Veterans' Choice Program. According to the fact sheet: The Veterans\u2019 Choice Act of 2014 provided up to $10 billion in funding for Veterans to obtain health care services from community providers. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided funding and some temporary authority to extend the Veterans Choice Program, and the VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded this authority through June 6, The fact sheet also noted, among other things, that the Choice Program established a permanent program to meet this need and created an electronic records system: VA is required to consolidate all of these programs into one community care program. The report is here: https://www.vets.gov/sites/default/files/VCP_Summary_of_Changes_January.pdf.\n* VA has established a permanent community care program through the enactment of the VA MISSION Act, which required VA to develop an electronic records system for its community providers, as was noted by the TPAC in one portion of its report.  * VA's new community care system will require providers to be eligible for Medicare reimbursement. The TPAC also commented on how VA's FY2020 funding request will be lower than its request for FY2019.

Various parties have recommended that federal regulations mandate use of uniform date labels in an effort to limit consumer confusion over date labels. In 2015 Congress directed GAO to review date labeling on foods. This report discusses U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service's authority to regulate date labels and USDA's support for states that choose to regulate date labels on meat and poultry products and FDA's authority to recommend and regulate date labels of certain foods as well as the consumer misunderstanding of date labels. The report also contains GAO's recommendations to FDA and USDA. To address the specific recommendations, we are contacting FDA and USDA to discuss our findings. What GAO Recommends GAO is making the following recommendations: USDA should issue guidance addressing questions on its authority to regulate date labels as well as its support for and oversight of states regulating such labels. GAO has made recommendations related to the FDA\u2019s authority on date labels and federal oversight of those entities that choose to regulate such labels. We have included these recommendations in our report. USDA agreed with GAO\u2019s draft recommendations and will address them in its forthcoming final guidance. FDA agreed with all of GAO\u2019s recommendations, and it will incorporate them. View on Garter Page\"\nThis list includes only books.

This funding was not enough for ATF to have all 352 of its special agents in field offices. Instead, ATF uses a staffing model to allocate special agents between field offices and headquarters, where they focus on firearms and explosives policy issues rather than investigations. In accordance with ATF policy, for FY 2019, the agency had 1,369 firearms and explosives special agents in field offices investigating firearms, explosives, and arson cases, including violent criminal gangs. Additionally, 58 explosives special agents are assigned to support other ATF programs, such as the National Response Team, and 80 firearms special agents are assigned to support firearms enforcement and program functions. The remainder of this report summarizes ATF\u2019s operational activities for FY 2019, followed by an analysis of these activities by program area. It addresses the extent to which ATF met performance goals, which include (1) arrest and conviction of individuals manufacturing, distributing, or possessing firearms illegally; (2) prevention of the illegal acquisition of firearms by convicted felons and other prohibited persons; and (3) prevention of firearms from being diverted into the illegal stream of commerce. \u2022\t3.\tReview the second sentence of the third paragraph, above.

On average, special agents spent 22 hours per day on the job. Special agents\u2019 duties include preventing, and investigating criminal and national security threats, such as espionage, terrorism, counterterrorism, public corruption, narcotics, white collar crime, and other cyber-related offenses. As of November 1, 2018, the FBI had 13,467 special agents, who are generally the FBI\u2019s primary investigators into threats to national security in the United States and abroad. Each special agent office has at least one field office. In FY 2018, 15 special agents worked in each branch office. The FBI also has two field offices in Puerto Rico, six offices in Hawaii and Alaska, and 117 satellite offices throughout the country. As of FY 2019, special agents generally spend 22 hours a day working on the job, which includes hours spent on overtime and investigative duties.

GAO reported in January 2006 that the value of DoD\u2019s real property was $507 billion. We estimate that current estimates of the cost to replace DoD\u2019s real property are about $655 billion. We reported in 2005 that the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated there were almost 150,000 public housing units that were older than their design life, which suggests that many are approaching the end of their economic life. We reported in 2010 that an American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) committee rated the overall condition of U.S. infrastructure in 2013 as a D, or poor. We also reported in 2011 that ASCE reported that the percentage of the nation\u2019s surface transportation system that it rated as poor condition increased from one-third in 2009 to more than half in 2013. According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, sea level has been increasing by about 0.1 inches per decade. However, the extent to which these trends will affect the Coast Guard is unknown. The Coast Guard will also face costs to maintain and recapitalize its infrastructure. For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s 2018 shore infrastructure backlog was at least $2.6 billion as of 2018, as we reported in February 2019, and Coast Guard officials have stated that their long-term backlog for both new construction and recapitalization will increase. Further, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reported in 2018 that more than half of the public housing infrastructure\u2014 69 of the 148 public housing developments it tracks\u2014is in locations projected to be affected by climate change. As we have previously reported, FEMA\u2019s mission includes helping to ensure that U.S. communities are safe, secure, and resilient against all hazards. However, FEMA officials have stated that FEMA does not have the authority to force public housing authorities to adopt relocation plans. Also, in a November 2016 report, the Government Accountability Office concluded that flood risk will increase as a result of climate change and that FEMA did not have policies or procedures for assessing the flood risk from climate change. DOCUMENTATION: PART 2/2\n2) The Coast Guard may face additional risks associated with climate change because it maintains shore infrastructure, including runways capable of supporting aircraft, in coastal locations. According to the National Climate Assessment, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events associated with climate change, such as frequent flooding and storms, as well as sea level rise, could affect Coast Guard facilities and related infrastructure such as roads and waterways. Coast Guard infrastructure may also be threatened by sea level rise. NOAA estimates that the average global sea level rose close to 6.7 inches between 190 and 2014, and that sea level is expected to rise by more than 2 feet\u2014enough to threaten the function and location of certain Coast Guard facilities that are located along the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast. Specifically, Hurricane Katrina destroyed approximately 20 percent of the 60 Coast Guard bases that were located in New Orleans. The Coast Guard\u2019s risk and vulnerability assessments have not identified how these additional risks, if any, will affect the Coast Guard\u2019s facilities.\n3) The Coast Guard is a DOD Combat Support Agency and is included under the \u201cClimate Change Resilience and Adaptation Program.\u201d However, the Coast Guard will face costs to maintain, recapitalize, and repair its shore infrastructure and to build new facilities in response to potential effects of climate change as well as flood-related damage. For example, Coast Guard facilities are vulnerable to sea-level rise. In addition, the Coast Guard expects that extreme weather events associated with climate change will increase the occurrence of floods, storms, and resulting damage to its facilities and to the transportation infrastructure that it oversees. We reported in 2014 that FEMA has estimated the cost nationally to replace structures that are damaged by 100-year floods, such as storms, at more than $1.3 trillion. We also reported that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of leading climate scientists convened by the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is expected", "According to OMB, federal agencies reported that they operated 432 data centers in 1998, 2,094 in July 2010, 5,607 in August 2016, and 5,916 in August 2018.  According to OMB, during their period of data collection, agencies also reported savings and realized cost avoidance due to consolidating and optimizing their data centers. According to OMB\u2019s data, agencies reported a total of $1.65 billion in FDCCI savings and cost avoidance. The Department of the Navy reported the largest amount of data center cost avoidance at $87.9 million. The Department of Energy was second with $61.6 million in avoided costs.  In addition, OMB\u2019s data indicate that agencies closed 815 data centers as part of OMB\u2019s efforts to implement FDCCI.

Foreign NGOs may not \u201cperform or actively promote\u201d abortion as part of their activities, except to save the life of the woman, or \u201cpropose abortion as a method of family planning.\u201d Proposing abortion is described as: providing, suggesting, recommending, or actively promoting abortion, performing abortions, or recruiting patients for abortions; and/or: providing or writing prescriptions for abortion medications; marketing abortion, or otherwise facilitating abortions in a third-country; conducting research for the purpose of developing abortion techniques, methodologies, procedures, or medications. Planning refers to the initial consideration to establish a facility that ultimately provides abortion or to \u201cmake abortion available as a family planning method.\u201d Foreign NGOs that receive global health assistance are also required to refrain from \u201cproviding, referring, or acting as an intermediary to or between any other foreign or U.S. organization or individual that performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning.\u201d This language is similar to the language used in previous applications. The PLGHA applies if a foreign NGO has an affiliate that it knew or should have known \u201cperforms or actively promotes abortion\u201d as defined above. The U.S. executive branch expects any international organization receiving U.S. global health assistance that includes a significant portion that is earmarked for specific purposes to separately account for all uses of those funds. This would include accounting, at a minimum, for all abortion-related uses of such funds. Additionally, the PLGHA is not intended to prohibit foreign NGOs that provide abortions as a method of family planning from receiving U.S. global health assistance through another account that does not include any restricted funds\u2014such as those earmarked for family planning. AID/ODI has primary responsibility for implementing the PLGHA under the direction of the director of its Bureau for Global Health. Specifically, AID/ODI has primary responsibility to ensure all foreign NGO awardees receive the PLGHA Terms and Conditions, and to track foreign NGOs that do not accept the conditions. The Departments of State and Health and Human Services both have responsibilities related to the PLGHA, as well as the responsibility for tracking foreign NGOs that do not accept the conditions. The executive branch is taking steps to revise the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to codify the PLGHA and develop a clear legal framework for future administrations to apply and enforce the policy. The executive branch is also taking steps to develop a clear legal framework for future administrations to apply the policy through other means, such as creating a contract clause that would be available to implement the PLGHA through Federal Acquisition Regulation amendments. The executive branch is also taking steps to amend 42 U.S. Code, Title 10 to develop a clear legal framework for future administrations to apply the policy through other means, such as developing a law that would preempt state laws governing abortion, in cases where the policy may apply. The executive branch is making similar revisions to Executive Order 12291 to ensure the policy continues to apply to foreign NGOs if those regulations are rescinded or revised.

Here is a possible format:", "The federal disaster workforce is designed to scale up or down depending on the timing and magnitude of the disaster. Staff assigned to positions that respond to presidentially declared disasters are categorized as: permanent full-time, temporary full-time, on-call, or local hires. According to FEMA, the temporary full-time employees include staff in the incident management and CORE programs. The incident management program includes COREs and reservists. Reservists and COREs are hired directly by and responsible to incident commanders. In addition, incident commanders can hire local temporary employees who are referred to as \u201clocal hires\u201d. However, under the local hires model, a federal employee, who is either a permanent federal employee or one of the temporary federal employees from these other programs, supervises the local hire. FEMA has the authority to augment its disaster workforce during a presidentially declared disaster with volunteers, including CORE volunteers, and contractors, both of whom are referred to as \u201ccontractors\u201d for this brief. FEMA is authorized to hire workers under its CORE program by the Stafford Act of 1988 which states that the Administrator of FEMA may appoint up to 300 employees under a three-year term. FEMA also has the Stafford Act authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, after a presidential disaster declaration, to \u201cprescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out this chapter\u201d, including the authorization to appoint employees to respond to a disaster, the number and grade of workers required to support the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \u201cduring a major disaster or emergency\u201d or to support any state or other jurisdiction receiving federal assistance, and the training and qualifications that prospective employees must meet. FEMA uses its CORE program to augment its disaster workforce for response and recovery operations after a presidentially declared disaster. In 2016 FEMA received about 2,000 applications from people who were interested in serving as CORE members. FEMA has discretion to waive certain job requirements for employment within the CORE program. FEMA officials emphasized the importance of hiring a diverse group of workers for the CORE program, highlighting that FEMA\u2019s diverse workforce is a critical benefit to communities in meeting the needs of disaster survivors. FEMA is authorized to augment its disaster workforce to execute response and recovery operations with volunteers, including CORE members. The agency hires CORE volunteers for one year terms or up to 300 years based upon operational needs for the year. During its most recent peak, FEMA deployed 1,100 CORE volunteers at the direction of the FEMA Administrator. FEMA is authorized to augment its disaster workforce to execute response and recovery operations with contractors. The agency is authorized to use contracting for special skills, experience, technical expertise, information technology products/services, or augmentation to FEMA\u2019s workforce under the provisions of the Stafford Act of 1988. For example, FEMA may contract for work on projects like the Repair, Reconstruction, Renovation, and Mitigation (R4) program. The Administrator of FEMA may appoint as many local hires as necessary to execute the disaster assistance functions described in the Stafford Act. For the last three years, FEMA has hired and trained about 6,000 local hires through its \u201csurge cadre\u201d. During its most recent peak, FEMA deployed 2,300 local hires at FEMA\u2019s direction. FEMA also can hire local hires after a presidentially declared disaster through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS\u2019s) authority to enter into intergovernmental service agreements to \u201cperform nonroutine tasks that require special skills, that are time-sensitive, or in support of mission-critical positions or activities.\u201d Federal employees directly supervise local hires. The DHS Secretary may appoint \u201csuch personnel services under this subchapter as [the Secretary] deems necessary to carry out this subchapter\u201d for work under a mission-critical or time-sensitive task. FEMA is authorized to use contracting for special skills, experience, technical expertise, information technology products/services, or augmentation to FEMA\u2019s workforce under the provisions of the Stafford Act of 1988.

They have also taken steps, such as expanding the HUD-VASH program, to try to end homelessness among veterans within the next 5 years. However, there are many challenges, such as a 1-year delay in HAVEN implementation. To address these challenges, VA, HUD, DOL, and others will need to continue to prioritize coordination among agencies and continue to refine and implement their strategies. In a report accompanying the enactment of the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Act of 2009, GAO noted that a key obstacle to preventing and ending homelessness was the lack of coordination among a plethora of federal agencies that had homelessness programs or served homeless individuals. GAO further found that several agencies had limited knowledge of homelessness programs sponsored by other agencies, and that a centralized, comprehensive, and up-to-date program summary had yet to be created. Congress, too, has taken steps to mitigate this problem. For example, in 1990\u2014after recognizing that in 1989, 18 federal agencies were involved in programs to prevent and end homelessness\u2014Congress instructed GAO in Section 1134 of the Housing and Community Development Act  to prepare a \u201cone-stop\u201d program summary for all federal, state, and local homelessness programs. Since then, Congress has expanded the scope of GAO\u2019s activities by periodically directing GAO to undertake several reviews and assessments focused on ways to better target, coordinate, and communicate federal homeless assistance programs 6 7 0 VA and HUD have jointly established criteria for communities to achieve HUD-VASH certification. 5   . GAO, Preventing and Ending Homelessness: Key Challenges and Collaborative Approaches, GAO-18-623 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Accountability Office, Sep. 2018). Congress, through the McKinney-Vento Act, authorized a national HMIS (National Data Exchange, or NDEX) that is designed to be used by all communities that provide services to homeless people. VA, HUD, and DOL each has an established role in addressing aspects of homelessness for veterans. Specifically, VA and DOL 1   .  VA, HUD, and DOL have worked with Congress and the Administration to address homelessness among veterans. For example, when VA established the HUD-VASH program in 2008\u2014funding rental subsidies for veterans who were participating in VA\u2019s homeless-prevention programs, while enabling the veterans to benefit from HUD\u2019s expertise in providing rental assistance\u2014the program was funded through Congress\u2019 annual appropriations process. However, HUD-VASH funding levels were ultimately provided through the annual President\u2019s Budget and the congressional appropriations process after fiscal year 2010. 2  Also, VA, HUD, and DOL have led, facilitated, or supported efforts to expand or create 15 programs to more effectively address homelessness among veterans. Those programs target homeless veterans, at-risk veterans, and their families, and include rental and utility subsidies and other forms of assistance. For example, VA has 1 . . . programs have expanded to meet the need for additional services. 2 . . . programs have created more comprehensive approaches to serving homeless veterans, 3 . . . programs have attempted to address gaps in services, and 4 . . . programs have refined approaches based on feedback and lessons learned from their experiences serving homeless veterans. VAMC Homeless Outreach Programs. In fiscal year 2019, VA spent about $320 million for its Homeless Outreach Program, which provided outreach and coordination services to homeless veterans, and provided VA case managers with training, information, and outreach materials to identify, screen, and refer homeless veterans to VA health care. VA\u2019s Coordinated Access and Single Point of Entry (CASP) pilot\u2014which implemented a single-point assessment to address concerns related to a lack of comprehensive assessments and coordination among federal homeless programs\u2014showed promising results but did not lead V", "Prepared for Ms. Brenda S.

TSA developed and implemented a program to enhance aviation security, however, the program is just beginning and additional analysis is needed to determine the program\u2019s effectiveness. Aviation security in public areas of the airport may benefit from the use of new technologies TSA may use to monitor activity. A TSA official advised GAO that the agency\u2019s future activities regarding airport public area security may include the use of drones to collect imagery.  OBJECTIVES The objective of this report is to determine whether (1) TSA has implemented any changes to improve the security of airport public areas, and (2) TSA has fully implemented its public area security program in accordance with GAO\u2019s recommendations made in March 2015.  METHODS To address the objectives, GAO reviewed TSA policies and procedures, conducted meetings with TSA officials and representatives of aviation industry stakeholder groups, visited three airports, and interviewed TSA officials responsible for public areas security. GAO also obtained information on 66  U.S. airports in 6 countries to help determine possible vulnerabilities. GAO shared this information with TSA to gauge whether any corrective actions were deemed necessary. GAO selected the airports for its review based on its criteria for airports of interest. These criteria were (1) a primary U.S. international airport, (2) a medium- to large-size international airport, and (3) a domestic hub or an international airport with over 7 million enplanements and a security restriction area. Specifically, we looked at the airports\u2019 security restriction boundaries, the number and locations of access points to the security restriction areas, the public spaces included in both the public and security restricted airport spaces, and the security strategies used by airport operators and TSA when securing space not encompassed in the security restriction areas. TSA classifies a domestic airport as one with 7 million or fewer enplanements and a hub as an airport that has scheduled jet service and is a source of connecting passengers traveling between domestic points. TSA classifies international airports as those that regularly serve international flights with regularly scheduled international services to at least one foreign airport. For airports GAO considered, these included Atlanta, Chicago-O\u2019Hare, Chicago-Midway, Dallas-Ft. Worth, LAX, Las-Vegas, Miami, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Charlotte, HoustonIntercontinental, Jacksonville, Orlando, Omaha, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Tampa, and Washington-Dulles. GAO\u2019s report focuses on commercial airlines; however, private airplanes, commuter planes and general aviation planes travel to and from airports where GAO met with TSA and studied the security architecture. This report also discusses TSA\u2019s program aimed at improving security in airport public areas but does not specifically address whether it is achieving results or improving security.  RESULTS GAO found that TSA has not yet implemented changes to improve the security of airport public areas, and TSA has not yet fully implemented its public area security program in accordance with GAO\u2019s recommendations. Specifically, TSA has taken one key step to address the GAO recommendation, such as implementing its public-area threat assessment process to include all known access points into and within the security-restricted areas that an individual using a public area may potentially attempt to reach. Still, TSA has not yet fully implemented its public area security program in accordance with GAO\u2019s recommendations. For example, this report highlights that TSA is still working to establish a process to assess potential changes to its security program before implementation to better ensure effective controls are in place. For example, a TSA official with knowledge of its public-area security program told us that TSA will determine whether additional controls are needed 2016 REVIEW FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SECURITY IN AIRPORT PUBLIC AREAS 31 before implementing those controls, such as new technologies. TSA recently implemented key security enhancements, such as placing security personnel in the public areas of the airport and deploying a fleet of TSA\u2019s", "FEMA has taken a look at its response to Presidentially-declared major disasters related to wildfires from fiscal years 2009 through 2018.

In 2016, the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act included congressional findings stating, \u201cthrough treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indians...\u201d It is the federal government\u2019s policy to fulfill its trust relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people for the education of Indian children by working with tribes toward the goal of ensuring that Interior-funded schools are of the highest quality and provide for the basic elementary and secondary educational needs of Indian children, including meeting the unique educational and cultural needs of these children. Similar to students in elementary and secondary schools nationwide, some students in BIE schools have documented disabilities that require special educational or supplemental support. More than 6,000 students with disabilities, representing about 15 percent of total enrollment, attend BIE schools. Specific learning disabilities, such as perceptual disabilities, dyslexia, or impairments from brain injury, formed the most prevalent disability category among BIE students with disabilities in school year 2017-2018 (see Table 1), affecting more than half of the students with disabilities at BIE schools (see Table 1). An individualized education program (IEP) is a written statement for each child with a disability designed to meet the child\u2019s individual needs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 20 U.S.C. 1400, et al.) . IDEA requires that children with disabilities identified by the district be referred to be evaluated by the local education agency\u2019s multidisciplinary or evaluation team. With parental consent, the student is then evaluated using a variety of assessment tools and strategies designed to help determine the student\u2019s unique needs. Once a child is evaluated and determined to be eligible for special education and related services under IDEA, an IEP is developed and implemented for each eligible child by the local education agency. IDEA requires that IEPs specify students\u2019 services to be provided or authorized and that the requirements of any identified services be defined and measured in the IEP. To facilitate this process, BIE uses its Native American Student Information System (NASIS) to document students\u2019 IEPs. IDEA includes regulations that define education services and related services as follows: Education services: Education services include those services necessary to ensure that a child with a disability has access to a free appropriate public education, including, but not limited to, instruction in the classroom and at home; instruction in physical education; speech-language pathology and audiology services; psychological services; and vocational and other rehabilitative services, beginning at age 14 and going up to age 21. Related services: Related services are developmental, corrective, and other services required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.

According to FDA\u2019s estimates for imports from June 1, 2014, to May 31, 2015, and compared to the same time period the previous fiscal year, seafood imports increased from approximately $6 million to about $7.4 million; processed seafood increased from nearly $13 million to more than $16 million; and canned (retorted) seafood increased from nearly $449,000 to nearly $5.5 million. In testimony before us in June 2016, senior FDA officials stated that FDA inspectors examine only a small percentage of imported food shipments. In fiscal year 2014, FDA indicated that it performed 2,744 seafood examinations at ports of entry, representing just 1 percent of seafood imports. Our report, A Review of Seafood Import Refusals at FDA\u2019s Import Offices, determined that nearly 13 percent of the refusals of imported seafood occurring in fiscal year 2013 were issued by FDA import offices located within the United States. According to FDA, from June 1, 2014, to May 31, 2015, and compared to the previous fiscal year, the United States exported approximately $829 million worth of seafood and $5.6 billion worth of processed seafood. During the same period, the United States imported approximately $6.5 billion worth of seafood and $124 million worth of processed seafood. Given the increased volume of imports and the continuing large numbers of refusals made at U.S. ports of entry, FDA and CBP have recognized the need to improve information sharing between agencies and enhance collaboration to better prevent importation and distribution by U.S. companies of noncompliant imported seafood. PREDICT also generates results for specific food shipments to facilitate risk-based physical examinations when an entry line is selected for further, targeted review. Prior notice screening results in an Entry Summary Message, which FDA uses to determine which shipments to physically examine further, either at the border or once the food is on the market. The entry summary message also informs FDA\u2019s field personnel of the results of the prior notice screening. Field personnel may, based on information obtained from the prior notice screening, seek enforcement actions against shipments that have not yet entered the country, such as seizures and detentions. If prior notice screening results indicate a risk for filth or for salmonella, FDA recommends that the entry line be reinspected on arrival at the U.S. port of entry. CBP and FDA plan, if a product violates FDA\u2019s seafood HACCP regulations or the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, to have the shipment physically examined at a port of entry. The shipment\u2019s physical examination could result in detaining the entry, placing it under CBP hold, or requiring the importer and foreign supplier to take particular actions\u2014such as obtaining a letter of No Action Assurance from FDA\u2014in order for the shipment to enter U.S. commerce. CBP and FDA are also developing a plan to harmonize FDA actions for seafood with CBP actions, such as refusal of entry of shipments, detention or seizure of products, and penalties. However, FDA has yet to develop and implement a process for issuing decisions related to product refusals from the field for CBP\u2019s use. FDA is working to develop a decision-making process that would include guidance to field personnel and provide for electronic submission of documentation such as laboratory microbiology results by field personnel to allow for assessment and decisions on physical examinations made at U.S. ports of entry. As part of implementing the STEP Act, FDA conducted studies and determined that it needed to make several key operational changes in order to expand its import refusal program. FDA planned to issue a regulation that would add imported food to the list of articles subject to detention without physical examination, as specified in Section 304 of the FDCA. Under the agency\u2019s current regulations, imported food that FDA refuses cannot be admitted, so importers are compelled to have detained imported food re-exported. As a result of the STEP Act, CBP", "There are 4,733 pages of comments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that we have received from the general public from May 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017.

That should be obvious, with health insurance companies topping the list of Fortune 500 companies by return on shareholder capital. If we then add the pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic companies, we can see an industry with solid returns on capital.\nAnd even with the large and growing amounts of money spent on health care, there are many people who do not spend enough time or effort looking after themselves. There are many who do not think about what they are doing and what they are neglecting in their bodies. And there are many who do not ask for help until they are at their point of exhaustion physically.\nIn the United States, the largest component of health care expenses are from the aging and chronic population. Many older folks need extra care.

The law is intended to increase government efficiency and transparency, and to identify opportunities for consolidation and disposal of underutilized or vacant real property. Since its enactment, federal real property data have been tracked manually and in spreadsheets, rather than in a centralized database. In addition, federal real property data were not all being tracked in the same way, and data accuracy was uneven. Finally, the data in the spreadsheets were not made publicly available, a gap in the FRPIA. These limitations contributed to a lack of visibility into federal real property holdings and use across the entire government. FRPIA also mandated a national inventory of federal buildings, and an annual report to Congress on the cost, efficiency, and utilization of federal real estate use. Since 2005, GSA has published these reports. To fulfill the FRPIA reporting requirements for non-GSA properties, GSA required information from other agencies. For example, in 2009, GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy received 398,000 information elements (one element equals one building within an agency or a vacant property) as assets from federal agencies. GSA has compiled its own data and the data of other federal agencies into the Federal Real Estate Ownership Data Act database through which agencies can search information about federal real property. A public interface to this database was released in December 2017. This brief focuses on the accuracy of the public database, which may not meet the statutory requirements. Therefore, our analysis addresses the public interface. While the data in the public database will continue to improve over time in accordance with GSA guidance and policies, this brief describes the current state. Our analysis includes our review of the entire public database, which we downloaded and validated. Further, we reviewed agency guidance and policies applicable to the data submissions and data corrections. Our analysis of the public database covers the time period of October 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018; however, it is possible that data have been added since that time. GSA officials reported to us that updates had been added since that time. To address the accuracy and other issues, we (1) reviewed guidance provided to agencies on submitting data, (2) interviewed a group of agency real property representatives on their efforts to comply with agency requirements, (3) reviewed a random selection of 20 assets. 10\nPursuant to the Federal Data Act of 1973, we validated and found reliable for purposes of the Act, the federal real property data in the public database except where noted in this report. These data were collected from January 1, 2017, to September 30, 2017, with the exception of updates to information posted afterwards or corrections made by other sources. We also found reliable the data validated from prior years in the public database. We also conducted our own data collection for other assets to develop a list of potentially unverified non-GSA assets\u2014nearly 15,000. Based on this list, we validated a sample of 20 federal real property records provided to us through agencies. Validation includes reviewing relevant documentation or agency-provided information against a standard of proof, such as inspector general findings, third-party sources, or other documentation or information. We verified that, except for assets from the 20 previously validated assets, the remaining approximately 237,000 assets contained within the public database are sufficiently complete and accurate. However, we did not verify the accuracy of the street address and suite information contained within the public database. Due to the limitations of the federal property inventory systems, certain elements contained within the public database are not entirely complete. Because of these and other limitations, this report presents information we found reliable for other purposes according to the terms and conditions of the Federal Data Act of 1973. GSA officials provided general instructions on what agencies should do if an individual or agency has reason to believe that information in the public database is inaccurate. However, our interviews and sampling revealed that agencies are not taking advantage of such instructions. Additionally, GSA officials indicated that they will conduct some validation exercises, but these have not yet been initiated. With the exception of these comments, we did not discuss our findings with any agency or inspector general officials outside the scope of this work because they raised significant independence concerns. In addition to the list of potentially unverified", "Nursing homes and assisted living facilities provide important long-term care to vulnerable individuals in institutional or residential settings. Specifically, nursing homes provide care to elderly and disabled individuals, many of whom have physical and cognitive limitations requiring skilled nursing care. Assisted living facilities provide a residential alternative to nursing home care for individuals who prefer to live independently but need assistance to maintain their independence. Like nursing homes, they may provide residents with a variety of services to assist with activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing, but the facilities are generally not licensed to provide 24-hour skilled nursing care and typically offer a more limited range of medical care. As we reported in our January 2018 report on CMS\u2019s oversight of assisted living facilities under the Medicaid program, the demand for assisted living services, which offer the benefit of community living, is expected to increase as a result of the aging of the nation\u2019s population, increased life expectancy, and older adults\u2019 desire to remain in the community. Additionally, the cost of nursing home care for an individual generally exceeds the cost of assisted living facility services, further incentivizing a shift among consumers and payers to assisted living for elderly individuals, including those with increasingly complex health needs who would otherwise need nursing home care. Oversight of nursing homes is a shared federal-state responsibility. Federal law imposes both a comprehensive set of quality standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and federal and state oversight responsibilities to enforce these standards. CMS, which is charged with implementing these standards and conducting federal oversight, contracts with state survey agencies to perform both routine inspections \u2013 known as standard surveys \u2013 and conduct investigations of elder abuse incidents, including complaints and facility-reported incidents.  CMS regional offices monitor state compliance with federal requirements for nursing home oversight. In addition to state survey agencies, state Medicaid agencies, and the agencies that license and regulate assisted living facilities, there are other entities charged with protecting nursing home and assisted living facility residents from elder abuse. These agencies\u2019 roles and missions can vary by state. For example, Adult Protective Services (APS) programs in each state are generally responsible for identifying, investigating, resolving, and preventing abuse of older adults, and such programs may investigate complaints of elder abuse in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Additionally, Medicaid Fraud Control Units and local law enforcement can also play a role in investigating elder abuse. Consequently, incident management may be coordinated among multiple separate agencies. Federal requirements include those for nursing homes and state survey agencies specific to reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement of elder abuse in nursing homes. For example, federal requirements specify the time 240\tADVOCATES FOR PATIENT ACCESS AND MEDICATION SAFETY Report On: Elder Abuse in Hospitals Hospitals are also required to report certain events, including allegations of elder abuse, to state survey agencies. The event reporting program was first implemented in 1984 for nursing homes. In 2008, the ACA broadened the requirement for reporting serious medical events to include hospitals and critical access hospitals, although only serious reportable events related to healthcare-associated infections (HAI) must be reported to CMS. Nursing homes and state survey agencies report and monitor complaints related to HAIs, and CMS conducts a periodic analysis of the data to investigate and enforce compliance with reporting requirements. Conclusion: Our overall methodology relied on an extensive review of the laws, regulations, and guidance governing reporting requirements for elder abuse in nursing homes. We also contacted CMS representatives to better understand federal guidelines for the reporting of elder abuse in nursing homes and how complaints are handled. We evaluated state policies, statutes, and regulations; and interviewed experts and advocates in addition to conducting a survey. We focused solely on the reporting and investigation of elder abuse in assisted living facilities \u2013 not on the broader issue of elder abuse generally.

I do not think any 767 has anything approaching that kind of hull design for a FAR amphibian classification; the hull has none of the requisite characteristics (like high-wings) and those hull characteristics would also make a FAR amphibian certification impossible because there would then be no way for the aircraft to land and safely taxi on water...and FAR amphibian certifications can only be for single design aircraft (and/or models) and any 767 variants would be certified according to the type certificate for aircraft without hull floats.\nThe FAA (and its regulations) does NOT consider an amphibious hull designed for an aircraft like the A318 and/or Bombardier Q-400 to have a separate certification category, so what is happening with the IAC's certification may not be all that relevant to the issue at hand, so far.\n(I would add the 727 was certified amphibian, too, but it did not require a separate hull design certification. The 727 was originally certified in the US as a commercial airliner and the amphibian designation was just something the FAA added to the type certificate as a \"bonu\"...and the FAA later withdrew the amphibian class from the type certificate for one important reason; if the FAA classified it as an amphibian there would be no limit as to how much fuel it could carry and it would no longer need to meet commercial certification requirements because the term amphibian hull then becomes the criteria for certification and the aircraft simply has to be able to float in order to be an amphibian).\nHere's a 727-200 with twin pontoons taking off in the Bahamas for a water landing.\nLyair727-200_-ta.jpg\nLyair and J.Lee like this.\nAnother 727 with twin pontoons taking off for an amphibious landing in Vancouver.\nhttps://globalnews.ca/news/3828620/s...\nA318_on_water.jpg\nAn A318 with twin pontoons taking off on Water near Bordeaux on June 29 (see below).\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?i...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbzcG...\nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images...\nCirrus Aircraft sold its entire inventory of SR20, SR22 and SR70 aircraft for US$57 million as part of the dissolution of SFERA\nThe entire inventory of Cirrus Aircraft\u2014and all of the company\u2019s assets\u2014has been sold to a group of Chinese investors who plan to take over the aircraft manufacturing company \u201cwhen all legal requirements are finished\u201d according to a translated press release.\nOn November 28th, a group of Chinese investors signed a deal with Cirrus Aircraft, buying the SR20, SR22 and SR 70", "Federal agencies have taken various steps to expanding access to broadband in the United States.  the potential for such data to achieve these reform goals related to transparency and accountability, FCC data collection strategies, the quality of data available, and the availability of these data after reforms.

CBP and HSI officials noted that an alien who alleges domestic violence may be immediately paroled into the country if doing so is consistent with national security and public safety. For example, CBP officials noted that a woman who was attempting to file for asylum for domestic violence was paroled into the country after her husband refused to sign a waiver allowing his wife to return to the United States. While in the United States, the wife contacted law enforcement authorities in the United States to inform them of the abuse she had suffered in her home country. In addition, her local law enforcement authorities interviewed her on her allegations and documented her claims. After this process was completed, the woman was able to re-enter the United States and then her asylum hearings commenced. Officials explained that because of her status as a parolee, she could file for asylum in the United States because she was lawfully present in the country. HSI officials also noted that their agents may use evidence of the abuse suffered by survivors, including witness testimony of abuse, in order to gain victims\u2019 cooperation in criminal investigations. For example, when investigating abuse allegations filed by immigrants who were also the victim or witness of an offense related to human trafficking or other violent crimes, HSI agents may interview the alien victim or witness in order to get information on the crime. After the information is gathered, the agent may share this information with the parolee, who may then decide to cooperate with the agent in order to obtain protection. In order to secure VAWA-related protection from ICE or USCIS, a victim must meet the statutory definition of \u201cbattered or exploited\u201d under the VAWA. Specifically, applicants must (1) be either a self-petitioning battered spouse, abused parent, or abused child (i.e., who has been subjected to extreme cruelty or maltreatment by a family member in the United States); or (2) have been granted nonimmigrant status (i.e., a domestic worker, or a person who is either physically or mentally unable to cope with everyday activities) and subjected to abuse by a family member. Finally, ICE ERO officials emphasized 69 and 4.5 percent, respectively. 3 ICE ERO officials also noted similar gaps in resources to ensure compliance with VAWA provisions. Finally, VAWA requires the Department, in consultation with DHS agencies, to develop and implement a process for ensuring that when aliens or children are removed from the United States, their U.S. citizen children who are minors will be given the opportunity to request, at a minimum, deferred action from DHS for the duration of the proceedings against the alien. VAWA also requires DHS to publish a Notice of Inquiry on whether U.S. child citizens should be provided with the opportunity to request, at a minimum, deferred action.  Specifically, the law requires DHS to make regulations, policies, and information materials available in a language that the alien, victim, and child understands, unless the alien, victim, or child requests otherwise. However, the officials were not aware of any examples where domestic violence survivors were denied deferred action or where the government was not providing access to information and support in the language requested by the survivor.", "The USDA has a number of nutrition education programs with nutrition education components (NEC), such as SNAP\u2013Ed, WIC, Team Nutrition, and FInI.

Specifically, DOD components did not establish any policy to direct federal employees on appropriate uses of their new OSS applications nor establish clear criteria to guide employees on when it is appropriate to use them. Additionally, DOD components will have to review their agency enterprise architecture to evaluate how to integrate the newly acquired OSS applications, modify existing applications to interface with the new applications, and ensure that these applications work as intended. In addition, by limiting the use of proprietary software, DOD also may limit its ability to develop customized applications that meet its mission needs.

For example, if an infrastructure project would have a potentially significant effect on an Indian tribe that the agency has not previously consulted with, the agency should establish consultation procedures to ensure that the relevant expertise of the Indian tribes is included in planning and decision making for such projects. Additionally, to help ensure that a \u201creasonable and good faith effort\u201d is made to consult with \u201ctraditional counsels or clan mothers of affected tribes,\u201d federal agencies should identify a point of contact in their agency who has responsibilities for coordinating consultation efforts with tribes and tribes\u2019 members concerning the construction and maintenance of the infrastructure project.

This volume is one of the first to appear under that new series, Chemistry and Sustainability: Learning to Live with the Earth\u2019s Natural Resources. Chemistry and Sustainability is a volume that can be profitably read by experts in the field and students. As the author of chapters 1 and 13 in this volume, we would hope that experts will appreciate how this new volume fits into the overall effort to communicate and promote green chemistry. As students read this volume, we hope they see the big picture: that the chemical enterprise has a tremendous influence on our environment and health but that the chemical industry is working to reduce its impact on health and the environment. We hope students will gain new insights on what kinds of challenges to the chemical enterprise must be managed by governmental agencies, the chemical industry itself, and citizens as a whole. For our part, the chapter we wrote is one-half of the text and the other half is filled in by co-authors of this volume, and that approach should make for an engaging and interesting presentation of the text. Thus, we would hope that as students read the chapters, they will have some sense of the \u201cbig picture,\u201d that is, they will have a vision of a future with a chemistry that is sustainable. We believe the big picture that coalesces around green chemistry can be used by students in undergraduate and graduate programs, thus, in our opinion, every chemistry student has a need to have information on greener chemistry in their basic repertoire. Every new chemist needs to be aware of the ways in which chemistry interacts with the environment and health so as to design products that are sustainable from the very beginning. 1 Chemical Engineering Education for Sustainability and Green Design: An Introduction by Thomas M.

This was the latest attempt to use modern biology and the capabilities of these two labs to address U.S. goals for energy, security and sustainability\u2014an effort that the Department calls Bioenergy Research for the Advancement of Net Energy Technology, or BRANE, for short. JBEI has many priorities\u2014ranging from fundamental scientific research to the commercialization of biofuels\u2014 but perhaps the most visible element is a major construction project involving a cutting-edge laboratory facility built to produce next-generation enzymes that could enable the development of a new generation of biofuels. This JBEI laboratory opened in April 2018. As a joint lab, JBEI is part of a growing initiative that aims to capitalize on the complementary expertise of DOE\u2019s national labs, as well as to create new ways in which their capabilities can interact and enhance each other.

In 2014, just under 700,000 people were hospitalized with an initial diagnosis of stroke\u2014and that number was expected to increase with the aging of the population. Many stroke patients are left with residual mobility defects requiring a variety of services to regain independence and quality of life. With the increased risk of recurring strokes, stroke survivors need to return to an active lifestyle without the long-term use of prescription analgesics. In this light, there is increasing enthusiasm for noninvasive methods to provide temporary pain relief during acute stroke. One promising approach is to apply repetitive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to affected brain areas. In tDCS, very weak electric currents delivered through transcranial electrodes are able to modulate specific neural circuits in a targeted and very local fashion. Although a variety of devices have been developed to deliver tDCS, commercial products are not available to non-specialists. Therefore, researchers at the Lienhard School of Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have invented a novel tDCS device to modulate brain signaling on demand, thereby temporarily relieving pain during acute stroke. Specifically, they designed a wearable tDCS device for acute pain management during stroke that is also low cost, user-friendly, robust, capable of delivering currents to multiple sub-regions within the brain, and able to perform customizable brain stimulation with little-to-no training. To address the unique requirements of this device, the Rensselaer researchers worked closely with a leading manufacturer of electrical circuits for the bio-medical and neuro-technology industries. In addition, they drew upon their own experience in neuro-engineering to develop a customizable system for brain stimulation. They also leveraged their close ties to the New York Stem Cell Foundation to further develop the new device. The tDCS device consists of a wearable headband that fits around the circumference of the head, with four independently controlled electrodes. The electrodes have individual contacts that are wired to the patient\u2019s scalp and allow independent tDCS currents to be delivered", "American Indian/Alaska Native students benefit from a unique education program.

In addition, according to a September 2018 report from the USVI Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Task Force, the territory\u2019s economic activity\u2014 particularly tourism\u2014 was severely reduced in the months following the storms, leading to job losses and a total estimated economic impact of $1.54 billion. In response to the request of the Governor of the USVI, the President declared a major disaster the day after each hurricane struck the territory. Major disaster declarations can trigger a variety of federal response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental entities and households and individuals, including assistance through the Public Assistance program. As shown in figure 2, Public Assistance program funds are categorized broadly as \u201cemergency work\u201d or \u201cpermanent work.\u201d Within these broad categories are separate subcategories. In addition to the emergency work and permanent work categories, the program includes category Z, which represents indirect costs, administrative expenses, and other expenses a recipient or subrecipient incurs in administering and managing the Public Assistance program that are not directly chargeable to a specific project. FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program also provides funding for cost- effective hazard mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the risk from future disasters. Once the President has declared a disaster, FEMA, the state or territorial government (the recipient), and local or territorial entities (the subrecipient) work together to develop damage assessments and formulate project worksheets for eligible projects, such as restoring roads and bridges, removing debris, and repairing or replacing local critical infrastructure\u2014for example, dams and utility systems such as water treatment facilities, schools, and hospitals. For example, Public Assistance funding awarded through FEMA\u2019s Individual and Household Assistance Program is designed to help homeowners, businesses, and renters replace some of the most important things in their lives and help rebuild communities that have been hit hard. Once a project has been constructed and meets all program requirements, the state or territorial government can obligate funding for the project by placing money into an account where the contractor has the authority to withdraw 8 percent of the project\u2019s total costs upon acceptance and an additional 8 percent of the project\u2019s total costs after the project closes out and meets all Public Assistance requirements. The state or territorial government or its GAR approves the payments and the FEMA Regional Office (or, in the case of the USVI, FEMA\u2019s Recovery Division) accepts each payment. At the end of the project, the state or territorial government verifies that the 10 percent requirement is met and issues the final payment to settle the contract. This process is described by the state or territorial government and illustrated by figure 3. FEMA\u2019s insurance providers\u2014Assistance to Firefighters Grants and FEMA Fire Management Assistance Program\u2014may also have responsibilities to complete during the project\u2019s lifecycle to support an applicant\u2019s recovery efforts. In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 107-14\u2014the Stafford Act\u2014FEMA is obligated to provide guidance to state, territorial, tribal, and local governments about acceptable and unacceptable actions relative to public assistance funding. This obligation is intended to provide clarity about the rules that govern state, territorial, tribal, and local government use of federal dollars and to encourage states, Territorios, Tribes, and local governments to engage in transparent budget processes.", "Individuals engage in countless online transactions every day\u2014from checking their bank accounts and making retail purchases to signing up for federal benefits and services. However, securing such transactions is a complex endeavor. A key part of this process is verifying that the person who is attempting to interact for the first time with an organization, such as a federal agency or a business, is the individual he or she claims to be. This process, known as identity proofing, is essential to prevent fraud, which could cause harm to both individuals and organizations. Identity proofing may occur in person or through a remote, online process. In the case of in-person identity proofing, a trained professional verifies an individual\u2019s identity by making a direct physical comparison of the individual\u2019s physical features and other evidence (such as a driver\u2019s license or other credential) with official records to verify the individual\u2019s identity. Verification of these credentials can be performed by checking electronic records in tandem with physical In this case, the CRA will have a record of information provided by the government or other entity such as a bank, and the question being asked about that person will be provided by the organization that wants to verify the person\u2019s identity. For example, if I wanted to open a new credit card account with my bank, one of the questions the bank may ask is whether I have filed for bankruptcy in the last 7 years. Someone with my name and address may have filed for bankruptcy in that time-frame, but did not open an account with that bank. Once enough of these answers are provided, each CRA verifies them against its own proprietary database of information about individuals, and assigns the individual (in this case, me) a score. The CRAs use some combination of personal identifiers, along with information about the type of account that is being acquired, such as a credit card, auto loan, or mortgage, to produce a score in a specific range that conveys an individual\u2019s creditworthiness in a standardized format. A CRA will assign a high score to an individual with excellent creditworthiness and a low score to an individual with very poor creditworthiness. The CRAs have their own approaches to and methodologies for assigning these scores. However, in all cases, the CRAs\u2019 methodologies are designed to help predict whether an individual is likely to repay a loan that is issued to them, based on the individual\u2019s credit and payment histories, including any known or suspected risks of default (see Appendix I for more details about credit rating). The credit history and status of an individual (in this case, me) will change as the individual makes timely or defaulted payments or runs up debt and ultimately attempts to repay it, with more timely payments and low credit card balances improving an individual\u2019s (in this case, me) credit rating and vice versa.

IDENTITY PROOFING: REMOTE IDENTITY PROOFING \u2022 What is remote identity proofing? \u2022 Remote identity proofing has two major steps, resolution and verification. \u2022 What is Knowledge-Based Verification (knowledge Based Verification)? \u2022 Knowledge-based Verification: A method used to validate a consumer\u2019s identity by posing multiple questions requiring responses based on an individual\u2019s personal knowledge regarding him or herself and his or her activities. ORIGINS:  The audit is part of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) mandate under section 803(f)(1)(B) of E-Government Act of 2002. The Congress added this requirement to E-Government Act in 2003. REQUESTING AUDIT:  \u2022 GAO reported three weaknesses that hindered the government\u2019s efforts to secure online transactions. 1.  The use of knowledge-based verification alone to validate a consumer\u2019s identity. 2.  The use of an organization\u2019s own proprietary information as evidence when seeking to prove identity to a third party. 3.  Multiple credit inquiries by an", "RETIREMENT SECURITY 9  United States continues to increase. It has been estimated that, without a change in policy, by 2034 the Social Security program would not have enough funds to pay benefits as promised. However, as in the past, many believe that Social Security can be made solvent on a permanent basis \u2013 including some who have proposed specific programs to make the Social Security program solvent for the long term. In this CRS report, we review the history of pension policy and Social Security from the enactment of the first significant pension legislation in 1926 through the present. We summarize the history of pension coverage and Social Security financing since 1926, including pension coverage trends, as well as various economic, demographic, and societal factors that have had an effect on pension and retirement policy. In addition, we summarize Social Security coverage, benefit levels, and financing since 1978. The report also summarizes recent reforms related to Social Security, such as changes made in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, recent reforms in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and a review of how the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program has been affected by the current 7-year-long economic expansion. We also summarize current efforts in Congress and actions taken by President Trump and the Department of Labor during his tenure regarding Social Security policy; these current efforts include proposals to address any projected shortfall in Social Security financing, to expand options for workers to finance their own retirement, or to improve Social Security payments for retirees.\nIn contrast with the recent growth in efforts in Congress related to Social Security policy, the Social Security program continues to experience funding shortfalls, projected to run even greater deficits in 2049 and thereafter. The 2018 Social Security trustees\u2019 report found that at present payroll tax rates, combined Social Security trust funds will be depleted by 2035. If Congress were to continue payroll taxes at current rates without any additional policy, Social Security Trust Funds will only be able to pay 91% of their promised benefits in 2037, declining to 79% in 2093. The Trustees, however, have made clear that these projections are not an expectation: rather, the trust funds will have sufficient assets and earnings to pay full promised benefits at any time Congress changes the law.\nSocial Security, the primary U.S. program for retirement income, is one part of a broader system used by the United States to provide income insurance and support for vulnerable individuals and their families. However, the retirement system in the U.S. has evolved with the general movement from defined benefit pension coverage provided by the company an employee worked for, to personal savings and retirement.", "7-30-19 Inquiry in Lending,\nCongress and the White House are in recess and in the meantime Trump tweets some 50 times a day about trade wars and the Russia scandal. The stock market went no where, the dollar rose, oil fell and the trade deficit was worse. There are several articles on trade wars and the stock market, but more to say after the summary.\nFirst, a summary of the trade deficit in June, which was the worst in history. The trade deficit widened 8.3% to a deficit of $50.tbn, with imports up 5.8% and exports up 3.4%. The politically important trade deficit with China fell 2% to $32.18bn. The trade deficit in June with the European Union was 7.61 billion. A summary of US import and export data can be found here.\nNext, we have several articles and posts which discuss the effects of the trade wars on the stock market. The first is from CNTV who discusses China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs in detail and why they may not be as bad as the Trump administration believes. They also discuss the 6.5% plunge in the Chinese markets, and the effects on US companies that do business in China.\nThe second article is from CNN who say that the markets are not swayed by the trade war rhetoric. The third article is from OE Watch, who say it is time to prepare for the next downturn. The first article on corporate earnings is from the WSJ and discusses the effect of one-time tax reform, as well as the effects of tariffs on earnings.\nAs we have reported many times, the corporate earnings were terrible and the revenue increased less than 3%. Many companies issued weak guidance or worse, cut full year revenue estimates. Most companies, over 60% issued weak guidance and cut estimates or revenue, EPS and capex spending. There were some increases in guidance, but that is a small number.\nThe next two articles say that the Dow rally is over and we should prepare for a market downturn in 3-6 months. The first comes from zerohedge with a short video of his interview with Jim Grant on the next crash. The second article from zerohedge was authored by Tyler Durden. Tyler says the market is overvalued and may drop 40%.\nThis is the last article from Jutia. The next two articles discuss the trade talks scheduled in China in less than 18 days. These articles come from the WSJ and the National Review. The National Review says it is time for Trump to dump his advisors.\nThe next article is from the Trump Hater. The article says that Trump and Boris Johnson were involved in a drug smuggling conspiracy that they thought wouldn\u2019t be discovered. The article is very funny, because the two lovers, Trump and Johnson, couldn\u2019t stop calling on their phones.\nThe next article comes from CCN. The article says that the market will recover and is looking good for tomorrow.\nThis is the next article from FX Street who say the US dollar is strong, but is in the weak to the Euro.\nNext, two short articles, one from CCN and one from a Trump Hater. The article says that the US dollar is rising on trade and tariff news. The second article talks about the trade wars continuing and how Trump and Xi might not talk. A recession is in the works.\nI have found a new article on tax reform and how it may push the economy into a recession. The article says there are problems that could push us over the edge. The article says there may be a recession in 2020, and is 100% correct. The tax cuts were one-time, temporary in nature, and will have no impact on growth in less than 6-12 months.\nFinally, we have another article from CCN, discussing the market down 2% as it readies the downturn.\nI am not a bear yet, but I am waiting for the confirmation. The markets would have no reason to sell off until late March of 2020. You have plenty of time to sell, invest and prepare for a market correction to occur before the end of 2019.\nIf you had a bad month in July, you should have more assets in Gold and cash.

Since 2016, DOD has taken steps to ensure that its agreements officers are knowledgeable about other transactions, according to information from one of the offices we included in this review. These offices now require agreements officers to either understand or be acquainted with other transaction agreements and to have at least one year of experience working with prototypes. DOD awarded its 14th other transaction agreement in May 2018, according to the Other Transaction Guide for Prototype Projects. The award was one of the first other transaction agreements that DOD\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit Experimental awarded to a major U.S. defense contractor, which was selected for its expertise in designing, prototyping, and testing naval systems, as a consortium. The agreement also authorized DOD to obtain up to the first $9.8 million in costs for research, development, and design, according to the website.\nRisk: Prototype other transactions involve the use of non-traditional companies, which may have less experience in fulfilling requirements and carrying out contracts for the federal government.\nRecommendation: The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the service acquisition executive/department acquisition executive should review applicable policies concerning non-traditional companies to ensure the use of these companies is consistent with their missions and responsibilities.\nRecommendation: The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and other senior officials responsible for the management and oversight of prototype other transactions should develop appropriate measures to assess and monitor the performance of prototype agreements.\nRecommendation: The service acquisition executives, Defense Acquisition Executive, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense should develop and issue guidance that clearly states their expectations for the proper use of prototype agreements.\nAs a follow-up to our recommendation on monitoring agreement performance to ensure that other transactions are awarded and carried out appropriately, we reviewed the 2018 other transaction guidance included in section 2173b of title 10, U.S. Code, to ensure the instructions were complete and that senior officials were performing their responsibilities for monitoring agreement performance. In 2018, the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, issued guidance establishing requirements for monitoring performance under a prototype agreement and providing that the agreement shall expire if a milestone is not accomplished within a designated period of time. The Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, also stated that agencies should not allow or approve exceptions to these instructions.", "The U.S. has enacted four pieces of legislation with a combined worth of $2.6 trillion in an effort to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still much to be done about data integrity, accessibility and accountability. For this reason, and because such information is critical to the health sector and to many other actors responding to the pandemic, GAO has published recommendations for agencies to consider to help improve data integrity, accessibility, and accountability of federal funds. Specifically, GAO recommends that the (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revise its case definition to reflect that case counts could only be calculated for infections that meet the clinical definition of infection, not merely tests for infection, and that (2) the Small Business Administration update its data to reflect that 90 percent of the more than $512 billion in guaranteed loans were made to small businesses.\nhttps://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/covid-19.pdf", "This is the first figure of the complete case study. TXT 1:\nThis is where the case starts. We present some information about the 2020 Census in general, such as the following: 2020 Census, for instance, will cost almost $2 billion, but some experts claim that the number can rise up to $33 billion in the course of its implementation. It is planned to count a total of 330 million people, which will be the largest total number of any census in US history, yet. This includes both permanent and temporary residents, people born in the U.S. and foreign-born ones among others. Another interesting fact is that US Constitution, as well as American Civil Liberties Union, guarantees a confidentiality of personally given information. The US constitution also guarantees that every person who participates in the census gets counted once, and only once. The main purpose was to get information about the distribution of population within a certain territory. The first census was held during 1790 and included seven questions, one of which was \u2013 how many slaves did the participant own? Later, during 1890, a special law required those who are 21 or older, both black and white, to answer a number of questions; those responses were later used for redistricting states. TXT 2:\nNow we need to describe the process, as we already do in this particular figure. Firstly, the Bureau invites governments to review the MAF in order to check for and provide address updates, and they usually get 90 or 120 days to do it, depending on the specific plan. TXT 3:\nSecond point is an inclusion of the address updates, as well as third-party data from sources, such as USPS, directly into the Master Address File. The list can be later shared with state and local governments. TXT 4:\nNow we see that Bureau uses the data from these government sources in order to improve its MAF or create a more complete address list. TXT 5:\nAs one of the experts said, Bureau needs to make a comprehensive address file on its own that will contain most of the necessary components \u2013 it should serve as a primary MAF reference for other governmental branches, and be able to update the file of address of at least 230 million or 240 million people before the census. TXT 6:\nAfter we describe this figure, we should talk about LUCA updates. During LUCA 2020, Bureau and other governments submit data updates to each participant directly into the MAF. Bureau also reviews these files in order to determine if the government is ready to accept them, or if they may need to appeal, or something like that. TXT 7:\nNext point is that Bureau updates in-field addresses by sending census workers into the field to correct or collect missing addresses, and to verify addresses after the enumeration process. TXT 8:\nNext point is that Bureau updates in-field addresses by sending census workers into the field to correct or collect missing addresses, and to verify addresses after the enumeration process. TXT 9:\nThen, Bureau uses information from its participants in order to update or create a new address list. By the way, Bureau does not provide such third-party data to all governmental branches involved, but only to a limited number of them, in order to keep this information protected. TXT 10:\nThese are the last things we should check and discuss about in this figure. The new address list can be later used if there are issues with the old address file, or if somebody just wants to fix them. TXT 11:\nHere we see that most governments update their addresses in order to take part in the LUCA 2020. Moreover, we should find information about how effective has this been; it should have both results and implications. TXT 12:\nNow we need to talk about how successful this procedure has been during the 2020 Census \u2013 does it work effectively or not. We need also to understand how Bureau is collecting address updates; how they are using third party data and so on. Some experts argue that Bureau gets address updates right from their governmental sources in the form of either the National Change of Address or National Change of\nAgency. What is more, Bureau has some partners that can give them address updates on a more regular basis. This whole process is called LUCA (Letter of Update Cancellation and Authentication), and Bureau uses three different levels in the process. As it was already mentioned, it collects, manages, and updates its Master Address File on its own. However, what is not mentioned \u2013 Bureau has one more partner, namely, the United States Post", "The Family Caregiver Program (FCP) is a Department-wide program that awards an annual stipend to eligible veterans who served on or after September 11, 2001.1 The program is administered at the local level through Veterans Health Administration medical centers and health care systems.

GAO surveyed representatives from VHA\u2019s Caregiver Support Program Office, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and 115 of 141 Veterans Health Administration medical centers, as well as 21 of 22 Veterans Health Administration health care systems in December 2018 and January 2019.

IAEA\u2019s policy-making bodies include the Board of Governors, which consists of 35 member states, including the United States as a de-facto permanent member. The General Conferences consists of all 171 member states. The agency\u2019s staff, led by the Director General, is referred to as the Secretariat and is organized into six departments that implement programs approved by the Board of Governors and the General Conference. The Division of Nuclear Security is within the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security and implements the nuclear security program. Figure 1 shows the position of DNS within the agency. The agency\u2019s other departments include the Department of Safeguards, which provides information and support to member states that have acceded to the CPPNM. In addition to the departments, the agency has a number of officers that report to the Director General including the Office of Legal Affairs. IAEA\u2019s statute is the foundation of the agency\u2019s dual mission of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and verifying through safeguards that the use of nuclear materials and technologies is for peaceful purposes and not for non-peaceful purposes. Nuclear security is not an explicit part of this broader mission, but the agency has identified a number of its statutory authorities as underpinning its nuclear security role. For example, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and related CPPNM amendment. The Convention sets forth the obligations of a state party to establish a legal and regulatory framework to protect nuclear material from unauthorized use or sabotage. IAEA provides guidance and other forms of support to member states on fulfilling their obligations under the Convention. The Convention also calls upon states to take and enforce measures to establish a domestic control system to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to establish export control systems to prevent the unauthorized transfer of nuclear materials and technologies and their delivery means to non-state actors. The resolution encourages states to support the agency\u2019s nuclear security programs. IAEA\u2019s regular budget for 2018 is approximately $439 million, and approximately $104 million is unfunded. Extra-budgetary contributions made by other states make up the difference. DNS\u2019s 2018 regular budget is $7.5 million and $1.5 million is unfunded.  IAEA\u2019s statute authorizes the agency to provide technical support for implementation of the Convention\u2014including through guidance and through training, exercise, and other support\u2014and to provide States Parties information and support to implement the Convention. States parties to the Convention may request that DNS carry out this support and information and support role, including through meetings, teleconferences, the exchange of information through correspondence, and training and workshops attended by representatives of States Parties. DNS provides States Parties information and support in a number of ways, such as: \u2022  Encouraging and supporting states to conduct security planning, including through an IAEA- designed Security Guide for Radioactive Sources and Facilities. \u2022  Undertaking safety assessments of nuclear facilities. \u2022  Conducting nuclear security training courses. \u2022  Conducting nuclear security policy workshops. \u2022  Conducting nuclear security workshops and training courses on the safe management and use of radioactive sources and materials with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and regional arrangements in Member States. \u2022  Conducting, or contributing to the IAEA\u2019s, review of states\u2019 nuclear security policies and practices in meeting their commitments under the Nuclear Security Plan. \u2022  Providing for and assisting member states with inspections; in some countries these have included multiple inspections conducted. \u2022  Offering assistance through the development of national regulatory, legal, and administrative frameworks and developing national nuclear security strategies. \u2022  Developing model legislation and procedures in support of CPPNM and IAEA Amendment implementation. \u2022  Offering training on the IAEA Code of Conduct. \u2022  Providing training and other support to help States Parties develop secure plans to manage a nuclear security event. \u2022  Assisting in the development of appropriate infrastructure and management systems. \u2022  Providing training and assistance in areas such as nuclear forensics and other aspects of investigation.", "MDA is responsible for developing a number of systems, known as elements, with the purpose of defending against ballistic missile attacks.

However, DHS does not have a fully mature and integrated information sharing process at this time.\nTo ensure the integrity and security of federal information, DHS conducts regular vulnerability scans for public-facing segments of federal civilian agency networks, and requires agencies to secure these segments.\nTo meet current and anticipated computing and storage needs reliably, cost-effectively, and securely, federal agencies are dependent on computerized systems and networks that use cyber technologies including the Internet, telecommunications networks, and satellite-based communications. Virtually all federal operations are supported by computer systems and networks, which store large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) on the approximately 28 million people serving in the federal government and provide support for critical missions. As agencies invest funds to modernize and update these systems, they are also working to improve the cybersecurity of this information.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, GAO issued two reports on federal cybersecurity. In those reports, GAO recommended that DHS require agencies to secure public-facing segments of their network. GAO concluded from a sample of federal civilian agencies, state and local governments, and private sector organizations in eight sectors assessed by DHS for compliance with FISMA requirements that publicly facing segments of network systems not performing official business were less likely to be sufficiently protected. (See, for example, the 2016 GAO reports: Improved Planning, but Controls for Monitoring State and Local Network Segments Remain an Issue; and Cybersecurity: Emerging Categories of Cyber Threats May Affect the Economic and National Security of the United States).\nThe United States has made significant investments in IT and telecommunications, and many federal missions\u2014for example, federal law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence gathering\u2014rely on advanced IT and telecommunications systems and networks. Federal agencies are challenged, however, in deploying and operating reliable and secure systems, especially with the need to rapidly respond to the accelerated pace of technological change associated with emerging and evolving cyber threats, as noted in Figure 1. The nature and scope of these cyber threats may affect the economic and national security of the United States, as noted below.\nSource: Data from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, Center for Data Innovation, https://www.itif.org/data/publications/public-sector-spending-information-technology-us#cybersecurity-spending-state; data on federal government funding for IT, FY 2006-FY 2018, available from \u201cBudget of the U.S. Government, for FY 2019,\u201d published at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2019/.

However, there may be enough frictional force to oppose the deformation, and thus lead to restoration of the original dimensions of the car body. This will reduce the occupants\u2019 risk of injury and likely death. Mostly trucks comprise the underride portion and the occupants of the car consist of mostly pedestrians and cyclist. The most common type of underride crash is when the rear of the tractor, or the passenger vehicle, hits the underride guard (if there is one) and the car slides up and hits the tractor and is crushed under it (underride crash type two) or slides underneath the trailer and is crushed by the wheels and is wedged underneath the trailer (underride crash type one). This type of crash mostly occurs in cars with no side airbags, no side impact protection, etc., and those driving and in the car in this moment in time (see fig. 5 for a visual aid). There are three classifications of underride crashes, which are classified based on the level of underride: crash types 1 (see fig. 6 for a visual aid), 2 (see fig. 7 for a visual aid), and 3 (see fig. 8 for a visual aid). The underride guard is any guard used to limit the slide up or slide under crash types. However most current designs, in the United States (US), only guard trucks/trailers (part of the load and not tractors). The reason is to protect the driver against the car in a fatal crash\u2014the driver will often not die, though there are many uncertainties in terms of the extent of injury and survivability. Crash types 2 and 3 are the most common in the US. The US also has laws for all states and Canadian Provinces that only allow passenger vehicles to be behind trucks for a specified distance. The purpose of this is to ensure that in a crash the occupants of the vehicle are not sandwiched up underneath the tractor/trailer combination. When the trucks and cars collide there is a possibility that they would not separate\u2014instead it would act like an accordion or accordion file. The air bags are designed in such a manner as to allow the passenger to withstand a certain amount of the deceleration and thus the vehicle will bend and crush instead of having a direct impact with the occupant of the vehicle. The passenger vehicles are only allowed to be behind the tractors for a specified minimum following distance in order to ensure a safe distance from the truck or in the case of an underride crash the safe distance from the truck and to allow for a sufficient amount of time to slow down. Furthermore the guard is designed to only be enough of a barrier in order to protect the driver of the tractor-trailer from being run over. A common misconception is that there is no such thing as an underride crash. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates all US commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operators and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulate all CMV vehicle design (under 26,000 pounds). FMCSA has stated that there is no such thing as an underride crash\u2014the only crashes that they will recognize are crush up and crush down collision crashes. They also state that there are no vehicle standards for preventing crashes. However, the FMCSA regulations only apply to intrastate carriers within a state. These CMV operators are not recognized because they are outside of their regulations. Therefore not all trucks are governed by the same regulations, which could include different crash test regulations and the underride guard design (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 2016)\u2014though there are underride guards on Canadian trailers. One design flaw is that in the rear guard only design the barriers can be removed in order to access the trailer. The barriers are intended to protect the vehicle in a crash, however the design of the barriers can create a larger space between the front of the trailer and the rear guard. When the rear guard is removed it can exasperate this issue. As well the design of the rear guard is usually not designed in a way to protect the passenger vehicle in a crash like it is", "In addition to overseeing NASA\u2019s transportation of supplies, goods, and personnel to the International Space Station, FAA\u2019s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is also responsible for commercial space launches, reentries, and related infrastructure. This report examines the office\u2019s accomplishments, challenges, and needs for fiscal year 2019.

As the delegated administrator of the BSA, FinCEN has issued implementing regulations. In complying with BSA/AML requirements, U.S. financial institutions assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing by, among other things, establishing and maintaining compliance programs, conducting ongoing monitoring of customers and transactions, and reporting suspicious activity as directed in the BSA. Oversight and enforcement of compliance with the BSA involve several federal agencies, including FinCEN and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). FinCEN has overall authority for administering and enforcing compliance under the BSA and may seek civil penalties and injunctions to compel compliance. In addition, each of the federal banking regulators has independent authority to initiate enforcement actions against supervised institutions for violations of law and to seek civil money penalties for BSA violations, among other things. FinCEN has also delegated examination authority for BSA/AML compliance for certain entities, including money transmitters, to IRS. In general, money transmitters must register with FinCEN and provide certain information on their structure and ownership. State supervisory agencies also may conduct BSA/AML examinations of licensed money transmitters. To ensure consistency in the application of BSA/AML requirements, in 2005 the federal banking regulators collaborated with FinCEN on developing an examination manual that was released by FFIEC for federal bank examiners conducting BSA/AML examinations of banks. The examination manual has been revised several times since its release, and the most recent comprehensive revision was released in 2014. According to the examination manual, a key function of the federal banking regulators\u2019 BSA/AML examinations is to assess whether banks have an adequate system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance with BSA/AML regulations. Similarly, in 2008 FinCEN issued a BSA examination manual to guide reviews of money transmitters and other types of MSBs, including reviews by IRS and state regulators. Both the FFIEC and FinCEN examination manuals are publicly available. Money transmitters and banks are subject to requirements under the BSA. They are generally required to designate an individual to coordinate and monitor day-to-day provide training for appropriate personnel; and provide for an independent audit function to test for compliance. Additionally, banks must include appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence as part of their AML compliance program.

As a result, the lack of clarity in the existing guidance may leave many IRA owners in the dark about how they need to protect their assets from disqualifying prohibited transactions and IRA custodians with questions about their custodial responsibilities and liabilities. Given this, we recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury work with the IRS to clarify custodial responsibilities for both IRA custodians and IRA owners.", "or through the contract pharmacies they hire (often referred to as a 340B contract pharmacy) or through a preferred network of pharmacies. To facilitate access to and use of 340B drugs, covered entities may also charge beneficiaries co-payments for 340B drugs. Covered entities must then make sure the prescribing and dispensing physician or other authorized persons dispense only 340B drugs when they treat covered entity patients and that the covered entity patient has not exceeded his or her limit of 340B drugs under his or her plan of care. Covered entities must keep complete records to demonstrate that they are providing 340B drugs and otherwise complying with program requirements. Covered entities also must keep records of the total acquisition cost for 340B drugs they purchase and report these costs to CMS. This information helps CMS calculate rebates owed to states.

Individuals who need access to secure areas\u2014such as someone who works at Mar-a-Lago\u2014are to undergo a background check. Based on the findings of this background check, the Secret Service determines whether the individual should be allowed access to a secure area in the hotel or on the property. The Secret Service is also responsible for setting timelines for its background checks to provide the Secret Service and its partners with adequate warning when the President is to meet with an individual and so that individuals can be identified for screening.", "Prior to January 1, 2018, TRICARE provided benefits through three main plan options for its non-Medicare-eligible beneficiary population\u2014TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra. TRICARE Prime was a preferred provider option with enrollment requirements and offered free primary care and a monthly premium for specialty care. Beneficiaries were typically required to choose a Primary Care Manager (PCM). TRICARE Standard was designed for those without PCMs and used a more traditional managed care insurance model with enrollment requirements. TRICARE Extra was offered only for retirees or medically eligible beneficiaries and allowed beneficiaries to choose any TRICARE-authorized provider regardless of enrollment status. TRICARE Standard and Extra did not contain enrollment requirements. Beneficiaries who used non-network providers in TRICARE Standard and Extra paid for their services at the time of care and submitted claims to DOD for reimbursement. TRICARE Select is the replacement for TRICARE Standard and Extra. TRICARE Select offers free primary care and, beginning January 1, 2019, uses a more traditional managed care insurance model. TRICARE Select uses an open network with no enrollment requirements and requires beneficiaries to use a Primary Care Manager for most preventive care and when seeking care in military or civilian treatment facilities, although other civilian providers are available to the beneficiary. Beneficiaries seeking mental health services are required to enroll in a TRICARE-authorized mental health provider before receiving care. However, beneficiaries can also receive care from certified non-network providers. In the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, Congress required that DOD maintain 85 percent of beneficiaries in TRICARE Select by January 1, 2018, or to enroll beneficiaries in TRICARE Select without consent, if a beneficiary was to receive care in the inpatient or outpatient mental health system. As of January 1, 2019, all active duty TRICARE beneficiaries and retirees enrolled in TRICARE For Life are required to enroll in TRICARE Select. To meet the needs of beneficiaries who wish to receive care from non-network providers, TRICARE beneficiaries still have the option to purchase supplemental TRICARE coverage that typically includes TRICARE Prime. By transitioning to TRICARE Select, DOD has also sought to improve health care access for beneficiaries in rural and other medically underserved areas. While the specific transition for a TRICARE Select beneficiary depends on their prior enrollment and payment status as of January 1, 2018, DOD and its two contractors are generally responsible for informing eligible beneficiaries to enroll in select by November 30, 2017, and for automatically enrolling eligible beneficiaries who did not elect TRICARE Select on December 1, 2017. Eligible beneficiaries are those who do not opt out or cancel TRICARE Select on or before July 1, 2018. Beneficiaries who used civilian treatment facilities, including non-network providers, under TRICARE Standard and Extra are now required to enroll in TRICARE Select and use the TRICARE-authorized facilities. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 prohibits TRICARE from terminating TRICARE For Life, but requires beneficiaries to enroll in TRICARE Select to continue eligibility. It is unclear if some beneficiaries who do not opt-out of TRICARE Select in June or July 2018 will be able to enroll in TRICARE For Life or will be required to enroll in  TRICARE SELECT PROBLEM: Non-Prime beneficiaries\u2019 overall ratings of health care services were lower in the 2019 survey compared to the 2017/2018 surveys and there were more negative ratings for primary care, specialty care, mental health care, and medical management issues. For example, when compared to the 2017/2018 surveys, 30 percent of beneficiaries reported that they had a problem finding a primary care or specialty care provider who accepts TRICARE in 2019, compared to 25 percent in", "TEXT: The EPA report also noted that HUD has 23 separate federal housing programs that have environmental justice implications.

For the version of this requirement that applied to D O L , H ~ C , and E D ~ , the Steven s Amendment has appeared in all but one of the full appropriations acts passed in Congresssince 1993. In Proposing the amendment in 1988, Senator Ted Stevens described the role of statelocal governments, and the federal government in forging a partnership to share in the costs of many projects and said that the federal contribution should be identified as amattertor taxpayer concern.

The country has demonstrated its resolve to effectively confront these disasters, yet remains susceptible to a variety of unpredictable and recurring natural hazards. The United States has invested $569.8 billion since 1980 to assist individuals and/or communities in recovering from disasters and is committed to remaining a world leader in resilience. However, future disasters are certain, and while past federal efforts have ensured the resilience of the nation, future resilience will require additional federal investment and coordinated federal efforts. Accordingly, federal agencies must better articulate their roles and responsibilities in disaster resilience prioritize the use of federal resources based on risk and needs collaboratively identify, address, and mitigate significant disaster risk improve national resilience to help the nation better withstand and recover from disasters.  In the past three years, the federal government has demonstrated commitment to improving preparedness and resilience through coordinated efforts and investments. In July 2015, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 to promote resilience, enforce readiness, streamline operations, and increase training. The bill requires DOD to develop a national defense strategy to include the roles and missions of the Department and its Components, and to describe current and future National Air and Space operations and strategic investments, among other items. In addition, the Federal Preparedness Comprehensive Planning, Programming, and Implementation Act of 2020 (Pub. I), which we will discuss in more detail later in this appendix, amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other agencies, to include in the NPRF guidance for FEMA to use in prioritizing the provision of assistance to address a catastrophic incident based on the expected outcome and the impact of the incident. However, there remains work to be done to further address national resilience. This appendix provides an overview of federal efforts to prioritize resources for hazard mitigation and provides a summary of federal efforts to improve national resilience to recurring or emerging risks from natural hazards, many of which are projected to increase in frequency and/or intensity in the coming decades.\u201d\nDownload ppt \"Federal Agencies Should Improve Their Efforts to Incorporate Resilience.\"\nPro Ppt online Ppt on 26 11 mumbai attack Ppt on social etiquettes Ppt on 2 dimensional figures and organs in human Ppt on diode as rectifier diode Ppt on economic development Ppt on different types of computers Ppt on social media privacy issues Ppt on business plan pro Ppt on 60 years of indian parliament first session\nNational Flood Insurance Program U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Agencies that provide flood mapping products and assessments include: FEMA, NOAA,\nFederal Agencies Should Improve Their Efforts to Incorporate Resilience.

The National Park Service (NPS) issues Public Gathering Permits for public and commercial events and activities that occur in areas under its legal jurisdiction or in areas where it is the lead agency coordinating permitted activities. We initiated the audit in response to concerns raised by the NPS concerning its use of permits and the administration of its process. We focused on the NPS Headquarters Office, the Parks and the NPS permit process in four locations: Independence National Historical Park, the Northeast Region Office (which serves as a regional permit coordinating office for the Northeast Region), Gateway National Recreation Area, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The four national park units included in our review account for more than 98 percent of all of the public gathering permits issued by the NPS, making them effective models for the majority of the permits process. Our objective was to determine how the NPS selected and enforced permitting policies and determined the fees for public events at federally governed lands, while ensuring that permitted events did not impede or displace other authorized uses of these lands.\nIn our report, we found that the NPS implemented a permits process to minimize adverse effects to the environment when public gatherings are held on park land. There is some disagreement among NPS managers and staff at the levels of review that should occur before the approval of a public gathering permit or how to make changes to the permits process. This has led, in some instances, to the inconsistent enforcement and inconscious execution of the permits policies. We found that permits fees were based on actual costs, except when certain park units had difficulty covering costs and used fees to make up that difference. We also found that the permits process did not always ensure that permitted events did not interfere with other authorized uses of park land. We made three recommendations to the Office of the Director, including the implementation of a national policy of the Public Gathering Permit process.", "While the core mission of protecting federal facilities has remained constant as FPS has moved from one agency to the next, its responsibilities have changed. In the 1970s, GSA created FPS as part of its Public Buildings Service (PBS). While in GSA\u2019s PBS, FPS was responsible for protecting GSA\u2019s held or leased facilities, providing both physical security and law enforcement services. To protect buildings, FPS officers developed physical security risk assessments, installed security equipment, and oversaw contract guard services. As a part of its law-enforcement services, among other duties, FPS officers enforced laws and regulations aimed at protecting federal facilities and the persons in such facilities and conducted criminal investigations. Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was enacted. It created DHS and moved FPS from GSA to the new department, effective in March 2003. Within DHS, FPS was placed in USICE, where its responsibilities grew beyond solely protecting GSA buildings to include homeland security activities such as implementing homeland security directives and providing law- enforcement, security, and emergency-response services during natural disasters and special events. In 2009, DHS proposed transferring FPS from ICE to NPPD. In explaining this transfer in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget justification to Congress, DHS stated that having FPS and NPPD\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection in the same organization would further solidify NPPD as DHS\u2019s lead for critical infrastructure protection. FPS was placed in NPPD and continued to lead physical security and law enforcement services at GSA- held or GSA-leased facilities and continued its efforts in homeland security activities. In November 2018, legislation was enacted that reorganized NPPD to an organization that had a greater statutory focus on managing cyber risks and authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine the appropriate placement for FPS within DHS and begin transfer of FPS to that entity.

These agencies are engaged in rule of law programs funded through interagency agreements, and partnership agreements with other Federal agencies, as well as with foreign goverments. 2/ Often US foreign aid and assistance to promote the rule of law has a human rights component. 3/ The State Department and USAID have identified 3 agencies as responsible for coordination of rule of law assistance: the Bureau of INL (State), DRG Center (USAID) and OPDAT/ICITAP (Department of Justice).\nThe Foreign Affairs Manual also specifies which offices at State are in charge of rule of law assistance, including the Bureau of Bilateral and Regional Affairs (State/B), which provides overall guidance with regard to the Bureau of INL, whose bureau chief is responsible for rule of law, human rights, and corruption.\nIn its Rule of Law Plan, State notes that its human rights and democracy strategy includes, among other activities, promoting the rule of law as an essential component of U.S. foreign policy. The plan calls for promoting the rule of law for the purposes of combatting transnational organized crime; fighting corruption; reducing poverty; improving governance; and facilitating economic growth and development by reducing legal and regulatory uncertainty. The plan states that rule of law assistance is implemented through a variety of existing mechanisms.\nAgency plans and activities reports indicate that rule of law assistance is primarily implemented through U.S. foreign assistance programs and, in some cases, special funding programs. Assistance activities are implemented by USAID and State through a variety of programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Food for Progress, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, international narcotics and law enforcement programs, and international education and training programs. In addition, a number of other federal agencies assist in rule of law efforts. For example, the DOD\u2019s humanitarian mine action program is designed to help foreign countries overcome the effects of landmines and explosive remnants of war and promote the implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty and Convention on Conventional Weapons. Funding for rule of law activities is identified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. This act allocates $531 million for State and USAID, compared with $496 million for these agencies for fiscal years 2014-2016 and $498 million for fiscal year 2017.\nThe DOJ, through OPDAT, ICITAP, and DOJ international programs, conducts anti-corruption, legal reform, and law enforcement assistance in certain countries. ICITAP, through the Justice for Others program, works with international, regional, and local partners to implement local rule of law strategies and capacity-building in areas of rule of law. DOJ legal reform programs have included the Drug Enforcement Program (DEP), to which the Congress appropriated $35 million for fiscal 2018.\nUSAID also coordinates the implementation of anti-corruption technical assistance programs through USAID bureaus, such as the Bureau of Economic Growth, Education and Environment, or the Office of Inspector General. Moreover, according to several foreign aid officials, USAID has coordinated with other U.S. government agencies to implement anti-corruption activities in a number of foreign countries, including Afghanistan, the Republic of Moldova, and Haiti. However, we have been unable to validate these assertions.\nTo address the rule of law and international corruption concerns, State and USAID have conducted strategic planning to develop and implement rule of law initiatives. For example, USAID\u2019s 2016 Assessment Report on the 2001 U.N. Convention for Corruption highlights a variety of rule of law initiatives, including assistance to build corruption investigation and prosecution capacity in developing countries. Under this assistance program, USAID has allocated an estimated $18 million in fiscal 2018 for 23 countries. The Office of Rule of Law and International Human Rights of the Civil Rights Division (Justice Department) also reports that it provides technical assistance to government officials, rule of law actors, civil society, and other rule of law stakeholders to strengthen government institutions and the rule of law. A number of international organizations provide technical assistance, as well as expert support and facilitation for implementation. For example, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe reported it provides a wide range of rule of law assistance in countries in the Eastern", "The Job Corps program was designed to address the employment and training needs of disadvantaged and at-risk youth, as part of the War on Poverty, which was launched in the 1960s. Established to provide career training, Job Corps was transferred from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to the Department of Labor (DOL) in 1983.\nAccording to DOL data, as of September 2017, Job Corps centers were operating in 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nearly three-quarters of these students are female, minorities make up about half of the student enrollment, and one-third of the students have histories of involvement in the criminal justice system. While enrolled in Job Corps, the average student receives two full years of postsecondary education and three-quarters of one year of earnings, as well as additional benefits such as access to medical care, clothing, and meals. Job Corps\u2019 contracts have been repeatedly criticized for allowing contractors to receive payments even if fewer students than expected enroll. For example, in two of the past five years, more than 30 percent of a center\u2019s potential earnings were forfeited due to student underperformance, an indicator of student enrollment underexpectations. Furthermore, audit findings have also raised concerns about these contractors\u2019 oversight of student funds at cash registers set up at Job Corps facilities and over how contractors calculate student payments. In August 2017, GAO added Job Corps contracting and oversight to its High Risk List. In its most recent report, GAO noted significant implementation lapses among DOL\u2019s oversight and monitoring roles in contracting, particularly for monitoring student-level earnings and spending in Job Corps. Furthermore, GAO found multiple instances under DOL\u2019s procurement processes in which contract prices were increased above the competition price before DOL awarded the contract. In addition, DOL has identified opportunities to help achieve program savings. For example, DOL found over $30 million of potential savings by increasing Job Corps\u2019 use of central pricing. However, the agency has not taken any action to reduce procurement costs.\nGAO also analyzed Job Corps\u2019 student performance for a period after program year 2016 and determined that performance is generally improving and comparable to the performance of some of the other programs GAO examined. Accordingly, we concluded that DOL\u2019s assessments provided a strong basis for the reported program improvements. To help DOL\u2019s efforts to strengthen its oversight and contracting processes, GAO will review the extent to which job corps has implemented GAO\u2019s recommended best practices and whether its program has improved student performance.\nSUMMARY CONCLUSIONS: GAO's review of documentation related to the contract bids for four Job Corps contracts in 2015-16 found that contractors\u2019 prices were increased above the competition price at some point in the solicitation process for each contract prior to award. However, DOL officials stated that they believed the increases were valid based on re-evaluations of each contractor\u2019s initial technical proposals, and they took no further action to evaluate the increase. In contrast, DOL officials stated that they would take the appropriate action to re-evaluate a price increase if it occurred in future years. Furthermore, GAO found that for three of four contracts, DOL contracting officials did not implement some provisions to review proposed prices in light of changes in the contractor\u2019s technical proposal. GAO also found that in two of four cases, the process to solicit contractor bids was unclear with respect to some aspects of contractor performance or to how DOL accounted for costs identified by the contractors with their proposals. For example, in some cases DOL contracting officials did not clearly articulate in the solicitation that they were allowing contractors to use a cost approach to calculate cost savings as opposed to a performance approach, which would have required contractors to estimate, in advance, the cost savings they would achieve. In addition, DOL\u2019s process for soliciting reprocurement bids for the five center contracts slated for reprocurement in fiscal year 2017 included a step requiring contractors to submit a proposal summarizing how they would modify their current proposal in response to solicitation feedback. Specifically, DOL stated that it took this step to address contractor complaints in 2015-16 about the unreasonably long timeframes from when requests for proposals went out until reprocurement awards", "Proceed to summarize the following text.", "(1) The FRA addresses records management and archiving of electronic records, including email.

Long- term care insurance (LTCI). LTCI is a small group of individually purchased insurance policies that provides coverage to seniors and the disabled for a limited set of services in the event of a disabling condition. LTCI is less common than health insurance, but coverage has expanded in the past several years, especially in the form of hybrid policies combining long- term care and life insurance. A number of studies and evaluations of LTCI demonstrate that insurance and other financial protections are critical for maintaining a caregiving structure. Medicare. The government\u2019s Medicare program pays for medical expenses associated with the aging population but does not generally reimburse for ongoing assistance with activities of daily living and does not typically pay for long-term care insurance. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security benefits. SSI provides a federal cash benefit of $735 per month for disabled adults or children with limited income and assets. The Social Security program provides disability benefits to individuals with long- term disabilities, who qualify based on work history and contributions. Family leave. Currently, there is no federal law that guarantees paid family leave. Paid family leave is an employee benefit provided by 13 states (CA, CT, DE, FL, HI, IL, MA, NJ, NY, OH, RI, VT, WA) and the District of Columbia. In addition, an additional four states (AR, CO, MD, MN) provide short- term leave paid for with state funds, while six other states (MD, MN, NC, NJ, RI, WA) have statutory paid family leave programs that are not currently operational. All told, 23% of Americans nationally receive paid family leave through one of these state programs. 69 554 REPORT FROM THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE PERIOD APRIL 1, 2017, through September 30, 2018", "(1) The Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 (Pilotage Act) established the system of compulsory pilotage on the Great Lakes, and a pilotage revenue sharing plan whereby pilots would receive a percentage of the fees set by the Coast Guard. (2) In 2019, the Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Committee recommended that, to incentivize pilots to take part in the seasonal transition between two pilotage districts without a change in pay and status, the pilotage fee be established at the same rate in each district. (3) To facilitate this recommendation, we requested that the Coast Guard provide an estimate of the total annual U.S. merchant vessel miles traveled across district borders. (4) In accordance with the Pilotage Act, we also recommended that the Coast Guard establish the total annual U.S. merchant vessel miles traveled across district borders for 2020. (5) To support its recommendation, the Coast Guard relied on three years of the Department of Transportation's Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System data, the U.S. Coast Guard's Great Lakes Regional Analyst Network vessel tracking data, and the U.S. Maritime Administration's Automated Vessel Identification System data. (6) According to the Coast Guard, the vessel traffic data it used was unreliable and inaccurate, and the Coast Guard had concerns about its data quality. (7) In January 2020, we reported that the Coast Guard's concerns were valid, and the Coast Guard reaffirmed that it is unable to accurately calculate the total annual miles traveled across the district border because of unreliable data. We recommended that the Coast Guard (1) develop reliable data, or (2) seek other sources for mileage data. (8) The Coast Guard has begun developing a system that it plans to implement in 2020. This system will provide reliable and accurate vessel arrival and departure data, among other benefits. Once implemented, the Coast Guard plans to recalculate the total annual miles traveled across the district border. However, until then, the Coast Guard plans to (1) establish a total miles figure based on its revised calculation of the number of miles traveled in the three U.S. pilotage districts for 2019, and (2) recalculate the percentage of the fee paid to pilots in each district.\nDATES: Comments must be received on or before April 1, 2020. Comments received after that date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Coast Guard is only able to assure consideration for comments received on or before this date.\nADDRESSES: To avoid duplication, please use only one of these methods.

Purpose of This Notice Request for Public Comments SUM", "The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically managing its workforce. As shown in table 1, in addition to strategic human capital management, skills gaps played a role in 16 of the 34 high-risk areas on our 2019 High-Risk List, including: (1) information technology management and acquisitions; (2) federal retirement challenges; (3) the federal personnel system; and (4) federal financial reporting. We have also designated as priority 29 of our prior recommendations to OPM because, upon implementation, they may have an especially significant impact on OPM\u2019s operations. OPM agreed or partially agreed with 15 of the priority recommendations; implemented 10 of these recommendations to date, and is in process for the other 5. For example, OPM has taken significant steps to address gaps in the recruitment and hiring process, and is working to increase transparency on performance-based decisions. To improve acquisitions, we recommended that OPM take a more strategic approach to improving and incentivizing the acquisition workforce, such as requiring a certain level of professional certification. We also urged OPM to increase the transparency of ratings associated with individual performance appraisal decisions. This will further enhance management\u2019s ability to identify and address poor performers and strengthen the link between performance and compensation. Despite some improvements, the federal personnel system continues to face structural constraints that hamper agencies from effectively managing their workforces. To effectively address the problem, we recommended that OPM considers re-engineering the current federal classification and pay management system and streamlining classification processes to improve their functioning. OPM is also working to enhance the federal recruitment, training, and development system. We recommended OPM provide agencies with best practices for recruiting and retaining talented federal employees. And we encouraged OPM to work with agencies to develop better approaches for collecting, storing, and disseminating workforce data. To address the human capital challenges associated with federal retirement, we urged OPM to address issues regarding the aging federal workforce by taking steps to provide agency managers with more information about the characteristics and knowledge of their retiring employees, to better inform the development of succession plans. We also recommended steps to better address workforce skills gaps, including: \u2022 Identifying and assessing existing skills. \u2022 Enhancing workforce planning. \u2022 Developing an integrated human capital management system. \u2022 Updating the federal personnel system. OPM agreed with these recommendations and is working to implement these recommendations..\nI would like to learn what the agency is doing to address strategies 4 and 5. OPM has no strategies to align mission requirements with existing workforce skills and capabilities, and no strategies for enhancing workforce planning capabilities. Does the agency have a strategy to align skills with the requirements of the agency mission or any strategies for enhancing workforce planning capabilities? If so, what strategies are in place and what is their status? For example, what strategies does OPM have in place or planned for (a) identifying and assessing existing skills, (b) enhancing workforce planning capabilities, and (c) developing an integrated human capital management system? If no strategies are in place, are there plans for OPM to create strategies to accomplish these objectives? Please provide as much detail as possible about the plans that currently exist and their status, e.g., when will they be initiated or completed.\nThe President\u2019s management agenda established by the president sets the tone to implement those strategies by the agency. OPM\u2019s strategic plan supports this president\u2019s management agenda and highlights these strategic areas as part of its plan at the bottom of page 22.\nIn addition, OPM recently issued a classified strategy.\nA.

L. 98-21, on November, 18, 1983. The SSA is authorized to prepare a combined Annual Report to the Board of Trustees for the Medicare and Social Security Programs. The Medicare portion of this report is prepared by CMS. The Social Security Board of Trustees submits this report to Congress each year. The annual report contains: \u2022\tReport to Congress \u2022\tMedicare Trustees Report \u2022\tThe OASDI Trust Funds Annual Report \u2022\tA 75-year Social Security (OASDI) actuarial balanced budget projection \u2022\tA summary of the results of a 75-year Medicare Trust Funds actuarial study (from 1972 to 1990 \u2013 10 studies) The legislation establishing the Board of Trustees requires that the Boards meet jointly.

FCC established the Office of Native Affairs and Policy in 2004 to act as a liaison between FCC and Indian tribes and other Native American governments to ensure that tribal governments and their residents have the benefit of FCC\u2019s services and programs. FCC is currently working on developing policies to modernize Native American telecommunications services so they can support economic development and community enhancement. For our report, we wanted to identify any barriers or concerns tribes have with broadband deployment efforts on tribal lands. The FCC Office of Native Affairs and Policy\u2019s tribal outreach manager told us that some tribes currently have difficulty obtaining access to spectrum for broadband services. FCC\u2019s 2016 auction of spectrum did not meet tribal entities\u2019 requirements because it relied on the use and retention of the existing technical rules applicable to the 700 MHz band. As such, some tribes did not have access to the 700 MHz band in their service areas. According to the FCC Office of Native Affairs and Policy, tribes with service areas outside the United States have experienced some additional challenges to meet their members\u2019 broadband needs. Tribal stakeholders have noted that the lack of affordable access to licensed spectrum has hindered tribal entities\u2019 efforts in improving broadband services. Tribal entities have sought access to licensed spectrum, but have not received a license to date. In March 2010, FCC released the National Broadband Plan (NBP)\u2014a blueprint for ensuring that all Americans have access to broadband (high-speed) Internet. NBP also emphasized closing the digital divide, especially among Tribal Americans, whose communities often experience the lowest levels of connectivity. However, according to FCC, the plan has not been fully implemented yet. FCC also reported in 2012 that some tribal lands have access to licensed broadband technologies. Also, since 2010 FCC has allowed tribes to develop their own broadband communications policies that are unique to their communities and needs. However, FCC has noted some tribal entities continue to be unable to access licensed spectrum to support their broadband needs. These issues may be attributable to the limited amount of licensed spectrum available and tribal entities\u2019 lack of experience in working with licensees to transfer spectrum usage rights to tribal entities. Tribal entities with wireless broadband access have reported having unreliable connections that interfere with their members\u2019 Internet usage. Tribes have reported that some broadband access providers do not have sufficient access to licensed spectrum in tribal service areas, limiting their ability to provide wireless broadband access. According to GAO-ISS, 1 these shortcomings can hinder tribes\u2019 access to critical public services, limiting their ability to improve their quality of life and support community economic development. For these reasons, FCC should take actions as soon as possible to increase tribal entities\u2019 access to licensed spectrum. According to FCC, some tribal entities have successfully deployed broadband access technologies using unlicensed spectrum. These networks provide adequate Internet access but are sometimes unreliable because of interference problems. FCC noted that some tribal entities are having difficulty transitioning unlicensed technologies to licensed technologies, resulting in reduced coverage area and increased interference because they need to comply with FCC\u2019s new frequency-channel use scheme. Because of these and other ongoing limitations, some tribal entities have not been able to sustain funding to maintain these infrastructure networks. Furthermore, FCC Office of Native Affairs and Policy staff noted that many unlicensed spectrum users lack experience in working with licensees to obtain and transfer spectrum usage rights. Without access to unlicensed spectrum, tribes rely on satellite coverage, which does not allow residents to access services and is much more expensive. If tribes cannot access the frequencies they need to deploy their broadband service, they have no other alternative option to provide their services. For this reason, FCC has the statutory responsibility to address issues affecting tribes\u2019 ability to access licensed spectrum and deploy broadband access services to tribal communities and other members. According to FCC Office of Native Affairs and Policy staff, tribes that lack access to licensed spectrum risk not being able to provide critical Internet services to all of their members, such as health care and education. FCC staff noted that the NBP envisioned creating a more robust broadband network infrastructure across the United States, including remote and rural areas, which is especially important for tribal entities with more limited resources. We believe that FCC should take steps to improve tribal entities\u2019 access to", "", "a. The mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country. The department\u2019s current operating budget for fiscal year 2018, which ends on September 30, is $584.1 billion. DOD\u2019s business systems mission is to support the department and its component services\u2014Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines\u2014in enabling them to meet their missions. In support of this business systems mission, DOD spends billions of dollars annually developing, modernizing, operating, maintaining, and retiring the department\u2019s vast portfolio of business information technology services and solutions for its 1.4 million civilian and military personnel. Except for the approximately $2 billion that DOD spends annually for military personnel pay and health care, this business system budget accounts for far more than half of the department\u2019s entire operating budget. This represents a steep increase from fiscal year 2004, when such spending accounted for less than 40 percent of the department\u2019s annual operating budget of $306 billion; since that year, the business systems budget has more than doubled. Table 1 at the end of this appendix provides an estimate of the fiscal year 2018 DOD business systems budget of $21.6 billion. This estimate includes an amount budgeted for investment of more than $8 billion\u2014this investment is intended to fund enhancements to business automated information systems to improve their efficiency and effectiveness, and to modernize and retire existing legacy systems, to develop modern systems to better support the department and its component services in meeting their missions, and to enhance the department\u2019s information technology security posture. DOD\u2019s investments also fund efforts to improve departmentwide management, modernize legacy business systems to make them more efficient\u2014for example, by consolidating data centers\u2014and enhance and modernize information technology infrastructure across the department. The amount budgeted for investment is budgeted for future years, as well, reflecting a multiyear funding approach.\nb. DOD is required under the Joint Authorities and Joint Implementation Instructions, which establish its investment management framework, to manage business system investments at the program level. A DOD program is generally the department\u2019s funding for and investment in developing, modernizing, operating, or retiring business systems. The amount budgeted for program-level investment in DOD\u2019s business systems includes not only the funding that is appropriated by Congress on an annual basis that DOD uses for its business systems investments, but also the amount of existing appropriations that is reprogrammed by the department for such investments. According to DOD investment management guidance, reprogrammed funds can support incremental investments\u2014incorporating new capabilities to ongoing programs\u2014as well as wholesale business system replacements. The requirement to manage investments at the program level is intended to allow for greater transparency and accountability for program-level investments and to improve consistency of practices across DOD.\nc. Among its investments in business systems, DOD continues to make investments in legacy systems. Such systems may be large-scale systems that it inherited from, or developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, or it may have developed its systems since its invention of the Internet in the late 1960s. These legacy systems have served the department well over the years, but they will have to be modernized, as well as retired, to allow DOD to better support its evolving missions, which include the emerging cyber mission and the increasing demands associated with the global war on terrorism.\nMission area Money management Modernization Retirement Total program investment\nLogistics/supply chain management\nFinancial management Acquisitions\nTraining and readiness Other business services\nTotal business system investment, fiscal year 2018\nd.

Subsequent reports are due to Congress yearly no later than 30 days after the submission of the President's annual budget request as laid out in section 20(7) of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of (126 Stat. 279; 44 U.S.C. 3557). The annual report on cybersecurity is also submitted to GAO by OMB and the agencies, and is prepared by the CIOs of agencies within the executive branch based on standardized methodology and criteria for reporting cybersecurity measures. This volume focuses on key management issues associated with each of the critical infrastructure sectors the President designated under U.S. policy as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act. As defined by the directive (and in accordance with the act), each of these sectors has distinct capabilities, characteristics, interdependencies, and vulnerabilities requiring it to have sufficient controls and protections to ensure continued delivery of essential services, as well as a strong cyber posture and cyber resilience, given its associated risks. For each critical infrastructure sector, the annual status report summarizes: a description of the sector; a discussion of cybersecurity risk management processes used by SCCs and agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to this sector; the nature of cyber threats and vulnerabilities to the infrastructure in this sector and the ways in which those threats and vulnerabilities are managed; the extent to which federal departments' and agencies' actions support this risk management process; and the status of the cybersecurity activities identified in previous assessments, including the status of the implementation of any new and revised security and privacy controls. Federal departments and agencies were to provide a copy of the cybersecurity report to OMB and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Federal departments and agencies were also to report the same cybersecurity information as provided to Congress to GAO. Federal departments and agencies have reported on implementing the guidelines included in the NIST Cybersecurity guideline (i.e., NIST SP 800\u201353Rev. 4, Cybersecurity Requirements for Federal Information Systems and Organizations). Specifically, federal departments and agencies report on efforts to address the  requirements set forth in the NIST Cybersecurity guideline, including the results of compliance and ongoing efforts toward continuous monitoring. Information in the annual reports are voluntary since noncompliance with federal requirements does not result in fines. In addition, the annual reports cover four years. (2016-2018) The Office of Management and Budget issued an assessment reporting to Congress for 2017.

This history of fire exclusion and changes in forest management have resulted in a buildup of surface fuels\u2014burnable material found on or near the ground\u2014and the overstocking of some forests with trees and other fuels. In addition, the reduced frequency of wildfire in some ecosystems has resulted in increased amounts of vegetative debris (e.g., dead trees, branches, leaves, and grasses) accumulating on the ground, which serves to increase fuel quantities and can create more continuous fuels. When this occurs, surface fires\u2014fires that occur on the ground\u2014may ignite more quickly and burn with greater intensity, causing fires to spread more rapidly and extensively than they may have in the past. The arrangement of living vegetation also affects the way wildfires burn. For example, an increase in the density of small trees creates a layered forest structure with fuels going from the forest floor into the forest\u2019s canopy. These layers are sometimes referred to as ladder fuels. This arrangement may allow fire that previously would have remained on the ground to climb the ladder fuels and spread into the trees\u2019 crowns, becoming a high-intensity crown fire. In addition, reducing the frequency of fire in fire-adapted forests and other ecosystems can result in changes to the plant species that make up the forest or ecosystem, which may cause the vegetative composition to shift toward species that are not well adapted to fire, including non-native invasive species. For example, many areas with sagebrush ecosystems\u2014that historically had fires only once every few decades\u2014have been invaded by cheatgrass that when dried creates large swaths of fuels that increase rates of fire spread, intensity, and frequency. In addition to residential housing, other valuable assets and infrastructure that support communities may be located in the WUI, including power lines; highways; and natural resources that provide economic benefits, such as timber, oil and gas wells, and recreation areas.", "Coastal communities face hazards from coastal storms and flooding that can cause loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment. More specifically, coastal communities face threats from erosion and damages from waves, wind, and storm surges.

Proceed to summarize the following text.\nSherwin Nuland, the author of How We Die, wrote the following review of Ms. Duffy\u2019s The Death of Mrs. Westaway for the Sunday Book Review in The New York Times, 7 May 2018.\nA year ago I read and reviewed the novelist Ruth Ware\u2019s mystery novel In a Dark, Dark Wood. I did not give that book a particularly good review. This time I\u2019m very pleased to be reviewing the newest mystery novel from Ware, titled The Death of Mrs. Westaway.\nI always start a review of book by telling you I\u2019m a professional book reviewer, but that\u2019s far from the actual truth. This month marks the 70th anniversary since I started reviewing books for the Sunday Book Review in The New York Times, and since I started doing that I\u2019ve written almost 10,000 reviews for them.\nSo I just want to tell you again how much I love doing this work, how much I relish it. My great love for the reviews I\u2019ve written for The New York Times started with a very simple idea that I had: I would review only books that I liked. Well, that means, because I\u2019ve written so many reviews, that I haven\u2019t liked every book I\u2019ve ever read. In fact, I don\u2019t like about 45% of the books I read, but I\u2019ve written reviews of almost all of them. The reviews I\u2019ve written for those books that I didn\u2019t like are the ones I most enjoy writing, and that\u2019s because while I\u2019m writing them, I\u2019m usually in quite a good mood.\nIn addition, after I write and send a review of a book I don\u2019t like, my spirits always manage to rise, for the sheer excitement over trying something new, rather than something I like. And that\u2019s why the reviews I write about books I like are the ones that I most enjoy writing.\nNow with all of that in mind, let me tell you that after reading the mystery novel The Death of Mrs. Westaway by the author Ruth Ware, I enjoyed reading it and I very much liked it. While I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say it was an extraordinary book, it was an excellent one.\nI was struck by the way the book began, because Ware wasted absolutely no time in telling the reader about the murder that would soon take place before the story truly got underway. The fact is that this is a fairly short novel, with only 356 pages, and there\u2019s no room in it for an author to have the reader wait for hours and hours for the story to begin. And to make it very clear, there\u2019s even less room for the book to meander around the plot of the story\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of suspense in the book\u2014because a certain sense of urgency is one of the most important elements that keeps the reader thoroughly engrossed.\nI always like what I do here, which is to give you a short summery of the books I\u2019ve written about, and my opinion of them. In fact, I just made a vow to myself that from this minute forward I\u2019m going to do my best to be honest with you in all reviews I write for you. With that in mind, I\u2019d better stop because I am going to be completely honest with you\u2014I really liked this mystery novel, and I very much enjoyed reading it.\nTo get this point across to you without spoiling any surprises in the book, I\u2019ll say this: If you read a great deal like I do and you have a hard time getting into a book in the first chapter, you\u2019ve got to read this one to see what I\u2019m talking about, especially if you like mysteries. Now let me tell you one other thing about this book before I end: I loved the ending.\nI was amazed when I reached it, and that\u2019s what I tell you when I recommend you read this book, and I most certainly do recommend this mystery novel with great enthusiasm.\nI\u2019ve been a writer now for approximately fifty years, and in that time I have spent roughly ten thousand hours writing reviews of mystery novels. Some of those novels were excellent, while others were not very good at all, but I always liked reviewing them. I like to review the novels and stories that I think will be read by a large number of people, whether they are excellent or not. And I also enjoy telling you about the books and stories I myself enjoy.\nI usually never review a mystery novel unless my own publishers recommend it, but this week they suggested a book by the author Ruth", "GAO reviewed the regulatory treatment of FBOs, the availability of price comparisons between FBOs, and actions taken by airports under federal grant assurances.

The Bureau\u2019s in-field address canvassing operation began at seven Area Census Offices (ACOs) on August 4 and then rolled out for the remaining ACOs on August 18. Bureau officials reported that they were able to meet their performance standards for the address canvassing operation because listers were more productive overall and more productive than expected when listers incurred delays, such as for lunches and traffic.\nThe bureau\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is the lead for initiatives to modernize the bureau\u2019s information technology (IT). Although other bureau offices also develop or support IT, OCIO coordinates with these entities to make best use of the bureau\u2019s resources when managing IT and for developing and implementing bureauwide IT modernization. OCIO coordinates and manages IT projects for the bureau and is developing a centralized IT investment portfolio.\nOCIO is also responsible for updating the bureau\u2019s IT master plan. The masterplan, which was published before the 2018 hiring freeze, prioritized IT projects with high business value\u2014 such as address canvassing\u2014and included 49 projects with an estimated annual cost of about $400 million. The plan also included projected cost savings and estimated dates to achieve full savings for the projects. The plan projected savings of nearly $300 million over 5 years to achieve its goal of making IT more efficient and effective. However, in March 2019, OCIO requested nearly $220 million in funding to be redirected from projects to meet bureau directives. Although bureau officials stated that these investments help modernize the bureau\u2019s capabilities, these changes to the projects in the master plan may affect the completion dates and associated savings. Furthermore, OCIO has not yet conducted cost analyses of the projects included in the updated master plan. These analyses inform the bureau leadership about the expected return on investments for the projects; however, cost analyses are required for approval of large IT projects. OCIO also stated that it will complete these analyses by the end of 2019.\nAs part of its IT master planning efforts, OCIO is also developing a project prioritization model that assesses the impact of current and planned IT projects on the bureau\u2019s business portfolios before making an investment. OCIO has not yet completed this model, but when it completes the model, OCIO will be able to assess the impact of different IT investments on the bureau\u2019s ability to carry out various activities related to the 2020 census.\nThe Office of Research, Educational and National Policy (RENP) is the lead for the bureau\u2019s ongoing research activities. RENP conducts and supports research activities to improve the bureau\u2019s methodology and quality control. RESULTS: Prior approval of IT projects and an IT master plan are generally considered good practices for organizations that develop and manage IT. For example, if an organization develops a master plan, it will identify all current and planned IT investments by business functions. With this information, managers can identify project dependencies\u2014i.e., if a component for project A is also critical for project B, project B must complete before project A can proceed. Managers will then develop a schedule for IT projects to prevent resource constraints and ensure that project completion dates will be met. An identified schedule also allows managers to ensure that projects with high business value are completed on time. Managers can then monitor the projects to ensure that project teams are complying with schedules and cost estimates as well as managing risks.\nOCIO reported that they may consider updating the IT master plan to include additional projects as they identify cost savings and projects that can help the bureau modernize its IT and improve efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, an updated IT master plan with projects prioritized for business value and cost savings, and with additional project cost analyses, would provide better information for bureau managers to determine which of the IT projects in the 2019 update should be completed or stopped based on return on investment. Similarly, managers can use this information for future IT investments to more effectively manage their projects and better assess which IT projects and enhancements would provide the greatest value to the bureau.\nThe bureau also stated that it is updating its project prioritization model. OCIO stated this model will help assess the impact of varying IT investments on the bureau\u2019s activities, but has not yet completed the model. The bureau stated that the REN", "The Air Force is not effectively managing the initial and continuation training of its pilots according to training requirements and cost objectives. In September 2016, we recommended that the Air Force comprehensively reassess the training requirements used to establish its annual training plans\u2014and make any appropriate adjustments in future plans to ensure the Air Force can meet its training goals and cost objectives. The Rand Corporation report, titled \u201cA Comprehensive Review of Air Combat Command\u2019s Pilot Training Plans and Needs,\u201d released March 31, 2017, examines the assumptions underpinning, or in support of, the Air Force\u2019s Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) and the training required for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 budget request, and it was also used as the basis for Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein's, decision to increase the size of the force by 4,000 pilots over the next two fiscal years. Because of the importance of the topic area, we wanted to assess the report and whether the conclusions that support the need to add 4,000 additional pilots were accurate. Doing this requires us to understand the information presented in our last report and the RAND report, and the extent to which it can be relied upon to make management and programmatic decisions, such as increasing the size of the force. To that end, we summarized the key information in the RAND report on the RAP and compared it with the information we presented in our last report for one of the aircraft (i.e., the A-10A) and the assumptions we reported used to calculate initial training requirements. With that, we discuss our assessment of the Rand Corporation Report, and in doing so, we draw two conclusions: (1) the assumptions used in the report\u2019s analysis of the RAP training requirements for A- 10As are not consistent with the training requirements and assumptions reported by the ACC in response to our last report, particularly the requirement to hire and train approximately 1,000 additional new pilots per year for the first two years, and, (2) the RAND report relied on data that was over two to five years old to make its conclusions. For example, ACC\u2019s data for the A-10A pilot training program in its response to the last report indicated that the ACC had hired about 461 additional new pilots in FYs 2015 and 2016 as a result of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act mandated pilot hiring, and that the ACC had only required 1 additional new pilot in FY 2016 to sustain the existing training plan for the airframe. According to the data presented in the RAND report, the hiring deficiencies that the report identified occurred primarily after FY 2016, with the exception of the training for the A-10A where the RAND report indicated that the lack of A-10A replacement pilots had led to a shortfall in the total number of A-10As that should be assigned to the Air National Guard (ANG) units. This shortfall results from RAND relying upon data that is out of date. Specifically, the RAND report relied upon ANG data for FY 2013, which shows one Air Force wing assigned a total of 102 A-10As, while the FY 2017 ANG data shows 87 A-10As assigned in total between two wings. The 15 fewer ANG A- 10As can be directly tied to the Air Force\u2019s effort to hire replacements for pilots that are eligible for retirement, or who have retired, which can then allow the Air Force to reallocate the A-10As in the U.S. Air Force to the ANG. Because of this situation, we believe that the Rand Corporation report failed to correctly assess future training requirements for the A-10As and the need to hire additional pilots. The RAND report concludes that there is an 80 percent probability that the number of pilots who will leave the FY 2018 A-10A force is less than 30, which provides an opportunity for the Air Force to cut the size of the A-10A force without negatively impacting the desired force mix of 159 A-10As. However we note that the RAND report uses the same approach for assessing the overall A-10A total retirees each year as we used in our last report for the A", "The National Flood Insurance Program is a federally- funded, FEMA managed program that enables property owners to purchase flood insurance for their homes and businesses. Since 1968, the NFIP has funded flood losses and offered insurance to property owners and renters who are insured through a participating private insurance company or governmental insurance program, including flood insurance provided by FEMA.", "Each major facilities project has a sponsoring office from within NSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seven research directorates. The sponsoring office assesses the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n30 A of the major-project development process. The MREFC Program Office at NSF administers the MREFC account and oversees the construction contracting and integration of the research infrastructure. The office also develops a formal project execution plan and works with the project contractor to develop and refine the project baseline estimate, to review contractor invoices, and to manage the change-control process during the construction phase (MREFC Guide 2016). During the design phase, NSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Science prepares a report for MAB that summarizes the sponsoring directorate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of scientific priority and outlines a recommended construction budget (Maass 2016). In addition, NSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Management prepares a report for MAB that includes a cost estimate, a risk/benefit analysis, and identification of an appropriate source of funding to fulfill the project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operational phase (Barnes 2016a). MAB reviews these reports, and if the report from the Office of Management describes a project that satisfies the needs identified by the Office of Science, MAB approves a new-start project, which authorizes NSF to begin the contracting and procurement process by issuing a request for proposals to potential construction or operations contractors (MREFC Guide 2016). The Office of Science then conducts selection and contract negotiation with the most qualified construction vendor and recommends an award to MAB. For operations contractors, NSF provides the funding, as appropriate, for each stage of development (design, construction, operations, and divestment) to the designated facility managers and operators. FIGURE 1: Overseer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Oversight of Major Facilities Projects 7\u00e2\u0080\u009311, 2016. p. 31\n31 Once a project begins the operations phase, NSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews its annual budgetary performance through the NSF-OMB budget review process. The operations-phase budget must meet the statutory requirements at 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71864a, to which NSF refers in its Major Facilities Guide (2016), which states: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach facility manager and operations manager shall develop operations budgets in accordance with the provisions of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, including budgetary performance that is cost-effective and provides adequate and appropriate levels of scientific access or usage. The budgetary performance shall consist of measurable performance criteria for specific user categories as well as project-wide criteria.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For example, the budget must cover staff salaries, including scientific and technical staff, as well as utilities and services, and provide an adequate budget for facility maintenance (Barnes 2016a; MREFC Guide 2016). To monitor compliance with the statutory requirements, the OMB conducts a performance review of the major-project portfolio annually, as described in fig. 2. This is a review of the performance of all major projects in the facilities portfolio that are in the operations or construction phase. The OMB analyzes performance against the performance indicators outlined in the statutory requirements and associated budget plans (see, for example, Barnes 2016b). The review findings are shared with NSF in annual briefings that take place in May each year, when NSF provides an overview of the performance of the overall portfolio (Maass 2017; NSF Office of Management 2017). RECOMMENDATION 5 Given congressional support for NSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major research facility investments, the Subcommittee urges the NSF to continue working to improve its project management processes and to ensure that its major projects are transparent to all stakeholders and the general public. In addition, the Subcommittee urges the NSF to enhance transparency, as appropriate, to enable it to receive effective oversight from MAB and OMB. The Subcommittee recommends that the NSF provide oversight responsibilities to a new advisory committee to provide project-level guidance. The Subcommittee also recommends that the OMB continue to conduct its annual review of all active major projects to provide an objective measure of performance according to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1864a.

IRS has taken some actions to combat IDT; however, the agency needs to refine its processes and controls for assessing the risk of IDT. By examining the underlying causes of IDT, IRS could strengthen the integrity of its processes. The results of our assessment support our prior conclusion that IRS has made progress in implementing controls over IT systems that support IDT. However, IRS has not fully matured them. In addition, our report found that IRS could increase its effectiveness and efficiency through process improvements and enhanced use of automated data mining tools and technology to identify potentially fraudulent taxpayer accounts.  ASSET: IDT is a continuing problem that the IRS faces. Last year, fraudulent and abusive tax schemes cost the government over $2 billion. Since 2015, 33,164 taxpayers have been convicted of IDT for a total of $34.1 billion for fiscal years 2012-2016  The report was to determine the factors that lead to the fraud. TERMINUS: The current systems and processes at the IRS need to be reviewed. Investment should be made into reviewing IRS systems and processes to detect IDT, which can result in a cost savings for the IRS.  IDT is a serious and longstanding problem. IRS has taken some actions to combat IDT; however, the agency needs to refine its processes and controls for assessing the 5 5 Risks Associated With IDT at IRS The IRS is particularly vulnerable to IDT because: a. The IRS is responsible for determining if a taxpayer is allowed to receive a refund to which they are not entitled. b. The IRS lacks the resources to match employment and federal information to its return processing activities in a timely manner. (See appendix V, figure 1)  c. Return processing often takes place during a significant period of time after a taxpayer submits their return. For example, according to IRS officials, a timely electronic return that the IRS received on January 1, 2018 could have an April 15, 2018, due date. The IRS begins processing the return on January 16, 2018. As of January 16, 2018, there have been 951 days since the return was submitted to the IRS. (See appendix V, figure 2)  IRS officials stated that the average time it takes the IRS to process a return during fiscal year 2018 was roughly 33 days, when including the tax examinations process. (See appendix V, figure 3) d. As it stands, the IRS does not have an automated process to analyze and detect IDT fraud. Instead, IRS conducts tax examinations in a paper-based, labor-intensive process. IRS processes nearly 40 million individual tax returns and processes $400 billion in tax refunds annually. Further, IRS officials stated that as of fiscal year 2018, tax examiners performed an average of 5.4 tax examinations, which they attributed to improvements the agency has made in automation. (See appendix V, figure 4)  Further, IRS reports show that although the IRS makes progress in reducing refund fraud, IDT remains a significant concern. For example, the IRS has taken steps to reduce the amount of refunds from false or duplicate tax filings but other aspects of IDT continue. According to IRS officials, about 90 percent of duplicate tax returns are the result of stolen identities. However, the return is not necessarily fraudulent. While the IRS has made progress on the amount of refund fraud, it cannot provide statistics on the amount of IDT activity.  The IRS has not implemented a solution to address IDT. IRS officials stated that examiners conduct tax examinations using a risk-based process 6 6 Risks associated with IDT are changing and evolving. For example, IRS officials stated that they have concerns about international criminal syndicates involved in IDT because they are able to transfer large sums of money out of the country, thus making the money untraceable. IRS officials identified the following as emerging trends in IDT: a. Taxpayers requesting a tax refund via gift cards; b. Increased numbers of taxpayers entering incorrect or invalid SSNs, as", "In general, these efforts have had a positive effect on enhancing the security of mass transit systems, though there is still significant room for growth. S&T, in coordination with TSA, conducts its R&D efforts by working with mass transit operators through the various pilot project and assessment programs. For example, S&T recently worked with the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Capital Metro) in Austin, Texas, to evaluate and assess their use of canine explosives detection units (EDUs) to screen passengers as a mass transit security measure (see figure 3). Similarly, S&T worked with New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), in coordination with TSA, to assess the use of EDUs in mass transit enviroments. S&T\u2019s R&D efforts currently focus on identifying and evaluating security products, including screening equipment, that are suitable for deployment and use by mass transit operators, while also identifying the needs of and security threats facing mass transit operators. As technology evolves and new security threats emerge for surface transportation, S&T\u2019s R&D efforts continue to be driven by needs identified as a result of the IPT process. TSA. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, TSA implemented the Security Credentialing and Access Control System (SCAMS) to enhance the identification and surveillance capabilities of Transportation Security Officers at mass transit facilities (see figure 4). Following this system, Congress codified the requirement under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114 and directed TSA to implement and oversee a comprehensive access control (AC) system to meet the requirements of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. TSA overlaps with S&T in multiple areas, including conducting assessment pilot programs and coordinating the assessment pilot programs as they pertain to mass transit. TSA coordinates the process for deploying pilot projects with mass transit operators and ensures that S&T is consulted during the planning process. Once deployed, TSA collects information for the pilot project sponsors and ensures that the data is made available to S&T to support evaluation and assessment activities. S&T also works with TSA to assess the effectiveness of the mass transit pilot products after deployment. S&T and TSA collaborated to conduct a joint evaluation effort to assess the utility of EDUs in screening mass transit passengers and their ability to deter and detect concealed explosive incendiary devices (CEDs). The evaluation, jointly developed and funded by S&T and TSA, assessed the ability of screening devices to detect CEDs, as well as their ability to operate in a real-world mass transit environment. S&T and TSA have continued to collaborate on a similar effort to evaluate new technologies for mass transit use and identify future mass transit S&T R&D efforts. Specifically, S&T has established the Technology Evaluation Process for New Technologies in the Transit Environment (T.E.P.N.T.E.) to allow technology developers to provide S&T with the technical information necessary for TSA and S&T to prioritize and assess new technologies. S&T staff also participate as subject matter experts (SMEs) in multiple program offices within TSA to support future technology needs assessments. As part of these efforts, S&T has worked closely with TSA to address a wide range of technology and operational questions related to screening mass transit passengers, to include those associated with physical security. O&M, a component of DHS, is a primary partner for S&T\u2019s R&D efforts and has been a strong supporter of S&T\u2019s initiatives since the establishment of the IAC. O&M works through its Office of Security Assistance and International Affairs to support S&T\u2019s efforts both domestically and in developing and transitional countries. O&M provides S&T with subject matter experts that can offer their specialized knowledge to assist in a variety of S&T processes, including product assessments and field testing. Moreover, O&M staff work directly with mass transit operators to support R&D efforts, and, along with the Transportation Security Directorate\u2019s (TSD) Security Technology Division, provide security consulting to operators. TSD also works with the FTA on security standards and training for mass tranpis operators. FTA. FTA, an operating unit within DHS with responsibility for developing security standards for all mode of surface transportation, works closely with mass transit operators to review and appro", "DHS and its components invest billions of dollars each year to acquire IT and other capabilities to support the department\u2019s critical functions. The department plans to spend approximately $2.3 billion on major IT investments in fiscal year 2020. However, DHS has faced long-standing challenges in acquiring and managing IT. We have highlighted the department\u2019s IT management issues on our high-risk list since 2003 and have made numerous recommendations to improve its IT management practices. Examples include a recommendation to develop policies to help ensure that IT acquisitions are managed in an effective and transparent manner and a recommendation to develop and implement departmentwide policies for IT program management, including IT modernization, and make these policies available for component use. DHS must also develop a plan, with milestones, to address the challenges we identified in the high-risk report, including those related to enterprise architectures and the control environment. As of August 21, 2019, the department had no specific policies regarding IT program management, and its high-risk report contains no updates. In addition, DHS needs policies to help ensure that contracts with vendors for major IT acquisitions are managed in an effective and transparent manner. While the department has been working toward establishing such policies, as of August 21, 2019, DHS had no specific policies. We recommended in 2018 that DHS develop such policies. Although the department has taken some preliminary steps toward establishing such policies\u2014for example, it has issued an Acquisition Instruction (No. 1, 3.5) for IT Investments to help address the need for effective IT acquisition management\u2014it had not yet completed any policies for IT management or for the acquisition of these critical systems as of August 21, 2019.\u201d\n\u201c2.6.1 The Risk of Investing in New Capabilities at the Expense of Other National Security Challenges \u2022 The Trump Administration has elevated the threat of cyber-attack to a national security concern. The threats to federal information systems and critical infrastructure continue to constitute a critical national security concern, while DHS has devoted limited attention and resources to address such threats. \u2022 Although cybersecurity is among the President\u2019s highest priorities, the Fiscal Year 2020 budget request does not include sufficient funding for DHS to address major national security cybersecurity risks. \u2022 DHS and the interagency process for national security system certification and accreditation have significant weaknesses, which hamper our ability to assess national security risks. \u2022 DHS, and specifically its National Protection and Programs Directorate, has not developed metrics to measure its progress addressing national security risks. \u2022 DHS has not implemented effective governance of its national security systems and cyber incident response capabilities. \u2022 DHS is not effectively using its information security personnel to address its most critical national security risks. \u2022 DHS has not implemented, and does not plan to implement, the security controls called for in major accreditation standards for federal information systems. \u2022 DHS is not effectively using risk management in the design, development, and operation of national security systems and critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201c3.1.2 Control of DHS Contracts \u2022 Under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, federal employees are barred from holding financial interests of more than $10,000 in a contract with a federal agency that is assigned to that employee or that employee\u2019s spouse or minor children. \u2022 DHS does not consistently apply its policy on financial interests to acquisitions with nonprofits that serve as contractors. \u2022 DHS has not developed or implemented policies to prevent or mitigate the influence of contractors over procurement decisions and actions.\u201d\n\u201c4.3.1 DHS Acquisition Workforce Development \u2022 The DHS acquisition workforce has grown significantly since 2007. For example, contracting positions were planned to increase 20 percent between fiscal years 2007 and 2009, and acquisition positions grew 20 percent between fiscal years 2012 and 2017. \u2022 DHS has not fully identified the workforce skills and knowledge levels needed to effectively accomplish the mission. \u2022 The majority of contracting workforce members take a single assessment for placement. Workforce members must take the same initial job skills assessment and, therefore, a single workforce-wide training plan with common requirements that are scalable to the agency\u2019s size is needed. \u2022 A number of federal workforce members have not completed their acquisition training requirements. \u2022 Few acquisition work", "TSA officials stated that the security directives are reviewed by the agency on a regular basis to determine whether it is appropriate to incorporate the security measures from them. However, the agency\u2019s process for identifying whether directives are obsolete or could otherwise be incorporated into a carrier\u2019s security program is not sufficiently thorough, as it focuses on reviewing directives individually as opposed to reviewing them broadly to determine if they are redundant with current TSA requirements. TSA policies and procedures specify that directives are not intended to be permanent and are expected to eventually be canceled or incorporated into the air carrier\u2019s security programs. As of December 2019, however, TSA officials acknowledged that 14 directives could possibly remain in effect over the next decade and stated that they have not reviewed whether those directives should be revised because they are not in the critical path for the agency and represent only a small portion (less than 1 percent) of the total directives. Without this review, TSA is at risk of missing opportunities to improve security, reduce the number of directives, simplify the security programs of its air carriers, and streamline security requirements for its air carriers. We believe TSA\u2019s process for tracking its directives and incorporating them into carrier programs would benefit from the establishment of a method for systematically identifying directives that should be revised or canceled. We also recommend that TSA reevaluate its process for incorporating directives into air carrier security programs and the incorporation criteria it uses to facilitate this process; however, this report is not about those processes. In addition to the potential risk of not canceling duplicate directives, we found that there are currently 19 active directives that do not appear to require air carriers to revise their security programs to account for changes in international aviation security standards or the agency\u2019s expectations of air carriers\u2019 security programs since the directives were published. The directives may therefore contribute to TSA-audited airlines being noncompliant with TSA expectations in some international security standards, such as the 2019 requirement to conduct airport assessments. We therefore also recommend that the agency reevaluate these directives to determine whether to incorporate them into carrier security programs, initiate the process to modify or cancel them, or take additional actions. Furthermore, airlines stated that TSA does not inform them of directives when they are issued, and when the directives are incorporated into air carriers\u2019 programs, there is a delay in informing program users. TSA stated that it plans to complete this revision by December 2019. Until this occurs, the directives and emergency amendments have not been incorporated into the air carrier\u2019s security programs, and many air carrier-related airport users that we spoke to were unaware that any changes have been issued regarding the directives. Without the incorporation of the new requirements into air carrier programs and awareness of these changes among program users, there is a potential for program users to conduct program audits using standards that do not align with TSA expectations and requirements. We also believe that TSA\u2019s process for modifying or cancelling directives to account for changes in TSA\u2019s expectations of air carrier security programs is inconsistent with TSA\u2019s guidance for issuing security directives. TSA is therefore potentially risking noncompliance with its own security standards.\nThe Federal Government is required by law to issue a public accounting of how it uses taxpayer dollars. Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act in 1990, in order to improve management in the executive branch of the government by requiring annual audited financial statements. These statements are known as the Financial Statements of the US Government (U.S. GAAP basis). The annual audits for 2014 and 2015 have now been issued by the GAO and are presented here in plain language for non-experts to better understand the U.S. Government Financial Statements. It is critical for the citizens of the United States to understand the financial reporting of the Government in order to ensure its fiscal responsibility. This information is very complex and should be read in the context of this publication.\nThe purpose of this annual financial statements is to provide information on: a) The financial position of the U.S. Government at September 30, 2016; b) The results of operations (for the fiscal year) ended September 30, 2016; and c) The cash flows of the U.S. Government for fiscal year 2016.\nAs a summary, the financial", "This report (1) summarizes our examination results related to diversity and inclusion efforts at the Office of Finance and the 11 FHLBanks as part of our 2018 annual assessment; (2) describes diversity and inclusion efforts of the 11 FHLBanks in our assessment and provides results from related questions in the Financial Management Survey of FHLBanks, which FHFA administered on behalf of the FHLBank System Office of Finance (the \u201cBank\u201d) in 2018 and 2017; (3) summarizes our annual review of diversity information in the FHLBanks\u2019 2018 annual reports and any additional communications from FHLBanks on this topic; and (4) summarizes FHFA\u2019s examination, or \u201coff-site,\u201d monitoring of the Bank\u2019s diversity and inclusion activities and results during 2009\u20132013.

The 2017 update reviewed this topic and found little progress given the current state of federal resilience efforts. We reiterate this priority in our 2018 update as federal efforts to mitigate climate risks and strengthen resilience remain fragmented across agencies; as a result, investments are not coordinated or optimized to reduce federal climate risks. In addition, the federal government provides funding to address disaster damages and losses but does not provide funding to help jurisdictions prepare to better avoid damage and reduce disaster losses in the future. In July 2018 we reported that the federal government lacks a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the resilience of communities and facilities, particularly in light of worsening weather events related to climate change. The absence of such a strategy presents financial and national security risks, in addition to the loss of life and property from natural disasters. While the 112th Congress established a task force to study the costs of climate-related disasters and potential impacts for federal disaster funding, this task force may not address the need for coordination, as intended by Congress. According to the 2017 update to our report on federal efforts to mitigate climate change, none of the 17 programs that were targeted for action had addressed the need for coordination by focusing efforts across agencies. FEMA has sought to mitigate this through its Disaster Mitigation National Strategy, but progress would benefit from enhanced policy and a whole-of-government approach. For example, in 2018, FEMA and the Office of the Science and Technology Policy convened a group of senior government officials to facilitate agency coordination on a resilience initiative and develop a resilience strategy. However, this approach to address the challenge of lack of coordination across agencies does not adequately leverage the full capacity of the federal government. The 115th  Congress considered legislation to overhaul FEMA\u2019s disaster response, but the bills stalled without action. To better identify the challenges ahead and inform efforts to enhance the effectiveness of disaster preparedness and response efforts, including related to resilience, GAO examined the role of federal agencies in disaster response. Specifically, GAO examined (1) the federal agencies\u2019 roles in disaster response and their authorities to address needs, and (2) the extent to which agencies with disaster response authorities coordinate their efforts. In the course of that examination, GAO observed a wide range of roles for agencies in the federal response to disasters, with roles that included addressing issues ranging from housing to food. For example, GAO observed that in disaster response, many federal agencies provide grants, contracts, and services as well as other financial and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal jurisdictions to help them repair flood-damaged public infrastructure. Moreover, according to FEMA guidance and other sources, some agencies may participate in disaster response in ways that fall outside their mission statements or statutory authorities. For example, GAO observed that under certain circumstances, the National Park Service may support disaster response in order to stabilize park landscapes. Agency officials also noted that they work with FEMA and other federal agencies to plan for disasters, for example, the Department of Agriculture provided crop insurance to the owners of more than 680,000 farms and ranches in 2018, and the Department of Veterans Affairs collaborates with FEMA to provide assistance to eligible veterans.  Despite FEMA providing federal disaster assistance, it does not provide jurisdictions with funds to help them prepare for disasters, citing statutory authority. Therefore, jurisdictions must fund their own emergency preparedness activities, such as hazard mitigation, which can include flood control measures. Nevertheless, federal agencies participate in planning exercises that facilitate agencies\u2019 coordination through agency-led tabletop exercises. GAO also reported that while the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s National Response Framework provides a structure and process for the establishment of the emergency support function, the framework does not specifically identify the role of all federal agencies nor does it include a plan for cross-agency coord", "Reducing transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries has consistently been DOT\u2019s top priority. Traffic fatalities and serious injuries may result from unsafe driver behaviors, such as speeding, or from the design or condition of the roadway and its accompanying infrastructure. Within DOT, both NHTSA and FHWA are charged with reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the nation\u2019s highways; NHTSA provides funding to state highway safety offices to implement highway safety programs, and FHWA also provides HSIP grant funding to states for projects to improve safety on all public roads.\n\u2022\tFunding for state highway safety offices: Since 1967, DOT has provided financial support to the states to help them develop an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to road safety. These grants are commonly called \u201chighway safety grants.\u201d DOT provided about $550 million in highway safety funding to states in fiscal year 2018.\nNHSTA administers the Highway Safety Grants Program, allocating funding directly to state highway safety offices (SHSOs). NHTSA grants are performance-based, allowing SHSOs maximum flexibility to address roadway safety problems. SHSOs are required to develop and implement highway safety plans and annual highway safety activities which address the factors contributing to highway fatalities, injuries, and property loss. In 2005, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) required states to set road safety targets for each highway safety program and to conduct road safety audits in their state highway safety plans to determine performance against those targets.\n\u2022\tFunding for states to improve road safety: DOT also provides additional federal funding to states to improve safety on both Federal-aid highways and on other public roads. In 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which contains provisions intended to increase emphasis on the safety of all vehicles traveling on the Nation\u2019s surface transportation system.\nMAP-21 also established the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, legislation enacted in October 2015 that addressed many funding concerns by extending funding commitments through fiscal year 2016 and authorizing funds for federal highway, highway safety, transit, and other transportation programs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In addition, SAFETEA-LU authorizes funds for federal highway, highway safety, transit, and other transportation programs for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.\nMAPF-21 established the Highway Safety Improvement Program. The Highway Safety Improvement Program allocates funding for safety improvements on rural interstates and other major highways, as well as in the construction of new highway safety features and devices that provide safety improvements. MAP-21 also included a set of performance measures to guide performance-based program decisions related to highway safety by state and regional transportation and law enforcement agencies across the country. These measures are intended to support implementation of performance-based approaches to managing and improving transportation and highway safety. By 2014, MAP-21 required state departments of transportation to develop targets for highway safety performance measures on which they would be scored.\nThrough this process, states are to assess their ongoing highway safety activities and to identify and implement strategies to meet these targets. Under the HSIP framework, safety activities that contribute to these performance targets are funded through the HSIP program. HSIP safety performance measures are used to assess whether states are meeting their targets for reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the nation\u2019s highways. Each year, states are required to submit an Annual Performance Report that assesses how well they are meeting their targets and to document the strategies they employ to improve these targets.\nNHTSA also administers grants for the establishment of state traffic safety information systems. These programs promote the collection, reporting, and analysis of data on traffic safety-related activities. By making these data available to state and local agencies as well as to the federal government, these programs promote improved road safety nationwide. In addition, NHTSA funds the State Data Program to help states collect traffic crash and road safety data. NHTSA recently proposed changing the federal motor vehicle safety standard for rearview mirrors for light trucks, which could improve visibility and reduce rearview crashes for light trucks operating at speeds greater than 25 mph.\n\u2022\tIn 2014, NHT", "VA\u2019s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials....\nTAGS: IT-enabled services, management consulting, performance measurement, organizational assessment, VistA\nThe following is an example of how we created a PPBE plan.

Under this program, VHA provides monthly stipends, support, and training to caregivers, who are primarily family members, of eligible veterans who suffer severe injuries that would otherwise require the care of a nursing home of residential care. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) must submit reports to Congress on implementation of the program. In addition, VHA must establish an advisory committee to assist with program implementation, outreach, and related initiatives. TEXT: The FCG Program has been well-received, and demand for the program from VHA providers and caregivers exceeds capacity. Extending eligibility until December 31, 2023, for all eligible veterans who are enrolled under VHA, whether as primary or secondary enrollees, should improve access to and outreach for the FCG Program. In addition, extending eligibility for the FCG Program under such conditions should better enable VHA to provide support, training, and care coordination to those caregivers and veterans. However, the FCG Program is limited to 1,944 family caregivers caring for an approved estimated 2,000 veterans. The provision limiting eligibility to 1,944 caregivers is based on the number of caregivers who were enrolled in the program when it was most recently authorized. The number of caregivers is fixed according to the program design, which includes a two-year limit on training, a requirement that a family caregiver be enrolled prior to his or her service member enrolling in the program, and a limited number of program authorizations (56,000) which cannot be exceeded. These program restrictions, combined with increasing need and demand, is creating an unacceptable shortfall in the capacity of the program to enroll caregivers into the training and support track of the program. This shortfall could, and in some instances already is, leading to caregender exclusion of caregivers and denial of caregivers who are eligible to participate in the program, ultimately harming the program\u2019s core mission of providing support to family caregivers. The Committee finds that the FCG Program is an essential benefit for VHA enrollees, but the VHA is ill-equipped to effectively address the needs of qualified caregivers. The provision of the bill to extend FCG Program eligibility until December 31, 2023, is intended to address this shortfall and ensure that all who are qualified to participate in the program are able to do so. TEXT: Additionally, VHA has created its own family caregiver program; however, the program has no oversight, limited accountability, and the quality of caregivers varies significantly across VHA and is, in effect, unmonitored. Given increasing enrollments in the FCG Program, and the increased number of providers, enrollees, and VAMCs that will likely be involved in FCG care coordination plans, creating a robust oversight process will be critical to ensuring quality of care across the nation. TEXT: VHA must also compete with other support programs to attract family caregivers to the FCG Program. The quality and transparency of the program experience, including quality of eligibility information and support, vary widely, which further erodes confidence in the program and may contribute to exclusion of deserving caregivers from the FCG Program. TEXT: Given this current situation, providing a stable eligibility period of five years allows VHA\u2019s leadership to continue the program, improve the delivery of training, and develop additional partnerships with the community for both program and non-program veterans to ensure the program is not limited by capacity. TEXT: Further, this provision would support improvements in VHA quality indicators, including reducing the occurrence of preventable adverse events, improving readings on survey measures used to calculate star ratings, and increasing the number of Veteran-Directed Care options in each VISN.", "Expert in summarizing text.

The FSM is a federation of four semiautonomous states-Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap-whose population and income vary widely. Chuuk, the largest state by population, has the lowest per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) (about $3,200). Overall, the FSM had a 2016 population of approximately 102,000 and a GDP per capita of about $3,200. The RMI's 2016 population was approximately 54,000 with a GDP per capita of about $3,600. The RMI's most recent census, in 2011, found that approximately three-quarters of the population lived in Majuro, the nation's capital, and on the island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll. Table 1 shows the FSM's, FSM states', and RMI's estimated populations and annual GDP per capita in fiscal year 2016. U.S. relations with the FSM and the RMI began during World War II, when the United States ended Japanese occupation of the region. Starting in 1947, the United States administered the region under a United Nations trusteeship. In 1986, after a period of negotiations, the United States entered into a compact of free association with the FSM and RMI that provided for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed FSM and RMI citizens to migrate to the United States. In 2003, after a period of negotiations, the United States approved separate amended compacts with the FSM and the RMI that went into effect on June 25, 2004, and May 1, 2004, respectively. The amended compacts' implementing legislation authorized and appropriated direct financial assistance to the countries in six core sectors- education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector development, and public sector capacity building-with priority given to the education and health sectors. These grants are described in section 211(a) of each compact and are referred to as (211 [a]) grants. Section 211(b) of the RMI compact further states that the RMI must target a specific amount of grants to the island of Ebeye and other communities within Kwajalein Atoll. Section 222 of each compact and their subsidiary trust fund agreements established a trust fund for each country, with the U.S. contributing to each fund. Table 1 shows the amounts of the respective U.S. contributions to the FSM and the RMI through fiscal year 2023 and then annually thereafter for as long as these agreements remain in effect. The direct financial assistance to the countries is known as (222) funds. Section 222 of the RMI compact states that (222) funds for health and education projects be managed by the trust fund committee and administered through a health and education subcommittee that consists of not more than three members (one from each country) for each subcommittee. The members are to serve in a personal (as opposed to official) capacity. Each U.S. member is to be appointed by the U.S. trust fund chairman and is to be a resident of the respective State of the FSM or RMI. Each subcommittee is required to hold regular elections to select a leader by a majority of members. The RMI trust fund agreement requires that the RM trust fund committee not include RMI or Marshallese nationals as members unless such nationals are employees of either the RMI or U.S. governments. The Health and Education Subcommittee (HESC) currently has two members: Mr. David Mokem, the Health Coordinator for the U.S. State (DOS) Foreign Service Office in Majuro; and Miss Jodene Menino, the Education Program Manager of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (DOI-IA) in Honolulu, Hawaii. Health and education projects may be authorized under section 201 of the RMI compact as (201) projects but must be administered through the RMI trust fund committee and HESC.

The military departments have flexibility in how they structure their privatized military family housing projects, but typically the military departments lease land to private developers for 50-year terms and convey existing housing located on the leased land to the developer for the duration of the lease. The developer then becomes responsible for renovating and constructing new housing, and for the daily management of these housing units. At the end of fiscal year 2017, 14 private partners were responsible for 79 privatized military family housing projects\u201434 for the Army, 32 for the Air Force, and 13 for the Navy and the Marine Corps. Each privatized housing project is a separate and distinct entity governed by a series of legal agreements that are specific to that project. However, there are some common elements in how projects invest and use funds. Every project takes in revenue, which consists mostly of rent payments. Projects then pay for operating expenses, including administrative costs, day-to-day maintenance, and utilities, among other things. After that, funds are allocated to a series of management incentive fees, such as the property management fee. Finally, the project divides these remaining funds according to a fixed percentage between accounts that fund scheduled maintenance, such as roof replacement, and a separate account for other discretionary projects, such as replacing heating and cooling systems. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management, under the authority, direction, and control of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, is responsible for all matters related to MHPI, and is the program manager of MHPI. In this capacity, the Deputy Assistant Secretary is to provide both guidance and general procedures related to privatized military housing management and oversight of the private partners. In our draft report, currently with the Department of Defense (DOD) for its review and comment, we found that (1) a limited scope of oversight of the physical condition of properties, (2) performance metrics focused on quality of maintenance and resident satisfaction did not accurately reflect private partner performance related to the condition of housing, (3) an inadequate amount of information needed to monitor the physical condition of the properties, and (4) DOD\u2019s reports to Congress on resident satisfaction were incorrect as the Department miscalculated the data.", "Executive retirement plans (ERPs) were designed to supplement or substitute for qualified retirement plans. An ERP is an unsecured nonqualified plan that provides for a cash or noncash benefit on completion of a specified number of years of service or attainment of a stated age and, in some cases, a stated compensation level. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) does not provide any guidance on whether benefits provided under an ERP must be reported on an annual statement. In addition, while the ERP is not subject to the same requirements as a qualified plan under the IRC, most states impose a similar reporting obligation. For 2008, the IRC requires each plan participant receive a written statement of the plan's financial condition and funding. However, the IRS has not yet issued any guidance regarding the applicable reporting date for this section of reporting. A plan sponsor is obligated to provide any participant to whom it has fiduciary responsibility or has control over the plan's investments, regardless of whether the participant is a current plan participant. Although the IRC does not require every ERP provide a copy of the written statement, most states follow the IRC requirement, and many state departments of insurance mandate such statements to be provided within 90 days of each plan year ending. Fiduciaries who are responsible for the investments of ERPs are liable to participants for ensuring that the written statement is provided. State fiduciaries would generally include plan administrators, members of the company board of directors, and members of the plan investment committee, if one existed.\n22 TEXT: Companies that offer executive retirement plans typically do so to supplement benefits provided under qualified retirement plans or to provide retirement benefits in lieu of a qualified retirement plan. In an executive retirement plan, a select group of managers or highly compensated employees defer the receipt of compensation earned in one year to be paid in a future year, generally at or after retirement. Executive retirement plans are not subject to certain statutory limits that apply to qualified retirement plans, such as limits on the annual amount of benefits received, the annual amount of contributions made to the plan, or the annual compensation level used to determine benefits and contributions. Executive retirement plans can be structured as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans but generally must defer compensation to a future year. For executive retirement plans structured as a defined contribution plan, executives are typically paid based on a formula that accounts for salary and years of employment. Distributions from all executive retirement plans are made from company assets. In the first objective of this report, we discuss and illustrate the defined contribution form of executive retirement plans, except as otherwise indicated. ERISA contains various provisions intended to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries in workplace retirement plans. These protections include requirements related to reporting and disclosure, participation, vesting, and benefit accrual, as well as plan funding. Generally, most of the substantive protections of ERISA do not apply to executive retirement plans. Specifically, ERISA grants DOL the authority to prescribe alternative methods of compliance for plans, and under this authority, DOL permitted administrators of executive retirement plans to submit a one-time single page statement to satisfy ERISA\u2019s reporting requirements.\n13 TEXT: Executive retirement plans (ERPs) were designed to supplement or substitute for qualified retirement plans.

The Internet gives taxpayers the information they need to fulfill their tax obligations and to find out more about IRS programs. IRS has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the tax-filing public on the information we are now providing via our website. The website\u2019s popularity is growing. By 2009, traffic tripled over our 2004 levels to 100 million visits. We have been working aggressively in the past few years to improve the site with the goal of providing taxpayers with a seamless experience when interacting with the IRS online. We also have been working to make information in our traditional media easier to get through the Internet. Taxpayers like our website because it includes links that take them to tax forms, answers to many of their questions, and tax law and procedures that affect their taxes. For those who want to do business with the IRS, such as ordering a transcript of tax return or making a payment, information is a few mouse clicks away. IRS has made steady improvements in the Internet services that our taxpayers use the most.  TAS recommended that the IRS increase the level of information available to taxpayers through various online resources; improve online customer service and the customer experience based on the findings of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) online services study; and provide taxpayers with more self-help resources and tools, such as online calculators, that would help them navigate the tax code. [END OF TEXT] [END OF PAGE 5]", "According an Air Force study (see below) released today, a new study concludes that Air Force pilots experience a significantly increased risk of stroke at an average of 24.5 years of age, based on the findings. Also according to the new Air Force study, the findings of this study support the Air Force\u2019s existing policy to retire pilots with more than 2,500 flight hours by age 33, or 25 years. For the purposes of this study, the term mid-career pilot referred to pilots who have served at least 14 years in the Air Force with up to 6,000 flight hours, so that this group could be identified specifically for comparison against a standard age group. The authors chose to compare a mid-career group of pilots against pilots of a similar age to show that pilot cardiovascular health and quality of life were affected by the stress of serving in a high-pressure role as a pilot at age 40 or younger. The 250 mid-career pilots had an average of 7,255 flight hours and served an average of 16.4 years. The study used USTHSC-Houston\u2019s Air Force Pilot Stroke Risk Score calculator to analyze the risk of stroke in flight hours and age group against the mid-career pilots.\nThis study is a large cross-sectional investigation of the effects of military service on pilot stroke risk and the risk of stroke among civilian fighter jet pilots. The results suggest that military pilots, who have served a minimum of 14 years with more than 6,000 flight hours, have increased rates of stroke risk from flight time and age. These findings also suggest that the early onset of risk may be important in pilot cardiologic health, since mid-career pilots experience a stroke risk of 1.8 percent that is more than double that of a standard age group of fighter jet pilots who are age 39 and younger.\nResearchers examined the association between service history and cardiovascular disorders in 250 fighter jet pilots who had attained the status of major. The pilots were chosen randomly from among 500 qualified major pilots who had served at least 14 years and were not older than 60 years old, the maximum allowed age to be included in this study.\nThe investigators included a total of 10,045 flight hours in their data set, including 9,622 h of actual piloting time, 3,000 h of co-piloting time, and 1,523 h of trainer time. Additionally, the study examined pilot flight time and history of aircraft crashes. Results showed that the risk of stroke in flight hours and age group was not lower in military pilots than it was in mid-career pilots  age 39 and under. Thus, there is an indication that the risk of stroke should be taken under serious consideration at every decision point in the U.S. Air Force pilots\u2019 careers.\nContrary to popular belief, mid-career pilots, who have flown more than 6,000 flight hours and served an average of 16.4 years, do not have a lower chance of experiencing stroke than a standard-age group of military pilots, who are age 39 and under. Therefore, the risk of stroke in military pilots should be taken into account during career progression.\nThis pilot study is the largest of its kind to demonstrate these findings and the first to use the Air Force Pilot Stroke Risk formula to assess the potential risks and effects military service has on the risk of stroke in military pilots.\nFurther studies are needed in the Air Force to improve this formula and to test new models of assessing pilot health. If it is ultimately determined that military service could place pilots at a greater risk of stroke, the study recommends that the Air Force implement specialized health care programs directed towards military aviators to mitigate the risks of stroke as well as other conditions that are associated with flying aircraft. For example, medical care should consist of annual physicals and access to specialized care on demand. Another recommendation is that the Air Force pilots receive a maximum of 15 years of service time, so that the increased risk of stroke does not occur at an age where it would severely impact the quality of life.\nIn conclusion, the new USTHSC study concludes that pilot health should be of greater importance to the Air Force in the 21st century, particularly since the world has become a more challenging place in which to operate.\nThe", "When you see this sentence, insert VA or Military-Related text.

The performance audit objective addressed in this report was to evaluate the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) implementation related to household goods relocations (HG-MOVE). We developed the objectives, criteria, and approach and assembled the teams to perform this performance audit in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspection and Evaluation issued by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. To perform our analysis, we evaluated the FTR household goods MOVE implementation strategy and assessed its compliance with guidance as related to specifications in the Performance Accountability Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (PACO) Charter.  To meet our performance audit objectives, we first conducted a document review for related regulations, policy documentation, and current guidance. We interviewed key personnel, reviewed prior audit reports, including DOD 2020 performance management goals, and relied upon personal observation of DOD activity in the HG-MOVE.  We reviewed the regulations, guidance, and policy documentation to determine whether or if the current guidance complied with relevant portions of the FTR. We verified our information with subject matter experts.  We reviewed the current guidance to determine whether it fully addressed the FTR requirements. Specifically, we were verifying if the current guidance complied with FTR specifications, including: \uf0b7 Ensure the household goods relocation (MOVE) process meets the requirements of P.L. 105-277; \uf0b7 Ensure the DOD MOVE strategy addresses the requirements of DOD Directive 1005.6, Military Travel and Temporary Duty Policy, and other associated policy guidance documents, including Air University\u2019s Air Travel Program, and DOD Office of the Inspector General (OIG) compliance standards (DODIG 2010.16.1). \uf0b7 Verify that the DPMO-3.c.9.e.2.b 11/22/2019  Compliance Officer for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for implementation and compliance issues relating to the FTRs implementation.

In January 2015, DOD approved the current policy guidance and procedures for MOVE that is contained in the U.S. Air Force Instruction 13-315, Household Goods, Travel Policy, and Allowances (July 1, 2014). We reviewed the Household Goods policy guidance for military personnel (10 U.S.C. 4734), the military policy of Air University\u2019s Air Travel Program, and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance standards to determine if the guidance addressing the Federal Travel Regulation compliance complied with the FTR requirements. For this performance audit we reviewed related policy guidance and procedures and determined they complied with applicable FTR specifications. \uf0b7 To meet our objectives, we performed limited technical file review. Based on our professional judgment, we determined this was not a systematic process evaluation. Therefore, we conducted our review in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. We conducted the audit in accordance with the Quality Standards for Inspection and Evaluation issued by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, and applicable to evaluations of compliance with administrative requirements.

These threat assessments are often delivered to BMDS systems customers via a threat assessment memorandum, which has become the primary source of defense intelligence community information on ballistic missile threats. \u2022\nThe defense intelligence community will provide additional resources to support requirements for more responsive and dynamic threat assessments.\n\u2022 A new validation process known as Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) reports is replacing the threat assessment process beginning in FY 2020. These VOLT reports will provide defense intelligence community assessments of ongoing threats and will have an enduring shelf life, such as reports for North Korea or Iran. \u2022\nThe defense intelligence community will support customer requirements for threat information on a more frequent timeline, provide additional sources of intelligence on the ballistic missile threat, and identify and disseminate open source information and available assessment data on adversary ballistic missile capabilities and proliferation.\nThe current threat assessment approach is inadequate in meeting customer requirements to support emerging threats with more responsive and dynamic threat assessment products, and a more frequent timeline for delivery of threat assessment products.\nA new approach known as Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) products will enable the defense intelligence community to provide real time threat assessments, improve the timeliness of its threat assessments, and enhance the accuracy of its threat assessments. The defense intelligence community has identified 10 VOLT reports that will be available to ballistic missile threat customers beginning in FY 2020. VOLT reports are replacing the threat assessment process that previously delivered intelligence in threat assessment memorandums. The defense intelligence community will continue to prepare the existing annual threats reports in FY 2020 and will work with BMDS systems customers to determine the need for these reports and to develop processes to replace their use moving forward.\nThe department of defense has taken additional steps to improve defense intelligence community support for customers of the BMDS. On 9 September 2016, DOD revised DOD Instruction 5200.09 (DOD Intelligence for the Ballistic Missile Defense System), to formally require defense intelligence community customer support for BMDS. In August 2017, DOD revised DOD Instruction 5000.01 (Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] General Military Intelligence [GMI] Support to the Department of Defense [DOD]), to formalize the requirements for the defense intelligence community in providing support to DOD customers, including those for the BMDS. These directives reaffirm the fundamental requirements and principles outlined in DOD Directive 5129.01E (Department of the Army [DA] GMI Support to US Forces), which were originally issued on 26 October 2005. The defense intelligence community is also planning improvements to its Ballistic Missile Threat reports in FY 2020 to provide a more dynamic and responsive threat assessment process in support of BMDS customers.\nIn FY 2020, the defense intelligence community will continue to develop VOLT reports for release to customers for North Korea and Iran. In addition, the defense intelligence community is developing additional modules for VOLT reports on adversarial proliferation activities and on new missile capabilities to serve as additional sources of intelligence on the ballistic missile threat.\nThe defense intelligence community will continue to identify key military, civilian, and corporate entities that require threat assessment information in support of BMDS and will identify and develop new and additional data sources to inform threat assessment processes.\nThe Defense Intelligence ballistic Missile Threat, Cruise Missile Threat, and Hypersonic Missile Threat reports are considered valid through the date of the report and are updated periodically for a period of time. The defense intelligence community will develop a process to inform of pending changes in threat assessments. \u2022\nThe Defense Intelligence Ballistic Missile Threat (BMT) assessment identifies the current global missile threat to the United States and allies.

Education determines its  DLC program payments by  multiplying the estimated net present value of estimated  improper payments by 0.5 percent.  For this reason, the  DLC program does not meet  the definition  of a major program, as defined in OMB Circular A-133, Audits of Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1995.  Improvement plans must be established by September 1, 2021. 2", "The federal government relies on commercial communications networks to obtain various services, including video conferencing, local and long- distance telephone calls, email, text messages, file transfers, and more. Much of the communications infrastructure is owned or operated by commercial entities. Similarly, federal agencies rely on call centers (also known as contact centers) to handle public inquiries on government programs and services, such as Medicare. These centers utilize automated and live telephone response systems, websites, and trained customer service representatives to provide information to the public. Agencies that contract with industry to meet their telecommunications and call center needs report information about these contracts and their obligations in FPDS-NG\u2014the federal government\u2019s primary database for contract information at the prime contract level. When reporting contract data, agencies report information on the type of product or service being purchased as well as the NAICS code that best describes the principal purpose of the product or service being acquired. See table 1 for a description of the industry categories for businesses that provide telecommunications and call center goods or services. In addition to FPDS-NG, the federal government has developed other contract reporting systems to collect contracting information related to subcontracting. The Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) was created in 2005 to streamline contractors\u2019 reporting of progress toward meeting the small business subcontracting goals in their subcontracting plans and to facilitate agency oversight. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) generally requires that contractors be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan when they are awarded a contract that exceeds $700,000 and is expected to have subcontracting possibilities. Information on subcontracts awarded by first-tier subcontractors to other entities, or lower-tier subcontractors, is not required. USASpending.gov was created in 2007 to promote transparency by providing the public with information about where and how federal dollars are spent. USASpending.gov contains prime contract award data from FPDS-NG and subcontract information from FSRS. Telecommunications and information technology (IT) fields have been merging in recent years due to integration of the technologies and combined operational management of their functions. Federal telecommunications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment and products, as well as services, such as managed network services and IT security services. In addition, telecommunications include such broadband internet services. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring that effective information security controls are put in place for communication and information technology networks. The framework emphasizes that an organization needs to develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks. For example, NIST recommends that agencies develop an organizational awareness, assess infrastructures and assets, and identify and prioritize risks and mitigation strategies. When assessing assets agencies must conduct threat modeling (identifying what can go wrong) and conduct impact analyses to determine the assets\u2019 vulnerabilities and analyze the costs and benefits of any resulting remedial actions. Agencies then need to ensure that risk management is implemented (or not implemented) across the federal government, such as by having a process for cybersecurity risk management in the acquisition process. If an agency has implemented risk management policies (e.g., using NIST Special Publication 800-53) they must work through the process to update it, among other requirements. Another set of requirements emphasizes the need to protect and control agency information and its systems. For example, the agency must have a security architecture and design that can be used to analyze and engineer security controls into systems, including requirements that agencies develop, maintain, and apply security plans and procedures. NIST Publication 800-47 provides guidance on how agencies can apply security program management\u2014using security engineering, systems engineering, and/or project or program management methodologies\u2014to ensure proper engineering and implementation of the plans that encompass an agency\u2019s information security program. Additionally, the FISMA- related CERT report on Federal Information Security Management found issues in all surveyed federal organizations that highlighted the challenges agencies have implementing controls. See example 2 and example 6 below to illustrate some of these challenges. Example 2: Information technology system. As we identified in the report, the information system has not been tested and validated to confirm if its controls protect agency data. Specifically, we confirmed that the agency did not test and validate the agency and contractor access controls before implementing them. Instead, because of time limitations", "HASC-I and HPSCI-I, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Secretaries of each military department, and the Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Health Affairs and for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.", "Numerous organizations have roles and responsibilities in formulating and executing the Marine Corps\u2019 budget. Specifically: Office of Management and Budget. OMB directs federal agencies, including DOD and the military services, to develop, among other things, civilian personnel budget requests by calculating workload requirements, the time needed to complete the workload and the number of FTEs needed to perform the work for the upcoming fiscal year. Every year, OMB releases an update to OMB Circular A-11, which provides guidance for budget formulation for the upcoming fiscal year. OMB Circular A-11 states that federal agencies should take steps to assess, and as appropriate, restructure, retain, and resize their FTE counts to achieve missions as effectively and efficiently as possible. Office of the Under Secretary of Defense ( Comptroller). OUSD( C) issues the DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation for budget formulation and execution. The Financial Management Regulation directs statutory and regulatory financial management requirements, systems, and functions for all organizational entities within the DOD. 2 Department of the Navy. According to Department of Navy budget officials, they provide annual bud get formulation guidance to all of the budget submitting offices, including the Marine Corps, through the Program Budget Information System, the Navy\u2019s Financial Management & Budget web portal. According to these officials, the guidance contains detailed in st ructions and updates for budget formulation, worksheets for checking the accuracy of submitted data, and points of contact for budget formulation questions. Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources (DC P&R). DC P& R is the lead for determining and allocating civilian labor budgets. The DC P&R delegates this responsibility to the Fiscal Director who monitors major subordinate commands and Headquarter s Marine Corps staff agencies, and servicing human cap ital resource offices in carrying out Manage to Payroll responsibilities, with regard to position classification. In June 2018, the DOD Inspector General reported that, among other things, the Marine Corps did not justif y or fully provide supporting documentation for how it deter min ed its budgeted civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated from projected hours to be worked, as re quired by OMB. As a result, the DOD Inspector General recommended that the the Marine Corps d etermined its budgeted civilian pay funding level using FTEs calculated based on projected hours to be worked, as required by OMB.  See appendix II for more details on the DOD Inspector General\u2019s report. The Marine Corps formulates its annual civilian personnel budget request using prior fiscal year budget execution data as a baseline, and then makes adjustments for the upcoming fiscal year. First, according to Marine Corps officials, civilian posi tion classifications are requested by the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps then collects FY prior year actual data, in addition to current FY data at the start of the budget process to develop the FY current program budget level. Second, according to Marine Corps officials, the Marine Corps uses the approved number of FTEs to determine the civilian pay request which includes adjustments for: \u2022 Comp time \u2022 FLSA exempt employees \u2022 FLSA nonexempt employees \u2022 FLSA salaries For compensation adjustments made between the prior civilian pay request and current the following year\u2019s civilian pay request, Marine Corps program and fiscal officials determine how it is determined \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 a dj us tme nt to FY19 and FY20 Marine Corps personnel budgets; additional costs related to pay; additional benefits to staff (e.g., health care, life insurance) of the additional FTEs in excess of the prior year; and how to ensure manning. 3", "CMS has developed a survey instrument that consists of two sections, a \u201cchild and adult experience of care\u201d survey and a \u201chousehold experience and attitudes about health care survey.\u201d The survey will be used to measure the impact of CMS programs on beneficiaries of those programs and will also be used to measure the impact of CMS provider appeals. The information collected through the survey instrument will be used by CMS to produce a series of state-specific reports known as the \u201cState and National Summary Reports\u201d containing survey results and program beneficiary and provider appeals data, which would be available to the public. CMS will make the survey results publicly available through the publication of a set of State and National Summary Reports as a data book. By the end of FY 2020, CMS expects to provide the data through CMS-created tools that will be made available to the public. The respondents will include beneficiaries and providers of CMS programs (which include individuals, entities, and health insurance issuers). We estimate about 1.5 percent of the 378,792 survey forms will not be responded to. We estimate that, on average, about 0.1 percent of the 378,792 survey forms will not be responded to due to the respondent\u2019s inability to complete the survey without assistance, and about 1.4 percent of the 378,792 survey forms will not be responded to when the respondent declines to complete the survey. We estimate about 11.4 percent of the 378,792 survey forms will not be responded to due to the respondent\u2019s choice not to complete the survey because the respondent has not had any experience with the provider or appeals process. We estimated this burden and cost during a 12-month period of time, from July 2018 through June 2019. We estimated an average of 720,000 respondents per year, with a burden of 0.20 hours per response (30 minutes), which results in an average of 262,500 burden hours per year. We estimate that the total cost of this information collection will be $4,245,757. DATES: In order to obtain meaningful and accurate survey data, CMS proposes that the survey will begin in September of this year and will be completed within 12 months. The estimated annual burden for this collection of information is 720,000. The estimated annually response burden is 0.20 hours per response. We estimate a total of 262,500 responses. The estimated cost to the public for this collection of information is $4,245,757. We request comments on all parts of the collection of information. This proposal will be effective July 1, 2018.", "As the landlord for the federal government, GSA acquires space on behalf of federal agencies through new construction and leasing. As noted in our previous review, while GSA centralized leasing management activities in March 2009, the delegation of leasing authority to some agencies continues to be poorly tracked and monitored. As a result, not all delegation activities and documentation are fully tracked and documented in a timely manner. Because of its multiple requirements and documentation, GSA officials noted that they do not have readily available, complete, and accurate data for the leasing delegation oversight process. Therefore, GSA officials have had a difficult time tracking the full spectrum of agencies which have authority for leasing in FY 2012. The GSA Office of the General Counsel also noted that it can be difficult to ascertain the complete number of leases executed each fiscal year, and this may delay its review and approval process. Second, in August 2012, GSA initiated a review of the delegation program through its Delegated Oversight Program Assessment, which included performing a sample of reviews across all categories (general, categorical and special) in order to assess the delegation oversight process. The results of this review have not been made publicly known. GSA officials indicated that this effort was underway at the time of our review, but this review has not been completed 2 months after our review was issued. Because it has not yet completed its review of 184 delegations, GSA has had difficulty calculating the correct amount of delegated lease contract values and the correct number of delegations. Finally, while GSA is responsible for leases executed by delegated agencies, it is not able to monitor all 2 billion square feet of space with federal funds in the government-wide inventory, nor the nearly one-third of that owned by GSA, according to its inventory management staff. Federal agencies are required to report the size of their inventories to GSA but sometimes report only those spaces on which they are currently paying rent rather than reporting the total square footage which includes currently leased but not occupied space. Therefore, GSA is not able to monitor delegated leases using the government-wide space inventory data. GSA officials noted that it has made efforts to develop an inventory of the approximately 60 billion square feet of leased space. However, GSA\u2019s data have been missing some space holdings as of May 2014, such as for the State Department. GSA has conducted the annual review of delegated space using the GSA-owned inventory of leased space, but only for those delegations in GSA\u2019s inventory. In addition, in some cases, the delegating agency has not been able to provide documentation to ensure timely payments at rates commensurate with fair market rates to the Treasury in a timely and accurate manner. This has also hindered GSA\u2019s oversight. For example, in 2 contracts that we reviewed during our prior performance audit. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) failed to provide complete documentation as prescribed in the agreements. Both cases resulted in GSA not being able to make a timely payment to the Treasury in order to maintain its 100 percent rental rate. Further, under terms of the delegated agreements, agencies are responsible to reimburse the federal government any difference in the square footage the agency occupies if the lease space is less than prescribed on the lease. In the limited review conducted during our prior audit, HUD had not provided adequate documentation for any of its leases. Since the start of GAO\u2019s review, three of the 24 cases we reviewed involving total value of $70.71 million and two thirds of the 71 agencies we examined through our 46 delegations had missing documentation. This hindered our ability to complete the review. Agencies we reviewed that lacked complete documentation included HUD, the U.S. Navy, and the Army Corps of Engineers. One contract we reviewed had not been closed for approximately 13 years, even though it was a long-term lease. Agencies were not able to explain why the file had not been closed, or why the files for the two other long-term leases being reviewed had not been kept current. Not only were these problems found during our prior review, they had persisted in the reviewing of an additional 46 leases. In addition to the incomplete documentation provided, for certain agencies, the data related to the leasing delegations are outdated, such", "The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which established the EAS program, specifies that if the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines that air service will not be provided without subsidy, DOT shall use EAS program funds to award a subsidy to a carrier willing to provide service. DOT currently provides service to 108 EAS communities within the contiguous United States, as well as 65 in Alaska and Hawaii. To be eligible for EAS, a community must: be located more than 70 miles from the nearest large or medium hub; require a subsidy per passenger of $200 or less, unless the community is more than 210 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport or unless DOT is satisfied that any decline below 10 enplanements is temporary; and have had an average of 10 or more enplanements per service day during the most recent fiscal year (except that 90-day termination notices for hub service during FY2006 would have been allowed to count towards the minimum average enplanement amount), unless the community is more than 175 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport. EAS is funded through appropriations from a combination of discretionary funding provided through annual appropriations acts, and overflight fees which are collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from foreign aircraft traveling over the U.S. and which have historically supported a large portion of the program. Each community\u2019s subsidization rate is based on the number of paying passengers served in a given period divided by the total number of paying passengers that the air carrier serves in the same period. The law requires that communities receive service during the first year at a rate of 100% to 85%\u2014with service being discontinued at the end of the first year if the subsidy cannot be reduced by half before such time. Under current EAS policy, an air carrier may only apply for partial subsidy from DOT. The law directs the Secretary to establish a minimum rate of compensation which, depending on certain variables, represents subsidies that are at least 25% lower than the first year\u2019s level. This minimum compensation establishes a floor upon which air carriers may negotiate in exchange for their EAS service. EAS communities can be served by scheduled, charter, or air taxi services, and a community can discontinue EAS service once the subsidy is reduced through negotiation or a decision by the air carrier to provide service without funding from the program. To establish EAS communities eligible for full subsidy, DOT may waive the 10 enplanement requirement, if DOT determines that the requirements of a community as a non-hub or primary service airport for certain types of air service. The law currently governing EAS provides air carriers with the freedom to use larger aircraft for this program or to serve multiple origin and destination airports\u2014a flexibility that was not available under the previous program. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which established the EAS program, specified that if DOT determined that air service will not be provided without subsidy, DOT should use EAS program funds to award a subsidy to a carrier willing to provide service. As of October 1, 2018, 108 communities within the contiguous United States (as well as 65 in Alaska and Hawaii) were receiving EAS (see fig. 1).\nFor a long time, most carriers have served these communities on a scheduled basis and on air taxi basis. Some EAS carriers also charter services within these communities. In 2006, the 65 EAS contracts were held, mostly, by Southwest and three other carriers. To obtain the required 65 EAS contracts, Delta acquired the then holding company of ATA Airlines and Air Wisconsin merged with Skyway Airlines\u2014a merger facilitated by DOT. Southwest was required to provide 32 of the 65 EAS contracts by statute. The 65 EAS contracts were awarded to 18 carriers, two of which serve Alaskan EAS communities, and which are now all members of the regional airline group SkyWest\u2014the first all-regional carrier.\nDelta and Northwest had 25 EAS contracts.

These estimates show that reported net improper payments increased in fiscal year 2019. As reported last year in figure 4, the improper payments were the largest in Social Security programs ($99.6 billion in fiscal year 2019). According to the improper payment agency report and IG reports, the 36 agencies examined reduced improper payments by $54.0 billion in fiscal year 2019. The OMB-estimated amount of improper payments for the 23 agencies in our report remains the same for an estimated amount of $139.4 billion. See table 5.  We consider the amount of improper payments reported last year as an estimate, not as a precise figure, because the scope and definition of improper payments differed from agency to agency.

The figure depicts the F-35 in flight. The DOD F-35 program has developed and is delivering three variants of the F-35 aircraft; the F-35A conventional take-off and landing variant for the Air Force, the F-35B short take-off and vertical landing variant for the Marine Corps, and the F-35C carrier-compatible variant for the Navy. The characteristics of the three services\u2019 variants are similar, however, each service\u2019s variant also has unique requirements in order to operate from a wide range of airfields, including aircraft carriers and landing on them, conduct short take-off and vertical landings at austere and remote sites, and also functioning in hostile environments. For example, the Marine Corps requires that the F-35B be capable of operating from aircraft carriers having limited catapult and arrestor gear clearance, landing heavily loaded, and conducting short take offs and vertical landings at austere and remote sites. As part of the F-35 program, the Navy and the Marine Corps purchased the three F-35 variants. The F-35 is the most expensive weapons program in history. Since program inception in 2001, the program has spent $406.4 billion with $270.3 billion for research and development, and $136.1 billion for procurement, for a total of $406.4 billion to develop and procure three variants of the F-35 aircraft. The remaining $837.5 billion will be needed for operations and sustainment costs for the next 52 years. To illustrate the remaining cost to support operations and maintenance of the F-35 for the next 50 years, a cost of $180.09 million will be needed each year, which breaks down to a total of over $4.8 trillion. This includes all the costs to research, design, develop, test, and sustain the F-35. The 50-year life-cycle of the F-35 is based on the fact that DOD has planned for the aircraft to serve for 8,000+ flight hours each. Operating the F-35 from now until 2078 would mean that it will have to fly at least 25 times a year, or an hour a day, every day of the year for its planned 52 year life-cycle, until 2078. Currently, all three services have accepted and are operating F-35 aircraft. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) FY2017 audited financial statement, \u201cDOD spent $7.2 billion on research and development, procurement, and operations and maintenance of [the] F-35 in FY2017.\u201d The DOD F-35 Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) reports that the program cost for the F-35A, the F-35B, and the F-35C variant is estimated at $10.76, $11.41, and $9.5 billion respectively. According to the DOT&E, \u201cthe aircraft sustainment cost is expected to be $1.13 trillion over the life of the program. When combined with procurement, the entire program is expected to cost more than $4.6 trillion at least.\u201d There is a high probability that the DOD F-35 program will cost more as it is being planned to acquire 2,528 aircraft, and sustain them for 52 additional years after their planned lifespan in 2078, and DOD has no plan to retire the F-35 until 2060. The cost of the planned 2,528 F-35 aircraft was based on the assumption that they would be produced at an average cost of $85 million per plane. But the latest cost estimates put that number closer to $133 million. This number increases $3 billion to a total of $139 million in year 2039. According to GAO, \u201cDOD officials [the Joint Program Office and the F-35 Joint Program Office] and contractors continue to negotiate an annual $193 million [per year] sustainment cost, but officials cannot be sure that will be the end result. Officials estimate that approximately 95 percent of the F-35s will be", "The Medicare DSH program was designed to offset the effects of the increased number of low-income nonelderly Medicare beneficiaries cared for by hospitals.", "15 United States Government Accountability Office Report to the Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate November 2018 VETERANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CONCERNED ABOUT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION Figure 2: Basic Process for Revising the FAR and DFARS Source: GAO.", "The military justice system has three types of military courts that can adjudicate violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). These court types are commonly referred to as the summary, special, and general courts-martial, and each court type may adjudicate increasingly serious offenses. The three court types can also adjudicate different maximum punishments. The military justice process begins after an allegation has been made and evidence has been gathered, and moves from preferred charges to a court-martial. Charges can be preferred in five different forums or military justice venues. Charges in these venues can be tried by a judge, a military jury, or a military judge and military jury. The military justice system provides for the accused servicemembers to raise claims that there have been improprieties at different points in the military justice process. This is done, among other paths, at post-trial and at court of criminal appeals. The services we reviewed each have databases that collect information on specific violations of the UCMJ. For example, records regarding investigations conducted by the military services might be stored in one database, and records regarding court-martial cases and administrative discharges might be stored in other databases. These databases are used by the military services and are often used to fulfill other congressional mandates. For example, the Army uses its investigation database to track investigations and their status, and its military justice database to track and manage cases going through its military justice system. The databases were not designed to collect race and ethnicity information, and the data we reviewed did not include race and ethnicity information for military justice case files. While the databases collect information about the servicemembers\u2019 race, approximately 80 percent to 89 percent of the servicemember records lacked sufficient race and/or ethnicity data for us to analyze race and ethnicity-related patterns using this data. However, for the servicemembers with race or ethnicity data available in the military justice databases we reviewed (Army and Navy), about 66 percent to 67 percent of the servicemembers did not have race of ethnicity data. Among servicemembers with available race and/or ethnicity data, about 13 percent to 20 percent were minorities. This means that 1 percent to 3 percent of investigations and 4 percent to 5 percent of court-martial cases in these databases had minority servicememembers. While collecting race and ethnicity data in its databases may not currently be an option for the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Marine Corps has developed the ability to capture and track servicemembers with minority race and/or ethnicity data. However, this information is manually entered in two Marine Corps databases and is not generated automatically by the servicemembers\u2019 automated military personnel records. Our analysis of UCMJ allegation-specific race and ethnicity and court-martial case-specific race and ethnicity shows that the racial and ethnic demographics of servicemembers within the military justice system vary greatly. Further, when servicemembers with racial and/or ethnic data in these military justice databases are considered, these servicemembers were more than six times as likely than servicemembers without racial or ethnic data to be discharged or retired out of the military. While this increased likelihood of separating out minority servicemembers may be due to factors other than the military justice system, the racial and ethnic disparities we observed across these databases are worrisome and indicate a need for additional study and analysis. We recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) take steps to better capture data on servicemembers\u2019 race and/or ethnicity in order to better inform the department about the racial and ethnic demographics of servicemembers within the military justice system. In their response to our report, the services concurred with our recommendations. We believe the services need to implement these recommendations in order to better assess why there appears to be a disproportionate number of minority servicemembers at risk of being discharged or retired out of the military. However, the services did not address our observation of disproportionate minority representation in military justice databases across military services. This finding suggests a need for greater analysis.\n\"The Services Did Not Address Our Observation Of Disproportionate Minority Representation In Military Justice Databases Across The Military Services, Raising Concerns About The Possible Use Of The Criminal Justice Process To Separate Minorities From The Military\"\n\"The military justice process begins after an allegation has", "Innovative, Low-Cost Ways To Manage Climate Change, November 2016 AUDIT MATERIAL ESTIMATE OF FEDERAL ASSETS RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE ACCUMULATED FROM 1993 TO 2016 ASSETS OVERSTATED ACCUMULATED FROM 2017 TO 2018 ASSETS $1,382.8 million $76.0 million $7.3 billion 676 50 15 440 40 90 3,841.9 553.3 19,190.9 25,693.1 32 15% 50% 85% 42,625 38,802 3,248 0 100 Asset under review 17 9,033 3,368 0 0 3,368 Total assets under review Total 42,625 3,558 0 3,368 3,368 14 9,033 3,485 Total assets (in millions) $1,382.8 $1,541.9 $19,190.8 $19,311.3 $3,841.9 $3,896.9 $ 3,368 $ 3,368 $ 19,190.9 $19,210.5 Source: GAO analysis of information from the Office of Management and Budget. Accumulative cost of implementing a federal climate change program on an annual basis. Agencies develop agency-specific adaptation plans in 2014 and update every \ufb01ve years thereafter, as required by Executive Order 13653.\nCongressional oversight responsibilities on managing climate change include overseeing the implementation of an agency adaptation plan. Further, oversight responsibilities include helping agencies understand the risks of climate change, identify signi\ufb01cant trends linked to climate change, implement adaptation activities, and assess how to mitigate risks associated with climate change. In 2010, DOI established a dedicated of\ufb01ce to develop strategies and coordinate a national-scale, landscape-scale adaptation plan based on the best available science. DOI\u2019s of\ufb01ce also provides climate change expertise to other federal agencies that develop adaptation plans. DOI\u2019s of\ufb01ce established an interagency working group to help agencies prepare their adaptation plans. In addition to providing information and expertise as needed, DOI\u2019s National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center reviews and provides feedback on the adaptation plans. Since the launch of the working group, many agencies have started developing their adaptation plans, and as of August 2017 some agencies, such as DOD, USGS, and NOAA, had completed their plans.\nIn 2015, EOs 13653 and 13683 required federal agencies with statutory authorities or signi\ufb01cant climate change expertise\u2014those with relevant climate change expertise\u2014to submit an agency-speci\ufb01c plan to assist federal agencies in managing the impacts of climate change on the natural resources and infrastructure that they manage. However, some agencies may encounter challenges incorporating this planning requirement into their agencies\u2019 natural resource and infrastructure management processes; for example, NPS faces challenges in developing its agency-speci\ufb01c plan due to its limited technical resources and budget constraints. Agencies addressing the challenge of incorporating agency-speci\ufb01c plans into their natural resource and infrastructure management processes could consult GAO\u2019s July 2018 recommendations to help agencies implement this requirement. The recommendations, designed for federal agencies, provide a framework for identifying climate change adaptation actions to consider for inclusion in their agency-speci\ufb01c plans, developing detailed strategies to address those adaptation actions, and integrating the agency-speci\ufb01c plans into their annual strategic and operating plans. For example, NPS managers can use this planning framework to help them identify actions they need to take to address climate change impacts across the system, develop action plans for addressing those impacts, and integrate those plans into annual strategic plans and ongoing operations. Such actions can help NPS strengthen its processes and actions to reduce risks and improve", "USPS is one of the largest civilian employers in the U.S. The author describes compensation costs (an important part of USPS\u2019s operations) over an 11-year period, and also discusses union representation at USPS and a compensation system.", "The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board finds that the Department of Energy has not complied with some or\n(1) NNSA uses\nprofessionals in\nits program offices,\nheadquarters offices, and\nfield offices.

Information about consumers is generated through their participation in markets for goods and services, such as the use of banking or insurance products. Consumer information is then collected and used for decisions such as eligibility for employment or credit and insurance. Consumer reporting agencies regularly assemble or analyze this information, and companies with which consumers have established financial relationships, known as data furnishers, supply information to them. The three largest CRAs control about 90% of the market today, although there are more than 400 CRAs in total. Consumers are not required to consent to the use of consumer information to make credit decisions, unlike information used for employment decisions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has authority to enforce federal consumer financial laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The agency has published a variety of rules and guidance regarding FCRA such as its regulation of the accuracy of information in consumer reports. In 2017, CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who jointly enforce federal consumer credit laws, settled with Experian for their compliance failures related to consumer reports and consumer dispute records.\nConsumer reporting agencies compile consumer reports that contain personally identifiable information, credit histories, account status, employment reports, insurance records, and such other information that the reporting agences deem fit. The FCRA enacts a number of consumer reporting requirements. These include the obligations to: (1) Follow reasonable procedures to assure that the reports are accurate and timely, and contain all the requisite information; and (2) maintain a reasonable process to assure that consumer reporting information for a commercial purpose is furnished only to the proper party. The FCRA also states that consumer reports may not contain a negative or a potentially adverse item, except in certain instances. The FTC enforces and regulates the consumer reporting agencies. The FTC shares enforcement authority on FCRA with the CFPB. The CFPB supervises consumer reporting agencies, while the FTC is responsible for monitoring their activities.\nA consumer\u2019s credit history can be obtained by CRAs, lenders, credit card agencies, and employers. A credit history helps a firm to estimate the applicant\u2019s credit worthiness. The credit history is compiled in such a manner that it allows an accurate estimate of the applicant\u2019s credit reliability by providing a profile of his financial status such as credit outstandings, payment history, bankruptcy status, or lawsuits. A credit agency makes a credit report available on payment of a fee and it contains information pertaining to the credit history of the applicant. A credit report is often used by lenders to determine their applicant's creditworthiness. Credit agencies also provide information on a person's identity. A credit report contains, among others, the following information: 1) the applicant's personal information, including Social Security Number and date of birth, 2) type of credit inquiries, 3) legal name and alias or other names used by the applicant, 4) addresses where the applicant or where records are maintained, and 5) consumer inquiries. While most creditors order credit reports on consumers from one or more of the three major credit reporting agencies (also known as national credit reporting agencies or consumer reporting agencies), some obtain the credit report directly from the credit grantor. Additionally, many lenders subscribe only to their applicant's credit report and not to the credit reports of all three credit reporting agencies.\nAccording to FCRA, a CRA may be defined as an individual who, for monetary fees, discloses the credit file of more than one hundred consumers who are provided with credit. For such purposes, a consumer is defined as a natural person in regards to a transaction in which the CRA sells credit information or a consumer report for money for use for  a determination of the consumer\u2019s, for employment purposes, eligibility. These CRAs may also be  referred as consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus.

As part of the strategic plan, states are required to develop indicators to measure program performance based on community needs, service needs, activities, and outcomes. They must also detail plans for using funds to address unmet needs in their communities. To be eligible for CSBG funding in fiscal year 2019, states were required to demonstrate a commitment to increasing employment outcomes; addressing the unmet needs of youth and those transitioning from juvenile justice or from incarceration back into the community; and addressing the unmet needs of people in rural areas. States are also required to describe how they will use CSBG funds to reduce poverty, improve school readiness, reduce child mortality, improve the nutritional status of low-income families, and increase the use of preventive services.\nOMB guidance for management of Federal Funds highlights a distinction among administrative costs, indirect costs, and direct costs that may not be apparent to the layperson, but that is essential for\nunderstanding how CSBG program resources are to be allocated, and therefore is important for our audit objectives.\nCSBG Act Section 670(a)(5) requires that state CSBG plans be consistent with state or local anti-poverty plans or agendas. This provision requires that state CSBG plans incorporate existing strategies to build strong communities and empower low-income people. The CSBG Act emphasizes that the CSBG program is \u201cdesigned to foster and promote the creation, expansion, and operation of broad and wide-ranging community action to revitalize communities and to reduce poverty,\u201d but does not require state agencies or local grantees to use CSBG funds to exclusively meet these goals or for only anti-poverty, low-income, or community empowerment activities. OMB defines these expenses as indirect costs. These costs generally cover administrative and planning support, but they may also include direct services to reduce the vulnerability of individuals, families, and children to hunger, malnutrition, disease, or injuries. They may also include activities or strategies that support or strengthen a community\u2019s economy.\nWhile indirect costs account for the expenses associated with running a program and are necessary for the efficient operation of a program, they should not be treated as an in-kind donation from states and other local agencies. Unlike administrative costs, indirect costs will not be reimbursed to states or local agencies, in-kind donations are generally goods or services provided free of charge. Unlike administrative costs, OMB is required to approve these costs, and therefore to assure that they are reasonable costs and that states and other local agencies have been accountable in their handling of funds. As such, they are not subject to the same rules regarding documentation, audit, and oversight as administrative costs. It is important to note that the majority of a state\u2019s or CDBG grantee\u2019s CSBG allocation is allocated for its indirect costs, i.e., administrative and support staff costs. Thus, ensuring that indirect costs are documented as allowed under the regulations will help to support program goals and reduce administrative waste.\nDirect costs are a subset of indirect costs, as well as direct service delivery costs. In the context of the CSBG program, direct costs are used exclusively for the community services that are most directly related to improving low-income people\u2019s self-sufficiency and reducing the incidence of poverty, which may include planning, developing services, and delivering those services. Examples of the types of direct services most commonly financed by CSBG include the provision of childcare; adult literacy and skill development programs; and supportive services for employment, education, and child health, among others. CSBG and HHS recognize that a single program\ngoal could, at least theoretically, be met through a range of different services. For example, the most effective way to meet a goal of increasing the proportion of low-income people who are educated above the high school level or receive some form of educational training may involve training and education in preparation for or entry into the workforce or support for obtaining a higher degree of formal education. In this case, programs intended to meet a specific education goal would fall under the direct services to low-income people expenses, rather than the indirect services to low-income and vulnerable people indirect costs. As indicated in the guidance on page 20 of this report, OMB guidance indicates that the \u201conly costs incurred in the normal operations of the", "Hospice care helps patients who are terminally ill\u2014as well as the families of those patients\u2014maintain their quality of life. Hospice care focuses on the comfort of patients (palliative care), not curing the illness. Patients are eligible for hospice care under Medicare if they have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Most patients get hospice care at home, which typically includes use of controlled substances, including opioids such as oxycodone, to provide pain relief. According to CMS, hospice teams are required to include a physician, nurse, social worker, and pastoral or other counselor; and may also include hospice aides, trained volunteers, and speech, physical, and occupational therapists. The patient selects a primary caregiver when first admitted into home hospice, and this person becomes a member of the home hospice team. The primary caregiver, often a family member, provides most of the care for the patient in home hospice, including most of the physical care for the patient, keeping records of symptoms and other problems, and communicating with the hospice team. The Controlled Substances Act regulates the manufacture, distribution, use, and disposal of controlled substances. In general, the Controlled Substances Act was enacted to facilitate the use of controlled substances for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes while preventing them from being diverted for illegal uses. DEA is the primary agency with responsibility for administering and enforcing the law, and DEA provides oversight of all persons or entities required to register with DEA. The Controlled Substances Act has been amended twice to clarify federal requirements for patient disposal of controlled substances. 2010. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow a patient who has lawfully obtained a controlled substance to deliver the controlled substance to another person for the purpose of disposal, without being registered with DEA. Instead, the rulemaking encouraged home hospice personnel to assist patients and their families in disposing of controlled substances in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, and partner with authorized collectors to promote or jointly conduct mail-back programs. 2018. The SUPPORT Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow employees of qualified hospices, whether or not registered with DEA, to dispose of a patient\u2019s unused controlled substances onsite and in accordance with all applicable laws after the patient\u2019s death. The authority to dispose of unused controlled substances under the SUPPORT Act applies only to qualified hospices. Such hospices must have written policies and procedures for assisting in the disposal of controlled substances in patients\u2019 homes. According to DEA officials, DEA\u2019s regulations also require employees of hospices with written policies and procedures to have on file with the Hospice Medical Director information about the location, type, and security of controlled substances in the hospice. DEA plans to issue regulations in 2018 to specifically address the collection and disposal of controlled substances in the hospice and other home care settings. We also found that since 2012, DEA has issued advisories and taken certain actions to address and mitigate concerns that hospices are not complying with federal controlled substance disposal requirements. For example, DEA conducted a series of regional seminars on the safe disposal of controlled substances and developed and shared with hospices educational informational videos about proper disposal practices. Furthermore, recent inspections of 46 hospices by DEA personnel found no noncompliance with controlled substance disposal laws or regulations. 10 OIG-A-00-13-0112\nDEA\u2019s Compliance Program is effective and adequately controls the distribution of controlled substances through the Order Writers. Pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act, DEA has statutory responsibilities to regulate the distribution of controlled substances through prescriptions. The Act requires the establishment of the Compliance Program, under which regulated parties (Order Writers) are authorized to issue written prescriptions for controlled substances to patients.\nOur review of Order Writer compliance with distribution requirements in 4 states revealed 14 compliance violations. We determined that in 3 cases, DEA-registered Order Writers dispensed medications outside the scope of their registrations. We also determined that in 7 cases, Order Writers failed to properly dispose of unused medication.\nThe states", "The Water Resources Development Act of 1974 created the Section 219 program, a new category of project authorizing the Corps to provide federal assistance to non-federal entities, in response to state and local requests. Congress added section 7,000,000,000 to the Corps\u2019 water resources development account, as authorized under the Corps\u2019 funding authority provided under section 213 of the Flood Control Act of 1948, as amended, for expenditures for the Section 219 program. The Section 219 program has been amended several times by later WRDA legislation. The original WRDA included a provision requiring the Corps to develop guidelines to address the cost sharing and cost sharing responsibilities between federal and non-federal entities. As a result of the guidelines established under the program, non-federal sponsors are to provide at least 25 percent of the cost of the overall project for the planning, design, construction, and inspection of any project. Similar to other Corps projects, the design-build contracting structure, a component of the WRDA of 2014, provides the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of possible contract types, including, but not limited to, fixed-price, and schedule-based incentives. In addition, the Corps may also exercise its authorities under section 1135 of the WRDA of 2016, which allows the Corps to use its authority under section 1134a of the WRDA of November 30, 2007. Under this section, the Corps may use its authority under section 1134a to acquire, design, and construct landside and waterside components associated with the transportation of dredged material.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: OECA has a range of compliance monitoring, compliance assistance, and enforcement tools available to elicit compliance with laws and regulations from regulated entities, as shown in table 1. Enforcement actions can result in, among other things, the imposition of penalties, requirements to remedy the violation of law or regulation, or both. OECA has developed policies and guidance for EPA staff that describe the agency\u2019s recommended responses to non-compliance based on a number of factors and the escalation of enforcement responses to continuing non-compliance. EPA guidance on informal and formal enforcement actions provides an example related to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In that example, if a regulated entity does not return to compliance or notify the state or EPA that it cannot return to compliance within a certain number of days after an informal enforcement action, the state or EPA may take a formal enforcement action. Generally, according to this same 2010 EPA guidance, informal enforcement actions address small or isolated problems, and formal enforcement actions can address bigger problems. OECA stores and manages a range of compliance monitoring and enforcement data in ICIS. For example, ICIS includes descriptive information about regulated entities, violations, and the outcome of enforcement actions. REPORT QUESTION: Describe EPA\u2019s compliance monitoring, compliance assistance, and enforcement program. OECA\u2019s Enforcement Program includes the following parts: the Assessment and Inspection Program; the Compliance Assistance Component; and the Enforcement Component. The Assessment and Inspection Program includes the following two parts: the Compliance Inspection Program, which requires regulated entities to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations EPA enforces; and the State and Indian Tribal Programs. The Compliance Assistance Component includes various voluntary and enforcement compliance assistance programs. The Enforcement Component includes various enforcement actions related to the failure to comply with laws and regulations. FIGURE 1: This figure shows the range of compliance monitoring, compliance assistance, and enforcement data that EPA collects, according to EPA officials. Enforcement actions can result in, among other things, the imposition of penalties, requirements to remedy the violation of law or regulation, or both. EPA has developed policies and guidance for EPA staff that describe the agency\u2019s recommended responses to non-compliance based on a number of factors and the escalation of enforcement responses to continuing non-compliance. EPA guidance on informal and formal enforcement actions provides an example related to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In that example, if a regulated entity does not return to compliance or notify the state or EPA that it cannot return to compliance within a certain number of days after an informal enforcement action, the state or EPA may take a formal enforcement action. OECA uses various data from national databases, such as Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS), to manage progress toward EPA goals, according to EPA officials. These officials said their offices conduct monthly reviews of ICIS data to understand how their current efforts on various compliance targets compare to prior years. REPORT CONCLUSIONS: EPA has a large number of policies, procedures, and guidance in place to support its Enforcement Program. The data OECA maintains related to compliance monitoring, compliance assistance, and enforcement actions provide OECA and EPA headquarters staff with additional details on the program\u2019s progress. REPORT EVALUATION: The report was fairly well written and the information was fairly accurate. However, there are a few inaccurate conclusions that should be fixed, as explained briefly below. Specifically, there are two statements in the report discussion that OECA needs to address in the conclusion section of this report. The first statement is about EPA\u2019s Enforcement Program and the second statement is about staff in regional offices providing assistance with state enforcement actions. Specifically: \u2022 Report Statement 1 \u2013 \u201cOECA\u2019s Enforcement Program includes the following parts: the Assessment and Inspection Program; the Compliance Assistance Component; and the Enforcement Component\u2026 The Assessment and Inspection Program includes the following two parts: \u2026 The Compliance Assistance Component includes various voluntary and enforcement compliance assistance programs.

Among other things, the Secretary shall take into account the need to update curricula for new types of warfare, and to ensure joint education requirements are met. In his role as the principal DOD adviser on the formulation and implementation of JPME policies, the Chairman shall submit guidance concerning JPME requirements to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. As directed in the 2012 NDAA, the Chairman\u2019s Joint Requirements Oversight Council (CJROC) shall continue to serve as the DOD-level joint warfighting requirements determination and approval body\u2014for example, to provide written approval of the DOD\u2019s budgetary submissions of requirements for approved joint programs. Although CJROC is organized as a Defense Agency, and therefore not a DOD component, for the purposes of developing the DOD budget request, CJROC provides and is considered to be the functional proponent of the Defense Planning Guidance and the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System. CJROC accomplishes its assigned tasks through its Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System process, which is explained in more detail in appendix C. DOD components outside of OSD(P&R) also contribute to the review and approval of requirements and acquisition program objectives, including the Chairman, the military departments, each of the 12 combatant commands, the Joint Staff, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). CJROC shall continue to review joint programs to ensure the requirements to achieve joint objectives are met. In addition to determining and approving joint requirements, CJROC, under this role, has the authority to direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to conduct required reviews. The CJROC is required by Title 10 U.S.C. 181(b) and 183 to review joint programs and approve requirements. If a program has been determined to be a DOD joint matter, CJROC shall also be briefed on the program, consistent with the requirements of Joint Concept Development and Executive Steering Group oversight briefs. DOD components and services, in coordination with CJROC, are responsible for ensuring the requirements are met. Once requirements are determined and approved, program management then begins. The military 3\n4 2017 Annual Financial Report\ndepartments continue to perform their assigned roles in managing funding, organizing, training, and equipping their forces, but are also required to develop and execute program management plans that are in compliance with the budget requirements. OMB is responsible for reviewing and approving the budget requests of each of the entities receiving funding from Congress. Within the budget request to Congress, OMB identifies funding requests for each of the individual program elements of the Defense Planning Guidance process, in coordination with CJROC. Through its review and approval processes, OMB determines the funding required for its budgetary submissions. As part of this approval process, OMB certifies to the Congress that the funding submitted by the Secretary of Defense and the military departments has been determined to be consistent with requirements and joint matters, as approved by CJROC. If a program has been determined to be solely a DOD program or to only address joint missions and tasks (e.g., training or equipping), the program would not appear in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System process, and would not be subject to reviews by CJROC. The Department of Veterans Affairs (Department of VA), as authorized by the Veterans Benefits Act of 2010 and supplemental funding provided, developed and operated the Veterans Health Care Contract Services program, which established a comprehensive national network of more than 600 health care providers in 47 of 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under the Veterans Care Coordination program, the DOD health system provides the Department of VA primary care at military treatment facilities for eligible veterans and their family members. DOD\u2019s primary care health records at military treatment facilities follow the DOD patient, and provide access to their DOD health records in the VistA electronic health records system through DOD\u2019s secure messaging 4\n5 2017 Annual Financial Report system. In this manner,", "A complete summary is in the above paragraph. The summary should include the main arguments of the article. These arguments should be written in very simple, clear terms. The summary should not contain the conclusions. 3 of 10 1/8/2020 REVISION: In 1917, the Board of Tax Appeals was established. The BTA was created to review refunds and other protests by taxpayers. The BTA was also responsible for reviewing determinations by IRS against individual taxpayers. The BTA was composed of three members who were not employees of IRS. Beginning in 1927, the Tax Court was established to hear contested cases, rather than administrative appeals and to hear petitions by taxpayers. The Tax Court began with three members but the court\u2019s size has grown to 19 members. In 1952, Congress established a three-person commission, known as the Joint Committee on Taxation or JCT, to provide Congress with independent, objective, nonpartisan, analytical tax-writing support. The JCT consists of 10 members of Congress and 5 congressional staff members, 5 members of the public appointed by the presiding officials of each chamber and 5 executive branch members, each appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. IRS was also given statutory authority to select audits in 1955. IRS\u2019s audit selection has increased the number of tax returns randomly audited and has focused on IRS\u2019s compliance programs. However, IRS officials have stated concerns about IRS\u2019s ability to conduct additional audits due to diminishing resources. The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (1998 Act) was enacted in order to improve the IRS\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. The 1998 Act authorized IRS to adjust its annual workload by hiring an additional 2,000 staff members every year between FY 1999\u2013FY 2003. The Act also established a revised mission statement for IRS to include the following: \u201cto provide America\u2019s taxpayers with top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.\u201d Finally, the 1998 Act established requirements for IRS\u2019s National Taxpayer Advocate, including having an Advocate who will have a full-time role and may be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The 1998 Act authorized IRS to conduct additional audits of taxpayers, enhancing its audit coverage of tax returns filed in prior years. IRS\u2019s total outstanding individual tax liabilities increased between FY 1998 and FY 1999, which was immediately after the 1998 Act. IRS conducted 59.6 million individual returns in FY 1999, a 23 percent increase from the number of individual returns examined in FY 1994. As of December 2018, IRS had approximately 75,000 employees. IRS operates on a fiscal year, which begins each October 1 and ends on the following September 30. FY 2020 will begin October 1, 2019 and end September 30, 2020. 4 of 10 1/8/2020 REVISION: IRS\u2019s most recent workforce planning report in September 2018 stated that IRS had approximately 71,000 permanent, full-time-equivalent employees. IRS provides a full range of services to taxpayers, including assessment and collection, customer service, education, enforcement, and issue management. IRS has had several changes in its leadership since July 2017. These changes included the termination of the acting Commissioner, the announcement of a new Commissioner, the termination of the Commissioner, and the acting Commissioner\u2019s resignation. IRS has identified employee attrition and knowledge loss as an issue, and IRS has established five strategic goals in its workforce and cultural transformation plan. We reported on IRS\u2019s budget in March 2019, and IRS\u2019s 2019 budget request is $12.15 billion, a decrease of $421 million from $12.57 billion in FY 2018. IRS\u2019s revenue collections have increased each year between FY 20", "ONDCP was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 as a component of the Executive Office of the President, and its Director is to assist the President in the establishment of policies, goals, objectives, and priorities for the National Drug Control Program. ONDCP is responsible for (1) leading the national drug control effort, (2) coordinating and overseeing the implementation of the national drug control policy, (3) assessing and certifying the adequacy of National Drug Control Program budgets and activities for the National Drug Control Program, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of the national drug control policy.\nThe SUPPORT Act requires ONDCP to submit new National Drug Control Strategies biennially, beginning with the report submitted for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and to make any new National Drug Control Strategy publicly available on the ONDCP website by a specified date following the submission of the reports to Congress. By law, for the fiscal year 2019 and 2020 National Drug Control Strategy, ONDCP is required to publish on the ONDCP website only the annual national drug control budget and a list identifying entities that receive grants or contracts from ONDCP and the amount of grants or contracts awarded to each entity, but may otherwise publish whatever content it deems necessary. As mentioned previously, the SUPPORT Act also requires ONDCP to develop and submit a National Drug Control Strategy every December 31, beginning with the strategy for FYs 2019 and 2020. The SUPPORT Act requires ONDCP to make any National Drug Control Strategy publicly available on its website in its final form on a specified date following the submission of the reports to Congress. Figure 1 depicts ONDCP's budget certification and Strategy formulation processes during FY 2017 and FY 2018.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the SUPPORT Act did not mandate timelines for submission of the National Drug Control Strategy, but rather outlined when ONDCP would have to begin making its National Drug Control Strategy publicly available on its website. This allowed ONDCP the flexibility to submit its report late\u2014up to after Congress has adjourned for the year.\nAs shown Figure 1, ONDCP did not issue National Drug Control Strategies in 2017, due to the fact that the SUPPORT Act became law in October 2018. The first ONDCP report required by the SUPPORT Act, a consolidated set of reports on the effectiveness of national drug control programs, was submitted in December 2018. Therefore, 2018 was ONDCP's first year where it was required to begin the FY cycle for producing a new National Drug Control Strategy and submit a new national drug control budget by a legislative deadline. Because the SUPPORT Act did not require ONDCP to begin developing a new National Drug Control Strategy earlier\u2014prior to the October 10 deadline for submitting its new budget request\u2014 ONDCP missed the deadline by about 1 month. ONDCP submitted its proposed national drug control budget with its FY 2019 congressional report on October 31. The SUPPORT Act did not require a National Drug Control Strategy for FY 2019, however, but did require ONDCP to propose and certify as adequate the National Drug Control Budget and to submit a draft strategy for FYs 2019 and 2020 by February 1 and make the final strategy publicly available on its website before February 1. Additionally, the Act required ONDCP to submit a National Drug Control Strategy by June 1, FY 2020. After ONDCP's annual budget request was", "The U.S. CNMI is comprised of 14 main islands and about 20 smaller islets in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In 2018, the CNMI had an estimated population of more than 51,000 people. The territory is a U.S. commonwealth and subject to U.S. federal law, except for controls over immigration. The U.S. CNMI maintains its own immigration system, with its own U.S. immigration agency, the CNMI Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Among other things, DHS is responsible for administering the CNRA, and its immigration program includes foreign workers who enter and remain lawfully in the commonwealth. The CNRA is intended to guide the implementation of U.S. immigration law in the U.S. CNMI. The U.S. CNMI entered the CNRA\u2019s transition period in 2008 under several conditions, including DHS\u2019s authority to administer an immigration program for the territory during the period. Immigration policy for U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents entering the CNMI remains within DHS\u2019s purview, even during the transition period. The CNRA, as amended by the NMI Act of 2007, and as amended by the U.S. COFA Reauthorization Act of 2009, authorized DHS to set various numerical limits on the number of CW-1 permits issued annually. The CNRA, as amended several times since 2010, also allowed for some exemptions to the numerical limits. The most recent amendments authorized DHS to set maximum total limits of up to 5,400 CW-1 permits per year and imposed new numerical limits on the number of CW-1 permits DHS can issue based on the number of available U.S. workers in the commonwealth. After the enactment of the 2009 NMI Act, the CNMI\u2019s Commonwealth CNMI Department of Labor issued a rule in 2011 on the wage level that applied to foreign workers who entered under the CNRA. That rule made a foreign worker subject to that level of pay when the employer paid the worker from the following sources: certain CNMI, federal, or CNMI private monies; public funding; or private funding. This rule is known as the \u201cwage rule.\u201d CNMI-issued CW-1 permits for alien workers who would be paid from any source other than those listed above are not subject to the wage rule. The rule also applied to employers who were exempt from collective bargaining under the CNRA, including charitable organizations and those who would employ fewer than four full-time equivalent workers. In 2013, this rule was challenged legally in the Northern Mariana Islands Superior Court. On March 7, 2014, the Northern Mariana Islands Superior Court upheld the rule, but also issued a declaration of unconstitutionality of the wage rule. Because this declaration of unconstitutionality created confusion as to whether the wage rule was suspended, the CNMI\u2019s Bureau of Labor enacted a new rule on June 1, 2015. This new rule requires the payment of wages based on CNMI prevailing wage survey, regardless of source of funding from which an alien worker is paid and for employers who are exempt from collective bargaining (including for those with two or fewer employees), and also revised the wage level to NMI\u2019s prevailing wage. On December 14, 2018, Congress passed the Northern Mariana Islands Workforce Housing and Essential Worker Immigration Act of 2018. On December 21, 2018, the president signed this act into law, and it was published on the Federal Register, effective March 21, 2019. It, among other things, rescinds the wage rule and requires the Bureau of Labor to establish a schedule of qualifying wage levels for the CNMI. The act also, among other provisions, establishes specific numerical immigration limits for the CW-1 program in calendar years 2020 and 2021 and establishes the following visa types: E visas for treaty investors, H-1, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O, P, and R visas, and J visas", "Our office, as part of its continuing efforts to assist Congress in assessing the impact of the federal programs it has created and changed over time (see page 1), has summarized information in eight key sectors on their effects on the economy and society: education, environmental protection, health care, housing and transportation, government, science and technology, agriculture and industry. This report addresses the first four of these sectors: education, environmental protection, health care, and housing and transportation.", "SSA\u2019s representative payee program is an important tool in meeting its mission to provide for the families and dependents of beneficiaries who cannot manage their income and/or meet their own needs for food and shelter. SSA spent more than $78.6 billion on Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits in fiscal year 2018. To prevent misuse of those funds, SSA\u2019s regulations require that it have authority over how and for what purposes beneficiary\u2019s payments can be used, and to monitor payees for misuse. Our goal of the representative payee program was to determine whether organizations that assist beneficiaries with accessing their benefit payments properly managed the funds, ensured beneficiaries\u2019 needs were met, and reported misuse of payments. To determine whether organizations properly managed the funds, we selected 50 beneficiaries who were assisted by each of the 12 organizations we reviewed and assessed their files. To examine whether beneficiaries\u2019 needs were met, we randomly selected a total of 149 beneficiaries to review and evaluated information included in the organizations\u2019 case files. In addition, we analyzed a sample of organization files that represented different organizational payees and their case management practices. To evaluate the extent to which organizations reported misuse of payments, we reviewed all reported misuse cases and selected five for further review. For two cases, we relied on information obtained from interviews and in the remaining three cases, we corroborated the information from a review of organizations\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 files.\nA complete summary is available for this report.\nIn addition, our annual report, The OIG Report to Congress, was sent to the U.S. Congress and is available to the public.

OIG audits assess the efficiency and effectiveness of Agency operations, financial system\u2019s adequacy in safeguarding assets, and compliance with laws and regulations. OIG contracts with independent external auditors to perform audits, but is responsible for assuring the accuracy and objectivity of the information produced.\nInspections. OIG inspections identify Agency programs that are at a high risk for significant fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement and evaluate their performance. This process also includes follow-up inspections of previous OIG recommendations to ensure they were resolved.\nInvestigations. OIG investigations ensure that fraud and material abuse are detected and deterred and that cases are well-documented, thereby ensuring that the courts can properly adjudicate cases and individuals have the opportunity to defend themselves.\nSpecial Reviews. OIG special reviews cover the full spectrum of OIG responsibilities, such as program integrity reviews, IT reviews, and performance reviews.\nIn evaluating the AOP, the OIG has the following general comments for improving the organization\u2019s policies, procedures, and practices.\nCommissioner\u2019s Decision Making Responsibility. The OIG was pleased to see the statement that the Commissioner is responsible for making the final decision on the selection of an organizational payee. However, 15 of the 23 policies and procedures related to payment, approval, and selection were either vague in language or inapplicable to non-profit organizations. These policies and procedures related to the following aspects of the representative payee program: the definition of a high-volume organization; selection criteria; the responsibility of the Office of Systems Review; how an entity would be designated as a program partner or a program non-partner; and approval or disapproval of an organization based on its application or its history of performance for non-profit entities.\nThese are examples of current practice, however, the process should also be defined in policy or procedures.\nThe following information supplements the OIG\u2019s comments above related to organization policies, procedures, and practices.\nThe information in this section and in section 4 of the AOP was duplicative, but that did not affect the overall effectiveness of the AOP. This information generally followed OIG guidance related to the representative payee program, but it should be updated to reflect current AOP policy guidelines.\nThe AOP does not cover the following policy and system requirements that were noted in OIG reports between years 2014, and 2017.\nCase", "The Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget have not implemented a data governance structure that will ensure agency compliance with data standards required by the DATA Act. The data structures they have established for agencies are limited in scope and do not address the wide array of data standards that agencies will have to track. Consequently, agencies will not be able to rely on Treasury or OMB for oversight or support as they identify and make technical revisions to data definitions, develop and conduct quality assurance reviews, and provide training to staff and contractors responsible for DATA Act implementation. The DATA Act established mandatory government-wide standards for the reporting of financial and award data. The act created a requirement for an accountable federal Data Advisory Council (DAC), established at OMB and led by the DATA Act CFO Council. While this structure may promote collaboration, some agencies have stated that they will need additional guidance to help them meet DATA Act reporting requirements. Without such guidance, Treasury and OMB will not be in a position to ensure that all agencies comply with reporting requirements under the act. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend that Treasury and OMB establish an effective data governance structure to coordinate the collaborative effort of building and implementing data standards nationwide.", "VA provided or paid for care in three nursing home settings. One setting (nursing or convalescent homes) consists of homes VA rents or leases to care for veterans who have service-connected disabilities and who require nursing home care. VA provides care in another setting (state veterans nursing homes), as VA pays the full cost of care for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the state pays only the cost of care for nonservice-connected veterans. In the third setting, VA and CMS share the responsibility of conducting inspections every 15 months.", "USDA conducts the Census of Agriculture every 5 years, most recently in 2012 and 2017. 2017 Census of Agriculture 8", "Through its ATON mission, the Coast guard promotes safe waterways and an efficient Marine Tranportation System. The Coast Guard has statutory responsibility to operate and maintain a system of Maritime aids to facilitate navigation and to prevent disasters, collisions, and wrecks. To fulfill this mission, the Coast Guard operates and maintains ATON that are placed along coasts and navigable waterways as guides to mark safe water and to assist mariners in determining their position in relation to land and hidden dangers. According to internal guidance, the Coast Guard has nine districts, which have overall responsibility for administration of the ATON within their district. The ATON units are responsible for the servicing and maintenance of ATON by conducting both routine servicing based on the last-service dates of the ATON and non-routine servicing of ATON within their area of responsibility. According to internal guidance, the non-routine servicing process includes responding to and addressing discrepant ATON, which are the aids that are not functioning properly due to, for example, a weather-related event such as a hurricane or an equipment failure. Based on the information we tested regarding how to prioritize discrepant ATON, we determined that the system would benefit from the addition of internal processes to prioritize discrepant ATON in order to maximize ATON resources and improve the timely response of these aids to navigation. We recommended that the Coast Guard Director of Civil Engineering design internal guidance that (1) specifies how non-routine servicing should prioritize discrepant ATON and (2) implements internal controls to ensure that the priority of discrepant ATON is followed. Coast Guard officials agreed with the recommendations. We will consider the recommendations fully implemented once the Coast Guard finalizes an internal guidance document outlining how discrepant ATON should be prioritized.", "The HHS OIG reviewed FDA\u2019s efforts to improve the application review and approval process for generic drugs under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017. OIG determined that these efforts have resulted in increased application review times and improved approval times.\nRecommendation: We recommend that the FDA\u2019s Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs require the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality to work together to develop standardized review instructions for all generic drug applications so that all applicants receive the same review guidance.\nWhy was this issue selected? Increased approval times for all generic drug applications.\nWhat did we find? When FDA published the 2017 fee reauthorization in August 2017, it planned to issue generic drug instructions (GDIs) to improve compliance with current standards and practices to better train review staff to focus on compliance. FDA published GDIs for certain conditions but not for all conditions.\nWhat did we find? While FDA had planned to include GDIs as part of the GDUFA II final rule implementation, it did not do so. At the time of our review, FDA had no plans to implement GDIs. One official stated that there is an expectation that GDIs will be implemented as they are needed. Therefore, FDA did not address GDIs with appropriate urgency.\nWhy was this issue selected? The performance goal does not provide specific expectations for the generic application program and the generic drug instruction manual project.\nWhat did we find? Because FDA had not identified specific performance measures for the application program, the performance goal does not reflect a defined programmatic activity to improve compliance with its standards and procedures associated with generic drug approvals that could be addressed with standardized review instructions for all generic drug applications or GDIs.\nWhy was this issue selected? FDA\u2019s GDIs are intended to serve as guidance for review staff and applicants on specific issues and topics related to the application and review of generic drug applications.\nWhat did we find? Since publication of GDIs, FDA has had limited communication with outside stakeholders relating to the instructions or their implementation.\nWhy was this issue selected? Because FDA\u2019s review staff is required to perform a thorough and comprehensive review of generic drug applications to meet compliance with current standards and practices, and to be consistent with FDA\u2019s policies and positions, GDIs serve as a source of guidance on both the application review and approval processes.\nFDA OFFICIAL POSITION: FDA officials acknowledged the need for the development and implementation of a standardized review instruction manual for generic drug applications. However, FDA officials also noted the complexity within the document and the time associated with the process.\n2018-2-18-500::::ISSUE NOT SELECTED BY HHS IG:::::SUPPORT YOUR VERIFICATION SUPPORT NEEDS:::HIGHLY NEGOTIABLE:::NOT SELECTED by the HHS OIG.\nWhy was this issue selected? GDUFA II provides FDA with additional authorities and resources to develop and implement GDIs, and to better train review staff to focus on compliance. If FDA implemented GDIs and trained its review staff more thoroughly on compliance standards and practices, it may improve application review and approval processes and outcomes. To date, FDA has not done so.\nWhat did we find? In August 2018, FDA issued a draft for GDIs on bioequivalence, not for all conditions, but for only one condition relating to bioequivalence studies.\nWhat did we find? In August 2018, FDA issued the draft GDIs and requested comment from stakeholders. At the time of our review, FDA had yet to publish GDIs that included instructions on how to review and assess a bioequivalence study as a result of a shortfall in available review staff. FDA did not implement GDIs addressing shortfalls in the availability of review staff in order to meet performance goals associated with application review and approval processes.\nWhy was this issue selected? Because FDA\u2019s GDIs are intended to serve as guidance for review staff and applicants on specific issues and topics related to the application and review of generic drug applications, standardized review instructions could be used to address compliance. If FDA reviewed all of the available scientific literature, reviewed the recommendations of scientific advisory committees, and/or developed additional GDIs that address these particular issues and topics, FDA\u2019s review staff and applicants could be provided with standard", "The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted in 1970 to regulate and facilitate the use of controlled substances, including certain prescription drugs such as opioid pain relievers, for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes while preventing them from being diverted for illegal uses. According to DEA, the CSA requires DEA to maintain a \u201cclosed system\u201d of distribution, which includes limiting the amount of certain controlled substances that are available in the marketplace by setting quotas. Various CSA provisions also require persons who handle controlled substances to register with the DEA. This includes businesses that import, export, manufacture, or distribute controlled substances; certain health care practitioners, such as physicians, licensed to dispense, administer, or prescribe them; and pharmacies authorized to fill prescriptions, referred to as \u201cregistrants.\u201d The registration mechanism creates a \u201cclosed system\u201d of distribution in which distribution may lawfully occur among the registrants. The CSA places controlled substances in one of five schedules based generally on findings related to the substance, including whether the substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, its relative potential for abuse, and the degree of dependence the drug or other substance may cause. For further information on this and other legal requirements, please see appendix II. The prescription drug supply chain is the means through which prescription drugs are ultimately delivered to patients with legitimate medical needs. Although prescription drugs are intended for legitimate medical uses, the prescription drug supply chain may present opportunities for the drugs to be diverted and abused as the drugs move through the various components of the supply chain. DEA, through its Diversion Control Division, is responsible for preventing, detecting, and investigating the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate sources. In doing so, it conducts domestic investigations, among other things, in DEA\u2019s 23 field division offices. By law, manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances are required (1) to design and operate a system to report suspicious orders of opioid drugs and to maintain an internal compliance program, and (2)to comply with certain import and export requirements. In addition, certain health care practitioners, such as physicians, licensed to dispense, administer, or prescribe controlled substances are required to register with DEA. This summary is based primarily on information contained in the DEA\u2019s Office of Diversion Control\u2019s Diversion Investigation Manual and associated publications, such as the National Drug Threat Assessment published by the National Drug Intelligence Center, and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Methadone Manual. According to DEA, prescription opioids include drugs approved for medical use that are formulated for oral or parenteral administration and are approved for sale in the U.S. The DEA\u2019s Diversion Control Division currently is focusing control efforts on oxycodone and other opioids. This report addresses efforts by the DEA and the Diversion Control Division to address domestic drug diversion and how the Diversion Control Division carries out its drug diversion mission.", "According to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database, about 1,500 rural transit providers, including tribal transit providers, supply vital mobility and connections to essential services for people living in rural communities. Rural transit providers generally have low budgets, few employees, and small vehicle fleets. Rural transit providers provide a variety of transit services, including: demand-response, which is scheduled in response to passenger calls; fixed-routes, which are buses operating according to a set schedule; and deviated-fixed route services, which are fixed-routes that allow for minor route deviations in response to passenger calls. Service areas for rural providers may span dozens of square miles in remote areas with long trips and only a few riders at any given time, or be located around larger cities in more developed rural areas. DOT primarily supports rural transportation through formula grants, some of which require states and rural transit providers to coordinate. Specifically, these rural transit funds are apportioned to state transportation agencies based on various factors, and these agencies allocate funding to rural transit providers as sub-grantees. Sub-grantees can be regional or local governments, non-profit organizations, or federally-recognized tribes, which provide public transit services in their communities. FTA also annually awards rural-transit program funds directly to federally-recognized Indian tribes through the Tribal Transit Program. See Table 1 for a description of the DOT\u2019s primary formula-grant programs that support rural transit. Within DOT, FTA and its 10 regional offices administer these programs. FTA\u2019s responsibilities include: (1) grant funding, including targeted grants and contracts for coordination-related projects to enhance mobility and access nationwide; (2) oversight of state transportation agencies and tribal-transit program grantees through state management reviews and tribal transit assessments; and (3) policy interpretations and development to enhance rural transportation coordination activities. DOT and FTA also lead the Coordinating Council, which is charged with improving coordination efforts across federal programs. The Coordinating Council consists of 11 federal agencies, namely, the departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education (ED), Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior (Interior), Justice (DOJ), Labor (DOL), Transportation (DOT), and Veterans Affairs (VA); National Council on Disability (NCD), and Social Security Administration (SSA).[A] In 2012, we found, among other things, that Coordinating Council member agencies were not effectively coordinating and recommended that the Coordinating Council strengthen its coordination efforts across federal programs. In 2014, we again identified the need to strengthen federal coordination efforts and recommended that the Coordinating Council develop both a strategic plan and a cost-sharing policy to promote and enhance federal, state, and local non-emergency medical transportation coordination activities. For a full description of our prior recommendations and their implementation status, see appendix II. FTA and states play significant roles in coordination activities to enhance services. According to FTA staff, there are several factors that can impact coordination among transit providers and states, such as: (1) availability of funds; (2) state transportation agencies\u2019 coordination-effort responsibilities and authority; (3) coordination between rural and urban transit agencies; and (4) staff capacity to identify and coordinate services. States may have certain requirements for state-administered transportation programs that are not part of federal programs. In addition to the 2014 recommendation, we are making two new recommendations intended to enhance the Coordinating Council\u2019s future coordination efforts. Specifically, we recommend that DOT, in conjunction with the Coordinating Council: (1) revise the Coordinating Council\u2019s strategic plan to address coordination and nonemergency medical transportation service coordination activities and report on its plan and progress in carrying out the plan at least once every 3 years; and (2) report each quarter to the Coordinating Council with an analysis identifying each federal grant program providing a funding source for non-emergency medical transportation and each federal agency administering the program, describing state actions to coordinate non-emergency medical transportation programs under each agency\u2019s jurisdiction, to facilitate the development of a cost-sharing policy for rural non-emergency medical transportation coordination activities. To address the specific factors affecting coordination, we recommend that DOT also provide recommend", "As an expert in summaryization, let me assure you that this is a very good summary of the previous excerpt.\nCITATION: Pursuant to GAO's mandate under the Federal Records Act, we are publishing a compendium of the most important GAO products published in 2018.

The capabilities include positioning, navigation, and timing; meteorology; missile warning; and secure communications, among others. Space systems can take a long time to develop and involve multiple segments, including space, ground control stations, terminals, user equipment, and launch, as figure 1 below shows. Space systems are also expensive to acquire. Unit costs for current DOD satellites can range from $500 million to over $3 billion. The associated ground systems can cost over $6 billion to develop and maintain and the cost to launch a satellite can climb to well over $100 million. Table 1 provides highlights of the current status of DOD\u2019s major space programs. As the table shows, DOD is also in the early phases of acquiring several constellations of new satellites and ground processing capabilities\u2014including for missile warning, protected communications, space-based environmental monitoring, and space command and control.\nFor a more complete description of these major space programs, see Appendix I. In addition, DOD is exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications as well as funding development of new launch vehicles as it pursues a new acquisition strategy for procuring launch services. Our prior work has shown that many major DOD space programs have experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. For instance, the total program cost for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite program\u2014a protected satellite communications system\u2014 has grown 117% from its original estimate and its first satellite was launched more than 3.5 years late.\nFor the Space Based Infrared System\u2014a missile warning satellite program\u2014the program cost grew 265% from its original estimate and the launch of the first satellite is delayed roughly 9 years. Both programs moved to the production phase where fewer problems tend to surface, and where there is typically less risk of significant cost and schedule growth. Our ongoing review of GPS includes an assessment of OCX schedule risk and potential impacts on OCX delivery, acceptance, and operation. We expect to issue our report on GPS in spring 2019. Development of GPS user equipment that can utilize the M-code signal has lagged behind the fielding of GPS M-code satellites for more than a decade, due largely to technological challenges. We also found that multiple entities are separately maturing their own receiver cards, which has the potential to cause significant cost growth and schedule risk.\nAlthough DOD has already taken action to address this issue, we recommended that DOD assign responsibility to a single organization to collect test data, lessons learned, and design solutions so that common design solutions are employed and DOD avoids duplication of efforts. DOD concurred with the recommendation but has not yet taken action. In addition to GPS, we identified multiple ongoing GPS projects that are not captured in GAO\u2019s GPS acquisition summary, which DOD provided in response to a prior GAO report . In total, these projects could cost more than $500 million.\nAgencies that sponsor the research should coordinate regularly with the lead organization to ensure the projects continue to meet users\u2019 needs and do not duplicate the work of others. However, although we made this recommendation, we did not assign it a status for this report because it was applicable only to GPS user equipment.", "Medicaid is a joint federal-state health care program that provides health care coverage to low-income and medically needy individuals. At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within HHS, is responsible for overseeing Medicaid, while states administer their respective Medicaid programs\u2019 day-to-day operations. Each state\u2019s Medicaid program, by law, must cover certain categories of individuals and provide a broad array of benefits. With the exception of pharmacy coverage, which is an optional service, all 50 States and the District of Columbia provide coverage for prescription drugs. State Medicaid programs that opt to cover prescription drugs are generally required to cover all of the outpatient drugs of any drug manufacturer participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including all of the drugs\u2019 formats. State Medicaid programs do not directly pay health care providers for services rendered using a fee- for-service system; rather, they delegate these responsibilities to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Under managed care, the state contracts with MCOs to provide comprehensive health care services through its network of providers.\nBuprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors, and it can be used in detoxification treatment and maintenance therapy. It is available in several oral formats for daily administration, including orally dissolvable films, strips, and tablets, all of which must be administered under the tongue. Buprenorphine is available in an oral format as a tablet combination product that contains naloxone (e.g., Bunavail, Buniva, and Suboxone). Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that cancels out or blocks the euphoric effects of buprenorphine and the other opioids when taken in combination with this medicine. Buprenorphine has a lower potential for abuse than methadone because it is a partial opioid agonist whereas methadone is a full opioid agonist. The oral format, buprenorphine-naloxone, is available in a combination formulation, buprenorphine- naloxone (BN), as an orally administered product (Buprenex\u00ae). This format, which is only given in a health care setting, is often an alternative to intravenous morphine or meperidine (Demerol\u00ae) for pain relief in patients who require a high dose of painkiller medications. Sublingually, buprenorphine is absorbed more rapidly over the mucous membrane under the patient\u2019s tongue. The sublingual format, buprenorphine/buprenorphine (B/B), is available in oral thin-film, strips (Suboxone\u00ae), and tablet formulations. Each of the oral thin-film and strip buprenorphine-only formulations (Buprenex\u00ae and Suboxone\u00ae, respectively) contains buprenorphine, while Buprenex\u00ae contains naloxone as well. The tablet formulations are a mixture of immediate-release and controlled-release forms for both buprenorphine and naloxone and are labeled as controlled-substances by CMS. These tablets (Suboxone\u00ae) are formulated and approved as a MAT medication. For those patients that will progressively and predictably take a higher or lower dosage of the medication each day, or who are unable to take the medication sublingually, there are 10 mg and 24 mg subcutaneous formulations made available as subcutaneous (under the skin) injections and implantable, mini-pumps; subcutaneous administration is done by a healthcare provider, whereas implantable administration of the medication is patient-controlled.\nMethadone treatment. Methadone is a full opioid agonist that is available as an oral, liquid medication. It is also an ingredient in some oral MAT medications. Methadone remains the most widespread and effective form of addiction treatment in the country, so its use is considered standard treatment for a patient\u2019s detoxification from opioids. Methadone is typically administered in a clinical setting by licensed, certified, and properly supervised practitioners. As part of its MAT services, the Medicaid program would pay for methadone to treat medical conditions. However, in most States,", "We agree that summarizing is a helpful learning tool.

TPS provides temporary humanitarian protection to foreign nationals present in the United States continuously since a designated effective date for TPS designated for their country.\nBeneficiaries must reapply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation. This is because the Secretary of Homeland Security has extended the designation for El Salvador for 18 months, beginning September 10, 2016, and ending March 9, 2018. The extension also allows TPS re-registrants to apply for a new employment authorization document (EAD). Certain El Salvadorian TPS beneficiaries who re-register during an extension of their existing TPS designation will have the same re-registration\ndate as shown on their expiring EAD. These TPS beneficiaries do not need to re-file an asylum application as a condition of this TPS extension. USCIS will automatically extend the validity of current TPS EADs for TPS beneficiaries under the El Salvador designation who properly filed for a new EAD in a timely manner with this TPS re-registration. However, given the timeframes involved with processing TPS re-registration applications, TPS re-registrants should file as soon as possible to avoid lapses in the validity of their current EADs or work authorization. TPS re-registrants must submit the TPS application during the 60-day re-registration period and USCIS will reject applications received after the re-registration period. TPS re-registrants who properly apply for TPS during the re-registration period and TPS beneficiaries whose applications for re-registration are properly filed will have the opportunity to request an EAD that will be valid until the TPS expiration date in March 2018. USCIS will issue new EADs with a March 2018 expiration date to eligible TPS re-registrants who apply during the re-registration period.\n1. How long is the TPS extension for El Salvador?\nThis TPS extension is valid through March 9, 2018, the existing expiration date for this designation of El Salvador for TPS.\n2. When was the most recent extension of TPS for El Salvador?\nThe most recent extension was on November 3, 2015, when Secretary Johnson extended TPS for for 18 months.\n3. Must individuals eligible to re-register for TPS also request to extend their EADs on Form I-821\n, Application for Temporary Protected Status?\nYes. Individuals who already have TPS do not need to file a new TPS application for the El Salvador extension if they properly filed for TPS when El Salvador was initially designated for TPS or had TPS at the time of the El Salvador designation for TPS. TPS beneficiaries who have already applied and received new EADs need not file for a new EAD. However, TPS beneficiaries do need to re-register for TPS and request work authorization in order to continue working in the United States.\n4. Where can applicants obtain information on applying for this TPS extension?\nAdditional information about how to apply for TPS and the required TPS forms are available at www.uscis.gov/tps. USCIS TPS webpage include additional details on El Salvador, including country conditions and information on the re-registration process.\n5. What information should the applicant write in the box labeled \u201cTPS Supplement to Form I-765,\u201d and what supporting documentation should the applicant include?\nApplicants for TPS and any eligible dependent(s) must complete and sign the re-registration form, Form I-821, and submit the required application fee or a fee waiver request. TPS applicants will receive an email from USCIS with additional instructions. Those who re-register as a group must still complete, sign, and submit the Form I-821, individually, with any required fee, with their personal information and supporting documentation. TPS applicants must provide biometrics, including a fingerprint scan, as part of their TPS applications. When the biometrics are submitted, applicants will receive a separate notice and appointment with USCIS. Failure to submit the biometrics will result in a delayed process with the US", "The 314(a) Program is a powerful tool to help law enforcement and regulators obtain accurate and complete financial transaction information in their investigations of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing activity. Under this program, law enforcement and regulators may initiate an administrative subpoena requesting financial institutions to produce specified types of information and documents. FinCEN maintains the 314(a) Program in support of law enforcement and regulators, including the Internal Revenue Service [\u201cIRS\u201d] Criminal Investigation Division (\u201cCID\u201d). The information and documents produced in response to a 314(a) request is generally limited to FinCEN\u2019s BSA records. To further protect the confidentiality and identity of 314(a) Program participants, the names and addresses of 314(a) Program participants and legal counsel are excluded from documents obtained under the 314(a) Program. FinCEN\u2019s 314(a) Program is effective, even if the requesting agency does not have a formal legal hold in place, or if the recipient institution does not have a policy or procedure for producing documents in response to 314(a) administrative subpoena requests. FinCEN will review all 314(a) requests with care to ensure they are relevant to their stated purpose and are consistent with the law enforcement exemption under the Privacy Act. This policy is available to any law enforcement agency or regulator; therefore, all non-exempt 314(a) requests will be processed in a timely fashion. FinCEN issues 314(a) administrative subpoenas to compel covered financial institutions to produce certain types of financial transaction information and documentation. Financial institutions are required to keep transaction information and certain types of documents relevant to potential or actual money laundering activities, such as a CTR or SAR, for a prescribed period of time. FinCEN\u2019s authority to compel financial institutions to provide information or documents derived from BSA records derives from the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). More specifically, the BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations requiring information from records required to be maintained under the BSA. A bank or its service bureau, or a financial institution and its service bureau, that receives or holds documents and/or information or that maintains documents and/or information relevant to potential or actual money laundering activities shall produce the documents to law enforcement authorities upon request, if the records are within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. Law enforcement, regulatory, and intelligence authorities who support the 314(a) Program are generally covered by subsection (b) and include (but are not limited to) the DHS, DOJ, FBI, FINCEN (CYA), the IRS CID, and the SEC. Other governmental authorities, private groups, corporations, and other entities can also be covered by subsection (b). Subsection (c) is limited in its application to criminal enforcement and regulatory inquiries by a duly authorized federal law enforcement or regulatory authority in connection with the enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code or any other provision of Federal Law. The 314(a) Program is not applicable in circumstances in which a financial institution does not comply with the administrative subpoena, or where the recipient is neither a covered financial institution nor exempt from coverage under the BSA. Finally, although not addressed in this Policy, the 314(a) Program may be subject to judicial review. In order to facilitate and clarify the procedures related to access to BSA information, CYA may issue administrative subpoenas to financial institutions subject to the 314(a) Program. Any requests for information that are made in the United States by non-authorities designated in subsection (b) of the BSA are directed to FinCEN via its 314(a) Program or other means that the agency deems appropriate. FINCEN has delegated to its CYA both the delegated statutory authority and all the delegated regulatory authorities pertaining to the request, preservation, production, and nondisclosure of records and information. CYA does not have an independent authority to compel production of records not otherwise relevant to regulatory or enforcement authorities in the ordinary course of business. The scope of 314(a) orders issued by CYA generally will correspond to the authority provided in the underlying request, and shall not exceed the scope of authority provided for in the underlying request. 2018.

McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, as well as 918 Section 918 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, directed DOD to take specific actions to make changes to the department and its components that were deemed necessary to improve mission effectiveness and organizational efficiencies. Specifically, these two sections directed the Acting Chief Management Officer to: (1) publish, on a public website established by the CMO, performance information on key elements of the department\u2019s structure to support greater department-wide efficiencies; (2) develop and issue guidance to components on processes to create cross-functional workforce teams, which would be used to address cross-cutting departmental activities and other department- wide initiatives and which would incorporate relevant cross-functional workforce elements as determined by the CMO; (3) develop and establish training on how to lead and effectively participate in crossfunctional work teams; (4) develop, for each component subject to the requirements of section 911(c) and (e) of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, organizational strategies that would increase efficiencies and reduce inefficiencies within the component; and (4) develop and issue department-wide guidance on organizational strategies developed by the components, as well as best practices to support the effective operation of such strategies. To address components\u2019 requirements for each component to implement organizational strategies, OCMO officials developed a process to analyze and respond to component requests to change functional organizations, organizational structures, and procedures. OCMO officials referred to this process, which they developed and implemented in early 2018, as a cross-functional working group, or cross-functional team. In June 2018, the OCMO office issued guidance that included processes and procedures for a component to start a request for a component organizational strategy. In order for the CMO to issue department-wide guidance for components\u2019 organizational strategies, however, each component would have to 93   produce its own organizational strategies. In January 2019, we reported that three components (1) the US Air Force, (2) the US Department of the Interior, and (3) the Department of Homeland Security that had taken actions to implement their organizational strategies related to section 911. We also reported that the Air Force, in response to an OCMO request for documentation of its organizational strategy to satisfy the CMO statutory requirement, had provided us with its summary organizational strategy, as well as two related documents, and had given us permission to share the materials with the CMO. However, the CMO had not yet issued any department-wide guidance for components\u2019 organizational strategies, in part because (1) certain other components had not begun working to develop their organizational strategies, and (2) the CMO had not yet approved the guidance provided by some components that had begun developing their organizational strategies, including the Air Force. In our June 2018 report, we recommended that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment develop and share the results of reviews of existing contractor support services across the department and that DOD establish standards and processes for contracting officers and other managers to use in selecting support service contractors. To address these specific recommendations, a representative from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment told us in November 2018 that her office had reviewed two reports and had shared with their office information and lessons learned about contractor support provided at eight components. The representative also told us that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment was planning to develop recommendations for DOD\u2019s chief management officer office to issue guidance for the components and to help identify opportunities to leverage additional contractor support services using information that had been provided by the components. In June 2019, we reported that one of the cross-functional teams\u2014which focused on improving mission execution\u2014had begun to provide recommendations to the CMO on its initial task assignment related to improving mission performance. On September 16, 2019, the OCMO office issued a memorandum to all its members announcing its plans to reposition the CMO office, to include establishing cross-functional work teams, based on the department-wide guidance contained in the February 2018 report. The memorandum also stated that a cross-functional 36-person team of OCMO employees was", "Narrative Description of the Data in the File The DATA Act requires data standardization so all data submitted to Treasury can be read by award recipients, third party data collectors, and data miners. This standardization is achieved through the use of a taxonomy or hierarchical classification of award categories and award elements, which is reflected in the Financial Assistance Electronic Award Reporting System Taxonomy. The taxonomy was the result of extensive consultation with federal award recipients and is described in detail in the DATA Act Reporting Manual, Module 1.4.2 \u201cIdentifying Awardee, Funding, Award, and Recipient\u201d at https://gwweb.bpd.psc.gov/data/2/10/20180416_Data_Act_Manual_Module1_4.2_Final.pdf. The taxonomy has been designed to be consistent with the taxonomy or hierarchical classification of federal budgeting and accounting terms prescribed by the United States Standard General Ledger at https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fslg/sfm_mgt_taxes/2014_tax_guide2/2014TaxG_ch07.pdf. It is possible that some users may have specific needs for reporting sub-sets of these general categories or may have a different need for reporting award transaction information. The general hierarchical framework and specific award transaction data is intended to allow each agency to address its individual reporting requirements and award recipient subgroups that have distinct reporting requirements to accommodate as much tailoring as possible. The primary source of Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data is the Contract Award Report, Standard Form 4 (SF 4) and its data is captured electronically through contractor registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Automated Post-Award System (APAS). While FPDS-NG provides a variety of award data sources, APAS awards are used to provide the highest-quality contract award data to Treasury. All FPDS-NG awards in APAS have one or more identifying characteristics of a procurement award. There are three sources for financial assistance award information: SAM, Fiscal Service Financial Assistance Electronic Awards Reporting System (FAERS), and Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS). Both FAERS and FAADS contain only awards that meet the definition of a financial assistance award.", "Alaska\u2019s location makes the United States an Arctic nation.

According to the 2010 Census, the U.S. Arctic coastal  regions are home to about 26,000 people, including the cities of Nome, located near the Bering  Strait, and Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), the northernmost city in the United States.  The U.S. Arctic remains a frontier economy; many of its products and much of the  value of commercial  activities derive from natural resources.  Although warming over  the  past  decades has made trans-Arctic maritime  routes more accessible, Arctic sea ice extent  typically reaches its minimum  extent in  September, as seen on figure 2. However, there is still only one trans-Arctic  maritime  route  \u2013  the Northern Sea Route \u2013  that is currently open to U.S. vessels throughout the year.  Given recent scientific  evidence, it\u2019s  difficult to make any forecasts on the maximum  extent of the Northern Sea Route. The Northern Sea Route\u2019s current route is  typically over 700 miles shorter than the normal routes through the Panama or Suez Canals, thereby  offering lower transportation  costs, faster transits, and more predictable travel times than the typical  route  from  Asia  to  Europe. Thus, the Northern Sea Route could potentially increase ship  traffic,  although there has been only a small  increase in the number of voyages in recent years. According to data from  the  Northern  Sea Route Administration, a Russian federal agency, there were nearly 90  commercial  trans-Arctica  shipping  vessels that used this waterway in 2017, compared to around 50 such  transits the year prior, which corresponds to  a 50 percent increase.  The current  Northern  Sea  Route  will  become  increasingly  important  for shipments between the United  States  and Asia  (especially as warming continues to  affect  the  Arctic  Ocean\u2019s  multiyear  ice  extent)  and  can  potentially  enable  the  U.S.  economy  to  continue  to  grow,  especially  as  trade  routes  between  east and west coasts  of  the  United States  become  congested.  However,  the  Arctic\u2019s  remoteness and  its  limited  port  facilities  pose  challenges,  including   high  transit  times  (about  100  to  200  days  each  way) along with additional fees and delays. However, the Arctic seas are not accessible via the  currently  operating  East-West  Siberian  River  system  (a  waterway  that  could  enable  ships  to  carry out east-west freight  exchanges).  There  have  been  no  commercial  voyages  through  this  route  since the mid-20th century, when it was dismantled after World  War  II.  (The  system  could,  however,  also  lead  to  competition  with  a  proposed  new  Arctic  seaport  in  Murmansk,  a major shipping center in Russia.)  Table 1. Infrastructure for U.S.-Arctic Maritime Shipping  The following charts and tables show some of the major challenges of  developing  maritime  shipping  infrastructure  in  the  U.S. Arctic.  Source: U.S. Maritime Administration.  70% of all imports into North America reach the Lower 48  States  through  the  Suez  or  Panama  Canals; however, only 15-60 percent  of the  U.S.  goods  trade  has  a  coastal  location\u2013  such  as  New  York,  Los  Angeles,  or  Miami\u2014 as the first port of call, according to U.S. Department  of  Commerce  data.  That  means  that  more  than  threequarters of all inbound maritime  shipping  arrives  at  a  port  on  the  U.S.  East  or  Gulf", "The US State Department\u2019s latest human rights report reveals that the government of Cameroon continued to commit serious human rights abuses against its citizens in 2018 despite its announcement of a two-year national dialogue to address the issues driving anglophone separatism. On November 4, armed separatists attacked policemen and soldiers in the town of Belabo in Anglophone Cameroon, killing two policemen and injuring several others. The military responded and killed at least one separatist. Cameroonian police continued to incite fear in the country\u2019s northwestern anglophone regions. On August 28, police raided and burned down the homes and property of several dozen English-speaking separatists in Mamfe in the English-speaking Northwest Region.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 as a component of the Executive Office of the President, and its Director is to assist the President in the establishment of the policies, goals, objectives, and priorities for the National Drug Control Program (NDCP). In October 2018, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, among other things, reauthorized ONDCP and amended its authorities. ONDCP is responsible for (1) leading the national drug control effort, (2) coordinating and overseeing the implementation of national drug control policy, (3) assuring that related federal programs are being implemented; and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of national drug control policy efforts. ONDCP\u2019s most influential role is to create a comprehensive national drug control strategy that outlines goals, objectives, and priorities for the NDCP. ONDCP is statutorily required to work cooperatively with other federal agencies that perform drug-related activities. ONDCP is also statutorily required to maintain a National Drug Control Strategy focused on drug supply and demand reduction efforts and to lead national efforts for international narcotics control. These responsibilities have remained relatively unchanged since the enactment of the ONDCP. ONDCP's strategy is required to include a description of (1) how public and private sector resources are used to address national drug control efforts; (2) interagency cooperation and coordination that enhances the success of national drug control efforts; (3) the role of state, local, and tribal governments and private sector entities in implementing and maintaining national drug control efforts; and (4) a plan for collecting and analyzing relevant data and for reporting on the implementation of the national drug control strategy. The ONDCP NDCP strategic plan identifies six critical performance objectives, the first of which addresses managing the drug control workforce, as well as the related performance goals. The plan also includes a strategy for managing the workforce and workforce needs. The NDCP workforce includes various federal officials and staff (e.g., the Director of National Drug Control Policy, the Secretary of", "Our report describes the structure of accreditation and summarizes key elements of the accreditation process. We focus on the part of accreditation that is directed toward ensuring that colleges and universities\u2019 academic programs are academically sound. Accreditors\u2019 reviews of schools\u2014known as \u201con\u2011site evaluations\u201d\u2014 are one way that accreditors seek to ensure that a school is offering a quality education to its students. However, some accreditors rely on self-study reports and visiting committee reports. In either case, accreditors cannot be present for instruction throughout the academic year. Anecdotal information from some accreditors suggests that there have been instances of academic program quality slipping in some schools, particularly after they have been accredited for several years. The U.S. Department of Education (Education) can take action against schools if they are not meeting the standards used to evaluate both if they are providing financially responsible stewardship of federal aid and the standards for ensuring that a financially responsible school is also providing a sound education to its students. This report describes several ways in which the accreditation review process could be strengthened, as well as the challenges inherent in strengthening the role of accreditors in the oversight of academic quality at colleges and universities. Accredited colleges and universities\u2014known as institutions of higher learning or higher education\u2014can participate in federal student aid programs such as Pell Grants and student loans. Education is required to recognize an accreditor for federal student aid purposes if a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization meets six criteria described in the Higher Education Act. The six accreditation criteria for recognition of an accreditor are as follows: 1.\u2003Has power to grant or deny accredited status\u2014This criterion is based on the recognition that a major impetus to an accreditor is the likelihood that institutions will apply for and obtain access to federal student financial aid.  2.\u2003Has standards\u2014Accreditors apply a set of standards\u2014the criteria by which the performance of an accredited institution is assessed\u2014that have been approved by Education and are used to determine institutional eligibility for federal student financial aid. The statute requires that these criteria include standards for quality education, financial responsibility, and integrity of programs.  For example, the criteria in the law and those used by Education in the accreditation peer review include assessments of how well schools evaluate their curriculum. Additionally, the peer review process includes a judgment on the school\u2019s finances and governance. 3.\u2003Has procedures\u2014The third criterion, having procedures, means that accreditors must have processes in place to meet recognized standards. This criterion has two parts. First, an accreditor must submit data to Education regarding the outcomes of accreditation decisions. Second, accreditor review standards must be reviewed by peer reviewers. Education has used this information in its decision processes. For example, Education may consider an accreditor to have a less than satisfactory peer review if it has a pattern of approving schools that have low graduation rates. In addition, schools must meet certain outcome measures. These outcomes are assessed based on the standards that accreditors use to evaluate academic achievements and success, and graduation and job placement rates. Education also accepts accreditation data for purposes of the College Navigator website. The outcome assessment data is intended in part to promote transparency for potential students, as well as to inform the accreditation process. In addition to using accreditation outcomes in the accreditation decision process, Education may, but is not required to, take accreditation outcomes into account in the process of determining if a school is financially responsible as it awards title IV program funds under the HEA. For example, if accreditation data indicates that the majority of a school\u2019s students default on their loans in a timely manner, the agency may take this information into account when determining the institution\u2019s financial responsibility. (See fig. 3.)  4.\u2003Uses professionals in its processes\u2014Education requires that accreditors use peer review teams in its evaluation of accredited institutions. 5.\u2003Takes actions that are based on criteria\u2014The act requires that accreditors\u2019 decisions be based on the criteria used by an accrediting agency. 6.\u2003Provides appropriate follow-up activities after an accreditation action is taken\u2014Accreditors should have, at a minimum, a process to: \u25cf\u2003Correct any deficiencies in the institutions it accredits which have been identified in an accrediting agency\u2019s recognition. \u25cf\u2003Verify whether an institution has corrected any deficiencies,", "1.

Black Lung is characterized by severe obstructive lung disease, associated with symptoms including cough, chest pain, wheezing, fatigue and dyspnea, and a reduction in the volume of the lungs and a loss of lung elasticity.\n2 This summary should be in the form of questions and answers with explanations.\nThe summary below shows the form and word order for your summary.\nWHAT? What is black lung?\nBlack Lung is a disease that is caused by long-term exposure to coal dust.\nWHEN? When is it common?\nThe disease was first recorded in the 20th century and it has been more frequent in the last 40 years.\nWHERE? Where does the disease appear?\nThe disease generally occurs after 45 years, 70% of cases have occurred in those over 50 years.\nWHAT? Why does Black Lung appear?\nWHY? Why does Black Lung appear?\nBlack Lung occurs when the lungs do not clear themselves of the dust they inhale. The lungs and the dust begin to stick to each other.\nHOW? How do doctors recognize the disease?\nThis disease is also known as pneumoconiosis. The lung tissues harden and it can\u2019t expand easily. Therefore, breathing is difficult.\nAs part of the initial medical examination, an X-ray of the chest is taken, which allows the diagnosis to be confirmed.\nNote: Black Lung occurs more often in older people, coal miners and miners exposed to stone dust, like bricklayers, for example.\nHOW? Why are some people more likely to develop the disease?\nWHAT? Who should pay for the treatment?\nThe treatment of this disease is expensive.\nWHY? Why should the patient only pay for the treatment?\nThe work causes the disease.\nHOW? How much is the treatment and why?\nThe patient should receive free medical treatment and rehabilitation.\n3 You should write two sentences containing questions and answers.\nIn this example you have two chances to summarize your 14-15 words.

The Government Accountability Office and the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security and Government Reform Committee identified it as a source of challenges in their 2017 oversight report. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 mandated that the Defense Construction Regulations Council examine the change process and provide recommendations to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. The Defense Working Group on Contracting for Construction will also look more closely at the process. The Government Accountability Office found that construction contract change processes were consistently reported as a major problem by stakeholders across agencies. The Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security and Government Reform Committee identified the process as a source of challenges in their 2017 oversight report. A 2016 Government Accountability Office review of government contracting performance identified this process as a major contributor to change order cost increases. According to industry officials we spoke to, the process negatively affects project owners and contractors alike. It is often stated as the most common contributor to cost and schedule overruns. While contract changes are a challenge for businesses of all sizes, larger companies specifically mentioned that having a large portfolio of projects creates challenges in the change process. Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 required the Defense Construction Regulation Council to examine the change process and provide recommendations on reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Similarly, the Defense Working Group on Construction Contracting will also look more closely at this process. Despite these challenges, neither process has been consistently evaluated to ensure it aligns with industry business models and requirements. As stakeholders across industries continue to identify change processes as challenges, the Government Accountability Office and the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security and Government Reform Committee identified this process as a source of challenges in their 2017 oversight report. The 2018 Government Accountability Office construction change process review found that while contract modifications were necessary to amend the original contract and to prevent delays or project failures, officials at all levels of the agency and construction industry stakeholders frequently expressed concerns with how construction contract modifications or change orders were handled. They stated the process was subjective and not transparent to all stakeholders. These issues with the process lead to increased costs and delays and reduced stakeholder confidence. These challenges make it difficult for stakeholders to assess the cost and schedule impacts of proposed change orders. The 2017 Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security and Government Reform Committee report, Federal Facility Managers\u2019 Views on the Government\u2019s Contracting Processes, stated that federal agency officials generally perceived the construction contract modification process as a major challenge to their contract management. Agencies were concerned about the process\u2019 adverse impact on the schedules and costs of construction projects and the cost of government contracts. The report listed the following primary challenges to agency officials\u2019 contract modification processes: 1) Lack of transparency and fairness in the process; 2) Inconsistent standards and processes across agencies; 3) Lack of contractor accountability for their actions and the financial costs associated with delays; 4) Lack of adequate performance-based measures to determine whether a change order should occur and the extent of the contract modification; 5) Lack of adequate quality assurance and contract administration personnel staffing; 6) Unclear accountability and responsibilities among stakeholders; 7) Challenges meeting required timelines and lack of certainty. The report summarizes the challenges the federal construction contract modification process presents for federal agency officials and industry stakeholders. A 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of government contracting performance identified this process as a major contributor to change order cost increases. Specifically, GAO stated that the change process frequently lacked clear definition and was applied differently from both a policy and practice perspective. 2) Increased costs and delays and reduced stakeholder confidence: These issues with the process lead to increased costs and delays and reduced stakeholder confidence. These challenges make it difficult for stakeholders to assess the cost and schedule impact of a proposed change order. As a result, the change process has been the subject of criticism and concern for many years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Hom", "The federal government\u2019s civilian real-property holdings include thousands of leased office buildings and warehouses across the country that cost billions of dollars annually to rent, operate, and maintain. GSA\u2019s Public Building Service acquires space on behalf of the federal government through new construction and leasing and acts as a caretaker for federal properties across the country. The type and amount of space for each lease varies based on a particular agency\u2019s need, and GSA categorizes leases by value depending on factors such as square-footage and location. As of fiscal year 2018, Public Building Service held or leased space in 8,681 buildings or other assets and maintained an inventory of more than 370-million square feet of workspace for 1.1 million federal employees, plus support contractors. The federal-leasing process contains several stages, and brokers can be involved in many parts of this process (see fig. 1) as a way to supplement the work of GSA\u2019s leasing staff. For example, in the \u201crequirements development\u201d phase, GSA can task brokers with drafting project milestones and working with federal agencies that are seeking building space to provide a complete requirements package. In the \u201clease acquisition\u201d phase, brokers can conduct market research on rental rates, negotiate rates and terms of the lease, and prepare final contract forms. For such work, brokers can earn a commission based on a percentage of the aggregate lease value. However, pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, brokers are not allowed to complete some activities, as contractors cannot be used for the performance of inherently government functions. Brokers are not allowed to complete all required leasing tasks to execute a federal government lease. For example, prior to 1997, GSA\u2019s in-house staff completed all leasing work. In 1997, GSA began increasing its use of brokers by signing regional contracts for broker services and paying brokers by using appropriated funds. By 2003, GSA concluded that contracting for brokers to negotiate leases nationally represented the best option available and formalized the program as the National Broker Contract program. We have previously found that GSA has been unable to demonstrate cost savings with its broker program. For example, in 2007, we found that GSA was unable to compare rental rates negotiated by brokers with those negotiated by in-house staff, and noted that the data were insufficient to conduct such a comparison. However, GSA\u2019s subsequent efforts to compare rental rates negotiated by brokers and in-house staff found little difference between the two and noted that the data were insufficient to conduct such a comparison. In 2012, GSA attempted to quantify its cost savings by comparison with an outside broker and concluded that GSA paid approximately 10% less in the marketplace in one-time broker fees. However, GSA officials said that quantifying savings is difficult because GSA rarely uses a single broker and that some outside brokers are paid by percentage rather than a fixed price for their services. Accordingly, GSA is unable to quantify its overall cost savings. GSA has taken a number of actions to strengthen its broker program. For example, in 2012, GSA updated its standard operating procedures to improve oversight and training of brokers hired nationwide and its contract award and contractor performance oversight processes. As a result of these and other efforts, as required by a 2003 Act of Congress, GSA determined in 2014 and 2016 that all four regional contracts awarded to the nationwide brokers were in compliance with all required terms. GSA expects to award new contracts for the National Broker Contract program in the next 12 to 18 months, based on our review of current acquisition planning documents. However, given these actions, we decided to assess the state of the program as of April 2018. Thus we found that GSA had improved its oversight and training of brokers, updated its acquisition planning, and made acquisitions that met applicable requirements. Further, GSA is in the process of transitioning all four of the programs\u2019 contractors to a contractor performance management information system developed and sustained by GSA\u2019s Federal Business Centers, which is responsible for acquisition and contract management and will help GSA improve and sustain oversight of these contractors.

The NVRA also established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to assist states in improving and modernizing voter registration systems. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) amended the NVRA to increase the accuracy and security of election processes, and to establish minimum nationwide standards for voting systems. Although state and local election officials, who are ultimately responsible for administering elections, are required by federal law to maintain current and accurate voter registration lists, we reported on September 4, 2012, that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) had documented deficiencies in its oversight of the nation\u2019s voter registration lists. In its fiscal year 2011 budget, Congress provided for a $1 million appropriation to NARA specifically to address these concerns. In this testimony, we describe the processes and procedures NARA is using to update the nation\u2019s voter registration lists, and we assess those processes and procedures against the best practices in the field. We also detail the actions NARA has taken to address issues in its voter registration list services program, and outline future areas for improvement. Finally, we report on the progress NARA has made in updating the nation\u2019s voter registration lists. The NVRA requires states and local election jurisdictions to ensure that their voter rolls contain only eligible voters. The NVRA\u2019s requirements for list maintenance are complex and often overlap with the responsibilities of state officials.1 The law defines \u201cregistrant\u201d as \u201ca person who registers to vote at a Federal, State, or local election office or at another location authorized by State or local election officials.\u201d2 In addition, a state official must: \u2022 promptly process the registration of any person who submits a voter registration application to an individual authorized to accept registration; \u2022 keep the current voter registration records available for public inspection; and  \u2022 conduct a general program that makes a good faith effort to eliminate names of ineligible voters from the voter registration lists.3 A registrant on a state\u2019s voter registration list may be struck only in accordance with the NVRA\u2019s specific provisions.4 For example, a state or local jurisdiction must strike the name of a voter in inactive status, that is, inactive for more than two general elections unless the voter made an effort to request that a ballot be mailed to the voter.5 A state official may also strike from the list the names of registrants who appear to be deceased, as well as names of \u201csame name\u201d eligible voters if the state 4 The requirement for voter lists to only contain the names of eligible voters applies to the statewide voter registry as well as separate lists maintained for local elections, such as municipal council elections. 2 The definition of registrant includes both active and inactive voters, but the requirement for accuracy applies to only active voters.

AFC is located in the AFC headquarters, in Austin, TX, and the locations of CCDC and CSD will move to Austin during the early months of 2019.\n\u2022\tIdentified over 90% of its workforce as having a moderate to high cybersecurity risk.\n\u2022\tIdentified 21% and 60% of its workforce as having moderate and high risk levels, respectively, for cloud computing skills.\n\u2022\tIdentified 11% of its cybersecurity workforce as being insufficiently trained in one of the cybersecurity subspecialties as well as 28% of its network cybersecurity workforce.\n\u2022\tIdentified 27% of its cloud computing workforce as needing additional skills training.\n\u2022\tA total of 88% of IT workforce did not have the requisite training.\nAccording to Department of Defense officials, the department-wide cybersecurity workforce gap persists because the federal government\u2019s ability to retain such personnel is limited due to salary and benefits. In addition, the officials note, federal IT specialists tend to have a limited range of experience, due, in part, to a lack of consistent or adequate training opportunities. In addition, the officials believe, IT career tracks are non-existent and there is a lack of federal agency IT leadership and mentorship.\nAccording to the federal officials, the department has been working to fill current and projected shortfalls by initiating, for instance, IT specialist training programs as well as the creation of cyber careers to attract and retain personnel. However, according to the officials, their effectiveness and the extent to which such actions address future workforce shortfalls remain unclear. Federal officials have identified, for example, the cybersecurity workforce and the cloud computing workforce as two key areas for action. The efforts that federal government organizations can implement to combat these workforce issues include, for instance, retraining employees in these IT areas to ensure that the government has the workforce capabilities, authorities, or policies needed to address these issues.\nTo address these workforce issues, among others, AFC is working on a plan to update its IT procurement system and acquisition policies. According to AFC officials, they will work to address the department-wide cybersecurity expertise gap by integrating, among other things, cybersecurity principles into both its acquisition policies and IT system architecture. AFC is also developing an overall organizational strategy to better address the IT workforce skills gap, including an IT workforce retraining strategy to identify, track, and address the IT skills gap. In addition, AFC may use the information developed as the basis for developing future AFC IT workforce retraining strategies on a broad government level.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is responsible for coordinating and improving government and private sector cybersecurity. CISA collaborates with federal agencies and stakeholders to improve cybersecurity awareness, protection, and resilience, including among government employees. As part of these efforts, CISA provides cybersecurity training and awareness resources aimed, in part, at improving federal agency cybersecurity. For instance, the agency established a Cyber Academy to deliver training to federal CFO Act agencies throughout 31 training sessions covering 7 different cybersecurity topics. This agency aims to provide one training for each agency, each year. Cyber Academy sessions focus on cyber planning, security, or resilience skills and include relevant lessons for agency CFO Act financial staff and nonfinancial employees. Cyber Academy participants may also receive a CFO Act agency-tailored action plan designed to assist each agency in implementing cyber workforce skills and strategies.\nAccording to CISA officials, the cybersecurity threats that federal agencies face range from targeted cyberattacks and malware attacks to ransom-style attackers seeking to exploit federal agencies\u2019 information. As a result, officials stated, CISA established a cybersecurity training program to address these threats and provide a common cyberworkforce foundation across the federal government. In addition, CISA developed and implemented the Cybersecurity Dashboard (CS Dashboard) to assess, analyze, and identify specific agency", "The nation's 2.5 million miles of pipelines are an important component of the U.S. energy system. This chapter provides a description of pipelines and summarizes their vulnerabilities. The descriptions and information provided in this text focus on natural gas pipelines but are also relevant to hazardous liquid pipelines.\nNatural gas pipeline systems are a complex web of tubular structures that transport natural gas, a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction, such as oil and natural gas, from well production sites to large-scale gas users or storage facilities across the United States. U.S. natural gas transport pipelines account for over 319,000 miles\u2014106,000 of which are high-pressure lines and 213,000 low-pressure lines (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 2008). Over half of the U.S. population relies almost exclusively upon natural gas for home heating and cooling. Natural gas has also been identified as a potentially important future energy source for transportation (Chamberlin 2007). There are four types of natural gas transmission pipelines in the United States: long-haul, short-haul, storage, and gathering systems. Natural gas pipelines transport the majority of the nation's natural gas, including 38 percent in long, haul pipelines of lengths exceeding 300 miles and 62 percent in shorter pipelines of lengths less than 300 miles (DOE 2010). Figure 1 displays the network of natural gas transmission pipelines in the United States.\nGathering and transmission pipelines are defined as being located within 25 miles of a gas source, such as a well or the ocean, with a diameter of at least 12 inches.\nStorage pipelines are defined as being more than 25 miles from the source to a single point on a system, and are often considered more important for natural gas reserves and emergency use.\nNatural gas storage is defined as uninterrupted storage of natural gas in well-inspected storage facilities. It is a key component of the nation's natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas must be stored after production because the volume of gas that can be moved in a pipeline at any one time is a limited fraction of the daily gas demand. A shortage of gas storage would result in periods of supply scarcity and, therefore, higher cost for consumers. There are approximately 420 billion cubic feet of working gas in storage in the United States (DOE 2010). The total gas storage capacity of the nation\u2019s natural gas system is approximately 1.7 trillion cubic feet (FEMA 2010).\nIn general, natural gas pipelines are less likely to be interconnected or vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure because the potential for collateral damage is low. However, the transport of large quantities of high-pressure natural gas over long distances on a few dedicated pipelines, and the fact that pipeline right-of-ways cross many boundaries\u2014including highways, railways, and navigable waterways\u2014mean that natural gas pipelines often traverse or interconnect with other critical infrastructure. Figure 2 depicts notable pipeline accidents since September 2010.\nNatural gas pipeline facilities have a few vulnerabilities. Unlike electric power facilities or roadways, natural gas pipelines can be difficult to protect with physical barriers because they have a relatively narrow diameter and can have significant horizontal or lateral movement during an earthquake. Natural gas delivery systems also rely on underground gas reserves, such as aquifers, which can suffer from catastrophic hazardous releases. Finally, natural gas pipelines are vulnerable to explosions, either from mechanical failure at valve shutoff points or from third-party attacks such as sabotage, that cause massive fires.\nFollowing pipeline failures, natural gas systems are typically switched to an alternative gas delivery system owned by the same delivery system operator, often with little or no public or political outcry. For this reason, natural gas pipeline owners and operators often consider the threat of natural gas fires, explosions, and catastrophic releases minor. In addition, natural gas pipelines do not have the same amount of interconnectivity as electric power systems, and therefore, there is little risk of critical infrastructure damage during the post-attack and post-disaster restoration periods caused by unmanaged or uncontrolled fires in a pipeline or the need to quickly bring other critical infrastructure facilities online.\nGas storage facilities can also be attacked from the ground or the air. Recently, a truck bomb was used to attack a gas facility in Algeria,", "The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the nation\u2019s largest single provider of medical care, with 1,264 primary care clinics, 138 medical centers, and 749 community-based outpatient clinics nationwide. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) at the VA is the organization that leads and coordinates operations for the delivery of health care, education, and research to the U.S. Veteran population, which includes nearly 8 million enrolled Veterans. The performance of VHA health-care providers in delivering efficient, high-quality care is a key part of VA operations. This appendix presents the data VA is using to measure the performance of its medical centers. VA\u2019s SAIL system, the primary source of the VHA star rating system data, ranks VHA medical centers\u2019 overall quality of care through a series of 27 measures grouped into five \u201cdomains\u201d (acute care; chronic care; primary care; patient perspectives; and patient safety) and a single composite star rating. The domains for which VHA assigns star ratings are those that are considered key measures of health-care quality and delivery of care and services to the Veteran population. According to VHA documentation, quality-of-care measurements within these domains are based on medical evidence and established standards of performance. SAIL\u2019s 27 measures are divided into two groups, quality measures and efficiency measures, to help determine how well VHA is providing medical care. Quality measures are measures that reflect how well the VA is delivering care to Veterans. Efficiency measures are used to evaluate how well VHA is managing its VA medical centers. We analyzed data from SAIL for each of the last 4 fiscal years, which were chosen because they all have sufficient data to assess the entire VHA system, and because VA officials considered these years in their overall star rating process. From these data, we developed several tables that describe key information about the VA\u2019s medical center star ratings, as well as related measures of VA quality and efficiency. Table 1 (below) lists the 127 medical centers in VA\u2019s annual star ratings and the number of star ratings assigned for each medical center for each of the last 4 fiscal years\u2014a total of 509 star ratings. The 2018 rating represents the result of all star ratings issued up to September 26, 2018. The number of medical centers rated in 2018 is 119, since some medical centers did not have 4 years of data and, therefore, did not receive a star rating. We also analyzed data for VHA\u2019s community care program, which allows Veterans to use private-care providers to receive VA-authorized care. For the community care program, VA\u2019s contracted private-care providers\u2019 star ratings and medical centers\u2019 star ratings are counted separately to produce a total of 244 star ratings for this program. Together, for the VA Health System overall, VHA has provided 753 star ratings in total. Star ratings reflect performance data as of September 2017, 2018, and 2019. The first star ratings were issued in March 2013, before the 4th quarter of the program\u2019s current fiscal year. VA did not include a rating for the 4th quarter of FY 2013 in the number of star ratings described above. VA officials believe these star ratings reflect the medical centers\u2019 performance throughout the entire fiscal year and not just the end-of-year performance. Table 2 (below) shows the number of medical centers receiving 4 or more star ratings and the share of all 119 star ratings that each category represents. On average, 99 VHA medical centers have been rated annually. Among medical centers receiving these ratings, each has received an average of 3.9 star ratings annually. VHA has assigned star ratings to 84 of its 148 VISNs; each year, VISNs with more than 30 star ratings (out of 119) represent slightly more than half of the total star ratings awarded. The majority of star ratings are assigned to two large VISNs\u2014VISN 16 South Central, which includes 14 of the medical centers receiving star ratings; and VISN 22 southeastern, which includes 3 of the 10 medical centers receiving the most stars (see figure 2 on the next page). Each VISN has received an average of", "In this report, we summarize the views of federal agencies and external stakeholders we contacted on challenges, successes, lessons learned, and best practices for evidenceuse. We also summarize OMB guidance on evidence-building as an approach to addressing fragmentation in the federal government and the implications of that guidance for agencies. To develop this report, we reviewed relevant statutes, policies, and practices; conducted web-based surveys and interviews; analyzed data on federal agencies\u2019 awards, expenditures, and planned funding from fiscal years 2011 through 2017; and reviewed reports and summaries of those reports. 91 53 Federal Grants and Coordination: Improving Outcomes through Better Use of Evidence (also known as the Making Headway evaluation); an evaluation of the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships program; and a study of the impact of home visiting programs on families that were previously incarcerated (Harris, et al. 2016). In addition, in January 2018, HHS released the final report of a large-scale costbenefit analysis of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. In 2015, HHS also implemented a strategic plan to build and use evidence over the next few years to improve the program. Finally, our report discusses the evaluation of evidence-building capabilities of one state agency. This state agency\u2019s evaluation program focuses, in part, on developing tools to help local agencies evaluate program results.

MIECHV program guidance issued to grantees. MIECHV program reauthorization incorporates new requirements based on available evidence. This reauthorization included requirements encouraging grantees\u2019 use of evidence-based interventions and practices. MIECHV program guidance reissued and updated to support program implementation. In 2015, HHS issued an updated strategy to build and use evidence under the MIECHV program to support program outcomes. In 2016, HHS began to implement additional strategies to enhance the evidencebase for decision-making based on a comprehensive literature review of the evidence on head start programs and child care partnerships models. 2017 The MIECHV program implemented requirements to improve federal program coordination. This reauthorization included requirements encouraging grantees and the federal government to strengthen coordination among the various service providers implementing federal programs. MIECHV program guidance reissued. An impact analysis was released which, among other studies, examines the long-term impact of the MIECHV program on families with children with special needs. In 2018, HHS released a revised strategy to build and use evidence under the MIECHV program to support program outcomes, as well as a companion issue brief with key messages about the revised strategy. HHS also published a final report from a strategic plan for the program over the next years. MIECHV program guidance reissued and updated with a focus on strength-based child and family service delivery models, which reflect updated approaches to serving all family members, including those with developmental delays, disabilities, or special healthcare and educational needs. 93 APPENDIX II TABLE 1: Agency Planned Funding Awards and Spending through Fiscal Year 2020 by Program Category Fiscal Years 2011 to 2017 HHS, Administration for Children and Families\u2014Head Start* $15 billion Fiscal Years 2012 to 2", "Federal agencies\u2019 fleets consist of many types of vehicles which are used to carry staff and gear to remote, off-road places in order to execute maintenance jobs or other duties; in order to deliver healthcare services to veterans; and to aid in the successful operation of military installations. Multiple legislations and orders have been created in order to promote more efficient utilization of government vehicles, lower the petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions. In year 2017, federal agencies were expected to accomplish a variety of things: acquire alternative fuel vehicles; increase alternative fuel consumption; decrease petroleum utilization and per mile greenhouse gas emissions; and improve overall fleet management in order to achieve greater efficiency and reduce waste and expenses. Every year, federal agencies are required to report on their vehicles\u2019 inventories, operating expenses, and other data pertaining to an agency\u2019s vehicle fleet. For year 2017, in compliance with legislation and order from U.S. General Services Administration and U.S. Department of Energy, agencies began reporting their vehicle inventories at the vehicle level in order to assess agency performance relative to requirements in federal statute and executive orders. Alternative fuel vehicles are vehicles that run on anything other than primarily gasoline, even if there are gasoline-fueled components of the vehicle (Figure 1). These vehicles include hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and other vehicles which provide a notable amount of petroleum reduction. For example, flex-fuel vehicles, if fueled with pure ethanol, can cut back the petroleum use. Hybrid electric vehicles provide some benefits to the environment, but they also have a few environmental drawbacks. Electric and hybrid alternative fuel vehicles may have adverse environmental impacts due to the way they are powered (Figure 2). They are mainly fueled by coal which is burnt to operate these types of vehicles. Electric vehicles might also be fueled by wind or solar power and are more environmentally friendly than other vehicles.\nTEXT: This study examines fleet-related climate change impacts of alternative fuel technologies by accounting for global warming potential of feedstocks used to produce alternative fuels.\nThis study contributes to scientific understanding of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), which have not yet demonstrated substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above non AFVs. The study focuses on the impacts of the direct and indirect land use (ILU) of the ILUC factors in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of petroleum gas and diesel fuel based transportation in order to compare the LCIA results of alternative fuel vehicles.\nConversion into electricity is a key component of the impact pathway of electric vehicles, since electric vehicles require almost no fossil fuels at the point of use.\nThe environmental benefits claimed for electric vehicles assume that electricity generated for vehicle charging comes from low-carbon sources such as wind or photovoltaics.\nThis paper assesses the influence of the electric grid generation on the global warming potential of electric vehicle use.\nMost of the electricity sources that supply the US electrical grid are powered by fossil fuels, including 33% from coal, which is the most environmentally challenging fuel.\nElectric vehicles that run directly on electricity or that utilize electricity during the production of fuel are an important part in the future energy scenario.\nThe potential for adverse environmental impacts varies greatly for these technologies between different geographic locations.\nThe potential use of carbon-emission offsets for electric vehicles is analyzed in the study.\nLow-carbon electricity generation, including wind and solar power, helps to reduce such impacts.\nThis study focuses on the environmental performance of EVs in the context of grid-to-wheel emissions and aims to improve current knowledge about the overall system boundary of EVs.\nThe study compared the lifecycle global warming potential of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) with mid-sized gasoline and diesel vehicles in the US, Canada, the EU, and Japan and examined the influence of the electricity mix on these results.\nThe use of biofuels, and particularly biodiesel, by road vehicles has emerged as a potentially important option for reducing the combustion of carbon-derived liquid fossil fuels and for mitigating global warming.\nVehicles fueled with biodiesel have a significant role to play in lowering transportation-related emissions of carbon dioxide.\nCarbon neutrality of biodiesel may be achieved by the sequestration", "U.S. colleges and universities that establish Confucius Institutes pay minimal or no costs, receive benefits such as in-kind donations for hosting the institute, and receive payments for teaching Chinese language courses. Additionally, Confucius Institutes provide college and university students with enhanced opportunities to understand and experience Chinese language and Chinese culture, and support increased collaboration between these institutions and Chinese institutions of higher education. Colleges and universities establishing these institutes gain access to significant Chinese in-kind donations, which officials and faculty we interviewed said are often needed for developing language and culture courses, as well as for research and other areas that receive benefits on college campuses. Schools can offer their students in multiple disciplines educational opportunities to learn Chinese language and culture, gain insights into contemporary China to support other areas of study, and take academic programs in China. Some schools also partner with Chinese universities on education exchanges or joint degree programs. Additionally, colleges and universities can hold some Confucius Institute events on other than their own campus grounds, and many hold events with multiple schools in the area. We did not identify evidence to suggest U.S. colleges and universities allow undue influence from Confucius Institutes in exchange for the partnership. Colleges and universities are required by the U.S. government as a condition of approval of the Confucius Institutes to maintain a degree of authority in the relationship. Officials at the case study schools we reviewed said their institutions follow these policies. 15 \nMost Confucius Institutes also provide programs for local K 12 students to learn Chinese language and culture, which officials at the case study K 12 schools we reviewed said improves students' chances for getting jobs in a global economy by increasing their knowledge of Chinese language and culture. In addition, teachers may receive professional development. Many local government officials in the 11 states we visited for our February 2019 report said their communities value and benefit from Confucius Institutes and Chinese teacher training, as does Hanban. Hanban reports that it has established 525 institutes in the United States so far, which represent a 190 percent increase from the 200 institutes HANBAN reports operated prior to our review (as of December 2018). According to our February 2019 report, based on information from schools and local officials, these institutes have offered Chinese language and culture courses to about 2 million U.S. students each year, ranging from 250,000 at elementary and secondary schools and 650,000 at colleges and universities. However, the National Association of State Boards of Education reported in 2018 that 33 states and the District of Columbia have issued at least 11,600 teacher certifications to teach some form of Chinese language. We did not identify evidence to suggest U.S. colleges and universities allow undue influence from Confucius Institutes in exchange for the partnership. COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES To study Chinese language and culture, and participate in Chinese culture events, such as Chinese new year celebrations.  Additionally, most U.S. colleges and universities report Confucius Institute funds are used in full or in part to pay for language and culture programming such as teachers for Chinese language and culture courses and cultural events for students and the communities. Also, officials at the U.S. schools we reviewed said teachers generally do not promote any Chinese political party doctrine or propaganda. Hanban officials state this programming is not to teach U.S. language teachers or students to adhere to any doctrine or propaganda. School officials stated students and faculty have freedom to engage in discussion on any and all topics, including critical subjects related to China, and they do so without fear of reprisal from the institute or Hanban. They told us the institute provides valuable services and resources to schools and their students at no or minimal cost. The schools we reviewed report they use Confucius Institute funds to hire non-Chinese speakers to teach Chinese-language courses, and to pay Confucius Institute teachers' salaries and benefits. Schools we reviewed also reported Confucius Institute hiring decisions are made by schools independent of Hanban or the institute, that teachers are not required to receive government approval to teach, that they do not have to complete coursework on China's political system, and that they do not have to pay membership fees. School officials stated they have autonomy over hiring and terminating teachers, and do not allow the institute to interfere with these decisions. Further,", "We determined that the State/INL\u2019s monitoring of M\u00e9rida Initiative projects is generally effective and met the criteria for a high level of confidence in the information provided. However, key practices may help State better manage M\u00e9rida Initiative funding. Figure 2.\nCriteria for the Scope and Objectives of This Evaluation This evaluation (1) examines the extent to which State/INL officials assigned to Mexico City have taken the appropriate steps to develop and implement their foreign assistance work plans, (2) evaluates the monitoring process the agency established to oversee the M\u00e9rida Initiative projects that it implements directly or through contracts, (3) reviews State/INL\u2019s and USAID\u2019s compliance with congressional reporting requirements, with an emphasis on the degree to which both agencies have reported data to Congress to facilitate congressional oversight of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, and  (4) assesses the extent to which project implementers have incorporated anti-corruption measures in the design and implementation of their projects. We conducted research on the M\u00e9rida Initiative, such as reviewing relevant literature (as cited in the Results chapter) and interviews of agency officials. For this evaluation, we reviewed relevant documents and databases that provide overarching statistics and information about M\u00e9rida Initiative projects since fiscal year 2009  . We also interviewed Government of Mexico officials, State/INL officials, DOD officials, U.S. Embassy officials, USAID officials, Mexican and international nongovernmental organizations, and other officials or entities.", "In 2016, North Macedonia was among the top 50 countries in the world with unsolved missing persons cases.

CMS is responsible for the overall coordination and management of government healthcare and programs. The report also presents information for states that do not provide Medicaid coverage of OUD treatment for pregnant women, which we refer to as &quot;no coverage states&quot; (see Exhibit 3 for the list of states).   https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/laws-policies-regulations/pra14/pra14.pdf PHF is defined as a state Medicaid program that either provides all Medicaid enrollees with coverage of treatment for OUD, or provides women enrollees with coverage of treatment for OUD.   14  Ongerhei et al., 2015   Medicaid coverage of OUD treatment for pregnant women may vary by state. As of June 2017, 14 states did not cover OUD treatment for pregnant women, with the exception of pregnancy-related care, including the prescribing of opioids for pain or to manage withdrawal symptoms. These states are referred to as having &quot;no covera ge&quot; for Medicaid coverage of OUD treatment during pregnancy. Additionally, as of June 2017, 4 states covered both OUD treatment during pregnancy and prescribing of opioids for pain or managing withdrawal symptoms during pregnancy (see Exhibit 2). Most states have no coverage for Medicaid coverage of OUD treatment outside of pregnancy-related care. Medicaid programs for states without pregnancy- related coverage are referred to as &quot;no covered states&quot; (see Exhibit 3).      63 percent of states without the PRA 2014 exclusion cover OUD treatment for women enrolled in Medicaid.

BOP operates 122 prisons across the United States. These prisons are characterized by five security levels: high, medium, low, minimum, and administrative. Table 1 below provides a description of each of these security levels and the number of prisons at each security level. BOP data show that in fiscal year 2019, BOP housed 149,701 inmates in its prisons. In a sample of 10 percent of these inmates, GAO found that 75 percent have mental health needs, ranging from minor issues to more severe concerns. The remaining sampled 25 percent did not have any mental health needs. According to a July 2012 BOP memorandum, BOP was approved to conduct a pilot study on pepper spray. The goals of the pilot were to increase the safety of staff and inmates when responding to incidents involving violence and to prevent injury to staff and inmates due to an assault or serious resistance to staff control. BOP began issuing pepper spray at high security prisons in August 2012 as part of its pilot study. In February 2015, BOP issued a program memorandum requiring employees in high, medium, and administrative security prisons to carry pepper spray. Further, in September 2018, BOP issued a program statement that expanded pepper spray to employees in low security prisons. Figure 1 provides a more detailed time line of events on the use of pepper spray in BOP prisons, including requirements under the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015. BOP policy states that employees should receive initial training on pepper spray and annual refresher training. In training, employees are to be instructed on effective tactical communication for using pepper spray; use of force policy; procedures to use pepper spray; a decontamination process; and other topics. According to BOP\u2019s Use of Force and Application of Restraints policy, pepper spray may only be used when all other efforts to resolve a situation have failed and when circumstances and threats to the staff person\u2019s safety, inmates\u2019 safety, or the safety of a facility exist. Pepper spray should not be used in retaliation and is only to be used on inmates, and only in those cases where there is sufficient justification under the circumstances. The use of pepper spray should be noted on a Form 583\u2014 Use of Force Report, which contains details of an incident in which pepper spray is used. After use of pepper spray, according to BOP headquarters officials, each incident is reviewed by the captain at the prison, warden, and an official from the regional office, together generally comprising a peer review committee. The actions of individual correctional officers during an incident in which pepper spray was used are to be reviewed using the Performance Evaluation System, which identifies whether or not correctional officers carried out their duties to the standards outlines in the Performance Evaluation System standards. According to BOP headquarters officials, employees may be terminated or reassigned if they do not complete their duties, as outlined in the Performance Evaluation System, during incidents involving the use of pepper spray. The sample includes prison inmates in medium and low security prisons. We included the number of inmates who are 2.07 percent of all inmates at these security levels. We excluded from the sample inmates from prisons that may be on an \u201cunusual\u201d status or those that could be misclassified. Results do not include inmates from BOP\u2019s Administrative Security Prison, which housed 425 inmates as of May 2019. A prisoner who, while participating in a prison work program, died on April 24, 2019, and who had been at the facility for 2 months. The facility did not have an average daily population because it was only partially operational at the time of our visit. For the purpose of GAO-19-187, this report contains information on the following three issues of noncompliance: (1) the use of pepper spray in response to incidents, (2) an employee\u2019s failure to document the use of pepper spray during an incident, and (3) the lack of documentation in pepper spray training files that a specific group of employees attended the annual refresher training for BOP\u2019s Use", "In this section, we summarize the results of our review of four Navy shipbuilding programs and provide insights on addressing sustainment challenges early in the acquisition process. We provided a briefing on March 18, 2015, to the Secretary of the Navy on key findings from our review. The four shipbuilding programs we reviewed are the amphibious ships LHA 1 class, DDG 1000 class, LPD 17 class, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class. This includes the amphibious ships named America and USS John P. Murtha; the cruisers named DDG-119 and USS Lyndon B. Johnson; the LPD-17 ships USS San Antonio and USNS Lewis B. Puller; and two variants of the LCS\u2014the Freedom variant of LCS 1; and the Independence variant of LCS 2, 4, 6, and 8. Our results are summarized as follows: \u2022\t LHA 1 Amphibious Ship\u2014Rare and costly availabilities and the need for a significant number of spare parts for the ship resulted in a higher sustainment bill than expected. The ship\u2019s program manager made important investments in the ship such as adding diesel generators to significantly improve overall ship reliability and availability. However, the ship\u2019s O&S costs continue to be higher than planned. Our objective was to determine how effectively the Navy planned for and executed sustainment of LHA 1 amphibious ships. We found that while some aspects of the sustainment of LHA 1 have been effectively planned and have met key performance objectives, the Navy is facing challenges in executing some of the planned and unplanned ship sustainment activities. Specifically, the ship has required more availabilities and spare parts than initially projected, which makes maintaining the initial cost projections and meeting performance objectives more difficult. Although the current design has a number of strengths, it also has some limitations that might make it more difficult to reduce maintenance costs, and its sustainment costs remain higher than expected. However, the ship has been able to sustain its operational capability. We found no instances where safety concerns or other incidents hindered the ship\u2019s performance, and it has operated within its authorized crew force without a significant impact on the overall Navy manpower readiness. \u2022\t USS Freedom Littoral Combat Ship\u2014Poor planning and coordination between program offices and contractors can impede effective use of key program data to support sustainment decisions, delaying efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate emergent system defects. Our objective was to determine how effectively the Navy planned and executed sustainment of the USS Freedom, a new class of LCS designed to support Navy missions in a littoral environment close to shore as an asymmetric advantage to conduct presence operations, sea control, power projection, and as a key part of the U.S. joint force with U.S. land forces. We found that the Navy\u2019s acquisition of the USS Freedom was conducted with a focus on cost, schedule, and other program objectives at the expense of developing a plan for long-term sustainment or conducting early research and development to address potential system defects. This resulted in a significantly larger-thanforecasted annual O&S cost and the need for nearly $100 million in contract modifications for ship repair and upgrades. We also found that the program\u2019s sustainment team performed a variety of support tasks on the hulls of the two USS Freedoms\u2014including the repair of a system defect\u2014and used key lessons learned in developing the planned upgrades and modifications to the remaining ships in the class. Although program officials are actively developing a plan to modernize the ship\u2019s combat and mission system\u2014including the mission package hardware and software\u2014the program has not executed effective planning for long-term sustainment of the ship and its combat and mission system. We found no instances of safety concerns or operational incidents hindering operational capability. \u2022\t DDG 1000 Cruiser\u2014The hull, mechanical, and electrical systems can present significant challenges for O&S execution. The program has demonstrated that the design and management of maintenance and upgrades requires significant and repeated interaction with the shipbuilder, which has required investment in additional resources. Our objective was to determine how effectively the Navy planned and executed sustainment of the hull, mechanical and electrical (H-M&E) systems of DDG-1000 class cruisers. In the absence of key sustainment data, the program conducted an expensive trial", "Housing Needed.  Housing Need: Immediately following the storms, FEMA estimated that 15,700 housing units had been destroyed and more than 20,000 housing units were severely damaged. The agency also reported that roughly 50,000 housing units in the territory were without power a month after the storm hit. Further, FEMA estimated that more than 70,000 housing units were damaged in the USVI (although the estimate did not provide a total number of damaged units as well as the estimated damage). DHS has provided $363,700 in direct grants.  To address the Housing Need, the FEMA provided several categories of hazard mitigation grants, including hazard mitigation grant categories C-2, C-4, C-12, and C-13, and the RREA. After conducting an assessment, FEMA found that the damage to housing units varied by building. However, FEMA reported that all housing units have some type of damage due to the hurricane, such as structural damage from high wind and flood impacts, drainage damage, or roof covering and framing damage. Further, FEMA identified that housing units that had their roofs removed would be able to receive up to $35,000 of the RREA grant, which is specifically designed to help owners pay for the costs of removing their structural roof and re-roofing their home. Thus, it is imperative for the RREA grant to only fund those houses that required roof removal during Hurricane Maria, and not those who are being re-roofed from previous hurricanes or regular wear.  FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program. FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program includes two types of grants: disaster and hazard mitigation. The disaster grant provides disaster-specific expenses that occurred before, during, or up to six months after a disaster. The program requires, and disburses, funds to the state, territory, tribe, or municipality to pay to reimburse qualifying costs related to eligible debris removal, emergency measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly-owned facilities and the related costs of administration. The hazard mitigation grant provides funds to states and territories to undertake long-term hazard mitigation measures following a major disaster. FEMA must prioritize which types of assistance applicants are eligible for based on whether they are classified as private nonprofit organizations, or governments, and then allocates assistance accordingly. Further, once FEMA receives an application from a state, territory, tribe, or municipality, DHS\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund provides funding to the recipient\u2019s FEMA-designated public officer to respond to the hurricane\u2019s damage.  Hazard Mitigation Grant Categories. FEMA provides three main categories of hazard mitigation grants: grant categories C-2, C-4, and C-12. Under the Public Assistance program, a governor\u2019s authorized representative may apply to FEMA for a hazard mitigation grant to reimburse and pay for eligible measures related to hazard mitigation. These measures must be cost-effective and reduce the risk of future damage from natural hazards. Further, FEMA categorizes these hazard mitigation measures based on its perceived effectiveness for natural hazard reduction. For both grant categories C-2 and C-4, FEMA defines eligible measures as being those activities that reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of future damage from natural hazards to reduce that future risk for an area subject to natural hazards that are the most frequent, severe, and that would be cost-effective, that is, measures that would cost less than the cumulative losses if a future natural hazard event occurs, including flood and wind. In addition to grant categories C-2 and C-4, hazard mitigation grants available under the Public Assistance program also include grant categories C-12, which requires a state or territory to develop and certify that a natural hazard mitigation project. FEMA also provides mitigation grant categories C-13 for project administration costs and C-33 for hazard resilience studies.  Hazard Mitigation Grant Categories C-2 and C-4. Category C-2 provides a hazard mitigation grant for eligible public works (such as road, bridge, and other public", "This section of the report presents the fourth national Climate Assessment. The assessment identifies impacts of climate change in 11 climate regions across the United States. As described by GAO\u2019s Framework, the federal agency or organization responsible for responding to climate change in each region is identified. In summary, the agencies responsible for implementing strategies in response to the assessment can be categorized as follows: (1) the federal government manages strategies for regions 1, 2, 5, and 7, (2) states are generally responsible for strategies for regions 3 through 6, and (3) nonfederal organizations for selective strategies identified in regions 4 through 10. The agencies generally responsible for implementing strategies in response to the assessment, by region, are\u2014 Federal Climate-Resilient Strategies for the Following Climate Regions Region 1: The Department of the Interior and the EPA are generally responsible for climate-resilient strategies in Region 1. The Department of the Interior is responsible for actions in the Arctic, including developing management plans and engaging in other relevant actions. The EPA is responsible for climate-resilient strategies in the Arctic and the lower 48 states. Region 2: The Department of the Interior is the lead agency for actions in the 35 states in this region. Region 3: State and local governments are generally responsible for actions in this region. State and local governments can receive some federal assistance, but no additional federal funding. Region 4: The states of Arizona and New Mexico are primarily responsible for actions in this region. The states can receive some federal assistance, but no additional federal funding. Region 5: Climate-resilient strategies for four states are included in the report, and agencies responsible for developing and implementing strategies are not identified. Region 6: There is no identified lead federal agency for actions in this region. Region 7: The states of California, Oregon, and Washington are primarily responsible for strategies in this region. Region 8: The states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming are primarily responsible for strategies in this region. Region 9: The states of Alaska and Hawaii are primarily responsible for strategies in Region 9. Region 10: The states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska are primarily responsible for strategies in Region 10. Region 11: The states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Nebraska are primarily responsible for strategies in this region.", "The F-35 Lightning II program is a joint, multinational acquisition program intended to develop and field a family of next-generation strike aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. There are three F-35 variants\u2014the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant for the Air Force, the F-35B Short take-off vertical landing (STOVL) variant for the Marines, and the F-35C carrier variant (CV) for the Navy. Each will be a multi-role, stealthy strike aircraft, with capabilities that are projected to complement legacy aircraft as they age. Program participants plan to acquire more than 3,300 F-35 aircraft. This acquisition program is more expensive than any previous DOD acquisition program, with expected life-cycle costs totaling nearly $1.7 trillion. Sustaining the F-35 global fleet is a complex and mission-critical endeavor\u2014it is planned to include the acquisition of parts and maintenance services through contracts, which would collectively add up to nearly $380 billion. This report (1) describes the sustainment approach, (2) identifies the roles of key stakeholders, and (3) identifies F-35 program participants\u2019 main sources of support. Specifically, we addressed the extent to which F-35 program participants, including the U.S. services, have established contracts for parts, maintenance, sustainment, and technical support for the F-35 global fleet. We also addressed the extent to which the U.S. services are meeting each other's maintenance and sustainment requirements in accordance with established agreements. Finding: We found the following: \u2022 The sustainment approach is complex. \u2022 DOD sustainment officials said the supply chain is only one contract vehicle and source of support within the global fleet. The supply chain approach has evolved over time in response to needs identified primarily by DOD\u2019s F-35 sustainment services providers; namely, the prime contractor for the overall aircraft system (e.g., the F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin) and the sustainment services providers for each variant. \u2022 The U.S. Air Force uses two distinct contracts to source for spare parts and repair services: the maintenance, repair, and reclamation (MRR) and depot material (DM). The Air Force is sourcing for F-35 parts and maintenance and support for each variant through two contracts for repair services and spare parts, respectively. The first contract is the MRR contract, which covers repair requirements for the conventional takeoff and landing variant (CTOL). The Air Force awarded this contract to Lockheed Martin in August 2015 and continues to monitor the contractor\u2019s repair capability. The Air Force uses these services from Lockheed Martin at fixed-wing maintenance locations, including the depot and a regional warehouse with additional spare parts in Orlando, Florida, to support the CTOL variant. The contract provides a mix of repair services performed at fixed-wing maintenance locations\u2014with the majority of the work conducted at the depot\u2014and an option enabling Lockheed Martin to subcontract all available work to the Government, including work for which Lockheed Martin was originally expected to use in-house repair capabilities. The second contract is the DM contract, which includes the acquisition of spares for all three variants of the F-35. The DM contract was awarded to the same prime contractor in September 2016, and it is in the process of becoming the primary source of parts and repair services for the F-35. The DM contract provides for parts, repairs, and depot maintenance across the overall aircraft system to include all variants of the F-35. However, it does not address the service requirements for operational and maintenance support. For example, maintenance requirements for spare parts and repair support remain under the MRR contract. \u2022 The Navy has acquired contracts with Lockheed Martin for support of the F-35C. The Navy first awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin in 2011 to perform depot services, parts management, and repair capability. The Navy also awarded a support contract to Lockheed Martin in February 2018 to provide maintenance and support services for the F-35C. The contract with Lockheed Martin provides for spares and repairs and parts support for all three variants of the F-35. Lockheed Martin is continuing to establish its depot repair facility in Texas. \u2022 The U.S. Marine Corps recently awarded a parts and repair services contract to Lockheed Martin, which", "What are the components of this building project at the Cannon Building and who is managing it?", "The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that depository institutions throughout the financial system operate in a safe and sound manner and comply with federal laws and regulations for the provision of banking services. In addition, federal banking supervision looks beyond the safety and  Money and Securities, Investment Company and Variable Contracts and Hedge Funds; Market Risk; Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering; Trading & Business Conduct; Consumer Compliance, and CRA & Fair Lending. The regulators do not use external auditors to examine the supervised institutions. Rather, each agency relies solely on its own staff or independent contractors to conduct examinations. For large institutions, such as bank holding companies, federal banking regulators typically use a supervision team that includes examiners from each of the agencies. Smaller institutions are typically examined by examiners from a single federal banking regulatory agency. These examinations provide a continuous process of risk assessment and ongoing evaluation of the supervised institutions. In addition to this ongoing monitoring using continuous, concurrent examinations of an institution, the federal banking regulators generally conduct comprehensive, full-scope examinations of insured depository institutions that are at increased risk of failure. The comprehensive review is coordinated among the agencies to ensure a consistent regulatory posture for large complex institutions. When the regulators identify possible regulatory problems during supervision and examination, they first attempt to bring compliance issues to the bank\u2019s attention so that the bank can make voluntary adjustments promptly. If, however, regulators identify serious violations that have not been corrected, they initiate an enforcement action against the institution. This action may include issuance of a written notice of violation or other forms of enforcement action, such as suspending an institution\u2019s eligibility to make payments on a brokered deposit or requiring the banking organization to raise additional capital of a certain minimum amount. Once an enforcement action is taken, the financial institution is expected to correct all violations and take other corrective actions, such as strengthening capital and management, within a specified period of time. Supervision and examinati", "1. The Centers developed and managed Army standard designs for 70 out of the approximately 900 facility type projects with the goal of achieving cost savings and efficiencies. 2. The Committees had primary responsibility for developing and managing Army standard designs. The Centers provided engineering and architectural consulting advice in connection with the development of Army standard designs but had very limited authority to alter specific designs and other technical information. 3. The Centers reviewed all proposed MILCON projects to identify those projects that would be based in part on standard designs. 4. The Centers collaborated with the Army during the design and construction of buildings and facilities, with a focus on reducing project cost and schedules. 5. The AFSP Committee, which is the main governance body that oversees the Centers, approved the standard designs the Centers developed, with the exception of standard designs for the four types of facilities that the Board manages. The AFSP Committee is chaired by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. 138 See Appendix III. Page 24 GAO-19-281 3. We identified the types of information maintained by the Centers on Army standard designs for review, approval, change control, and monitoring as well as the steps used by the Centers to develop those types of information. 4. We summarized the main Centers\u2019 staffing, cost, and performance information for review. 5. We summarized our evaluation of the key management risks we identified with respect to each of the nine Centers. Table 3 provides a summary of the information contained in this appendix.\nTo better understand the Centers\u2019 activities and operations, we examined the AFSP\u2019s strategic plan and various data to identify the key AFSP program objectives as well as the related metrics and the types of actions undertaken to meet these program objectives. In addition, we examined various data maintained by the Centers to obtain an overview of the Centers\u2019 information management, including information on the standard designs. We also interviewed Center staff and managers on these matters, among other things. For each Center, including the Board for standard designs for four facility types, we summarized and discussed the relevant information we identified.\nA. AFSP Strategic Plan Objectives and Related Metrics (Army-Specific Objectives) The AFSP program aims to use standard designs, best practices, and lessons learned in construction and facilities to guide future Army construction projects to achieve facility design and construction cost savings and better support the Army\u2019s mission. This includes the development, use, and management of standard designs to achieve cost savings over current construction methods. The 2014 AFSP strategic plan has as its goal one standard design for 900 of 900 facilities and has four objectives to reach that goal. Table 1 identifies these objectives and the performance measures and targets associated with these objectives.\nAs shown in the table, these four performance measures are metrics used to monitor the achievement of the objectives outlined in the strategic plan. All objectives have performance measures that are aligned with the overall goals of achieving cost savings, efficiency, and better facility designs as well as supporting the Army\u2019s mission.

To fulfill this direction, NASA formally established the SLS launch vehicle program in 2011. Then, in 2012, NASA aligned the requirements for the Orion program with those of the newly created SLS vehicle and the associated ground systems programs. EXPERT TEXT: We found the program\u2019s current cost and schedule estimates are not fully supported and are out of date. NASA is about one year into a 5-year schedule, which provides little assurance that its estimates for remaining program activities are adequate. For example, the program currently estimates the Mobile Launcher is scheduled to be completed in 2020, but its cost estimates for 2017 and 2018 are based on a much earlier design for the Mobile Launcher. In addition, NASA\u2019s cost estimates for the SLS core stage, flight stage, and Exploration Systems Development program are based on work that was carried out 4 to 6 years ago and may not fully reflect the program\u2019s needs. Moreover, NASA is relying on its cost estimate methods to make decisions when other measures exist to manage costs. As an example, NASA did not use the cost estimate methods to analyze the contract value of the Exploration Systems Development program to establish its funding levels. The primary purpose of cost and schedule metrics is to ensure contractors are meeting their commitments. Increasingly, NASA uses cost and schedule metrics in a different manner\u2014as a tool to allocate resources. For example, NASA\u2019s program manager stated that he uses cost and schedule performance to negotiate contract changes with the contractor. A more effective use of cost estimate methods would be to identify cost and schedule growth areas, and then allow program officials to manage and mitigate these areas. NASA\u2019s current cost estimate methods provide little insight into the causes of the cost growth.\nSUMMARY-SCHED: NASA\u2019s current cost and schedule estimates are not fully supported and are out of date. EXPERT SUMMARY-SCHED: Expertise indicated that cost and schedule estimates were not fully supported and were out-of-date. Proceed to summarize the expert recommendation to address this. TEXT: According to expertise, NASA should evaluate each part of the SLS and Orion program to assess the most efficient and effective approach for cost reporting. For example, the current approach to reporting cost and schedule progress is to combine the core stage, the flight stage, and the EGS. According to expertise, because these systems are on different development schedules, the combined data does not fully present the status of each program. If NASA considers the SLS launch vehicle as one program and the Orion spacecraft as a completely separate spacecraft, both programs with different development schedules, the development of the SLS and Orion could be more effective. Therefore, the SLS launch vehicle program should be separated from the Orion program. NASA would then be able to estimate the cost of manufacturing the SLS and the individual components, as well as costs associated with manufacturing the unmanned exploration spacecraft; however, with respect to the cost of launching the spacecraft, expertise stated that NASA would be able to estimate only the costs associated with launching the crew vehicle.\nSUMMARY-BASIS: NASA's current cost and schedule estimates are not fully supported and are out of date. EXPERT SUMMARY-BASIS: To address the basis issues identified in Parts 2.2 and 2.3, it is necessary to analyze whether cost-based acquisition best supports the program and the agency's mission to safely increase and maintain access to space. According to expertise, the acquisition of SLS/Orion provides NASA with a significant opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cost-based acquisition procurement model. Proceed to summarize the expert recommendation to address the basic acquisition structure. TEXT: According to the expertise, because NASA awarded contracts to build SLS and Orion to companies without a proven track record of building space vehicles, NASA could have implemented a different acquisition structure than was used. For instance, it would have been more consistent with traditional space program contracting to base the contracts solely on the contractor's cost and to establish the specifications only after the contractors were selected and incentives were identified. The incentives of a cost-plus design, build-and-test fixed-price contract may have provided the benefits of an unmanned launch that may not be seen with an expendable rocket. In other words, expertise stated that NASA has the", "In 2017, nearly one in three Medicare Part D beneficiaries received an opioid prescription, and Medicare spending for prescription opioids was almost $3.4 billion annually. Medicare data for 2017 showed that the beneficiaries potentially at risk for opioid misuse and abuse were more likely to be under 65 years of age, female, and dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. For years, to limit Medicaid at- risk beneficiaries\u2019 access to controlled substances, state Medicaid programs have used lock-in programs, which restrict certain beneficiaries\u2019 access to a single prescriber (such as a physician or other health- care provider), a single pharmacy, or both. Medicaid lock-in programs have been associated with advantages including declines in inappropriate prescribing, decreases in abuse of controlled substances, and increased treatment options for beneficiaries. Research has identified an unintended consequence of the Medicaid lock-in programs; some individuals increased the amount of out-of-pocket payments they made for controlled substances, thus avoiding lock-in programs as data on these purchases are not collected by Medicaid. State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are state-run electronic databases that track the prescribing, dispensing, and purchasing of controlled substances by individuals, whether purchased out-of-pocket, through private insurance, or under insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Data are available to individuals or organizations as authorized under state law. As of February 2018, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico had operational PDMPs within their borders. Medicare DMPs perform case management to identify at-risk beneficiaries and attempt to mitigate risk by increasing communication and coordination across plan sponsors, health-care prescribers, pharmacists, and at- risk beneficiaries. CMS established a framework for plan sponsors that volunteer to establish Medicare DMPs. The CMS framework consists of two steps: 1) identifying potentially at-risk beneficiaries from plan sponsors\u2019 claims data and 2) using case management to identify actually at-risk beneficiaries and mitigate risk of misuse and abuse. Medicare claims data are used to determine which potentially at- risk beneficiaries are actually at risk. Plan sponsors\u2019 clinicians coordinate care of these beneficiaries. The purpose of this report is to present the 2017 Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Spending data by opioid overutilizers and to report on CMS\u2019s efforts to mitigate risk of misuse and abuse of opioid medications. Data sources: PDMP data are from a survey of PDMPs. PDMPs are the principal source of information for this report, because these programs produce and maintain data on controlled substances purchased by Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Additionally, PDMPs are the only source of data from which specific PDMP data can be examined by beneficiary, prescriber, and/or pharmacist, and CMS can use PDMP data for its DMP program. National Medicare claims data are from the CY 2017 Medicare Standard Analytical Files (SAF) that contain data on beneficiaries enrolled in Part D. PDMP data were provided by 48 of the 50 state PDMPs, and data from those four missing states were estimated using SAF data. CMS determined the average amount of opioids prescribed to dually eligible beneficiaries who appeared in the CY 2017 SAF files and whose Medicare Part D 3\npreferred drug was an opioid from national PDMP files. The final sample included about 49,490 Part D beneficiaries and 9,886 drugs dispensed. Study design: The SAF files contain data on enrollees and their usage of selected Part D prescription drug coverage. SAF data from CY 2017 were aggregated using a national weighting algorithm developed by CMS, based on data from the National Health Expenditure accounts. This national data source is the principal source of annual information comparing estimates of national expenditures for medical services. The data that are available from CY 2017 SAF are not identical to the Medicare prescription drug records (Part D PDE) data because the files differ in their scope and coverage. CMS produced Part", "The Air Force has expanded its vision for ABMS from a new aircraft to a family of systems to provide capabilities across all domains.  The Air Force\u2019s acquisition approach has evolved over time due to changes in its strategic priorities, such as developing a multidomain command and control family of systems to support JADC2 and responding to potential threats from China and Russia. These changes have resulted in increased acquisition-related costs and challenges, such as developing capabilities that have not yet been demonstrated. The Air Force\u2019s vision for ABMS continues to evolve based on information warfare priorities and changing technological capabilities.\nA1c_981347-243020-1586-3678:", "ED/OIG \u2022 AUDIT SERVICES \u2022 19 educational loan repayments for forgiveness, according to the analysis. Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid officials have publicly acknowledged the challenges with the PSLF program, including the length of time a borrower must be employed by a qualifying  organization, the difficulty some borrowers have with properly documenting their qualifying  public service employment, and the potential for confusion or misunderstanding among borrowers and others about the program. For example, we have noted that public service employees at public colleges and universities are employed in critical public services, but they are not eligible for forgiveness because these public service jobs do not qualify for forgiveness. Education officials agreed with that determination. For the temporary expanded process, the initial  borrower interest was so overwhelming that Education capped the number of borrower applications for temporary expanded process loan forgiveness at $300 million each for the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, and the $12 billion borrower cap is expected to be reached for fiscal year 2017. The temporary expanded process borrower interest has since waned, partially because of the $12 billion borrower cap and partially because the temporary expanded process is significantly more restrictive than the PSLF program. In fact, as of March 2019, 75 percent of the applications for temporary expanded process loan forgiveness were denied. In light of these challenges, we believe that borrowers with federal student loans should understand better how the program works, the types of employment opportunities that qualify for the  program, and the processes for applying for and receiving forgiveness. Borrowers with federal student loans should also more accurately know what steps can be taken to maximize the probability of receiving loan forgiveness through the program. For example,  PSLF recipients may have to make 120 loan payments instead of only 10 years due to the time the program was first available to borrowers and borrower eligibility  requirements. 3 We have reviewed and audited the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 17-01, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. The results of our audit and the opinions we express in this report are based on our consideration of the Department\u2019s financial statements as a whole. (This is in accordance with OMB Bulletin No. 17-01, section 233.) We conducted audits of a sample of the transactions in the Department\u2019s financial statements to determine whether the transactions were appropriately recorded. Based on our audits, we have not found any material weaknesses when determining our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination on the entities included in the Department\u2019s consolidated financial statements.

Gov- ernmentwide, agencies reported using their independent authorities to recycle or transfer more than 4,600 pieces of excess and 5.2 million square feet of unneeded buildings and improperly declared that 277,111 properties were in surplus for recycling and transfer and that 129,074 were in surplus and declared for use. The act also required an annual report for agencies\u2019 activities under GPRA. This report is the first of such reports that the Federal Real Property Working Group 7 (FRPWG), a collection of experts in the federal property community, reviewed. A review by the FRPWG of agency reports to the GAO provided the technical basis for this report. This report is a summary of our findings at the 30 largest federal government agencies as measured by fiscal year 2014 agency expenditures of operating appropriations as reported by the GAO, totaling $837.5 billion. The agencies\u2019 excess and surplus reports cover the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014. Accordingly, the agencies reported properties in the possession of or control by their field organizations; hence, the total number of properties, and properties in surplus, reported in this report is substantially less than the number of federal buildings and surplus in- surance program properties reported in the annual report to Congress. The agencies\u2019 reports are only summaries of the numbers of properties the agencies recycled, transferred, or discarded at the close of fiscal year 14; hence, some reported properties may be reported twice \u2013 first in the initial summary data and subsequently in details on the reported outcomes. Furthermore, since some agencies reported their numbers as total real property, and others reported by property type, we combined the data for an agency- wide summary. Where that was not possible due to the lack of consistency or where two or more agencies have merged, the data was not combined. The report does not contain a summary report on recycled and surplus real property reported by agencies in 2015. Recycled property: A number of the 30 agencies reported having recycled property in fiscal year 2014. Since the specific property numbers vary widely among the agencies, we provide summaries of the reported real property and square footage that was recycled. We did this by comparing property lists of various sizes reported by agencies. For this comparison, we used as an example the reported results for GSA\u2019s recycled properties, and we used the GSA list of recycled properties as it was reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for comparable reasons. We selected GSA\u2019s list as it was submitted to OMB, not for the properties as a final determination of what was recycled in fiscal year 2014. Although some of the agencies reported a list of less than 20 properties recycled and surplus, the reports of other agencies identified 240 distinct pieces of property that were recycled. As a result of our comparison, we chose to report the number of pieces of recycled property that matched the number of pieces that GSA reported to OMB for fiscal year 2014, even though only one of seven agencies we reviewed reported the number of pieces that GSA listed in its recycled surplus file with OMB. We used that as a baseline figure of 241 pieces of property recycled. The properties reported by our sources that matched those reported by GSA for recycling in its OMB file included 56 pieces of property in surplus and 185 pieces of property declared in surplus and recycled. Some agencies reported properties as recycled, and subsequently as surplus and/or declared for sale; hence they appeared twice in our reports. In our report, each property is given one line irrespective of the agencies where the property changes status. 8 As the source OMB reports only the aggregate totals of the properties declared for sale, we had to allocate all or some of the reported properties among the agencies to achieve that number (see summary of sold surplus and recycled properties). To be consistent with GSA\u2019s OMB file and the Federal Supply Schedule, we did not allocate the properties recycled and sold surplus to the Defense Department, the Department of Energy, or the Department of Veterans Affairs", "Although recent hiring progress is encouraging, the number of law enforcement officers hired is insufficient to fill all existing positions, and CBP does not currently have the necessary infrastructure and support systems to be able successfully staff all of its facilities. To address these continuing hiring challenges and staffing gaps at these facilities, we recommended that CBP ensure that infrastructure and support systems are in place to help the agency successfully hire staff for its border facilities.  HOW CAN WE MAKE HIRING A MORE EFFECTIVE PROCESS? CBP can hire additional officers faster by improving the processes that guide hiring and providing additional resources. For example, CBP has the authority to issue temporary appointments on an interim or indefinite basis for not to exceed 120 days in 12-month periods and to extend temporary appointments beyond 120 days in one-month increments. We provided additional information on our prior recommendations about how CBP can improve its staffing efforts in table 2 below. TABLE 2: OUR RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP BORDER PATROL IMPROVE ITS HIRING AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS In October 2018, we reported that, to help address its hiring delays, CBP had increased its hiring capacity and improved its efforts to recruit, retain, and relocate officers. Specifically, we highlighted the following: Increasing hiring capacity CBP has been hiring law enforcement officers and filling existing jobs faster than they have in recent years. Further, the number of applicants that applied but did not obtain jobs was lower during fiscal year 2017 than it was during any year from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016. However, CBP\u2019s hiring process, while improved, remains undercapacity. CBP estimates that at least 2,400 additional law enforcement officers are needed to meet mandated staffing levels, that the Border Patrol\u2019s backlog on applicant processing and processing of qualified applicants is greater than 28,000, and that the agency will need to hire at least 3,300 law enforcement officers annually through fiscal year 2021 in order to decrease the hiring backlog. According to CBP officials, because the Border Patrol has not been staffed to its approved levels for years, they do not have the appropriate support staff, such as case management offices, hiring offices, and a comprehensive applicant tracking system. Until CBP has sufficient support staffing, officials will not know which hiring locations have vacancies available or which hiring locations are not being filled. In addition, because many applicants withdraw from the hiring process when they learn it will take more than a year to get the job, CBP cannot fill all job vacancies. Also, in order to hire new recruits in a timely manner, CBP needs to be able to move staff into positions as they vacate or retire, but it continues to have significant challenges in doing so. As a result, CBP\u2019s ability to hire and train new officers remains constrained for the foreseeable future, which contributes to the delays in filling its positions. CREATING AN AGENT RECRUITMENT PLAN AND DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CBP developed an agent recruitment plan, although the plan did not outline actions to address specific capacity and staffing challenges or strategies to improve its applicant processing speed. In addition, CBP needs to fully develop a comprehensive technology solution to improve the timely processing of hiring applications and to address the challenges of an ineffective IT application that is incapable of accurately processing law enforcement officers\u2019 applications. The agency is still working to fully develop this recruiting and hiring process improvement effort\u2014an initiative known as the Hiring and Development (HALO) initiative\u2014and is not yet able to meet its mandated hiring capacity within the targeted period, which is why the HALO project is critical to CBP\u2019s ability to keep pace. CBP officials plan to have a fully functional system in 4 to 6 years. We reported that in a series of audit reports from fiscal years 2014.1 to 2016, when we reviewed hiring, CBP lacked basic human resources (HR) information on its law enforcement officers, such as the job positions and types of work these officers did or", "For many veterans, long-term care is provided directly or purchased by VA. VA provides or pays for long-term care for eligible veterans enrolled in VA\u2019s health care through a variety of programs, including institutional-based care like nursing homes and non-institutional programs like home health care, which provides care to veterans in their own homes. VA provides or pays for long-term care through a range of three institutional and 11 non-institutional programs. Institutional programs, such as nursing homes, typically provide more acute skilled nursing care in an institutional facility; non-institutional programs, such as the Home-Based Primary Care program, provide care to veterans in their homes or communities. Fig. 1 provides a list of VA\u2019s institutional and non-institutional long-term careprograms and Appendix I provides brief descriptions of these programs. VA provides or pays for veterans long-term care in three institutional programs that provide skilled nursing care, such as for rehabilitation after surgery or for health issues and disabilities that require 24-hour care in an institutional facility. These three programs include: VA Community Living Centers (VACLC) (VACLC, under the control of VA, owned and operated by VA), Community Nursing Homes (non-VA owned and operated under contract with VA), and State Veterans Homes (state- owned and operated homes approved and supported by VA). VA nursing home programs are also part of VA\u2019s system of acute care hospitals that provide inpatient, rehabilitative, and medical services. Many veterans receive long-term care in VA medical centers where specially trained individuals and teams work to identify the care and services needed by veterans. Because medical centers are central to VA\u2019s health care infrastructure, they are likely to serve some of the program\u2019s most demanding patients, including those with the most severe and complex needs, and are able to provide a full range of services through a combination of programs and outpatient services. To meet these additional needs, VA must provide home-based long-term care services to meet the growing number of veterans who need both medical and long-term care. Most veterans enrolled in VA\u2019s health care live outside of medical centers, and VA generally contracts with community-based providers for the provision of nursing home care. These contracts generally provide for the operation and maintenance of nursing homes, and VA may also support construction or renovations. VA contracts with more than 140 private, not-for-profit nursing home (NH) programs and pays a fixed price for residential care in them. Nursing home care accounts for more than 40 percent of the VA\u2019s long-term care budget. VACLCs are the only VA-owned and -operated facilities within VA. VACLCs are highly specialized, with more than 85,000 admissions in fiscal year 2014; each served an average of 20 to 25 veterans per day with varying levels of disability. In a typical year, VA served hundreds of thousands of veterans in these programs with varying degrees of disability. VA has 133 VACLCs located all across the U.S. at its large medical centers (See Appendix II. Table 1 for a listing of VACLCs). These centers are located where they can readily serve large areas and where they can be integrated into medical centers that offer inpatient, outpatient, and rehabilitation services. Nursing home services are provided at VA\u2019s largest medical centers and are generally provided through contracts with non-VA entities, including not-forprofit organizations, private for-profit corporations, state and local governments, Hospice Home Health Care agencies, and Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded. Veterans must meet certain conditions to be eligible to receive home health care, such as requiring medical care and nursing care; being homebound, meaning that they are generally unable to leave their home except for infrequent, short (e.g., to attend church) non-medical purposes and cannot leave home without assistance from another person or medical equipment; and, in many cases, a requirement for skilled care from medical professionals. Nursing home care is available to many eligible veterans through contracts with not-for-profit long- term care facilities. (Nearly all", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text.", "3 billion grant awarded by HHS under the Federal Tort Claims Act to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington meets this statutory requirement, we determined that HHS did not adequately assess that grant. In addition, our analysis indicated that the pilot fully met the requirement for the pilot to cover a mix of federal award recipients for which awards include funds appropriated for specific programs in appropriations acts. The pilot also partially met the statutory requirement that OMB establish a set of best practices as guidance for federal awarding agencies. This requirement outlined best practices for agencies to consider in minimizing burden and increasing the effectiveness of federal reporting. However, according to OMB staff, agencies do not currently consider this report in developing new best practices because of the ongoing pilot. The Section 5 Pilot also did not fully meet the requirement for OMB to issue recommendations for legislative or regulatory action in the August 2017 report to congressional committees. However, OFFM did include recommendations for potential legislative or regulatory reforms in their internal working draft which is summarized in figure 1. In addition, while the Section 5 Pilot partially met the requirement for OMB to conduct and summarize the results of an evaluation of opportunities to automate and streamline aspects of federal financial reporting to reduce reporting burden for recipients, we found that the process could have been strengthened. For example, OMB should have documented more clearly its decisions to deviate from leading practices regarding pilot design and implementation. In addition, we identified opportunities to strengthen OMB\u2019s implementation of certain requirements related to diversity in the selection process for pilot participants. In light of this report, we made 10 recommendations to the Secretary of HHS that included an opportunity to improve the results provided by the pilot reporting platform, guidance, and other related activities. HHS generally agreed with our recommendations and agreed to implement corrective actions to address identified concerns. We will consider the resolution of the recommendations during monitoring and assessment of HHS\u2019s implementation of the DATA Act.", "I. Efforts to Educate Staff (Reviewing Period Covered: January 2018\u2013October 2018) 75 FE and NIST identified several measures they are taking to educate and communicate their scientific integrity policies to staff, including the use of departmentwide bulletin articles and training on ethics and scientific integrity for staff at various levels in the department.  The Department of Energy (DOE) oversees FE, its largest laboratory, which has more than 4,400 employees at nine sites in six states and overseas. NIST\u2019s staff of 3,900 supports its missions of measurement standards and technology, technology services to industry and government, and nanotechnology.  II. Designation of Scientific Integrity Official (SIO) and Coordination System (Reviewing Period Covered: January 2018\u2013October 2018) 76 Five of the nine selected agencies reported having designated an SIO and reported efforts to coordinate scientific integrity activities (EPA and FE were not covered in our review of implementation of these policies).  At the time of our review, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) had designated 70 the NPS SIO. The report on department-wide research activities, which the DOI issued in October 2016, included a scientific integrity policy, and the DOI published a policy on scientific integrity for the USGS in April 2017. However, while we reported that NPS implemented its policy during the review period, the agency did not designate a scientific integrity official until our review.  USGS officials reported that USGS\u2019s Chief Scientist serves as USGS\u2019s SIO. An SIO is necessary to carry out the implementation of a scientific integrity policy across an agency. According to agency officials, in August 2018, the USGS Chief Scientist designated a USGS National Coordinator for Scientific Integrity. The National Coordinator is charged with coordinating and implementing scientific integrity policies and initiatives at the regional level, across disciplines. We judged that the agencies\u2019 efforts to designate a qualified SIO to oversee implementation of their scientific integrity policies were not yet adequately established.  USGS officials explained that one of the agency\u2019s challenges is that some USGS personnel do not report directly to the department\u2019s Chief Scientist. Officials reported that this is especially a challenge in regional offices, where a staff member may report to a regional director but, in some cases, his or her research is funded by the department. As a result, while the policy defines the responsibilities of the SIO, USGS officials explained that they had not been able to designate a specific staff member as the SIO. USGS officials said that the USGS National Coordinator for Scientific Integrity in August 2018 designated a USGS liaison in each of the regions, which report to the coordinator. These designated USGS liaisons were appointed on an annual basis and are expected to act as point-persons in the regions to foster collaboration and coordination in scientific integrity across their regions. However, until the Coordinator establishes the responsibilities of a USGS liaison, we judged that USGS\u2019s designation of a qualified SIO responsible for implementation of a scientific integrity policy was not adequately established.  III. In-Person Training (Reviewing Period Covered: January 2018\u2013October 2018) 77 USGS officials reported that all USGS staff who are new to USGS receive training on its scientific integrity policy during their orientation. In addition, existing USGS science staff receive in-person training and those returning from temporary assignments outside the department receive training. Agencies also reported additional efforts to educate staff about scientific integrity policies through bulletins, meetings, seminars, workshops, and webinars. Three agencies\u2014EPA, NASA, and NPS\u2014had not posted any policies or guidelines to educate staff about agency scientific integrity policies. We concluded that DOE, DOI, EPA, FE, IHS, NASA, NOAA, and USGS have made some progress in providing training for staff, but their efforts to do so were not well established.  IV. Publications (Reviewing Period Covered: January 2018\u2013October 2018) 78 USGS has published two reports titled \u201cScientific Integrity at the U.S. Geological Survey\u201d to share examples of scientific integrity practices at USGS. The documents discuss, for example, the process of developing and adopting", "USAID has made progress implementing its reforms and has incorporated many activities in its reform strategy to address OMB\u2019s seven keys practices. However, OMB and USAID agreed that additional reforms are needed to achieve maximum benefits from the Agency\u2019s new authorities.\nTable 3: Practices Used in USAID\u2019s Reform Efforts Source: USAID TOR Aggregate Reform Strategy, November 2, 2017, and USAID, July 2019.\nUSAID\u2019s transformation agenda has evolved substantially since its inception in July 2017. In developing the initial stages of the transformation plan, USAID determined that the reforms needed in order to achieve its mission were driven by a comprehensive assessment of the Agency\u2019s organizational structure and its business processes. USAID focused particularly on eliminating the barriers and duplication within the Agency to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its foreign aid programs and policies. In February 2018, USAID submitted to OMB the initial versions of its six transformation projects that were associated with its implementation of USAID\u2019s three mission goals (global health security; U.S. leadership and influence; and poverty and development). The six transformation projects were  (1) the design and implementation of organizational changes; (2) enterprise performance management; (3) the implementation of the Agency\u2019s transformation strategy plan; (4) USAID\u2019s technology strategy; (5) business process transformation; and (6) redesign of USAID\u2019s organizational structure. The USAID Transformation Task Team (T3), in the second and third phases of the Agency\u2019s transformation agenda, further identified 27 specific tasks needed in order to implement the Agency\u2019s initial 6 transformation projects. The second phase, which concluded in July 2018, was focused on developing the details of each of the 27 tasks. The third phase, which began in October 2018, focused on implementing the 27 transformation task components. The 27 transformation tasks fall into one of the Agency\u2019s six transformation projects, and were defined as part of the implementation of one of the transformation projects. In addition, our analysis of the seven key practices that the Agency used in its reforms showed that USAID\u2019s transformation efforts fully addressed one key practice (collaboration), partially addressed two others (collaboration and technology and human resource strategies), and not at all addressed two key practices (funding reform and improving the environment within agency).", "This is a performance audit by the DHS Office of Inspector General. The objective of this audit was to evaluate the implementation of DHS\u2019s Alternative Procedures for funding of debris removal under the Public Assistance (PA) program. Specifically, this review evaluated: (1) the extent to which DHS and FEMA have provided guidance to states on the implementation and application of the alternative procedures; (2) the extent to which FEMA reviewed Puerto Rico\u2019s implementation of the alternative procedures; and (3) the basis upon which FEMA decided to end the alternative procedures early. Our review identified some challenges or issues associated with implementing the alternative procedures, which FEMA and Puerto Rico need to address. Specifically, our review identified five issues to monitor: 1. the alternative reimbursement method and the potential reduction in costs; 2. debris clearance; 3. Puerto Rico\u2019s eligibility under the Public Assistance alternative procedures; 4. Puerto Rico\u2019s ability to provide the federal government a reasonable assurance of full and prompt reimbursement under the alternative procedures; and 5. Puerto Rico\u2019s ability to verify work completion with a less than usual amount of oversight and documentation by FEMA during project implementation. In addition to these five issues, we identified four areas as opportunities for improvement. Our recommendation to the State of Puerto Rico and DHS is intended to further facilitate debris removal and assist debris removal contractors to achieve compliance with the Public Assistance program\u2019s eligibility requirements.   As explained in the attached briefing sheet, the objective of this performance audit was to determine if the Federal Emergency Management Agency has effectively monitored the implementation of the alternative procedures, and if improvements can be made going forward to ensure that debris removal can be completed in a reasonable timeframe. FEMA\u2019s Alternative Procedures for funding of work under the Public Assistance Program were implemented in Puerto Rico to expedite debris removal following Hurricane Maria. Based on an initial analysis of alternative procedure program expenditures, FEMA concluded that it was paying contractors more than the actual costs incurred for debris removal. Therefore, beginning October 10, 2018, FEMA modified the alternative procedure reimbursement method. During our review, we made two site visits to Puerto Rico to observe debris removal, observe the administration of the alternative procedures, and interview FEMA and Puerto Rico employees regarding the implementation of the alternative procedures for debris removal. Although we observed a lack of documentation to support the contractor invoices we received, we could not definitively conclude that this lack of documentation had a direct impact on the Puerto Rico debris clearance effort. We could not quantify the impact in terms of dollar values. However, because debris removal is dependent on contractor invoices that were determined to be inadequately supported or lacking documentation, we cannot be certain that all damaged trees have been removed. Therefore, we believe there is a reduced level of confidence that debris clearance is complete. Also, we could not determine, with absolute certainty, that Puerto Rico was effectively implementing the alternative procedures, although we determined that FEMA was effectively monitoring Puerto Rico\u2019s use of alternative procedures in accordance with the Federal Government and FEMA\u2019s contracts with Puerto Rico. Based on our analysis of the data and conversations with Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of State\u2019s Secretary\u2019s Office, the level of confidence Puerto Rico has about the cost to remove a ton of debris is significantly less effective than it was under the standard procedures. The debris reduction per ton under the alternative procedures represents only a savings of $83 per ton compared to $107 per ton in the standard procedure when the debris tons had an assigned value of $2,000. This is a significant reduction of confidence for both methods of reimbursement and could negatively impact Puerto Rico\u2019s reimbursement of debris removal costs. As you may be aware, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in a March 2019 report that the reimbursement method used by FEMA in Puerto Rico did not fully capture all eligible costs or reduce contractor fraud for debris removal. FEMA agreed with GAO that it would implement a modification to its claim settlement process in Puerto Rico that would review costs associated with damage to eligible public structures (i.e. facilities used by the public). GAO recommended that this review should be performed at the same time that FEMA verifies final total project costs. Going forward, we have found no issues in FEMA verifying total public structure damage eligibility, but FEMA has made changes to the", "The National Defense Strategy is DOD\u2019s primary strategy document, providing a foundation for all other strategic guidance in the department. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017required DOD to develop a national defense strategy and update it at least once every 4 years and, during the years without an update, to assess the implementation of the strategy and whether any revision is necessary. The National Defense Strategy replaces the Quadrennial Defense Review, which the Armed Services Committees concluded had become too slow and ineffective to provide relevant strategic direction to the department. For each new strategy, DOD is required to identify, among other things: DOD\u2019s strategic priority missions; the force structure, readiness, posture, and capabilities needed to support the strategy; and major investments required by the strategy. A separate provision in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 also included several provisions related to these matters.\nThe National Defense Strategy falls under the President\u2019s National Security Strategy, which outlines the overarching security strategy for the federal government. The National Defense Strategy is above the National Military Strategy, which provides more detailed military direction. DOD guidance states that the NMS is intended to provide a common starting point for identifying the ways to achieve the strategy, which is intended to establish the direction and priorities for how the department will organize, train, equip, and maintain forces to ensure that its forces can execute the military dimensions of U.S. national security strategy. A common starting point is important because DOD must prepare forces to meet multiple and diverse requirements. The need to prepare for multiple and diverse contingencies demands a planning process that defines a range of military options in advance and provides the guidance that will enable the full spectrum of military capability, across active and reserve forces, to respond to any military contingency. Figure 1 provides a graphical view of these documents and some of their key features. Table 1 provides a summary of organizations with key roles and responsibilities for providing analytic support to senior leaders in making force structure decisions to support the NDS. Our objective in this review was to examine the extent to which DOD has developed requirements for the national defense strategy in accordance with DOD guidance.", "The U.S. airline industry generally faces challenges in dealing with IT outages. This is especially true for outages affecting multiple airline travelers. It can be extremely difficult to quickly resolve these types of outages for airlines and passengers alike. While airline computer systems generally work well, there are numerous examples of system glitches leading to delays, including major system issues affecting a large number of passengers. The FAA established a national Air Traffic Control System Command Center to support coordination related to system-wide outages impacting both airlines and Air Traffic Control. The FAA coordinates with the airlines and Air Traffic Control in the event of large-scale IT system outages, according to an FAA representative. We reported earlier this year that airlines and the FAA are collaborating on system monitoring services to facilitate greater proactive identification of system failures.", "Federal trust funds are an accounting mechanism used to link dedicated collections with their expenditure for a specified purpose or program, much as in accounts of a private corporation. Trust funds may retain accumulated balances of collections that exceed their cash needs. Earmarked budget authority is limited to the total amount specified as dedicated revenue receipts. The federal budget usually designates several trust funds and other dedicated funds. 1. Non-revolving trust funds. The Federal Hospital Insurance Fund (HI) is credited with non- revolving receipts (FY 2008 - $97 billion) from premiums paid by employers and employees and is replenished as these payments are made. HI reimbursements to Medicare providers amount to about 90 percent of the total incurred. Accumulated HI fund balances are often used to finance the Medicare HI program, which provides insurance benefits to enrolled beneficiaries. 2. Special funds. The Universal Service Fund (USF) is credited with special receipts (FY 2008 - $5.4 billion) from annual subscriber fees, surcharges, and taxes on telecommunications carriers that support the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s subsidy programs for telephone service in high-cost service areas, Lifeline Telephone Assistance service to eligible consumers, and the Telecommunication Relay Service for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities. 3. Revolving funds. The U.S. Postal Fund (FY 2008 - $11.9 billion) includes revenue from sales of postal service, including postage, and transfers from the Postal Service\u2019s revolving fund. In addition, it receives postal-related transfers to the fund from annual appropriations as Congress makes them. Any accrued fund balance is reinvested in the Postal Service. 4. Public enterprise funds. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) (FY 2008 - $10.8 billion) includes revenue from airport-related aviation taxes and fees and user taxes and fees and aviation-related taxes imposed by foreign governments. Accumulated fund balances are reinvested in trust fund activities, if needed, or added to the federal deficit, if excess. 47 GAO-06-808 Accounting for Trust Fund Assets and Liabilities Statement of net position.

Most seniors are in good physical health during this part of their life, which is why they are often offered more conservative treatment choices in addition to a lot of other options. These treatments include:\nOver-the-counter medication for colds and pains such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen.\nPrescription drugs such as hypertension drugs and oral diabetes drugs.\nDietary changes such as reducing sugar or sodium intake.\nOpiates for short-term pain relief, depending on the doctor\u2019s treatment plan.\nMedicare Part b drugs to help patients recover their life and maintain a healthy diet such as cholesterol-lowering drugs.\nThis part will explain some of the risks associated with seniors\u2019 care and help you understand when to decide between seniors\u2019 care or medical care and choose the most suitable for you. A senior should be the best judge of his or her own care as well as the best judge of what the doctors and the care team should be offering as far as treatments.\nIt\u2019s a proven fact that a care plan is the most effective method of treatment delivery. A good plan should follow the patient\u2019s health, the family\u2019s health, and other necessary care that is required of the patient. This is what keeps the care team and the patient on the same page.\nHere are a few tips concerning senior care planning:\nKeep everything consistent with all of the doctors included.\nKeep the doctor up-to-date on everything that they feel is the correct treatment so that the doctor can ensure that proper medications and treatment plans will be available.\nEnsure that everyone on the care team is on the same page with treatment and care.\nAsk the doctors and the care team where they are taking the patient or you in case something needs to be changed in the future.\nWhen it comes to choosing health care providers and their treatment plans, keep all doctors informed about your loved one\u2019s health. This helps to minimize any confusion. It can be challenging at times, but keeping the lines of communication open is very effective.\nBeing involved in senior care planning is easier than ever before. More and more seniors\u2019 care providers are using websites as a means to communicate effectively with everyone. With more tools at your disposal to communicate with the seniors\u2019 care team, seniors have more control over what is being done to manage their care and health.\nSenior care is an essential part of keeping seniors healthy and well. If you believe that your senior is going through depression, then it is important to reach out to a professional for assistance.\nIf you are planning to get health insurance, then you must read the terms and coverage provided by the plan. To get a plan that covers almost all the treatment required with little or no out-of-pocket expense from you then you must read the information provided in the plan\u2019s details. This is because it is easy to be attracted by the lower premium when you should be basing your decision on coverage and premium.\nSome of the plans include only a limited subset of providers and do not cover treatment that is offered by the other providers. Some of the plans only cover the cost at the in-patient facilities, and thus", "The objective of the report is to determine how effective the Transportation, Accounting and Settlement-of-International-Claims Act is. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe a special procedure for claims by foreign countries for the costs of transporting and storing articles and materials and for transporting and storing articles and materials under the jurisdiction of a federal agency. We interviewed relevant officials at the State Department and GSA. We also contacted some transportation companies that have experience in handling claims through the Act. Overall, the officials we interviewed were familiar with the Act and believed that the Act is effective in reimbursing the federal government for certain of the costs associated with transporting, storing, or disposing of articles and materials under the jurisdiction of a federal agency. However, the Act\u2019s procedures for claim preparation can be time-consuming and burdensome for officials who are responsible for claims processing. Additionally, it sometimes takes a long time for the federal government to receive claims when the federal agency and the federal agency\u2019s contractor make separate claims for the same article or material. Finally, we found that the federal agency\u2019s contractor\u2019s claims for freight charges are not always included with the federal agency\u2019s claims. We conclude that the Act is effective for handling claims for costs associated with articles or materials being handled by a federal agency.\nIssues in the Office of the Judiciary\nInspector General's Report and Recommendation, IG-96-44 (1996) In response to issues in the court, the Inspector General prepared this interim report.\nDepartment of Justice Inspection and Review in the Inspector General's Annual Reports\nIssues Identified Within the U.S. Marshals Service, This is GAO Report GAO/OGC-94-94 (1995) The Marshals Service has provided the resources and personnel necessary for achieving the Inspector General\u2019s recommendations.

Executive Order (E.O.s) direct agency chiefs and other officials to make it a priority to hire more workers with disabilities. In January 2017, OPM published final regulations, amended in January 2018, to execute the orders. We looked at the order\u2019s implementation since 2001 and its current status. We determined that EEOC\u2019s policies have been effective, but that EEOC had not fully addressed some challenges, and neither OPM nor Labor had made progress in improving the employment of persons with disabilities. To address challenges in OPM\u2019s policies and practices for monitoring agency compliance and promoting agency efforts, OPM should identify a single leader to oversee all agencies\u2019 affirmative action plans to hire individuals with disabilities. OPM should also develop a system for tracking agency progress toward the disabled hiring goals in their affirmative action plans, and establish a mechanism for identifying key barriers facing agencies. To enhance its efforts, OPM should (1) further leverage its existing tools and processes designed to support agencies\u2019 efforts to hire more individuals with disabilities and (2) provide agencies with information and technical assistance regarding disability-related provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To enhance its support of agencies\u2019 ability to hire and retain employees with disabilities, Labor should complete the online disability training tool for managers.

The process, known as a reverse auction, is a process in which each participating contract inspector bids the lowest price he or she is willing to charge to perform an inspection. The contract with the lowest bid is then awarded to the contract inspector, who then schedules and performs the property inspection. For the period July 2012 through June 2013, we reviewed data collected from a sample of 140,352 multifamily and public housing inspections conducted by 497 contractors. Based on these data, we found no systemic misconduct by contract inspectors, such as favoritism, fraud, and bribery. However, we found that 71 of the inspection contracts we reviewed (14 percent) did not comply with the award requirements for the reverse auction process. For 54 of the contacts (12 percent of inspections), the required certification was missing entirely, and for 17 of the inspections, the required certification was not completed or not obtained from the actual contract inspector (we found a similar pattern of weaknesses in the quality assurance process for multifamily and public housing inspections).", "While DOD included its organizational strategy in its October 2019 report, its implementation plan should include more specific steps, and the department cannot make the decision to include these steps contingent on whether the new administration takes ownership of the strategy. SUMMARIZED: As we reported in August 2019, OCMO developed and presented to the Secretary of Defense an organizational strategy to restructure the Office of the Secretary of Defense consistent with the requirements of section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 2). However, the strategy was incomplete, as OCMO only provided for the creation of cross-functional teams for eight of the 10 areas of responsibility designated as critical objectives. Since we reported this incomplete organizational strategy and as required by section 911, DOD presented a more comprehensive organizational strategy in its report to the Congress in October 2019 (see table 2). We have determined that DOD has taken several actions to complete and finalize the strategy, including: \u2022 Approved the strategy, \u2022 Developed an implementation plan consistent with the strategy, \u2022 Conducted several training sessions for senior officials of the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide an overview of the strategy and its implementation, and \u2022 Developed a strategy for incorporating the strategy into the daily operating cycle of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Proceed to summarize the following text.\nTEXT: Sanctions provide a range of tools that Congress and the President may use to seek to alter or deter the behavior of a foreign government, individual, or entity in furtherance of U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives. For example, sanctions may be used in response to human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, or occupation of a foreign country; ultimately seeking to change the behavior of those perpetrating these offenses.\nSanctions may include actions such as limiting trade; blocking assets and interest in assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction; limiting access to the U.S. financial system, including limiting or prohibiting transactions involving U.S. individuals and businesses; restricting private and government loans, investments, insurance, and underwriting; and denying foreign assistance and government procurement contracts.\nSanctions can be comprehensive or targeted. Comprehensive sanctions. Generally, comprehensive sanctions include broad-based trade restrictions and prohibit commercial activity with an entire country.\nExamples of comprehensive sanctions include U.S. sanctions against Iran and Cuba. Targeted sanctions. Targeted sanctions restrict transactions of and with specific persons or entities.\nFor example, the U.S. sanctions program related to Somalia targets persons engaging in acts threatening the\npeace, security, or stability of Somalia, as well as for acting for or on behalf of, or facilitating a terrorist organization, regardless of place of\nresidence or location at the time of the offense. There are currently 20 country-based or country-related US.\nsanctions programs, according to lists of sanctions programs published by Treasury and State. The sanctions may\ntarget the governments of these countries or individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers,\ndesignated under these sanctions programs that are not country-specific.\nTreasury, State, and Commerce, as well as various other U.S. agencies, play roles in implementing sanctions.\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is part of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence\n(TFI), has primary responsibility for Treasury\u2019s sanctions implementation.\nAs part of its implementation of sanctions, OFAC has issued a general license to allow nongovernmental organizations to\nengage in not-for-profit activities in furtherance of U.S. policy interests in countries subject to certain U.S. sanctions. These\nsanctions include a 50 percent U.S. shareholder limitation for a transaction to be exempt from certain U.S.\ntreaty-related obligations involving the exportation of goods or the provision of services to those covered countries.\nOFAC issues general licenses\u2014authorizations\nthat generally allow all U.S. persons to engage in\nprohibited transactions or to undertake prohibited\nactivities subject to certain conditions and restrictions.\nIn addition to the nongovernmental organization general license, OFAC issued a waiver to allow U.S. persons to engage in specified activities involving Cuba as an example of the implementation of sanctions.\nOFAC may also issue special licenses to authorize\ncommercial transactions for the benefit of a\nspecific U.S. person that could not be authorized by\na general license. In general, these licenses are\nlimited to specific countries and prohibited activities,\nincluding but not limited to activities in connection\nwith persons or groups associated with terrorists.\nA general license is an authorization that applies to\nall U.S. persons, whereas a specific license is\ngranted to a specific party, often for a specific\nactivity or event. OFAC may additionally authorize,\nfor specific periods and limited purposes, an activity\nthat would otherwise be prohibited. This activity\ncould include the exportation of products or provision\nof services to a specified country. Specifically, OFAC\nmay authorize persons (U.S. or non-U.S.) to engage\nin transactions that might otherwise be prohibited.\nThese licenses are referred to as general licenses. In addition, the President or his representatives may authorize transactions that are otherwise prohibited, including but not limited to exports of certain items to Cuba.\nOFAC\u2019s general and specific licenses are often accompanied by a Statement of Licensing Policy (SLP). SLPs provide\ninterpretation of licenses. For example, OFAC\u2019s SLP regarding Sudan explains activities that may not involve Sudan, including but", "The CERT and PERM contractors\u2019 estimates for fiscal year 2017 are similar to the estimates for fiscal year 2016. Medicare\u2019s national estimate of improper payments is estimated to be reduced slightly to 11.4 percent, from 11.6 percent. This estimate is statistically valid, and the change from the prior fiscal year\u2019s estimate is not considered \u201cmaterial,\u201d as defined by OMB. Medicaid\u2019s national estimate of improper payments is estimated to be 4.9 percent, unchanged from prior estimates since 2014. CMS contractors have found statistically significant decreases in Medicaid improper payment rates since 2011, though these decreases have not been consistent among states. While the contractors\u2019 estimates are not statistically valid for fiscal year 2017, the decreases in the improper payment rates were consistent with those found in fiscal year 2016, and therefore are expected to continue with the PERM and CERT contractors as they review medical records for fiscal year 2018. These decreases indicate continued improvements in Medicaid program integrity.\nIMPROPER PAYMENTS ACROSS BOTH PROGRAMS CONTINUED: As discussed in the CY 2019 Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)/Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) final rule with comment period (83 FR 47669-72), CMS used a series of regression analyses at the state level to determine what specific factors are associated with decreased estimates of improper payments for Medicaid DMEPOS services. These analyses will inform CMS\u2019s work to reduce improper payments for DMEPOS services nationally, particularly improper payments that result from insufficient documentation.\nRECOMMENDATION: CMS should ensure that improper payment rates are calculated using a statistically valid sample.\nMedicare improper payments estimated by CMS to be 11.4 percent for fiscal year 2017 were statistically valid, which means that the difference between the estimate and its confidence interval was not considered \u201cmaterial\u201d as defined by OMB. In other words, the estimate is sufficiently reliable to be used to represent the entire fiscal year. The estimate was statistically valid based on a series of statistical tests\u2014including the R-statistic and the p-value\u2014which CMS uses to estimate improper payments. The estimate is statistically valid for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. CMS\u2019s contractors found statistically significant decreases in Medicare improper payments for fiscal year 2017. This is consistent with improper payment rates found in audits of claims from fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017.\nDue to these decreases, the improvement in improper payment estimate rates was considered by CMS as evidence of effective program management and oversight and is likely to continue in fiscal year 2018 due to the current sampling methodology. Additionally, OIG has completed statistical and program integrity evaluations of the CERT and PERM contractors\u2019 audit sampling methodology. OIG concurred with the CERT and PERM contractors\u2019 risk-based sampling methodology and concluded that it produced appropriate estimates of improper payment for both Medicare and Medicaid. These improvements and findings are evidence of effective program management and oversight. CMS has ensured an improved data governance process to oversee contractors and program integrity as well as improved program integrity reviews.\nHHS acknowledges OMB\u2019s direction to agencies to use statistical valid methods for calculating improper payment rates. HHS and CMS are committed to ensuring that improper payment rates are calculated using statistically valid samples. We acknowledge that OIG\u2019s report found concerns with the CERT and PERM contractors\u2019 past auditing methodology, and we share OIG\u2019s recommendations to ensure that estimates are statistically valid. We are committed to ensuring appropriate program integrity across Medicare and Medicaid. We have ensured an improved data governance process to oversee contractors, and we have improved review of contractor program integrity.\nCMS has strengthened and modified its CERT and PERM contractors\u2019 audit sampling methodologies. Specifically, in 2017, to address OIG\u2019s concerns regarding the previous statistical validity methods employed by the contractors, CMS instructed its contractors to use the R-statistic, which is less susceptible to bias in", "Although the enforcement of federal immigration laws is a longstanding authority of the federal government, many immigration law experts consider the PEP to be a more aggressive enforcement approach with respect to the apprehension, processing, and removal of certain aliens. Procedural Changes to DHS Policies and Processes. ICE\u2019s Office of Policy (OP) issued a new policy memorandum to establish the procedures that will govern how ICE officials can exercise prosecutorial discretion when determining whether to place certain foreign nationals in removal proceedings. The new procedures are intended to implement the prosecutorial discretion guidance described above. The memorandum emphasized that ICE\u2019s civil immigration enforcement decisions will be based on individual cases and not categorical determinations, and will be made on a case-by-case basis. The memorandum will require that any ICE agent, officer, director, or investigator who is to exercise prosecutorial discretion must first check to see if the person for who discretion is being considered has committed a serious crime. ICE also is taking actions outside of the executive branch. During early May of 2018, ICE issued a legal threat to state and local governments regarding immigration enforcement. ICE issued a warning letter to officials in California, warning them in no uncertain terms that they could be prosecuted for obstructing federal immigration enforcement if they continued to issue sanctuary policy guidelines that prohibited California law enforcement from informing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about inmates\u2019 pending release dates and providing the inmates with documents that will help them with the transition, like temporary drivers\u2019 licenses. ICE issued the letters to the California Attorney General and some of California\u2019s county sheriffs. Those letters came days after ICE officers arrested nearly 200 people in California that had either convictions for criminal or immigration violations or who were facing state charges. ICE stated in the letter that it was issuing the warning because it was frustrated by California policies that officials claimed prevented cooperation with federal immigration authorities. REMARKS: Due to PEP, along with the legal threat to states and counties that defy federal immigration laws, ICE\u2019s agents and officers increased arrests during the remainder of May and in the beginning of June. There were more than 500 ICE arrests in San Diego county in the month of May, alone. ICE detention facility capacity reached a record 50,000, with more than 300,000 active warrants outstanding for potential removals.\nEXPERT TESTIMONY UTILIZED: During the past decade, Ms. Mendoza has conducted numerous internal investigations and developed and presented expert testimony in cases involving sexual and physical abuse, elder abuse, and child abuse.

OCSPP is also reviewing its risk management decisions based on IRIS assessments in recent years to identify how IRIS chemical assessments have been relied on and whether the program has met its objective of providing consistent chemical assessments for risk managers. In 2017, OCSPP received approximately $59 million funding to support its programs, including IRIS and the IRIS Program received $5 million, which is a 5 percent decrease from the previous year funding levels.\nThe OIG has conducted reviews of the effectiveness and efficiency of EPA\u2019s risk management decisions. Based in part on these reviews, in November 2017 the Deputy Administrator of OCSPP established a policy to improve environmental justice and health equity in EPA\u2019s environmental programs. This policy directs program offices and regions to use the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) recommendations when developing and implementing activities to help disadvantaged communities. In addition, OCSPP has established a Risk Communication Subcommittee to work with the policy program office and regions to integrate public health and risk communication strategies into OCSPP chemical programs. For the past three years, OIG has identified chemicals as one of its top priorities. In particular, its risk-based audit work has supported environmental justice and health equity through improved oversight and control of OCSPP activities. In addition, it has conducted reviews of OCSPP chemical programs, including its Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) implementation, as well as its reviews of Risk Communication Programs Efforts, Risk Management Plan for Integrated Risk Information System, and IRIS Risk-Based Prioritization Strategy.\nOCSPP, which oversees TSCA implementation and chemical oversight and control activities, provides technical and regulatory advice to several program and regional offices that have direct responsibility for chemicals under TSCA. For example, EPA Regional Superfund Program Managers work with the program office on cleaning up chemical contamination and managing chemical risks in the Superfund program. The program office also provides technical and regulatory advice to other EPA regional offices that have jurisdiction over chemicals. In addition, OCSPP oversees 14 program offices and eight of these program offices have some responsibility for regulating, oversight, or management of chemicals.", "IRA officials established working groups to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

Before the act\u2019s enactment in 1966, an individual seeking access to federal records faced the burden of establishing a \u201cneed to know\u201d before being granted the right to examine a federal record. The act shifted the burden of proof from the individual to a government agency and required the agency to provide proper justification when denying a request for access to a record. Any person, defined as broadly as to include attorneys filing on behalf of an individual, corporations, or organizations, can file a FOIA request. For example, an attorney can request labor-related workers\u2019 compensation files on behalf of his or her client, and a commercial requestor, such as a data broker who files a request on behalf of another person, may request a copy of a government contract. The act requires federal agencies to respond in 20 working days to a FOIA request, unless they receive an extension, or to make records available in an electronic format if they have been requested three or more times. Although the act generally prohibits fees for FOIA requests, it can charge search, reproduction, and review fees in some (but not all) instances. The nine FOIA exemptions restrict records of personal privacy, national security, trade secrets, law enforcement investigations, and inter/intraagency memos, as well as certain types of geologic, geophysical, or financial data. The FOIA statute has been amended a number of times. In 2007, the President issued an executive order under which the chief FOIA officer of each agency, designated by the agency head, was to ensure their agency\u2019s compliance with FOIA; the act was amended in 2016, including provisions that require agencies to develop single, online portals through which to request records. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), requests for DHS records received fiscal year (FY) 2018 totalled 10,377, a decrease of 19% from the previous fiscal year. This report compares the 10-year FY2008-FY2017 trends in DHS FOIA requests, including the number of requests and pages processed, the number and types of exemptions used, and the most common requests. The report also provides the distribution of requests under certain types of FOIA exemptions (Exemption 3, 5, and 6 \u2014 see textbox below). The department also publishes an annual FOIA report containing an agency-wide summary of the requests, along with more detailed, subject/series specific information. Pages processed is the statistic that is most relevant to determining an agency\u2019s progress in responding to FOIA requests in a timely manner. Pages processed is the total number of pages in the records that are responsive to a FOIA request and that are either withheld in full or released or withheld in part but released in any case to the extent the release is permitted by law.", "DOD uses military and commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) to meet its global communications requirements.

The DTS Regulations also direct that travelers, upon signing and certifying a travel document, personally attest that they have complied with all of the applicable travel regulations and policies. The DODIG reported that the DTS Regulations, as revised January 1, 2016, were not properly communicated to DTS users. Specifically, the DODIG reported that 33 percent of the authorizing officials, 46 percent of the certifying officers, and 69 percent of the travelers interviewed had never received the DTS Regulations, although they were officially published in revised form in 2016, and none of 32 reviewers of the DTS Regulations, including the DODIG, found the most current published version in the DTS user account. In addition, according to the DODIG, the revised DTS Regulations were not widely accessible, since they were contained only on a DTS server and not in hard-copy format, and had no link on the DTS website. Finally, the DODIG found that the DTS Regulations were not uniformly applied by the certifying officer and traveler population.

The Coast Guard\u2019s shore operations asset line, for example, is organized into five product lines and 13 asset types, known as asset lines. For example, within its shore operations asset line, the Coast Guard maintains over 200 stations along U.S. coasts and inland waterways to carry out its search and rescue operations, among other missions. Much of the Coast Guard\u2019s infrastructure is vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather and can be costly to repair or replace after major storms. From December 2005 through June 2019, the Coast Guard received about $2 billion in supplemental appropriation funds to, among other things, rebuild or relocate 15 facilities damaged by hurricanes. After Hurricane Ike in 2008, for example, the Coast Guard relocated a regional facility in Houston, Texas further inland to help protect the new facility from extreme weather. The facility was also designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 115 miles per hour. In February 2017, the Coast Guard\u2019s civil engineering program also issued guidance intended to increase the likelihood that new or recapitalized buildings would be designed to withstand natural disasters, and to enable the Coast Guard to better manage risks to its operations and personnel, among other things. We found in February 2019 that the condition of the Coast Guard\u2019s shore infrastructure is deteriorating and almost half of it is past its service life\u2014resulting in (1) recapitalization and new construction and (2) deferred construction projects and maintenance backlogs. With almost half of its infrastructure past its service life, and given recent Coast Guard funding requests for their shore infrastructure, it will take many years for the agency to address these backlogs. For example, in 2018 the Coast Guard estimated that it would take almost 400 years to address just the $1.774 billion recapitalization and new construction backlog. Nevertheless, the size and estimate costs of the Coast Guard\u2019s backlog may be understated. We have previously reported on certain steps the Coast Guard has taken to begin to improve how it manages its shore infrastructure. These steps included, for example, identifying risks posed by the lack of timely investment. In February 2019, however, we also reported that the Coast Guard does not have a written policy outlining how they determine risk to its shore infrastructure, or to its personnel and operations. We believe the Coast Guard\u2019s policy should not only consider risks to its infrastructure, but also risks to its personnel and operations in the event of a disaster. In addition, we believe the Coast Guard\u2019s policy could consider how to mitigate risks to shore infrastructure, including infrastructure located up to 2 miles inland. As of February 2019, there are approximately 775 Coast Guard assets located inland, and the number is expected to grow to more than 1,000 by 2024.  As part of our recommendation to improve how the Coast Guard manages its shore infrastructure, we believe the Coast Guard should assess, for example, the impact of rising sea levels, flooding, and climate change on coastal U.S. communities, including the effects on the Coast Guard\u2019s shore infrastructure. Also, we believe the Coast Guard should update its assessments of risks to its shore infrastructure on a regular basis, including risks associated with climate change and rising sea levels.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) maintains and produces price indexes including the CPI-U, chained CPI-U, CPI-W, and CPI-E to measure changes in prices for goods and services used by the civilian population as a whole in the United States by tracking changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services. Data are collected by BLS for the CPI-U from outlets where consumers purchase goods and services for the civilian population as a whole. Expenditure weights describe the relative importance of each expenditure category within the market basket. Data collected in the Consumer Expenditure Survey are used to calculate expenditure weights for the market basket that represent the target population in a broad sense. The CPI-U is based on data for the entire civilian population, where the CPI-W and CPI-U are targeted to a subset of the civilian population, the CPI-E. BLS produces subpopulation indexes for these groups based on the CPI-U data. BLS uses data collected through the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) to develop expenditure weights that measure the spending patterns of subpopulations. These subpopulation indexes, CPI-W and CPI-E, are based on data for two separate subpopulations of consumers. Using the expenditure weights for the CES data, BLS created CPI-E and CPI-W expenditure weights to approximate the weights applied for the CPI-U. The CES data allow BLS to calculate subpopulation expenditure weights so that they accurately reflect the spending patterns of each subpopulation. BLS also uses methods, tools and data, such as the Chained CPI for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) to measure changes in the cost of living for a broader population than the CPI-U represents. The C-CPI-U reflects changes in consumer substitution between items relative to the CPI-U. The C-CPI-U better reflects the changing purchases of consumers relative to the CPI-U. The CPI-E measures the effects of price changes on urban consumers who spend a substantial amount of money on housing. The CPI-E measures price changes for the households with expenditures that are 30 percent or more for the housing component of the CPI-U. The CPI-E is an experimental measure that is designed to identify the effects of housing prices on the overall cost of living. To measure price change, BLS uses a combination of the data for the entire CPI-U population with an experimental series to better capture the impact of changes in the housing market. The Chained CPI-U is an experimental series developed to measure the effects of consumer substitution on the CPI. It is based on the CPI-U data, with a special technique that is believed to be more appropriate for the kinds of changes that consumers with stable buying patterns experience. The Chained CPI-U uses the same items as the CPI-U, with prices adjusted for seasonal variation and a fixed-weighted basket. The Chained CPI-U differs from the CPI-U series in that it reweights expenditures to reflect the changes in buying patterns of consumers relative to price changes over time. The expenditure weights are based on the data collected through the CES. BLS reweights the expenditure weights twice a year, when data for the CPI-U are next updated. The weights used currently are those calculated in 2012 as part of the CPI-U annual revision. This calculation is in addition to the routine revisions, such as seasonal adjustment revisions, applied to the CPI data. The data from the CES and related programs are used to calculate weights for CPI-W and CPI-E, and are used to reweight the items and add new categories to the CPI-U basket; the reweights for CPI-U are more dramatic, shifting expenditure weights on a group-by-group basis. With the reweighted expenditure data comes a more consistent and accurate measure of the changing U.S. cost of living and a series of price indexes that will be better able to measure price change as consumer buying patterns change over time. Chained CPI represents the basket of goods and services used to measure the change in the cost of living for the civilian population as a whole. It is the CPI that will be most commonly used to index federal benefits and to update tax brackets. It has the same basket of goods and services as the regular CPI. A chained index is one where changes to the index are based on fixed-weighted prices, so as", "In addition to comprehensive sanctions, which may involve restrictions on all trade and transactions, Congress, the President, and federal 25 TEXT: \u2022\tCongress establishes most of the authority to impose economic sanctions in statute, often through authorizing language in legislation that gives the President the constitutional authority to exercise this impu- sive power. \u2022\tThe President may also impose sanctions pursuant to executive order, and often does so in cases that the United States may not want to publicize. \u2022\tThe United States often participates in international efforts or UN resolutions to impose multilateral economic sanctions.", "Proceed to summarize the following text.

In response, GAO conducted reviews of federal, state, and local laws and regulations; conducted an extensive review of studies, literature, and other sources; conferred with experts and stakeholders; and reviewed data and information from some sources, as appropriate. Although GAO\u2019a analysis of the federal Controlled Substances Act revealed that DEA does not specify a method of disposing of unused drugs, GAO identified numerous requirements related to disposal of unused drugs that would be carried out under existing requirements. FDA regulations require that controlled substances intended for outpatient use must be distributed in packaging that ensures the security and integrity of the drugs throughout the chain of custody, from the time of packaging to the time of administration to a patient. Although FDA may require certain drugs with a serious risk of overdose or abuse to be packaged in a way that makes them non- retrievable (rendered non-retrievable) when they are in a patient\u2019s possession, FDA has not imposed this requirement. Additionally, state laws and regulations, including those in Massachusetts, Oregon, Florida, and Rhode Island, also require some drugs to be non- retrievable by the patient or caregiver. Further, in its study, FDA may consider methods to non-retrieve prescriptions through non-packaging means, such as disposers and kettles. GAO found that localities can implement certain policies to encourage disposal of unwanted medications at local disposal events. These events can be hosted at police departments, senior housing communities, or other locations and may be open to the public or to the local area. Disposal events may incorporate one or more disposal methods to handle unused drugs and may include specialists such as pharmacists or physicians who can provide education and answer questions.", "(2) First, DOD is facing substantial supply chain challenges that are hindering the readiness of the F-35 fleet. Specifically, parts shortages throughout the F-35 supply chain are contributing to F-35 aircraft being unable to perform as many missions or fly as often as the warfighter requires. The F-35's unique supply chain is central to DOD's strategy to sustain the growing fleet. Rather than owning the spare parts for their aircraft, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, along with international partners and foreign military sales customers, share a common, global pool of parts. This construct for the F-35 supply chain was intended to ease the logistical burden and create economies of scale for the military services and international partners; however, the global pool does not have enough spare parts. Specifically, from May through November 2018, F-35 aircraft across the fleet were unable to fly about 30 percent of the time due to parts shortages. (3) Below is pictured an F-35B aircraft conducting training aboard a ship. Our work found that several factors contribute to these parts shortages, including F-35 parts that are breaking more often than expected, and DOD's limited capability to repair broken parts at the military depots. DOD originally planned to have repair capabilities at the depots ready by 2016, but, as we reported in April 2019, the depots will not have the capability to repair all parts at expected demand rates until 2024. We have also reported on other challenges that DOD faces related to its supply chain, including challenges in supporting deployed F-35 aircraft around the world, in clarifying how scarce parts will be distributed, and in maintaining accountability for spare parts. (4) Figure 2 depicts many of these and other challenges that DOD faces related to the F-35 supply chain. DOD has not fully implemented our April 2019 recommendations that it (1) Conduct a comprehensive review of the F-35 supply chain to determine what additional actions may be needed to achieve the level of spare-parts availability that it expects, and (2) Establish a formalized process for sharing critical reliability data, which would allow DOD to actively identify and manage critical parts. (5) DOD's efforts to increase the quantity and quality of spare parts, and to prepare the depots that repair them, have contributed to the increased rate of F-35 flight hours and the decrease in the number of parts unavailable to maintain the aircraft. However, a shortfall exists between DOD's funding requests for parts and the needs of the warfighter. In 2015, the U.S. Joint Program Office used contract options to procure additional parts for the F-35 program. By exercising the options, DOD increased the quantity of parts needed to service the global fleet from a base of 93,752 in 2015 to 113,966 in 2017. At the same time, DOD's actual purchase of F-35 parts in 2015 was less than half the funding levels required in the program's 10-year fiscal planning period. DOD plans to spend about $750 million on F-35 depot-level repair parts in 2019, nearly 95 percent less than the fiscal year 2018 levels. (6) For the remaining part of fiscal year 2019, and fiscal year 2020, DOD requests about $5.65 billion for F-35 parts that are not fully funded as well as about $500 million to meet the anticipated part demand. Additionally, funding will be needed to pay the salaries of the parts specialists at the military depots who are responsible for repairing parts that break down during use, including parts that are critical to the F-35's combat-worthiness and, therefore, needed by the warfighter.

Page 4 of 13 .\nmembers of the contracting staff in the region. See figure 4 for a depiction of the Disaster Contracting Team. FEMA\u2019s regional offices reported that the number of contract specialists varied. for example, one agency reported that their disaster contracting operations involved multiple contracting workforce elements in a range of locations.\nDisaster Contracting and Program Support (DCAPS) Team, and that team included seven contract specialists. These disaster agency contracting workforces may consist of many elements. For example, disaster agency officials observed that their contracting workforce frequently includes employees from various divisions and that some personnel were contracted from the private sector. Agency officials also reported that their disaster agency contracting workforce included contract specialists and that these contract specialists reported solely to the contracting officer serving as their supervisor. FEMA headquarters contracting workforce was also deployed to the regions. For example, in its contracting regions, FEMA\u2019s headquarters agency contracting workforce typically deployed DART teams\u2014including contract specialists. While most agencies reported the use of contractors in the disaster cycle, some agency personnel stated they used contractors sparingly and others said they used contractors exclusively for their disaster programs. Similarly, some contractor personnel observed that they provide disaster support as consultants, in contrast to others who said they work as permanent employees of disaster agencies. While there is not a nationally-recognized definition of disaster agency contract cost-reimbursable contracts, such contract costs often reflect the actual costs to the contractor in fulfilling the contract. For example, certain contracts required contractor personnel to travel to disaster areas in order to help in fulfilling contract tasks. In sum, the contract agency workforce includes a mix of contractor and government personnel, with various contract types used. See figure 5 for additional detail about the disaster contracting workforce. Page 5 of 13 .\nFEMA also maintained a contracting workforce for responding to disasters and emergencies, which we reviewed in our prior work.30 The contracting workforce FEMA maintains for responding to disasters and emergencies includes offices in its headquarters, along with contracting resources located in each of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices. This contracting workforce was deployed to FEMA\u2019s regions, such as to provide a wide range of administrative support and operational activities in support of disaster responses. The role of this contracted support was to assist regional and national contracting officers throughout the entire disaster life cycle, including before and after disasters and emergencies.31 FEMA\u2019s 2012 National Contract Management Staffing Study identified FEMA\u2019s contracting workforce for responding to disaster cycles and emergency support functions as the agency\u2019s largest contracting workforce, based on a snapshot observation of personnel identified in 2012.32 For example, FEMA\u2019s disaster agency contracting workforce for the 2017 hurricanes was deployed to regions to provide a wide range of administrative support and operational activities in support of disaster responses.\ndisaster agency contracting workforce for responding to these disasters. It should be noted that the contract cost of FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce may not be distinguishable from the contract cost of FEMA\u2019s response to these disasters. For example, FEMA\u2019s disaster agency contracting workforce may serve both functions. Disaster contracting workforces may also contract for other service needs. For example, as discussed in our prior work, disaster agencies used various contracts to help with disaster programs. These included contractor personnel supporting disaster program needs, as shown on page 5 of 13 .\nFEMA also has contracting arrangements with other federal agencies for support in disaster responses. For example, within DHS, FEMA uses contractors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Page 6 of 13 .\nIn other agencies, contractors provide program support and analysis. For example, the Energy Information Agency within DOE supports FEMA\u2019s disaster agency program by providing programmatic analysis information and reports. This contractor provides FEMA with energy sector information needed for planning and implementing the national response plans. Aside from contracts with DHS, FEMA used contractors for other agency programs, including the Army Corps of Engineers.33 FEMA is also responsible for disaster relief contracting under the Stafford Act, as discussed below", "Executive Branch ethics program.

The SEC OIG has long reported on the effectiveness of internal control systems, which the agency deems essential to achieving its most basic business objectives. For example, a 2007 examination of the agency\u2019s implementation of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FIMIA) revealed that the agency had not fully developed internal controls for its major IT activities. SEC implemented many of the recommendations in our 2007 audit report (which included recommendations that the agency (1) develop adequate oversight processes for its IT investment planning and oversight and (2) ensure that systems comply with FIMIA and OMB standards) and, based on the results of its Section 961 working group, improved its internal controls over financial reporting, information systems, operations, legal obligations and compliance with laws and regulations. Also, in September 2016, the SEC OIG issued an audit report that reviewed SEC\u2019s efforts to address the most serious internal control deficiencies identified pursuant to the requirements of Section 961 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the federal internal control standard. In this report, we presented the results of four internal control reviews conducted by the SEC OIG. The four reviews identified various control deficiencies in accounting records, information system user access, workpaper review processes, contract administration, and segregation of duties. In its management response to the audit report, SEC management outlined plans to address the OIG\u2019s recommendations. As in all of our audits we reviewed the agency\u2019s implementation of our recommendations, and SEC management concurred with the majority of our recommendations. Finally, we believe that SEC management\u2019s completion of its internal control reviews, development of effective corrective actions to improve internal controls and prompt reporting of material weaknesses to Congress is consistent with Section 961 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Therefore, we have no recommendations.", "Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures rely on information technology systems that are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising their systems and networks. Further, federal systems and networks are at an increased risk of attack. This is due to those systems often being interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the internet. Cloud computing relies on internet-based interconnectivity and resources to provide computing services to customers, while intending to free customers from the burden and costs of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. As federal agencies increasingly use cloud computing to perform their missions, the implementation of effective information security controls becomes more important. The effective implementation of a standardized process for securing cloud environments could reduce risks to agency systems and information maintained on an agency\u2019s behalf. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) was enacted to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. The act requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an information security program, and evaluate the program\u2019s effectiveness. FISMA also requires OMB to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. The law assigns OMB the responsibility of requiring agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and systems. In December 2010, OMB issued a plan for improving IT management that included provisions for agencies to consider cloud computing environments. Security Authorization of Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments that established FedRAMP to support federal agencies migrating to cloud services while protecting government information. The cloud service providers participating in the program must meet a security requirements baseline, as defined by  the Joint Authorization Board. In addition, providers must demonstrate that they meet the FEDRAMP requirements and provide appropriate assurance to federal agencies. Further, service providers must undergo continuous review by the JAB, which provides FEDRAMP with authority to grant, conditionally grant, deny, or terminate federal use of cloud services. Each agency is required to conduct its own risk management process to establish its security posture in determining whether to authorize use of a cloud computing environment. For those agencies interested in leveraging cloud resources, FedRAMP will help them do so securely.

Older adults often face food insecurity and, as in other populations, older adults in nutrition programs are at nutrition risk and may have related health conditions. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes support the intake of specific vitamins, minerals, and fiber as part of a healthy diet and suggest that there is some potential to improve health-related biomarkers among individuals with the greatest potential need through improved adherence to dietary guidelines.\n170 words, 1 citation in Chicago style.\nThe U.S. older adult population (those age 65 and older) is growing and is projected to steadily increase in the coming decades. By 2060, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that adults 65 or older will make up nearly one-quarter of the total U.S. population.\nIn addition to the overall growth in this population, the number of older adults 85 or older is expected to nearly triple from six million in 2016 to 19 million in 2060.\nSeveral federal nutrition assistance programs serve older adults, which are overseen by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The characteristics of older adults served by these programs vary, as do the types of assistance provided, the numbers of participants, and the amounts of federal expenditures.\nThe nutrition assistance programs serving older adults are overseen by the ACL and FNS\u2019s national and regional offices and generally are implemented by state and local entities.\nIn the four programs that provide meals and monthly food packages to participants, state agencies work with regional level area agencies on aging, which generally contract with local providers. Area agencies on aging are local or regional public or private nonprofit entities that are responsible for planning and delivering services to older adults within their geographic service area, generally one or more counties.\nThe dietary guidelines recommend the consumption of a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains (at least half of which are whole grains), and protein. The guidelines also emphasize the consumption of foods and beverages that reduce sodium and limit saturated and trans fats.\nAmong older adults, research has shown low dietary intakes of fruits and vegetables and underconsumption of whole grains and protein. Older adults are more susceptible to nutrient deficiencies and are more likely to have chronic health conditions associated with poor-quality diets, including some chronic diseases; excess weight and obesity; poor mental health; and frailty and functional limitations, than younger adults.\nChronic conditions in older adults, in addition to physical inactivity, are considered major factors that can restrict dietary intake, which may contribute to the decline in appetite and oral health that increases with advancing age, as well as the risk of poorer overall nutrition that declines with increasing age.\nOlder adults who are experiencing food insecurity are at increased risk for numerous negative health outcomes, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, decreased bone density, diabetes, and depression. They are also at risk for malnutrition and inadequate nutrient intake.\nPoor physical health in older adults has been associated with adverse nutritional and physiologic consequences. Low intakes and inadequate intake of certain vitamins, minerals, and fiber have been associated with negative health outcomes for older adults and, particularly for pregnant and nursing women, infants, and young children.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes provide the nutritional support for the development of the Dietary Guidelines. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the DRI provide nutrient-specific recommendations for healthy adults, pregnant and lactating women, and children.\nFollowing the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and DRI can improve the nutritional intake of Americans, including older adults, and may also improve other related indicators, such as biomarkers and risk factors for chronic diseases.\nA balanced diet, as recommended by the DGAs and the DRI, based on a", "In 1968, Congress created NFIP, with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act, to help reduce costs of providing federal flood assistance to repair damaged homes and businesses.

FEMA has a division responsible for flood mapping activities and policy and guidance, but stakeholders from various levels of government and private sector participate in the mapping process. As of May 2020, 22,487 communities across the United States and its territories voluntarily participated in NFIP by adopting and agreeing to enforce flood-related building codes and floodplain management regulations.

SUMMARY (Continued):", "This section provides an overview of (1) the impact of nuclear or radiological events, (2) U.S. efforts to combat nuclear or radiological smuggling, (3) STC program goals and phases, (4) how the STC program operates, and (5) STC program activities.\nThe Homeland Security Act, 2002, mandated creation of the Department of Homeland Security and its National Security Directorate. The directorate established the Office of Counterproliferation and Counterterrorism that included a program called the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office was responsible for the coordination of the detection systems for nuclear and other radiological devices with the STC Program is a critical element of the national security mission of the CWMD. Prior to the passage of the Homeland Security Act. 2002, Congress had established similar programs to coordinate state and local government partners in the development and implementation of detection systems. Specifically, the FY2006 DOD Authorization Act required the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security and the FBI to establish programs to help state and local governments improve their capabilities to protect vital areas and facilities against radiological and nuclear attack and also improve their detection capabilities through technology development and operational testing. A similar, but not identical, program run by DHS since 2003, had assisted state and local agencies in establishing or enhancing their detection systems. Both the DOD and its predecessor and homeland security partners\u2019 programs provided funding for equipment, training, and exercises to help states and urban areas identify and respond to nuclear threats. Other Homeland Security Act. 2002 requirements have also supported state and local radiological detection efforts. The act\u2019s requirement that DHS plan for and establish a national radiation detection network has also driven efforts from multiple federal agencies to improve homeland security by integrating state and local government partners. According to the DOD, its program provided the basis for what became the STC program.  The STC program is one of several DHS security initiatives established through the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the CWMD. A few examples are the nuclear forensics program initiative, the radiological transportation security program, and the radiological and nuclear detection certification programs.\nThe STC program began in 2009 and is one of the many components of broader U.S. Efforts to counter terrorist efforts to smuggle, deploy, or detonate a nuclear or radiological devise in the United States. Specifically, U.S. efforts involve (1) securing radioactive materials and (2) monitoring or intercepting radioactive materials at the borders, with partner countries, or with law enforcement, border protection, and other first responder organizations. Since 2001, the U.S. government has invested in efforts to protect nuclear materials that are stored, used, and transported in the United States. These efforts aim to prevent nuclear or radiological materials from entering into terrorists\u2019 possession or from being used illegally outside the regulatory control of the U.S. government.\nCWMD\u2019s STC program has several roles that make up its mission. Some of these roles are to: (1) coordinate the STC program as well as the intervention effort against nuclear and radiological smuggling, and (2) conduct exercises and training events to enable municipalities to interdict nuclear or radiological threats.\nIn developing the first phase of the STC program CWMD created a 6-step process that would (1) allow CWMD to determine what cities are interested in participating in the STC program, (2) evaluate if cities are eligible to participate, and (3) determine which cities are eligible for up to $7 million dollars to develop and install detection capabilities. The 6-step sequence can be summarized as follows.\n(1) City\u2019s identification as a partner city with a state or local law enforcement and/or a fire or emergency responder organization with the capacity (as defined by CWMD), capability, and intention to implement the program.\n(2) Preparation of an application for partner city participation that CWMD uses as a basis for program participation decisions.\n(3) Conducting an assessment of the partner city\u2019s technical proposal\u2019s ability, capability; and intention to implement the program.\n(5) Coordination with other relevant national stakeholder organizations and establishing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between CWMD and partner cities.\n(6) Developing the", "TSA is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), primarily responsible for aviation security and the security of foreign points of origin beyond the U.S. border\u2014 that is; overseas. Over the last 10 years, TSA has issued numerous directives requiring changes to the passenger and cargo screening programs. These directives are usually motivated by threats to the aviation sector or intelligence gathered in vulnerabilities assessment at overseas airports with last point of departure passengers and cargo bound for the United States. The nature of these threats (as well as vulnerabilities/shortcomings at foreign airports) prompted TSA to issue directives related to overseas airports in high, medium, and low risk countries. Although all directives require certain security measures to mitigate vulnerabilities, TSA also gives air carriers the ability to opt for an alternative measure(s) to maintain the required standard, if it deems the alternate measure to achieve a similar outcome. For example, the alternative measures permitted through existing TSA directives include (but are not limited to) explosive detection equipment that relies on passive or active technologies, screening procedures based on intelligence, special security measures, enhanced passenger screening, and the employment of additional private screeners. A directives-driven approach\u2014 that is; air carriers responding to directives with requests for alternative measures\u2014 may help TSA identify the costs of specific alternative measures, and, therefore, may aid TSA\u2019s regulatory efficiency. Additionally, TSA\u2019s directives program serves as a useful tool for targeting airports or airlines with security vulnerabilities, identifying potential changes to security requirements without legislative action, and ensuring aviation security. However, as noted in our report, TSA could improve the directives approval process by identifying a designated agency official, establishing an internal documentation system for directives, and requiring TSA to periodically reevaluate directives.", "AVAILABLE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA SHOW A RANGE OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST THE FOUR FEDERAL LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES\u2019 EMPLOYEES FOR 2013-2017. THE SEVERITY OF THESE INCIDENTS RANGED FROM THREATS CONVEYED OVER THE TELEPHONE TO ATTEMPTED MURDER, AND INCLUDES AN INCIDENT IN WHICH AN EMPLOYEE WAS STABBED OUTSIDE A FEDERAL BUILDING. THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OF\nTHREATS AND ASSAULTS ON THE FOUR AGENCIES VARIED BY AGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013-2017, BLM DATA INCLUDED 88 INCIDENTS OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST BLM EMPLOYEES. FWS DATA INCLUDED 66 INCIDENTS OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST FWS EMPLOYEES. FOREST SERVICE DATA INCLUDED 177 INCIDENTS OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST FOREST SERVICE EMPLOYEES. PARK SERVICE DATA INCLUDED 29 INCIDENTS OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST PARK SERVICE EMPLOYEES. FBI DATA FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013-2017 SHOWED THAT FBI INITIATED UNDER 100 DOMESTIC TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS INTO POTENTIAL THREATS AGAINST FEDERAL LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES. THIS ANALYSIS CONCLUDES THAT EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL THREATS AND ASSAULTS IS UNKNOWN, DATA SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN RECORDED. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WE CONDUCTED WITH AGENCY AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES. REPRESENTATIVES SAID THAT SEVERAL FACTORS EXPLAIN THE MULTIPLE INCIDENTS THAT AN AGENCY REPORTS. FIRST, ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN ASSAULT OR THREATEN EMPLOYEES SEVERAL TIMES. SECOND, AN ACT CAN BE VIOLENT BUT NOT BE PROSECUTED AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. THIRD, THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSAULTED OR THREATENED, BUT RATHER THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT EMPLOYEES ARE THREATENED OR ASSAULTED. THIRD, THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ASSAULTED OR THREATENED.\nSummary: Data show that the number of actual threats and assaults on land management agency employees is unknown because some threats are not reported.\nDATA SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL THREATS AND ASSAULTS ON LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY EMPLOYEES IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE SOME THREATS ARE NOT REPORTED. For example, officials from the BLM reported that not all threats and assaults are reported to agency offices. Specifically, in an interview with USDOI\u2019s Office of Inspector General officials stated that they had not heard of any reported threats and assaults to BLM employees, but they noted that they could not say BLM employees had not been threatened or assaulted. Further, officials reported that when field units are small and isolated (which can occur in many western states), the threat may be perceived as more serious", "TBML can work in any trade transaction. The misrepresentation of the price, quantity, or type of goods can disguise the origin and destination of criminal proceeds. The misrepresentation can involve an invoice being inflated, an actual quantity of goods being misrepresented, or a different invoice being inflated that does not describe the goods being shipped. The TBML process typically involves the import and export of goods and the exchange of goods through multiple parties. The TBML process often involves an exchange of payments between two different parties, including two different financial institutions.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: The purpose Statement of Work for task order 3 under the FirstNet-AT&T contract requires that AT&T prioritize and allow access to \u201cFederal and State\u201d public safety agencies. In the context of the FirstNet contract, first-responder agencies generally encompass those agencies that have emergency response functions, including federal and state governments as well as federal and regional public-safety agencies. We further defined and discussed the terms public safety, federal public safety, and state public safety in a prior report,19 and they are also defined and discussed in a National Public-Safety Broadband Council (NPSBC) report.20 We found that, from the public-safety agency perspective, federal first-responder agencies and non-federal first-responder agencies generally have comparable public-safety-related functions, as non-federal first-responder agencies typically serve similarly sized jurisdictions as federal first-responder agencies. We found that federal public safety has unique characteristics, and federal public safety is different from state public safety21 in that the federal government has jurisdiction over interstate crimes that affect federally owned, leased, or protected resources when states do not have jurisdiction. However, in state public-safety context, state public safety has unique characteristics and functions and state public safety is different from federal public safety, particularly when it comes to interstate 18 U.S. General Accounting Office. Public Safety and Homeland Security: Key Actions Needed to Ensure Effective Implementation of Nationwide Public-Safety Broadband Network. Washington, D.C.: GAO, September 4, 2017. 19 According to public-safety officials, public safety includes all first responder agencies. This includes all federal, state, territorial, tribal, municipal, county, and regional agencies including but not limited to law enforcement, public health, emergency medical service, fire service, national disaster medical service, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, other responders, search and rescue agencies, etc. who provide all kinds of emergency- response services.

December 22, 2017 22 Statements of Work for each task order provide that AT&T has 90 and 120 days from the task order inception to complete a detailed risk analysis, depending on which task order we focus on. Therefore, these statements of work are not providing a set timeline for completion of each task order. 21 GRAPHIC: Statements of work from the FirstNet-AT&T contract\u2019s task orders. 4, 31 (e.g., intergovernmental agreements) between federal and state agencies. As such, while there are clear distinctions between federal public safety and state public safety, states face various challenges balancing the needs, interests, and characteristics of federal public safety versus state public safety. Furthermore, when a national public safety network is established, state public safety agencies should remain the network\u2019s predominant users, as they generally have the most network users. This is important, as there are a limited number of network resources available for allocations based on priority. However, a significant challenge from the state perspective is that federal public safety\u2019s use of the network and funding it may be considered \u201cmission critical.\u201d At the same time, states are required to meet both the critical-needs and public-safety responsibilities of a national public safety network established under federal legislation. Furthermore, states may also have less influence over federal first-responder agency network decisions as compared with state first-responder agencies. We do underscore the importance of working together to develop consistent approaches to allocating network resources in a fair and equitable manner. For example, states may determine that allocating more network resources to state first responders with relatively fewer users than federal first responders with more users would be more efficient and fair, rather than using a pure percentage method wherein all users have the same proportional share of network resources. As such, states may wish to", "The Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, located mainly in southwestern Oregon and extending into northern California, encompasses nearly 1.8 million acres. The west side of the forest lies within the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion, which is known for its ecological diversity, with 28 coniferous tree species and numerous rare and endemic plants. The forest also contains diverse topography, with steep terrain and rugged geological features across several mountain ranges, including the Klamath Mountains, Siskiyou Mountains, Cascade Range, and Coast Range. Access to the forest is limited, due to many roadless areas and over 340,000 acres of wilderness, including the 180,000-acre Kalmiopsis Wilderness, where the Chetco Bar Fire began. Citites and communities in Oregon near the fire include Brookings and Gold Beach - along the coast of the Pacific Ocean - as well as Agness, Cave Junction, and Selma in Curry and Josephine counties. Figure 1 shows the final perimeter of the fire in southwest Oregon. The part of southwestern OR where the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest is located is a fire-adapted ecosystem, meaning that most native species and plant communities have evolved with fire, and many are adapted to or dependent on periodic wildfires. The historic fire interval in the area where the Chetco Bar Fire occurred varied, as did the historic severity of fires, according to a Forest Service ecologist. The forest experienced a number of fires over the 30 years before the Chetco Bar Fire occurred. In 1987, the Silver Fire burned nearly 100,000 acres. Fifteen years later, in 2002, the Biscuit Fire burned nearly 500,000 acres, including areas previously burned by the Silver and, to a lesser extent, Chetco Bar fires. The Chetco Bar Fire started in areas burned by both the Silver and Biscuit Fires. In 2018, the year after the Chetco Bar Fire occurred, the forest experienced another large fire, the Klondike Fire, which burned about 175,000 acres, abuttinh t the burn scar of the Chetco Bar Fire in some places. In some parts of southwestern OR, significant vegetation has built up, according to Forest Service and other documents. At the same time, development in and around wildland areas continues to increase, placing more people, businesses, and infrastructure at risk of being affected by fires, regardless of who has", "Uranium enrichment is the process of increasing the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope relative to uranium-238 in a quantity of uranium. Natural uranium consists of approximately 0.7 percent of the fissile uranium-235 isotope, while uranium used in commercial nuclear power reactors generally consists of 3 to 5 percent uranium-235 and uranium for nuclear weapons requires a higher concentration of uranium-235. In addition, as a nuclear reactor operates, some of the uranium in the reactor fuel is converted to plutonium, which can also be used as a weapons material when it is separated from other elements of the irradiated, or spent, fuel through a process known as reprocessing. Plutonium and enriched uranium are \u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d under the Atomic Energy Act. The processes for obtaining such material\u2014 enrichment and reprocessing\u2014are called sensitive nuclear technologies. Under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which came into force in 1970, non-nuclear weapon state parties to the treaty may not acquire nuclear weapons and must conclude a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA is an independent international organization affiliated with the United Nations that has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and verifying, through a set of technical measures called safeguards, that nuclear technologies and materials are not diverted from peaceful uses to military purposes. Figure 1 shows the safeguards arrangements of the partners with which the United States has nuclear cooperation agreements. Section 123 of the AEA establishes a framework for civilian nuclear cooperation agreements, which are a prerequisite for the export of certain nuclear material and equipment, including major components of nuclear reactors. Section 123 also lays out requirements for informing congressional committees and obtaining congressional review. It requires that the President submit any proposed agreement along with a non-public Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for a period of at least 60 days of continuous session, during which the committees may each submit an advisory report. If the committees notify the House International Relations and Senate Foreign Relations Committees (IR/SFRC) of congressional dissent, the president may submit the agreement for Congress\u2019s final approval. Alternatively, the president may choose not to seek congressional approval of the agreement. Section 123 also contains three options that could be used to alter the NPAS or add to it: 1) the insertion of additional information or analysis, 2) the removal of certain non-public information, or 3) both. The options allow greater congressional input and a better understanding of an agreement\u2019s nonproliferation implications.  \u2022\tSenior Department of Energy (DOE) and State Department officials have expressed concern over foreign efforts to enrich uranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel. Some ally and friendly governments, such as Japan\u2019s, are also making such requests. Because of this, Section 123 provides for increased consultation and reporting to the executive branch on nuclear cooperation agreements, as well as the authority for the President to veto agreements. Section 123 requires increased reporting to Congress to enable more effective oversight of the implementation of safeguards. \u2022\tThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA, enacted in 1978) requires the President to make a report to Congress every 6 years on the status of nuclear nonproliferation efforts\u2014 the latest of which was transmitted to Congress on May 4, 2006. The report is part of the NNPA\u2019s requirement of a comprehensive assessment of the status of nuclear nonproliferation efforts.  SUMMARIZED TABLE \u2022\tRelevant Law: Atomic Energy Act Sections 123,122,113; Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 Sections 1(d),2(b); National Security Act of 1947 and Executive Order of 1978; Plutonium Management Act of 2006 \u2022\tAuthorities: Treaties or agreements pursuant to the AEA;", "TEXT: Proceed to summarize the following text.

While the 2015 NDAA authorized contractor oversight reviews until SBA\u2019s final rule for the new certification process was published in May 2019, SBA is not conducting such reviews and has not developed a schedule or criteria for conducting them. In June 2019, some certifiers said they recently received an email from SBA requesting additional information about their firm within the next month and a half. SBA officials stated in July 2019 that they would use this additional information to better inform future reviews of the third-party certifiers. However, given the lack of progress on performing oversight reviews, SBA may not be conducting these reviews within the timeframes we considered reasonable for addressing our recommendation. We continue to believe that our recommendation for the Administrator of SBA to establish criteria for contractor oversight reviews and to schedule them is valid. Without clear criteria for and guidance on implementing contractor oversight reviews, SBA cannot ensure that the certification process is working as intended and WOSB-certified firms are not receiving ineligible set-aside contracts. These weaknesses increase the risk that WOSB-certified firms and contracting agencies will be inappropriately awarded contract set-asides not intended for their businesses. Consequently, we maintain that our recommendation should be addressed. Page 1044. Pgs 59-62.

(2) addressing eligibility irregularities that a contracting officer identifies by issuing a written determination of ineligibility that includes specific information about its finding and the basis for it, including, at a minimum, when appropriate, a description of ineligible elements or a summary of information from the contracting officer\u2019s investigation. (3) taking aggressive and timely actions before awarding the contract. (4) reviewing and revising its guidance for conducting business eligibility examinations to ensure it is clear. (5) defining the type and amount of evidence that a contracting officer may consider in order to conduct an appropriate review. (6) developing a database that can be used to house all information related to businesses\u2019 annual eligibility examinations to identify common problems and potential trends and to serve as a basis for discussing any business recertification issues. (7) revising its policy guidance to enhance WOSB oversight by, for example, establishing clear performance standards and specific performance criteria for contractor oversight reviews that address the requirements applicable to third-party certifiers. (8) developing an implementation timeline and assigning staff responsibility for revising its internal business eligibility documentation guidance in order to update and review the eligibility documents it has on file.", "The recommendation would result in an increase of $1.02 in the costs of commissary shopping for military beneficiaries. According to the task force\u2019s recommendation for consolidating the defense resale organizations, this sum would primarily represent costs associated with establishing the category management reform, but also includes costs associated with eliminating the current regional offices and implementing a headquarters relocation and a transition management office. The task force expects net savings will recur and result in an annual savings of approximately $390 to $670 million, contingent on the effectiveness of category management reforms. Thus, the task force estimates that category management reforms, consolidation-associated HR costs, headquarters relocation costs, and transition management office costs would result in savings of about $8.59 to about $10.55 per shopping transaction for military beneficiaries. However, according to DOD officials, the task force underestimated the costs associated with eliminating all of the separate IT systems and underestimated the time and resource level needed to perform the tasks. According to DOD\u2019s Chief Management Officer, the task force estimated that consolidating IT would result in overall savings of $53 million to $120 million annually within 5 years, contingent on the effectiveness of category management reforms. In reality, the estimated IT costs are likely to increase as work on the plan to consolidate IT begins. DOD officials state that the task force estimated that total one-time costs to consolidate IT would be about $8 million and would include costs for contractors. However, the task force\u2019s cost estimation for the IT consolidation might not accurately capture the full scope and scale of the required work or costs. Consolidating IT systems is typically an infusion of funding for IT contractors to do the work. To accurately estimate IT cost implications, one would need to estimate not only the one-time costs to consolidate IT systems but also the ongoing operating costs for IT. Further, DOD officials stated that they plan on implementing additional categories of retail items, such as groceries and pharmaceuticals. According to DOD officials, the task force may have overestimated the expected savings to be achieved through the consolidation of commissaries and exchanges because it may have assumed that lowering the cost of goods sold was the only potential cost savings associated with consolidation. The task force should have weighed all likely cost savings associated with consolidation by using various potential cost savings scenarios of a consolidated organization and estimating total expected savings to justify recommendations for consolidating the commissary and exchange systems. The Business Transformation Agency, which led the work on the business case analysis, should have analyzed the full range of potential scenarios to identify additional cost savings that may be realized in the future if the recommendations are adopted. It could have considered scenarios that included implementing a non-appropriated fund structure in the commissary program to eliminate appropriations subsidies. The agency should have considered the extent to which commissary and exchange operations could benefit from merchandising the products carried by competitors and how doing so would affect shopping patterns of customers. The department would have been wise to conduct a comprehensive cost\u2013benefit analysis before it decided to recommend the business case analysis\u2019 recommendations for a consolidated defense resale organization.

Floods are the natural disasters of most frequent occurrence in the U.S. (1968). The Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act in 1968, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish the NFIP. The program strives to limit or mitigate the damage and financial loss to tax payers from floods. The floods are classified in three categories: catastrophic, moderate and isolated. The most destructive are catastrophic and usually occur in low-lying area with impermeable soils and a large extent of surface runoff. A moderate flood can occur anywhere in the U.S. if there is enough precipitation and snowmelt from melting snow. Isolated flood is a small flood, usually localized. If the flood in a particular community does not exceed the threshold of coverage, the Federal Insurance of Flood Act (1956) provides coverage only for the structures that do not qualify as catastrophic, moderate or isolated flood. The other way NFIP helps local governments is its guidance programs: (1) Flood proofing is offered to help reduce damages as well as to provide assistance and flood insurance discount in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Reform Act (1994). (2) Floodplain management assistance is to provide information and assistance to help state and local governments adopt and enforce measures to reduce future losses from flooding. Floodplains are the land areas that are at or near the limits of the stream channel at time of flooding. Floodplains are often subject to flooding as a result of flash floods and the rising water tables. Flash floods are usually the cause of major damage and are particularly associated with rapid snow melting or with major, sometimes untimely rainfall that cannot be handled by the sewer systems. Other common cause of flash flooding is the inability to cope with the large amounts of rainwater due to improper drainage systems. NFIP also offers funding for flood mitigation projects and technical assistance if needed. All the technical services are offered to the communities for free. The NFIP focuses on the most hazardous flooding areas, known as special flood hazard areas in which NFIP flood insurance is offered. NFIP offers several discount options, for instance if one is paying for both building and flood insurance, there is a ten per cent discount, and other discount options are also available up to twenty per cent discount if one decides to pay flood damage premium once instead of twice in a year. The NFIP program strives to reduce the amount of federal financial support needed to help local government recover after a major flood. Through community assistance visits and the floodplain management assistance NFIP offers a help to its participating communities to enforce measures that reduce future flood damage and lower insurance premiums for property owners.", "Title U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff guidance on environmental, social and governance (ESG)\nSubject Securities and Exchange Commission, United States ; ESG investing ; Securities regulation, United States\nDescription U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff guidance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) [electronic resource]\nCreator/Author United States.

We did, however, provide general observations on that system, including a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of the concept, along with the benefits of relying on air marshals to respond to threats as a last line of defense. We also provided information on how FAMS is attempting to mitigate some of the drawbacks of the concept, specifically to include providing additional air marshals to SMC flights.\nOur general assessment of the roster method is that it is effective. Under the roster method, FAMS relies on air marshals and supervisory air marshals to provide recommendations for and schedule air marshals. The fact that FAMS relies on the recommendations of its employees, as part of the roster method, is beneficial to the agency. Furthermore, in the evaluation we conducted, we found that these recommendations were based on the air marshal\u2019s training and experience. Moreover, we did not identify any problems with the method.\n1 We obtained the most current data for 2019 because the Human Capital Management Office indicated that it is no longer collecting employment data at the time of our evaluation fieldwork period, which is 2014 to 2016.\nFigure 1: Average Hours Worked by Air Marshal, Law Enforcement Availability Pay, and Extra Compensation Eligible (ECE)  Air Marshals: ECE + LAEP (Average +/- Standard Deviation) ECE, 85+ Overtime\nSource: TSA, FAMS, and OIG analysis of FAMS data as of 30 August 2019.

May 22, 17,", "VA is responsible for providing benefits to veterans, including health care, disability compensation, and various types of financial assistance. In fiscal year 2019, VA received a total budget of $201.1 billion, and the largest discretionary budget in its history\u2014$86.6 billion, about $20 billion higher than in 2015. The department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation through its VHA, with 172 medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities organized into regional networks. VA has faced growing demand by veterans for its health care services, with the total number of veterans enrolled in VA\u2019s health care system rising from 7.9 million to more than 9 million from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2019, VHA received $73.1 billion of VA\u2019s $86.6 billion discretionary budget. In addition to providing health care services, VA provides cash benefits to veterans for disabling conditions incurred in or aggravated by military service. To carry out its mission, VA spends tens of billions of dollars to procure a wide range of goods and services, including medical supplies; to construct hospitals, clinics, and other facilities; and to provide the information technology (IT) to support its operations. We have made hundreds of recommendations to improve VA\u2019s management and oversight of these services. Specifically, since 2000, we have made 1,225 recommendations to VA. While VA has implemented most of the recommendations, 125 recommendations related to management of disability claims workloads remain open, including 1 recommendation that has remained open for 3 years or more.  In 2017, we began sending letters to VA and appropriate congressional committees identifying priority recommendations for VA to implement in order to significantly improve its operations. Since then, we have identified and rated five criteria and have re-rated the five criteria multiple times.  These criteria include (1) VA\u2019s leadership commitment and action plan; (2) VA\u2019s performance management and accountability; (3) VA\u2019s capacity for strategic thinking and innovation; (4) VA\u2019s culture for high performance; and (5) VA\u2019s IT management.  As of March 2019, VA met the leadership commitment and action plan, but not the performance management and accountability, culture for high performance, or IT management criteria. VA has made changes in leadership and in senior staff to demonstrate its commitment. VA officials are now accountable for taking action on our recommendations or to provide an update on progress on all but the 42 of its high-risk areas. However, VA officials have not yet ensured that they have clear goals and performance measures for monitoring performance results in its five high-risk areas. VA has taken some initial steps to foster a high-performance culture, but this remains a work in progress. VA updated its action plan in September 2018 and included a list of tasks, but not associated performance measures for its high-risk areas. We will continue to monitor VA\u2019s leadership\u2019s commitment to improving its performance. VA spent over $5 billion on IT in fiscal year 2018, and has implemented many IT modernization initiatives. However, VA\u2019s data center closure efforts continue to experience challenges and VA will struggle to realize some of the costs savings it expected. We will continue to monitor VA\u2019s implementation of its IT modernization plan in its five high-risk areas. As discussed in more detail later in this briefing, we found in March 2019 that VA had yet to make progress in addressing the underlying causes of its designation. Thus, VA remains in the High Risk List.  VA can address these risks by implementing GAO\u2019s recommendations.  We believe that VA is taking positive steps to address its long- standing, complex management challenges, as evidenced in its fiscal year 2019 budget that is hundreds of millions of dollars larger than its fiscal year 2015 budget. However, despite these positive changes, VA continues to face serious and long-standing challenges that it should address with urgency.  Although the mission of VA to deliver quality benefits and services to veterans can lead to positive outcomes, we have found that VA\u2019s systemic challenges can be", "Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, use wireless networks to enable voice and data communications. These wireless networks comprise several components. For example, cell sites\u2014a base station equipped with an antenna\u2014receive and transmit radio signals to mobile devices. In addition to traditional \u201cmacro cells,\u201d 5G networks also use smaller wireless infrastructure, known as \u201csmall cells,\u201d which can be installed on existing structures, including macro towers, buildings, utility poles, or streetlights. Base station controllers manage communications between the cell site and the mobile switching center, or the \u201ccore network.\u201d The core network then directs the communication to landline phones, other cell phones, or the Internet. Finally, backhaul facilities, such as fiber optic cabling or microwaves, transport the communications. Federal Communications Commission is responsible for assigning spectrum to wireless carriers; National Telecommunications and Information Administration develops spectrum policies and assigns spectrum to federal government agencies.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the U.S. Government (Federal Government) with administrative responsibilities under five United States federal statutes. The Commission is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. It is also responsible for consumer support and education through publications, workshops and seminars. The FCC\u2019s primary mission is to \u201cmake available to all people of the United States a rapid, efficient and nation-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission regulates the radio frequency spectrum. Carriers (service providers) utilize the radio frequency spectrum for communication between mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and land-based network facilities. These frequency bands have different characteristics that make them more or less suitable for communication between devices and land-based facilities. Examples of wireless communication spectrum used by service providers include 700 MHz: Used by a service provider providing service in the United States. In the 700 MHz band, licensed spectrum, such as the license for AT&T Wireless LLC., and unlicensed spectrum are located in separate portions of the spectrum. The licensed spectrum provides an infrastructure-like service within the unlicensed spectrum, enhancing the performance of unlicensed spectrum use, and can provide a back-up option for customers if the unlicensed devices lose their connection with the unlicensed spectrum for any reason, such as when a customer is outside of unlicensed spectrum coverage. The licensed spectrum is referred to as \u201cenvelope,\u201d and the unlicensed spectrum is referred to as \u201ctier.\u201d 1.2 GHz: Used for personal and business communications services (CB/PCS Services) (See fig. 1.). Service carriers use the 1.2 GHz and 1.5 GHz frequency bands for personal and business communications services (CB/PCS Services). Personal and business communications services provided include \u201ccellular\u201d (e.g., voice, email, and data services (services provided to a customer\u2019s mobile device through a local carrier, such as Verizon Wireless) as well as radio services provided through the 1.9 GHz frequency band. Personal and business communications services also include a variety of business equipment service lines, including the use of wireless Internet service providers and Internet service providers as part of these services. The 1.9 GHz band is available for licensed wireless services, including voice, data and other services, including machine-to-machine communications in the United States. The 700 MHz band and the 1.9 GHz band have been allocated separately.\nThe 800 MHz band is designated for Industrial, Scientific and Medical Radiation Emission (ISM) (See fig. 1.). Industrial, Scientific and Medical Radiation Emission Devices (ISM); The 800 MHz band is designated for Industrial, Scientific and Medical Radiation Emission. The use of the 800 MHz band is limited to devices employing radiated power and providing a function such as radiofrequency communications. This band is considered to be compatible with the radio astronomy service. 900 MHz: Used for wireless communications in the United States (See fig. 1.). In the United States, licensed mobile networks in the 900 MHz band enable the mobile device to communicate with the network, such as voice and data. Because of its wide spectrum bandwidth\u2014frequency range\u2014a mobile device can travel much further using a network in the 900 MHz band, than using networks in the 1.9", "You are an expert at summarization.

Some of the waste was dumped directly into the soil, some was encased in drums or other containers and buried, and about 54 billion gallons were stored on-site in 177 underground tanks.

Proceed to summarize the following text.\nThe United States Department of Labor (DOL), under the direction of President Obama, began a multiagency initiative in 2010 aimed at improving the state of disability management in the federal government. Among the participating agencies are the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the U.S. Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP). As the EEOC agency responsible for leading the effort, we have been coordinating closely with the other agencies involved in the initiative. Our goal is to provide federal program and management leaders with a single portal for managing the employment of individuals with disabilities. In order to improve service to federal managers, this portal provides a comprehensive summary of the various rules and regulations governing federal hiring and disability management practices, and provides them with the key resources needed to fulfill their leadership obligations. The portal is targeted specifically at program and management leaders in the federal workforce because these managers are best-positioned to foster and support agency-wide changes related to the recruitment, hiring, retention, and accommodation of individuals with disabilities. EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations has taken the lead in developing this management-training resource to facilitate leadership development with regard to disability management in the federal government. DISABLED FEDERAL EMPLOYEES The 2010 Annual Status Report of the Federal Government\u2019s Employment of Individuals with Disabilities (the ASR) highlights the importance of leadership in managing the employment of individuals with disabilities. In fact, the current ASR, \u201cPerspectives on the Status of the Federal Government\u2019s Employment of Individuals with Disabilities,\u201d is devoted almost entirely on what leaders in the federal workforce can do to improve the employment outcomes of individuals with disabilities. The report examines the issue of federal workforce leadership, and the role played by supervisors and agency managers in shaping a positive and healthy work environment. The report identifies the important differences between the various roles leaders play in work situations that involve employees with disabilities and employees without disabilities, and calls for more leadership development opportunities to facilitate a greater appreciation of the real-life work experiences of federal employees with disabilities, including those from targeted disability groups, such as the blind and deaf or hard-of-hearing community. The report also identifies the impact of several leadership barriers that affect the employment outcomes of individuals with disabilities, such as an inadequate knowledge of disability issues or a lack of understanding regarding the legal rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for greater training and resources for overcoming these barriers.", "R L is the Hanford Site\u2019s contract operating waste management contractor. The TPA Action Plan outlines the cleanup strategy, schedule and actions required to dispose of the remaining waste at the Hanford Site in a compliant and timely manner. R L\u2019s S&M requirements for excess facilities are outlined in the TPA Action Plan. R L has established an S&M plan (S&M plan) for each of the facilities that are key excess facilities or excess facilities associated with key hazards. As part of the S&M plan, an interior inspection is required of three contaminated excess facilities not previously inspected or not adequately or properly inspected to ensure the contamination controls provided to the facility are functioning. In addition, we made six inspections of contaminated excess facilities not currently in S&M. Our review found three of these six inspections were not adequate or proper, and R L should perform inspections of these six other contaminated excess facilities to verify that they have adequate contamination controls in place to mitigate the risk of contaminants seeping into the groundwater. The TPA Action Plan outlines the cleanup strategy, schedule and actions required to dispose of the remaining waste at the Hanford Site in a compliant and timely manner. Under the TPA Action Plan, excess facilities are categorized into one of six categories\u2014Key Excess Facilities (KEF) or Excess Facilities Associated With Key Hazards (E F C\u2019s)\u2014and S&M requirements for each facility are established within the S&M plans. These S&M requirements outline the specific procedures for S&M. In addition, a graded approach has been established for managing the risk associated with excess facilities. The graded approach is based on the type of hazard associated with the facility, the condition of the facility, the physical conditions of the facility, the location of the facility, its accessibility, its potential impact on the environment, and public safety and security. For example, KEFs represent the highest risk in terms of managing releases of contamination from a nuclear fuel facility and thus have more stringent requirements for S&M than do E F C\u2019s, and S&M for E F C\u2019s is stricter than for those at facilities that are nonhazardous. The S&M plan for each facility identifies which contractual clause items and requirements apply, defines its scope of activities, and establishes a schedule of work that includes when work is to be completed and the associated work and costs. While the graded approach takes into account the potential for a facility\u2019s release of contamination into the environment, the approach also relies on contractor-developed S&M plans. The graded approach assumes that the S&M plan will include all structural and contamination controls needed to provide the protection of the public, workers and the environment. However, we could not determine that a graded approach was implemented in two instances; that is because of inconsistencies in the scope and application of some structural and contamination controls of the two facilities we reviewed. We made four of these inspections of E F C\u2019s not currently in S&M to verify that they meet the same stringent control measures as excess facilities categorized as a Key Excess Facility or Excess Facilities Category. Because these four facilities do not currently require the stringent control measures that come with KEF\u2019s or E F C\u2019s, R L determined that inspections of these excess facilities are required less frequently. As part of its annual review of the S&M plans implemented by contractors, R L should: (1) validate that the S&M plan requirements are fully implemented on excess facilities by following the S&M checklist developed by independent, third-party experts with appropriate experience applicable to the facility type and any known facility-specific conditions and (2) ensure that contractors have implemented the safest, most practical, and adequate structural and contamination controls for the facility, based on the graded approach. Page 5 of 75 . In its February 20, 2014, report on contaminated excess facilities not currently under S&M management (R L-STO Report), R L advised that contractor requirements needed to be clarified for the S&M of these excess facilities. R L also noted a high risk of structural deterioration and the potential for catastrophic material failures and other hazards associated with the failure of the remaining structural supports and other unstable structures at the excess facilities because the structures are no longer functionally useful. Failure of these remaining pieces could result in uncontrolled contamination releases into the environment that could result in", "You are an expert at summarization.

The purpose of the test is to accurately and reliably quantify the anaerobic alactic capacity and aerobic capacity of the runner. The anaerobic alactic capacity (AA capacity) refers to the body s ability to produce a very rapid burst of anaerobic energy in a brief period of time. The aerobic capacity refers to the body s ability to produce energy in the presence or absence of O 2. The test consists of running up a slightly inclined ramp to a 200m mark while holding the stopwatch in one hand, starting the stopwatch and the tape measure at the base, and then starting a 70cm ruler to record the finish line. This is done in conjunction with a person who is able to stand on the side of the ramp and who is in visual contact with the runner at all times. Both of the testers stop the stopwatch, record the total time of the run, and record the 200m distance as soon as the runner crosses the finish line. The testers must agree on the distance of the finish line within five meters. The test is performed at the end of an 11 weeks Marine Recon conditioning program. The Marine must be able to make at least two practice tries the day before the test. The Marine must also be able to successfully meet the standard of three makes at the test distance of 85m the day before the 200m test. Failure to achieve this standard the day before will result in remediation of the 85m sprint the day before the test. This requirement prevents a Marine from failing for a performance standard without first having a chance to achieve that standard. Also, this requirement establishes a standard procedure that all Marines can follow, since some recon units might not have such a requirement already in place. To qualify for this study, a Marine must have at least a 210 200m time and be no more than 70 days from completing the 11 week Recon Conditioning Course. The Marines with the best times in the Recon Conditioning Course were chosen from a pool of 30 Marines for the 200m sprint test to establish the baseline of 200m sprint performance. The following parameters were determined while the Marines performed the 200m sprint during the conditioning course: (1) the average time to complete the 200m, (2) the average time to complete 80m of the 200m, which is used to test the AA capacity, and (3) the average time to complete 160m of the 200m to test the Aerobic Capacity. The time from the beginning of the ramp to the finish line was measured and the AA Capacity was calculated by subtracting the time for the entire 200m run minus the time for completing 80m. The Aerobic Capacity was calculated by subtracting the time for the entire 200m run minus the time for completing 160m. The test is performed at the end of an 11 weeks Marine Recon conditioning program. The Marine must be able to make at least two practice tries the day before the test. The Marine must also be able to successfully meet the standard of three makes at the test distance of 85m the day before the 200m test. Failure to achieve this standard the day before will result in remediation of the 85m sprint the day before the test.

However, challenges with planning to manage change; limited guidance and methods for analyzing capabilities; and lack of clarity about decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities while adapting to a new enterprise-wide approach could limit the success of the Strategy\u2019s implementation. The National Biodefense Strategy and its associated plans bring together the efforts of federal agencies with significant biodefense roles, responsibilities, and resources to address naturally-occurring, accidental, and intentional threats. The Strategy and plans also provide processes for collecting and analyzing comprehensive information across the enterprise, an important step toward the kind of enterprise-wide strategic decision-making we have called for. The Strategy defines the term \u201cbiothreat\u201d broadly to include all sources of major catastrophic risk, including naturally-occurring biological threats, the accidental release of pathogens, and the deliberate use of biological weapons. Officials we interviewed noted that this is the first time that the federal government has identified activities across the whole biodefense enterprise and assessed resources and gaps to address multiple sources of threat regardless of source. The Strategy also outlines high-level goals and objectives to help define priorities. NSPM-14, which was issued to support the strategy, established a structure and process by which federal agencies can assess enterprise-wide biodefense capabilities and needs, and subsequently develop guidance to help inform agency budget submissions. NSPM-14 lays out, in broad strokes, a process to identify biodefense efforts and assess how current resources support the Strategy\u2019s goals. Additionally, agency officials said that the assessment and joint policy guidance development process outlined in NSPM-14 offered some promise for helping agencies identify the resources necessary to achieve the Strategy\u2019s goals. However, officials from all of the agencies we interviewed, even those with the most optimistic views on the leadership and governance structure design, tempered their responses with the caveat that if not addressed could hinder enterprise-wide biodefense efforts. In our analyses and interviews, we found that parts of the process in the first year were underdeveloped, raising questions about (1) the plans to support change management practices and ensure that early-implementation limitations do not become institutionalized in future years, (2) guidance and methods for meaningfully analyzing the data, and (3) the clarity of decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities while adapting to a new enterprise-wide approach.

Under current law, CHCOs serve as the principal liaison between their agencies and OPM regarding the human capital aspects of their agencies\u2019 missions. ACHO\u2019s shall conduct an IT workforce inventory and analyze the IT staff needs that are required under the guidance in the 25-point plan. This includes a summary analysis of the results of an assessment of: (1) all IT-related workforce categories, to include a description of the IT workforce inventory and the analysis conducted; (2) the IT workforce investment and alignment with the strategic direction of the agency; and (3) the progress on workforce goals in the agency\u2019s Annual Performance Plan. The CHCO must work with the CIO to ensure that the results of their efforts are included in the Annual IT and Human Capital Assessments (AITCA) submitted to OPM in July. As stated in the statute, this directive also includes requirements for agencies that are overseen and guided by OMB to perform and report on the IT workforce inventory and analyze their IT staff needs. The AITCA will use data and analyses from this inventory and report. Agencies will also use the results from this inventory during the performance review and rating process. READINESS ACTIONS FOR CIO/CHO INVENTORY DIRECTION:  In December 2015, the CHCO Council met to discuss the impact of FITARA on the CIO and CHO and the need for the CHO to be involved more in technology. Members agreed that an IT workforce inventory and analysis to meet requirements of FITARA should be coordinated between the CIO and CHO. The CIO/CHO inventory directive meets the legal and other requirements, including: Executive Order 13591, Creating Economic Opportunity for the Next Generation of Americans, July 2011, section 5(f) (\u201c\u2026the Director of OMB shall direct agencies to create new career paths in the public sector\u2026\u201d); and section 3(c) (\u201c\u2026the Director of OMB shall ensure, to the extent legally possible, that all new hires employed in the Federal Government within a competitive service by an agency are considered for employment within a new career path\u2026as identified by a director.\u201d); OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, November 2011, section 1-4.b.(5) (\u201c\u2026agencies should be increasingly more focused on their respective missions and the most efficient and effective accomplishment of their goals, objectives, and mission in an environment of effective and efficient fiscal disciplines\u2026\u201d); Memorandum of U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Improving Management of Human Capital, May 2010 (\u201cIncreased competition for top talent between the public and private sectors will require agencies to invest in and develop their ability to engage with the next generation of government employees and to provide them with opportunities to take leadership roles\u2026\u201d); PD-29, Requirements for a Performance-Based Organization, February 2016 (\u201cA performance-based organization (PBO) should not only be effective in getting work done, efficiently and well, but also in making the right choices, especially in light and uncertainty.\u201d). The National Security Agency (NSA) already has developed and is implementing an IT workforce inventory and analysis similar to what is required of other agencies through this directive. Their assessment process focuses on the IT workforce, but is very similar to what is required of agencies under this directive. Additionally, a study conducted in 2013 by the NSA, ODNI, and National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) was used to develop the ACHO Inventory and Analysis Guide, which provides information and resources to the CHOs to effectively lead the agency efforts.                                       4\nPRE-CONVENTION\nTHE PRE-CONVENTION GATHERING", "The future of space is of vital concern to the 21st Century warfighter, but DOD lacks the workforce to deliver space capabilities. As a result, there is a need to improve space acquisition workforce management to ensure the best people are assigned to meet the needs of the warfighter. The following is a synopsis of GAO-18-127. For a complete copy of this report, please visit  www.Gao.Gov. Please note, the summary is a brief overview of this acquisition study, the full report includes much more information. SUMMARlZATION GAO-18-127 Space Acquisition A. This report is GAO-18-127, issued on Monday, December 11, 2017. It is the fifth in a series of reports under the heading \"Future of Warfighting: Space Systems.\" This report examines the extent of DOD's space acquisition workforce. Our reporting objectives included, but were not limited to, 2. How is the workforce distributed among the different organizations? What is the size of the workforce? 3. What capabilities does the workforce need to effectively serve the needs of the warfighter? B. Summary. Space systems are used by the military and intelligence agencies for a wide range of mission needs for information collection and communication, weather prediction, and national reconnaissance. The future of space systems and how DOD manages those systems are of increasing concern to the warfighter,  but DOD lacks the workforce to deliver space capabilities. DOD does not have the information needed to fully manage its space workforce, but we have identified several actions it has already taken or that it could take to better manage it. GAO was asked to provide a better understanding of DOD's space acquisition workforce, but has decided not to issue a formal report. Instead, we are issuing this summary, which contains more limited information, and is intended for congressional use. Although we did not analyze all of the programs that DOD lists as belonging to its 82 programs in the space domain, our analysis of 13 programs indicated that most had staffing gaps in the work they needed to complete their space programs. However, only two programs had staffing shortfalls significant enough to affect mission outcomes. We estimate that there are 8,000 to 8,500 DOD military and civilian personnel identified as part of DOD's Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund funded workforce, or who are required to attend DOD space-centric 5. What acquisition processes do they need and how can they be developed or refined to ensure those needs are met? workforce training? What processes are used to transfer critical DOD space knowledge from one group or center to another? A. We analyzed 3,500 to 5,000 staff from four different DOD organizations, which included about 80 percent of DOD's 8,000 to 8,500 estimated space acquisition workforce funding level, 2017. For the remaining 20 percent, 1 the staff could not be verified from the data we could collect, or because they are not members of the defense acquisition workforce, or they were exempted from the reporting guidance. Further, staff at some DOD organizations declined to participate in our reviews. To identify the workforce needed to execute space plans, DOD could take steps such as, for example: defining its overall space mission; assessing the workforce needed to meet its space mission; and articulating a plan to determine when and how to fully implement that strategy (see figures 1, 2, and 3). Further, to address its space acquisitions, DOD has the authority to set direction and requirements, establish policies and procedures, and perform oversight of the Department. DOD also has the authority to act as a model organization. GAO has long reported that DOD needs to update its strategic plan for acquisition organization and workforce development. We recommend that DOD assess existing workforce requirements to determine when any gaps could be fully satisfied and develop a plan to fully implement that assessment. Specifically, we recommend that the Department of Defense, based on a review of its space acquisition workforce requirements: a. assess the workforce requirements against its future space program requirements to determine if additional workforce is required. If needed, set priorities and develop plans to implement those requirements, which could include rebalancing the workforce; determining the critical skills needed to deliver the space program requirements and assessing existing skill sets in light of the needs of the program; developing recruitment", "For initial NDA reviews, PDUFA has three sets of goals: FDA will decide to meet its PDUFA goal for the review timeline of applications for standard review if FDA\u2019s initial decision is received as of the following date: For applications designating certain pediatric conditions as an orphan indication, FDA will meet its PDUFA goal if FDA\u2019s initial decision is received within the following time frame: As part of the user fee negotiations, FDA also agreed to consider and take certain actions to streamline the drug review process, which are described in this report. These actions are intended to minimize, or reduce, the documentation required by FDA to determine drug safety and effectiveness (for example, to require smaller clinical trials), the review time required to determine the safety and effectiveness of a drug, and the documentation required to determine the eligibility of a drug for expedited review. To facilitate its efforts, FDA committed to specific actions. This information is important because a major goal of PDUFA is to facilitate the drug development process and achieve timelier review of new drugs through an increase in resources and funding. GAO was asked to review the actions and plans taken by FDA to streamline the drug review process as well as the progress made in meeting certain goals. To conduct our work, we reviewed FDA documents and interviewed FDA and other HHS officials, as necessary. WHAT GAO RECOMMENDS: To improve its implementation of the Cures Act, FDA should determine the extent to which the implementation of FDA\u2019s new authorities and the agency\u2019s activities under the new authorities reduce or eliminate the need for certain prescription drug applications.

The revised GPA has 20 parties (including the EU) covering 48 WTO member countries (including the 28 EU member countries). Another 33 WTO members are observers; of these, 10 are in the process of acceding to the agreement. In addition to the GPA, the United States has 14 FTAs with 20 countries, four of which (Canada, Israel, Singapore, and South Korea) are also parties to the GPA. Almost all of the FTAs to which the United States is a party include provisions covering government procurement. The GPA aims to mutually open government procurement markets for goods, services, and construction services among its parties, according to the WTO. Under the GPA, foreign suppliers are able to compete alongside with U.S. suppliers for USG contracts covered by the agreement, and U.S. suppliers are able to compete for covered foreign government contracts in accordance with the framework established by the GPA. According to the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), to implement U.S. obligations under the international agreements that cover government procurement, the United States\u2014generally (and not always) \u2014 waives preferential procurement requirements for goods and suppliers from other countries that are parties to the agreements in covered procurements over a certain threshold. However, small business set-asides are not waived nor are the provisions of the Berry Amendment. As part of our body of work on international government procurement, we have previously reported the following: The U.S. and EU government procurement markets are comparable in size, and each is larger than those of all other GPA and U.S. FTA partner countries combined. Some other parties to the agreements also have large government procurement markets, including Japan, South Korea, Norway, and Canada. The United States reported opening more procurement opportunities covered by the GPA and NAFTA and those not covered. Additionally, the Buy American Act does not apply to products that are purchased for use outside the United States, nor does it apply to the acquisition of services. Therefore, such contracts can be awarded without the application of Buy American Act domestic preference conditions to bids from any firm. To estimate foreign source procurement, we looked for information in government procurement databases. We estimated direct cross-border central government procurement and the portion comprising imported goods and services. We have limited data sets of contract information, which do not provide sufficient detail to make these estimation methods reliable or robust. The estimates we present are the most direct calculation possible given available procurement data. We did not perform an analysis for state and local governments, as there are a variety of procurement rules for these governments, and there is no single good source of this information. There are two ways in which government procurement can occur: at the level of national or regional governments, and at the level of state and local as well as foreign (subnational) entities. There are some international agreements that govern national and regional government procurement, the most-established being the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) of 1994. According to GPA provisions, a country may request a waiver for certain preferential procurement conditions in government contracting covered by the GPA. Countries that have done so, including the GPA parties, are required to inform the other parties of the waived procurement measures. As GPA waivers are made available through government procurement databases, the availability and amounts of such waivers can be determined. Additionally, there are a few bilateral and regional agreements that have been established to lower barriers to trade in government contracts, such as the FTAs that the United States has concluded with Australia, Korea, and Morocco. This report provides preliminary estimates of the values of GPA waivers and non-GPA government procurement contracts. Foreign source procurement can also be estimated through information on global trade in goods that may be provided by input-output (I-O) databases and trade data. We found I-O data that are used to develop national and regional industry data in the United States, and we analyzed these datasets to estimate value added for selected industries. The data presented relate to value-added trade in the industry sectors of construction, finance and insurance, transportation", "The United States Air Force (USAF) has long used manned aircraft for military and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, but this approach has also shown its limitations because manned ISR aircraft are not always able to operate in high-threat and contested airspace. Furthermore, manned aircraft are inherently single tasking, which can also affect the ability to fly ISR missions. Given these considerations, the Air Force has begun to employ remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs), or drones (officially designated as unmanned aircraft), in more advanced military roles. RPAs are cheaper to fly and operate, safer to fly, and can carry out missions where an equivalent manned platform is at great or even impossible risk of losing its crew. As of late December 2019, the Air Force operated RPAs using at least five different aircraft types across its four operational ISR squadrons (see sidebar \u201cBrief Description of Major USAF RPA Programs\u201d). These aircraft types were RQ-1 Predator, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, MQ-9 Reaper, and RQ-170 Sentinel. While all manned-aircraft pilots are required to undergo similar ground school, flight training, operations, and unit maintenance training, RPA pilots are able to complete these tasks separately for each aircraft they operate. Air crews that fly and maintain RPAs may have to also have technical and maintenance training to operate aircraft. The MQ-1/9, for example, has a six-man aircrew: pilot, sensor operator, and four maintenance personnel. Training for the Gray Eagle, which is designed as the Army\u2019s primary UAS, varies based on the operator. The U.S. Army trained 911 drone pilots in 2019, exceeding its year-on-year goal of at least 800 pilots. In this brief analysis, we present an overview of the RPA mission, its role in U.S. operations, and its impact on the future of U.S. air warfare.", "\u2022 Public safety entities currently operate LMR systems on the T-Band spectrum, and will be required to relocate as part of the requirements of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. For this reason, FCC officials have described the need to reassign spectrum for public safety purposes at this auction as \u201ccritical\u201d and auction proceeds are to be used to fund relocation costs; \u2022 When Congress previously required FCC to make the T-Band spectrum available for telecommunications services, it only identified nine metropolitan areas. Since the enactment of the Act, FCC has expanded the number of markets where required to conduct the auction to encompass all of the metropolitan areas within the continental United States that were not identified, and as such, FCC currently plans to auction this spectrum nationwide.", "The IRS has established a system whereby contractors must disclose their tax debts.\nTEXT: The FAR, among other things, sets forth requirements that must be met before agencies can award contracts to prospective contractors. Beginning February 26, 2016, contracting officers are required to include a provision in all contract solicitations that require contractors to report information about unpaid federal taxes, regardless of contract value. This applies to contracts that are bid, negotiated, or made using a simplified acquisition process. Specifically, FAR \u00a752.209-11 incorporates the language from fiscal years 2015/2016 (41 USCS \u00a7 47) and requires contractors to report in a contract bid if they owe $3,500 or more of unpaid federal taxes. The contracting officer cannot award to the contractor unless his government officials that decide to suspend or debar the contractor have done so.\nIn addition, FAR \u00a752.209-5 requires contractors to disclose delinquent tax debts and tax debts that have been assessed and reported by the contractor and are in excess of $3,500. The disclosure must be made on a certification included in all federal contracting bids.\nAgencies can take action against contractors who have not reported their federal tax debts, or failed to pay the disclosed debts, before the contract is awarded. This includes the exclusion of contractors from award, issuing instructions to the prime contractor to not subcontract, and debarring the company from federal contracting for a period of time. Moreover, contracting officers must determine whether contractors are \u201cqualified\u201d based on their disclosure of \u201cqualifying\u201d federal tax debts and excluded contractors from awards if the contractor is unqualified, unless the government grants a waiver for other than serious misconduct based on a review of the contractor's records, or a determination that the exclusion is not in the government's best interests.\nThis is necessary for two reasons: to prevent the misrepresentation or nonpayment of unpaid taxes, and ensure that contractors pay their taxes in full before the government awards contracts.\nCongress has amended the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-206), as well as the IRS statute at 26 USCS \u00a7 7213 to enable the disclosure of tax debts. All federal agencies are also directed to develop procedures for contractors and suppliers to electronically report their tax debts. IRS procedures require contractors to notify their corporate management of contract awards that have delinquent tax liabilities of $1 million or more, prior to award. Contracting agencies conduct a preaward review of tax liabilities and have the authority to exclude contractors who are a \u201cnonresponsible\u201d contractor, not a \u201cresponsible\u201d contractor, or is not of satisfactory performance based on the contractors\u2019 records pertaining to delinquent taxes. These procedures also set forth that agency contractors must comply with any preaward notices the IRS may provide and that any tax delinquencies must be repaid before the contract can be awarded.\nAdditionally, the IRS will make disclosure of federal tax debts possible under the Internal Revenue Discovery Act as amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAA \u00a79.104 (c)), and FAR Procedures 9.104 (c) for the certification of federal tax debts. This provision allows federal agencies to include in a contract solicitation and contract the certification of disclosure and certification of delinquent tax debts by a contractor pursuant to the Internal Revenue Discovery Act. As a result, each potential or actual federal contractor must: complete and submit IRS Form 8508-T to IRS electronically, provide to the prime contractor or to an office specified by the agency the certification of delinquent federal tax debts and delinquent federal nontax debts, and comply with administrative disclosure from the IRS.", "The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically managing its workforce. We first added federal strategic human capital management to our list of high-risk government programs and operations in 2001. Because skills gaps within individual federal agencies \u2014 as well as across the federal workforce \u2014 can lead to costly, less-efficient government, the issue has been identified as the focus of the strategic human capital management program in the GAO high-risk government programs and operations list since February 2011. Our experience has shown that the key elements of making progress in GAO high-risk areas are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders, grounded in the five criteria for removal from the GAO high-risk program, as well as any required congressional action. The five criteria for removal are: (1) leadership commitment, (2) agency capacity, (3) existence of a corrective action plan, (4) program monitoring, and (5) demonstrated progress. Although Congress, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and individual agencies have made improvements since 2001, federal human capital management remains a GAO high-risk issue because mission critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to the nation. GAO, along with OPM and individual agencies, has identified mission critical skills gaps in numerous government-wide occupations. These skills gaps both within federal agencies and across the federal workforce impede the government from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results. For example, VHA had opportunities to improve its recruitment and retention but did not consistently employ best practices, such as hiring for attitude, fit, and culture, in filling its medical center leadership positions. Specifically, VHA\u2019s failure to have standardized, documented procedures for hiring for attitude, fit, and culture meant that individual recruitment professionals had wide discretion to select candidates for interview, with no specific requirement to hire those who best fit established criteria for success. As a result, VHA was unable to provide specific examples of recent hiring efforts for which its human resources departments actively recruited and selected candidates based on attitude, fit, and culture. By contrast, other large civilian employers and federal agencies, including the U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, have incorporated attitude, fit, and culture into their recruitment and hiring practices. According to an expert panel of public and private sector authorities on recruiting and retention, when recruitment and hiring are effective, the impact extends beyond the individual new employees into an organization\u2019s culture. The report also provides specific recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs. STEWART L. BEAUSHAT: Hello and welcome to Federal News Radio for Federal Worker. I\u2019m Stewart BeAushat. In November, the Government Accountability Office added human capital management to its high risk program \u2014 calling it a serious and persistent deficiency. A report released today by the Government Accountability Office found that federal agencies still face challenges in strategically managing their workforces despite efforts to improve in this area. In 2001, the GAO added federal workforce management to its list of the top 25 government programs and operations with acute management and performance challenges. The GAO is expected to release a list of the most high-risk issues facing the federal government with its spring report, which is due out later this month. Today, agencies still face challenges to identifying mission- critical skills gaps within both individual agencies and across the federal workforce. The GAO said this results in the nation\u2019s ability to cost-effectively serve the public and achieve results. These challenges also resulted in federal agencies being ranked as less effective last year in a survey conducted by the non-partisan Partnership for Public Services. We will have more on this report when Congressional Hearing Week begins next week. For the latest in federal workplace news, stay tuned. I am Stewart BeAushat. This is Federal New Radio for Federal Workers. TEXT: GAO HR-18-117, January 10, 2018.

For example, the Department implemented an internal office, conducted a disparity assessment, and developed an action plan to address health equity, among other actions. VA is now beginning its third action plan aimed at advancing health equity, but has made no plan to evaluate the impact of its previous health equity actions. VA\u2019s Office of Health Equity (OHE) has experienced several leadership changes and has reduced FTEs during the past 8 years. We recommended VA monitor OHE\u2019s activities and provide input to OHE\u2019s plans to advance health equity.

Additionally, federal contractors and subcontractors are generally required to take affirmative action to ensure that all applicants and employees are treated without regard to these factors. Both EEOC and OFCCP have established MOUs with each other to encourage collaboration between the agencies. Both also share a common history of civil rights violations and discrimination complaints. EEOC uses charges of discrimination that are filed with the agency, as well as information that it gathers through its investigations, to develop systemic cases that it may prosecute. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2018, EEOC has filed thirteen (13) such cases, as compared to fifty-seven (57) throughout all of fiscal year 2018. The agency also filed twelve (12) enforcement suits in fiscal year 2018, as compared to twenty-two (22) in all of fiscal years 2016 and 2017 combined. As a result of the reduction in agency activities, there was a similar decline in the number of employment discrimination complaints it received from the public. In fiscal year 2018, the agency received 22,479 discrimination charges, which is 4 percent less than the number of charges that it received in fiscal year 2016 (23,313) and a decrease from the 24,989 charges received in fiscal year 2017. For its part, OFCCP files suit when necessary and reasonable to ensure that federal contractors and subcontractors maintain AAPs and make other required compliance with OFCCP procedures. In fiscal year 2018, OFCCP filed fourteen (14) compliance suits and four (4) other enforcement cases. In comparison, the agency filed thirteen (13) compliance and fifty (50) other enforcement suits in fiscal year 2017 and eighteen (18) compliance and fifty-four (54) other enforcement suits in fiscal year 2016. From 2009 through 2018, OFCCP successfully resolved a large number of complaints without filing a lawsuit or imposing a monetary fine. For example, in fiscal year 2018 OFCCP settled a total of three hundred twelve (312) complaints without prosecution. Under the MOU, EEOC will share investigative product that pertains to OFCCP regulations with OFCCP, in order to help identify systemic issues related to equal opportunity for federal contractor applicants and employees. In addition to the MOU, EEOC and OFCCP have also adopted procedures to protect confidential EEO-1 data, such as names and addresses. EEOC shares the confidential data with OFCCP only to the extent necessary for systemic investigations based on factors enumerated in the MOU.

Although contractors were required to ensure that health care services for TRICARE beneficiaries\u2014military personnel, their families, and veterans\u2014were uninterrupted during the transition, health care continuity was not maintained during the transition from August 2016 to October 2017. The TRICARE contractors in the East and West regions did not provide the services contractually required in 95 out of 548 cases due to a number of different reasons: late submission to DHA\u2019s oversight and validation activities; DHA errors in validating requirements and conducting transition management; contractors\u2019 failure to address the government\u2019s deficiencies and concerns regarding contract requirements; and contractors\u2019 failure to perform in accordance with government guidelines, transition guidance, regulations, and best practices throughout the transition.\nDHA\u2019s errors in validating requirements and transition guidance and its failure to conduct transition management were key drivers of the health care service continuity challenges that have negatively impacted beneficiaries. However, the most significant deficiencies in terms of the transition\u2019s continuity of services are related to contractor performance, particularly the new contractor\u2019s failure to identify the majority of 95 out of 548 cases as transition-in and transition-out conditions and to complete all required deficiency action plans. Had contractors followed DHA\u2019s transition guidance, transition protocols for health care continuity would have been established and implemented, potentially mitigating beneficiaries\u2019 inconveniences and difficulties.\nDuring the time span of this contract, over 1.6 million beneficiaries have transitioned through the TRICARE contracts. While each transition is different, contractor errors, such as missing contract requirements in transition plans and deficiency plans or validations, have resulted in some of the past TRICARE contract transitions being considered failures from the perspective of continuity of care and the associated service disruptions. DHA acknowledges these challenges and in April 2018, in an attempt to reduce the recurrence of these deficiencies, DHA produced an after- action report identifying lessons learned for future TRICARE contract transitions.\nTable 1 \u2013 A sample of transition-related health care service disruptions for beneficiaries related to TRICARE contractor performance\nNATIONAL: SUMMARIZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT: T-2017 is the fourth TRICARE region contract and, when implemented, represents more regional consolidation of TRICARE contracts than previous TRICARE acquisitions. The 2016 acquisition was the result of a procurement effort launched in 2011, with a total contract value of up to $19.6 billion. The T-2017 contracts were awarded to two existing contractors: Health Net Federal Services in the East region, and Humana in the West region. This is the second transition where Health Net Federal Services had responsibility for the T-2017 contract. The transition of the T-2017 contracts is the largest in TRICARE history, affecting over 1.6 million active duty and TRICARE beneficiaries and associated health care services. Health care service disruption and disruption to beneficiaries are one part of the success of the transition; however, disruptiveness should not interfere with or hinder beneficiary care or the continuity of care. The T-2019 contract is still under development by DHA and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) anticipates the 2013 congressional mandate to consolidate TRICARE will continue. This report\u2019s objectives are to (1) determine whether the T-2017 contract transition was effective and provided uninterrupted health care services to beneficiaries; and (2) assess contractor performance, identify lessons learned, and recommend actions to improve future transitions.\nNATIONAL: SUMMARIZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT: The 2016 acquisition was the result of a procurement effort launched in 2011, with a total contract value of up to $19.6 billion.

However, many of the challenges for OPM in this endeavor cannot be overcome absent significant changes to current law and policy. Until these barriers are surmounted, OPM will confront significant limitations in meeting its strategic goals.", "As we reported in October 2019, the federal government has invested in projects that may enhance climate resilience but does not have a strategic approach for investing in high-priority climate resilience projects. Some federal agencies have made individual efforts to manage climate change risk within existing programs and operations. However, federal investment in projects specifically designed to enhance climate resilience to date has been limited. In addition, our October 2019 update reported on our past work that shows an absence of government-wide action to strategically plan how to adapt to climate change. Specifically, four of our rating regressions regressed to \u201cnot met,\u201d with the other one remaining unchanged at \u201cnot met.\u201d Further, action toward implementing 14 of the 17 recommendations we have made to address this issue has not been taken. The federal government needs a strategic approach to address climate change risk. In September 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas, as a category 4 hurricane. Hundreds of thousands of people across southeast Texas and the Louisiana coast were forced to evacuate their homes. This was followed by Hurricane Irma, a category 5 storm, that made landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida, causing billions of dollars of damage, and then Hurricane Maria, a category 5 hurricane, that made landfall in Dominica, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These catastrophic hurricanes caused unprecedented damage in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, as well as devastation in other regions, such as the Caribbean. All three hurricanes resulted in tens of billions of dollars in damages. The National Climate Assessment released in 2018 states that warmer temperatures are projected to increase the intensity of heavy downpours and extreme rainfall events. The report forecasts the U.S. economy to expand in regions that are projected to experience greater amounts of flooded land by 2050, including those in Florida. The report also projects that by 2035, 10 of 26 U.S. seaports could experience port inundation. This means that flooding can reach the ports, making cargo and ship movement difficult or impossible. The report projects that by the end of the century, all 26 U.S. seaports could experience port inundation. It further states that a 10-day coastal flooding event in the Northeast that would typically happen once every 100 years between 2005 and 2050 could happen as often as three times a year within the same time frame. Without adaptation efforts, these climate impacts could be catastrophic and result in billions of dollars in damage and loss of life\u2014a key finding of the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s Climate Change Report. The federal government reported that in fiscal year 2018, federal agencies spent about $32.2 billion on disaster relief and flood control projects\u2014an amount that in the past has not been recovered in the form of taxes. Further, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, federal departments and agencies reported about $7 billion in disaster payments, of which more than half pertained to Hurricane Harvey. For example, a government official of one major federal agency said their agency spent approximately $11 billion as a direct response to Harvey, and the official expects the agency will spend another $10 billion for its response to Hurricane Maria. The federal government has taken several steps to invest in projects aimed at enhancing the resilience of infrastructure, such as levees, as well as buildings, agricultural land, and social services to future climate risks and weather events. For example, in fiscal year 2018 alone, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers invested $6.7 billion in projects related to flood protection and water resources. The Corps also completed an analysis of alternatives for projects intended to reduce the risk of flooding, and a Corps official is optimistic about the agency\u2019s continued progress on these risks. In a 2018 report on resilience investment, one official from the Department of Housing and Urban Development stated that his agency\u2019s Office of Environmental Affairs was in the process of developing a strategy on how his agency would address future climate risks. Similarly, in a 2018 memorandum on adaptation, the Department of Homeland Security Director of the National Infrastructure Assurance Commission", "(1) According to DOD guidance, ACSAs may only be entered into between certain U.S. federal entities; (2) In DOD\u2019s view, there is a general tendency to favor ACSAs when entering into transactions that are non-traditional in nature; (3) The Defense Logistic Agency has sole authority to enter into logistic transactions, although DOD is developing alternatives to ACSAs that could provide opportunities for additional transaction types; and (4) DOD officials noted certain ACSAs provide transaction authority to certain contractors, who may enter into commercial transactions with foreign partners under the ACSAs. PAGES 1-47 54 STATES ACSAs. According to DOD officials, this guidance also calls for program and financial information to be maintained on each ACSA program. DOD officials also stated that the OUSD (A&S) is responsible for maintaining accurate records of all authorized ACSAs and determining whether the ACSA process should be used. DOD directives, on the other hand, generally provide the authority for managing ACSAs and provide specific responsibilities at the program manager and financial management levels. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation (DFAR 234) details the responsibilities of program and contracting officers as well as the responsibilities of financial management personnel in managing ACSAs, including the obligation to collect all pertinent information and to maintain adequate records of all information regarding each ACSA program. As of February 2020, DOD maintained records for 125 ongoing ACSAs, and there were 36 expired, but currently active ACSAs. The records maintained in the ACSA program management database can provide information about each ACSA partner country, such as whether a country is eligible for a new ACSA, whether an ACS has been revised, and what the terms of the agreement are. GAO noted the ACSA program management database contained data that was dated as of November 2019, and had not been updated since that time. ACSAs are generally not considered contracts under the FAR. As a result, ACSAs are not subject to the various regulations regarding contract administration and management of commercial contracts. Rather, DOD has specific regulations in DFARS 234.2 and 234.203 related to ACSAs that are to be followed by military departments and defense agencies, with certain exceptions. According to DOD officials, the DOD Components are primarily responsible for managing and administering ACSAs, including monitoring the quality of financial and performance information, authorizing payment of foreign expenses, and maintaining accounting and administrative records. GAO\u2019s analysis of ACSAs as of December 2018 identified the following as some of the key terms included in the agreements: 19 out of the 130 ACSAs (14%) listed a specific period of performance and expirability. 106 of the 130 ACSAs (80%) listed specific transaction types. 042 of the 130 ACSAs (33%) did not specify any particular expiration date. 66 of the 130 ACSAs (51%) did not list any terms and conditions after the initial term expires and the agreement may simply be extended. ACSAs DOD has identified as \u201clong term\u201d tended to have more robust terms and conditions compared to agreements identified as \u201cmodular.\u201d GAO analysis identified certain transaction codes in the contracting logistic system of records that might be used for future non-traditional logistics transactions, such as ACSAs. According to DOD officials, for ACSA activities, transaction codes such as contract logistics support and 11X are typically identified for the 53 27% of 130 ACSAs (41) listed terms and conditions related to expiration. Most of these ACSAs also listed expiration, but 019 did not list any expiration date. 66 of the 130 ACSAs (50%) did not specify any particular expiration date. 76 or 60% of the ACSAs reported in the DOD database, reported expiring after 2012. 6 of the 27 (22%) reporting ACSAs with expiration terms indicated no expiration date, compared to those that provided specific terms (3%) and expiration date (1%) indicating no expiration after the initial period of performance. In addition, 476 of these ACSAs, representing almost 100% of all ACSAs", "Immigration-related offenses are crimes at the federal level. We provided a summary of the federal criminal prosecution process followed by the Department of Justice (DOJ); the United States Attorneys\u2019 (USAOs) offices on the southwest border; and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Border Patrol agents in the southwest border region, for the purposes of criminal prosecution of these immigration-related offenses. In our prior work, we reported that immigration-related prosecutions are increasingly concentrated in certain USAO districts, particularly the five southwest border districts. As of early July 2017, immigration- related prosecutions comprised nearly 82 percent of all of USAO activity in the five southwest border districts. For fiscal years 2015 and 2016, there were roughly 32 federal prosecutions of illegal reentry per month in these districts compared to 9 the prior year. In these border districts, Border Patrol data show that a majority of immigrants apprehended have little to no prior criminal history. Given these trends we agreed to review (1) how and when USAOs along the southwest border decided to refer immigration- related prosecutions to federal prosecutors, (2) how USAOs prioritized immigration cases among other criminal cases in these judicial districts, and the factors that led USAOs to prioritize one type of case over another, and (3) what steps USAOs took to implement the Attorney General\u2019s April 2017 memorandum mandating such priorities. For this review, we obtained data from seven USAOs on improper entry, illegal reentry, and aggravated felony prosecutions for fiscal years 2015-2017, and from DHS on Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border for fiscal years 2015 through September 2016. We interviewed USAOs officials from the five southwest border USAOs and Border Patrol agents, as well as staff from DHS Headquarters and its component, Customs and Border Protection. We conducted telephonic interviews at our offices and visited the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona. We also reviewed DOJ guidance and policies, legislative and USAO directives and press releases, department training presentations, and court proceedings. To address our objectives, we reviewed DOJ orders and memoranda dating from 1982. We determined that the five southwest border USAOs in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, prioritized the prosecution of immigration-related cases in fiscal year 2017. Specifically, in response to the Attorney General\u2019s April 2017 memorandum, these five USAOs made changes to their practices\u2014such as expanding the definition and scope of criminal prosecution priorities or increasing monitoring and evaluation of prosecutions. The USAOs also instituted additional efforts, such as providing more guidance to prosecutors and changing internal training for all prosecutors. We identified two USAOs that were prioritizing immigration prosecutions prior to the Attorney General\u2019s April 2017 memorandum in response to changes implemented by DHS, including increased arrests and prosecutions. In one district, immigration-related cases for fiscal year 2016 represented 44 percent of all federal cases prosecuted. A USAO official in another district said these officials are, in general, receptive to changes in the priorities of the district. For example, prior to the April 2017 memorandum, this office had begun prosecuting Border Patrol apprehensions of immigrants based on certain \u201caggravated felony\u201d charges\u2014particularly those involving firearms violations, human trafficking, and murder or murder with a racially motivated element. Our review of these cases from fiscal year 2015 through 2017 showed that a majority of initial case referrals in this district for immigration-related cases involved some form of misdemeanor, with a minority involving a felony. A USAO official told us that the office planned to prioritize prosecutions of felonious Border Patrol apprehensions of immigrants\u2014even for those who were entering the United States for the first time without authorization. Prosecutors there determined that these types of cases were less resource-intensive and more likely to result in successful prosecutions and convictions. We observed five USAOs prioritized immigration-related prosecutions in both the preliminary stages of making charging dec", "Table 1 provides an overview of tax-time financial products based on information gathered during our review. The tax-time financial products industry consists of four main groups of participants: banks, paid providers of tax preparation services, settlement service providers, and software developers. Providers of tax preparation services include paid tax return preparers or electronic return originators (ERO). Not all tax preparers are EROs, but because IRS generally requires returns to be filed electronically for tax preparers filing more than 10 returns, tax preparers generally work with or for an ERO that also may be a tax preparer. Paid preparers and EROs offer their services in-person, on the Internet, or through software sold to taxpayers. They generally offer different refund disbursement options to taxpayers and may partner with banks to offer tax-time financial products. Software developers provide software needed to file tax returns electronically and offer tax-time financial products through their software to taxpayers. The largest tax preparation companies have their own software that allows them to prepare returns as well as offer tax-time financial products. Applications for the products generally can be completed through the same software used to file the return. Banks provide tax-time financial products. They also may approve and process application s for tax products and perform settlement services (discussed below). Settlement service providers serve as intermediaries in transactions to deliver tax-time products. They work with banks to accept and process applications for tax products and provide distribution instructions to banks. Some banks have affiliates that perform settlement services, and some banks perform these functions themselves. Figure 1 illustrates the roles of these groups, using the example of a refund transfer transaction. The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that banks throughout the financial system operate in a safe and sound manner and comply with banking laws and regulations in the provision of financial services. At the federal level, banks are supervised by one of the following three prudential regulators and CFPB: iii The Federal Reserve supervises state-chartered banks that opt to be members of the Federal Reserve System, bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies (and the non-depository institution subsidiaries of those organizations), and non-federally chartered banks for which the FDIC is appointed by the Federal Reserve as the bank supervisor. FDIC supervises all FDIC-insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System as well as state savings associations and insures the deposits of all banks and thrifts approved for federal deposit insurance. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) supervises federally chartered national banks, federal savings associations (federal thrifts), and certain other entities that are not chartered as banks by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. CFPD has rulemaking authority to implement provisions of federal consumer financial protection laws from multiple federal regulators to CFPB. Additionally, for the transferred laws such as Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority for banks with assets of more than $10 billion and any affiliates of such institutions. The three prudential regulators also are responsible for supervising other federal consumer financial protection laws and examining tax products and tax-time product providers. ii The three prudential regulators generally conduct full-scope, on-site examinations of all banks and thrifts every 12-18 months. The on-site examination process includes supervisory recommendations and findings, reviews of compliance with regulations, and tests of controls. Specifically for tax products, the regulators will evaluate the effectiveness of financial institutions\u2019 tax product policies and procedures, including their marketing, sale, and underwriting practices with respect to tax products. Financial institutions that sell tax-time financial products face greater reputational and legal risk (for example, from enforcement actions for unfair, deceptive, or prohibited practices) in the event of poor execution, marketing, or compliance practices, so managing that risk requires that financial institutions monitor those practices. The prudential regulators generally conduct similar reviews for providers of tax-time financial products and affiliated settlement service providers. The prudential regulators will also examine the extent to which, and how effectively, banks and other financial institutions monitor providers\u2019 and settlement service providers\u2019 practices and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OCC also conducts nationwide examinations, focused on banks\u2019 tax product policies and practices, for purposes related to its supervision. In addition, the IRS", "According to FCC, caller ID services became commonplace due to technology developed in the 1980s, and caller ID information transmitted with the call could generally be trusted by the call recipient. However, FCC found that as voice service providers migrated to Internet Protocol (IP) networks, these technologies lessened the overall accuracy and reliability of the information presented to the call recipient. Caller ID allows the recipient of an incoming call to determine the telephone number of the caller and, in some cases, the name. This information helps the recipient to make informed decisions about which calls to accept or ignore. While the number and name displayed on the caller ID may be associated with the caller, a caller can also deliberately falsify or \u201cspoof\u201d the information transmitted to the caller ID display to disguise the source of the call. Under the current telephone system, this information, true or false, is conveyed to the call recipient unless the caller requests that such information not be conveyed. Caller ID spoofing is widespread. Many instances of spoofing are legal. For example, spoofing is legally used by professionals such as doctors who want to use their cell phones to return calls to patients, but choose to transmit their office number instead. Spoofing also often accompanies robocalls\u2014an automated telephone call which delivers a recorded message. Certain types of robocalls are illegal, such as robocalls for sales pitches unless companies have consumers\u2019 explicit written permission to call. In addition, telemarketers may not call home or mobile numbers that consumers have registered in the National Do Not Call Registry, which was established through legislation and is maintained by FTC\u2014and they must transmit their telephone number and, if possible, their name, to the call recipient\u2019s caller ID service. According to FCC, advancements in technology have made it inexpensive and easy to make robocalls. As telecommunications systems have transitioned from traditional wireline services, to IP networks, the cost of making phone calls has dropped dramatically. IP-based service allows any individual or organization to send a very large number of robocalls at a minimal cost. IP-based services have also made it inexpensive and easy to spoof caller ID information, such as a phone number, to appear as though it originated from a region or area other than an individual\u2019s actual location. (See fig. 1.) FCC, FTC, and DOJ each enforce different laws within their respective jurisdictions to curb illegal spoofing and robocalls. FCC enforces rules requiring any caller who intentionally disguises or falsifies the truth or the origin of any call to provide the name of the entity on whose behalf the call is placed. FCC also enforces rules related to robocalls, including rules prohibiting a person from using autodialers to deliver live calls or text messages unless the person has written consent from the consumer to which the calls were made. FCC and FTC each maintain consumer complaint databases where consumers can report violations of federal telecommunications laws. In addition to FCC and FTC, the telecommunications industry, including voice service providers and third party companies, have taken steps to combat illegal spoofing and robocalls, which are widespread. FTC enforces rules protecting consumers from false or misleading caller ID information. These rules require that any caller information be \u201caccurate, truthful, not misleading in any material respect, not to omit material information, and if made through an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS), will state the identity of the entity on whose behalf the call is being made.\u201d For more information about FTC\u2019s regulation of robocalls and FCC\u2019s regulation of interconnected VoIP service, go to the following Web sites: www.ftc.gov/robocalls and www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/caller-id-services. In March 2015, FCC proposed rules under the Truth in Caller ID Act, an act which prohibits any person from transmitting a misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. It also prohibits any person from altering or changing the source, route, path, or destination of a telephone call to disguise the identity or other caller identification information of the caller. Under the rules, FCC would apply its existing Do Not Call provisions to prevent entities from displaying false and misleading caller ID display information, including information displayed on Internet Protocol-based calls such as VoIP, text,", "Medicare beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions have a diverse range of conditions, of different severity, requiring different types of care. Beneficiaries with mild behavioral health conditions\u2014such as mild depression\u2014may require less complex care than beneficiaries with serious behavioral health conditions\u2014such as schizophrenia\u2014or with multiple interacting behavioral or physical health conditions. Subpopulations of Medicare beneficiaries also may face different behavioral health challenges. For example, dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid\u2014are three times more likely to have been diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder than non-dual beneficiaries. Medicare covers services for the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health conditions, which includes the inpatient care covered by Part A and the physician services and outpatient care covered by Part B. Key behavioral health services in Medicare Part B include visits with a physician or other covered provider, partial hospitalization program services, annual depression screening, alcohol misuse screening and counseling, psychotherapy, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment services, and behavioral health integration services. Dual-eligible beneficiaries may be able to access additional behavioral health services through Medicaid that are not available through Medicare. Medicare covers behavioral health services delivered by a range of providers, including psychiatrists and physicians, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers (LCSW), nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists. In order to bill for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, providers must enroll with CMS. Providers who do not want to enroll in the Medicare program may \u201copt out\u201d of Medicare. Behavioral health providers have among the highest opt-out rates, with over 7,000 psychiatrists, psychologists, and LCSWs opting out of Medicare, representing nearly one-third of all providers who opted out of Medicare in 2017. CMS is required by law to provide information annually to Medicare beneficiaries about their coverage, including benefits and limitations on payment. Various factors affect how beneficiaries receive and process information about their behavioral health care. According to HHS, low health literacy is a key barrier that impacts individuals\u2019 ability to comprehend health-related information. More specific challenges facing individuals with behavioral health conditions include the stigma surrounding behavioral health conditions that, in some cases, discourage individuals from seeking help or treatment. According to CMS, one-third (36 percent) of Medicare beneficiaries in 2019 were enrolled in MA plans, which CMS pays on a monthly capitated basis to deliver all covered services needed by an enrollee. According to the MA plan officials we interviewed, prior authorization\u2014a utilization management strategy\u2014may be employed for high-cost treatments. One study found access to psychiatrists to be more limited than any other behavioral health provider. In some cases, stigma surrounding mental health may cause individuals to avoid seeking treatment.\u201d Pages 50 \u2013 51 of the full report (pages 474-475 of the PDF) at the second and third sets of asterisks in the sentence above.

See pages 33-35 for an explanation of how GAO cites to its reports.\n\u201cMA plans that we reviewed reported that one of the primary reasons MA plans have difficulty recruiting and retaining behavioral health providers is that many private practice behavioral health providers are not interested in participating in managed care. According to these plans, this is primarily due to differences between MA organization contracts and provider contracts, such as a lack of prior authorization requirements and the difficulty in determining the reason for which a member is visiting a behavioral health provider. One MA official stated, \u201c[H]ealth care has not changed as rapidly as technology has and as a consequence, behavioral health providers see a dis", "The deputy assistant secretary of defense (DASD) for nuclear matters oversees the Department of Defense (DOD) nuclear mission, providing advocacy for DOD\u2019s nuclear programs and working extensively with national, state, and political leaders in congressional districts. The position also involves coordination of many national-level nuclear-themed policy discussions in the Executive Branch, particularly within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the Joint Staff, and the Nuclear Weapons Council. The DASD also oversees the DOD components (military departments and defense agencies) responsible for and accountable to the Department for nuclear policies and programs. The position is a Principal Staff Assistant at the Senior Executive Service level, reporting to the DASD for Nuclear Matters. The DASD reports directly to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Key Duties: The DASD for Nuclear Matters provides day-to-day guidance on all national security aspects of the nuclear mission, and acts as principal advisor to the Director, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters and to the Secretary of Defense on matters relating to planning, organizing, and directing DOD\u2019s nuclear policy formulation and implementation processes, nuclear force integration, deterrent postures and strategies, and nuclear enterprise sustainment. The DASD is responsible for developing strategies and concepts, including for modernization projects, that contribute to national security and ensure nuclear deterrence and assurance. In particular, the DASD provides specific leadership and guidance on all aspects of nuclear strategy, operational and strategic planning, deterrence and assurance, posture, nuclear forces, readiness and sustainment, as well as resourcing of DOD programs. The DASD also serves as the lead Nuclear Issues Staff Assistant (NISSA) in the OSD, advising the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and DOD Directorates on the formulation and implementation of national security policies regarding nuclear strategy and operations, countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), C4ISR, missile defense, and cyber security.

The NISSA role is to monitor and execute nuclear policy throughout the Executive Branch, and report through the NISSA to the Presidential Assistant for National Security Affairs. The DASD provides oversight of DOD programs that maintain the nation\u2019s deterrent capabilities and provides military support to the United States Department of Energy, which has primary jurisdiction over the U.S. nuclear force. 56", "Drugs sold in the United States\u2014including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished dosage forms\u2014are manufactured throughout the world. According to FDA, as of August 2019 about 70 percent of establishments manufacturing APIs and more than 50 percent of establishments manufacturing finished drugs for the U.S. market were located overseas.\nAs of March 2019, FDA data showed that India and China had the most manufacturing establishments shipping drugs to the United States, with about 40 percent of all foreign establishments in these two countries. (See fig. 1.) FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of all drugs marketed in the United States, regardless of where they are manufactured. Drugs manufactured overseas must meet the same statutory and regulatory requirements as those manufactured in the United States. FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) establishes standards for the safety, quality, and effectiveness of, and manufacturing processes for, over-the-counter and prescription drugs. CDER requests that FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) inspect both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure that drugs are produced in conformance with applicable laws of the United States, including current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) regulations. FDA investigators generally conduct three main types of drug manufacturing establishment inspections: preapproval inspections, surveillance inspections, and for-cause inspections, as described in table 1. At times, FDA may conduct an inspection that combines both preapproval and surveillance inspection components in a single visit to an establishment. FDA uses multiple databases to select foreign and domestic establishments for surveillance inspections, such as its registration database and inspection database. Some foreign establishments may register because, in foreign markets, registration may erroneously convey an \u201capproval\u201d or endorsement by FDA, when in fact the establishment may never have been inspected by FDA. In our report, we recommended that FDA take steps to improve the accuracy and completeness of information in its catalog of drug establishments subject to inspection. We also recommended that FDA clarify the types of information required for preapproval and postapproval product manufacturing inspections in establishments that export or have exported drugs to the United States, among other recommendations. In the course of our work, we noted that FDA was in the process of implementing revised guidance for preapproval inspections that FDA released to explain some aspects of this work.\nAs of August 2019, FDA had developed and released guidance to address all of the recommendations. Specifically, for our audit, we addressed the extent to which FDA is inspecting foreign drug establishments that are shipping or have shipped drugs for the U.S. market. A foreign drug establishment is one that is domiciled in a foreign country or is located in a country covered by an applicable free trade agreement  The Foreign Inspections Program\u2014an element of the overall CBE program\u2014is carried out in three main steps of oversight: preapproval inspection of drug establishments, which is typically conducted before a drug can be marketed in the United States; surveillance inspection and maintenance inspection of drug establishments; and postapproval inspection of drug establishments. In the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the rate of FDA\u2019s inspections of foreign drug establishments.\nAs table 2 shows, through calendar year 2016, FDA conducted about three-fifths of its foreign drug inspections in China and India. The next most common countries were Brazil, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Mexico, Belgium, and Spain. In fiscal year 2017, about one-third of FDA\u2019s foreign drug inspections were carried out in China, with India, Brazil, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates making up the remainder of the top seven most frequently inspected countries. In fiscal year 2018, two-thirds of FDA\u2019s foreign drug inspections were conducted in China, India, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, and the United States of America, in that order. In fiscal year 2019 to August 2019, one-third of FDA\u2019s foreign drug inspections were carried out in Mexico, with China, India, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, and Singapore making up the rest of the top seven most", "The 10 programs that state and local entities reported using to meet whole family needs all generally target or serve low-income families and offer a mix of services and other supports. The programs tend to offer services that address aspects of families\u2019 healthy development. The majority of these programs (7 of 10, or 70 percent) focus on promoting parents\u2019 employment or economic security and families\u2019 economic self-sufficiency in the form of financial support, education, and/or employment. In addition, all of the programs require families to participate in service or employment activities\u2014particularly in terms of parental engagement in children\u2019s education\u2014to receive benefits. State and local entities generally view these programs as helpful in encouraging parents\u2019 self-sufficiency and in improving children\u2019s well-being, and they often combine the services when offering support to families. However, state and local entities are generally not happy with these programs\u2014in terms of both their quality and outcomes. The programs, state and local stakeholders told GAO, tend to be burdensome and difficult to navigate. The stakeholders believe there are aspects of these programs that could be improved so that families gain from them consistently and state and local officials can better use them to serve families. Although stakeholders expressed a need for data to evaluate the programs\u2019 effectiveness, they noted that data was not readily available in some cases due to privacy and security requirements, among others. GAO provided information for improving data collection on the effectiveness of the 10 programs. We believe that this assessment is useful in considering the types of services best suited for low-income families to improve their employment and economic security and/or education and training outcomes.\nBACKGROUND. Federal agencies administer over 80 programs designed to provide aid to people with low incomes. These programs serve diverse populations, including low-income families with children; individuals with disabilities; the homeless; and low-income persons, including older adults, with limited resources\u2014 including low incomes, high levels of risk, and high levels of need\u2014to meet their basic needs, according to HHS. Furthermore, among its programs, HHS administers six Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs that target cash assistance to low-income families with children\u2014including the TANF program itself, which provides cash assistance to low-incoming families with children for up to 60 months (4 years). Also, among its programs, DOL administers the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which provides funding to states to provide job training and employment services, including for low-income persons. In addition, the 10 federal programs GAO assessed were also generally provided to low-income families with children who meet eligibility criteria. These 10 programs have generally been in place for some time. State and local stakeholders told GAO that state and local entities have increasingly been coordinating the programs to provide services for low-income families with children. In addition to having service-coordination arrangements for some low-income families, states are creating service-coordination arrangements for families at greater risk of developing poor outcomes. In addition, ACF recently announced plans to support whole-family approaches to its programs. Further, Congress has reported an interest in evaluating the effectiveness of these programs because of congressional concern about the effectiveness of TANF programs and the federal government\u2019s spending on them (see figure).\nAs these stakeholders continued to express a need for improved quality data to evaluate the performance of programs generally, HHS and DOL\u2014through the agencies\u2019 collaboration efforts\u2014created a framework to identify performance indicators that would be the most useful and relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of these programs. The data would also be the type of data suitable for reporting in the Annual Report.  See GAO-15-479, Low-Income and Postsecondary-School Age Youth: Performance Data Framework To Evaluate the Effectiveness of the TANF Program and Other TANF-Funded Programs (Washington, DC: Jun 3, 2015) for information on an evaluation framework created to identify performance indicators that are the most relevant.  These types of improvements would serve both programs and families.\nRECOMMENDATIONS. GAO is recommending that HHS and DOL collect more robust and comprehensive data, consistent with best practice, on the effectiveness of the 10 programs. GAO is also making recommendations about how the agencies can help federal and state stake", "In fiscal year 2017 we had 6,000 jobs at Hewlett Packard located in Corvallis, OR. We had 350 employees working on the 5th floor. The 4th floor was not occupied at the time of our audit engagement.  The fifth floor is comprised of open and closed areas. A large part of the fifth floor was used as a training facility.  5th floor: training area, conference, meeting rooms, restrooms, cafeteria, 4th floor: unused  The majority of the fifth floor was used as a training facility by our employees. The training facility contained an IT data center and an AMP Data Center. The training facility contained various office cubicles and open office spaces containing servers, laptops, computers, and other equipment. HP has 4,000 PCs, laptops, and other computer devices that contained and transmitted sensitive and non\u2011 sensitive personally identifiable company data such as employee payroll data and employee benefits data.  At the time of our audit engagement in September 2017, HP management indicated that they stored some of this company and client data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, usernames, and password in a database. The database was an encrypted database that was held at our Corvallis, OR data center.  Our client, HP manages their IT security and employee identifiable data internally.     2016-2017 fiscal year, and it was 99% of the total STEP award funding, $8.25million. The other award recipients included the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Japan, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Guam. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, for 5 of the 7 grant cycles, SBA awarded all of the STEP funds for these grants and OIT did not use any carryover funds. For the only two grant cycles that did contain carryover funds, OIT did not use any of that non-competed grant funds.          SUMMARIES: (a)(1) TRAINING  AUDIT FINDINGS: HP provided IT, sales, and other training for our employees. Most of the training occurred in the 5th 5th floor training facility. The 5th floor contained multiple conference, training and meeting rooms. HP had 4 conference meeting rooms that were not used for meeting rooms. HP had 1 conference (room) that was set up for training for HP employees. There were approximately 20 conference, meeting, training tables in that room. Employees used all the tables, but approximately 60 employees could work in that room at the same time. HP was limited in the amount of employees that could use the meeting room, due to a lack of tables. The conference table were removed from the meeting room and some employee\u2019s would work at their desk and the employees at the meeting room table. There were not enough tables to accommodate all the employees that needed to have training. HP did provide training for employees at the datacenter (room) located at the 5th floor in that facility.    The conference (room) also contained approximately 10-15 laptops, computers, servers, data back up equipment, server racks. The datacenter contained approximately 10-15 servers, laptops , computers, storage, and other devices. The laptops, computers, and other devices were placed on a desk in the datacenter. Many of the laptops, computers, and other devices were used to train employees on how to use the products and the IT equipment.   OVERALL OBJECTIVES: The audit objective was to evaluate HP\u2019s policies on the security, use, and disposal of the equipment.    AUDIT OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HP has appropriate IT equipment disposition, management and control policies and procedures in place that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its IT equipment.                5th 5th floor, there were approximately 45 closed office, and 10 open cubicles containing servers, laptops, computers and other equipment. The training facility was used for multiple functions. The training facility was used for training, meetings, and other various activities.

It has developed mitigating actions to address these risks, but may not have the information it needs to effectively manage its risk. WHY WE DID THIS REVIEW The 2020 Census is the most expensive and most complex decennial census in U.S. history. With its own unique set of challenges and circumstances, the 2020 Census must overcome a number of obstacles to achieve its objective of a complete and accurate count. This objective is especially challenging due to the changing environment in which the population lives, works, and is counted. Given the complex nature of this endeavor, the Bureau cannot afford to be complacent in preparing for the decennial count that begins in 2018. It must take on an entrepreneurial spirit to continuously adapt to this changing environment so that it can complete an effective decennial enumeration. In addition, the Bureau must use modern, innovative cost- effective approaches in order to reduce the 2020 Census program cost and to maximize the return on investment. These two objectives\u2014reducing risk to ensure a complete and accurate count and reducing program cost and maximizing the return on investment while protecting enumeration quality\u2014are at the forefront of the Bureau\u2019s strategy for conducting the 2020 Census. In this context, it is essential that the Bureau\u2019s strategy for mitigating risks to the 2020 Census takes advantage of best practices and cutting-edge methods. We conducted this performance audit to answer the following questions: \u2022 Does the Bureau have an effective approach for identifying and managing risks for the 2020 Census program? We assessed the Bureau\u2019s approach to managing risks facing the 2020 Census, including the Bureau\u2019s risk assessments, risk mitigation activities, and risk management plans. We identified the key processes the Bureau used to assess risks for the 2020 Census and examined the actions taken to mitigate identified risks to the 2020 Census. We identified examples of actions taken to mitigate a range of risks faced by the 2020 Census. We assessed the Bureau\u2019s processes for managing risks associated with the Bureau\u2019s Systems Engineering work and for measuring and managing performance in its systems acquisition efforts We assessed whether actions taken to mitigate risks included a well-defined process that was consistently followed by the Bureau\u2019s risk management staff. We determined whether the Bureau had an integrated approach to developing and monitoring performance against cost and schedule targets, and whether the Bureau used best practices to manage risks in this effort.

SUMMARY (Page 2 of 6) FEDERAL AND CORPORATE FRAUD COST BILLIONS WORLDWIDE EVERY YEAR It\u2019s important to note that in the past year alone, according to the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, fraud cost health care providers, individuals and insurance providers an estimated total of $50 billion. In a recent survey by Health Care Fraud Net and Inventiv, respondents cited that fraud is their biggest challenge, but only 19% of respondents cited it as their top priority. FRAUD HAS EXPLODED OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS FRAUD has been growing, and will continue to grow, as the population ages, as the number of people who are disabled increases, and as technology advances. FRAUD COSTS TO TAXPAYERS, CORPORATIONS, INDIVIDUALS, NON PROFITS, AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE HUGE It\u2019s important to note that in the past year alone, according to the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, fraud cost health care providers, individuals and insurance providers an estimated total of $50 billion. In a recent survey by Health Care Fraud Net and Inventiv, respondents cited that fraud is their biggest challenge, but only 19% of respondents cited it as their top priority. FRA", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: We reported in September 2017 that, while estimates of the economic effects of climate change are imprecise because of modeling and certain information limitations, they can convey useful insight into broad themes of potential damages in the United States. We reported that, according to two nation-scale studies that examined the impacts of climate change on various sectors of the United States, potential economic effects could be significant, and these effects will likely increase over time for most sectors analyzed. For example, for 2020 through 2039, one of the studies estimated from $4 billion to $6 billion in annual property damage costs from rising sea levels and coastal storms, for example (see Figure 1). This is consistent with the findings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment that rising sea levels from climate change threaten the United States\u2019 coastal economy. We reported in September 2017 that information on the potential economic effects of climate change can help federal managers more effectively manage climate risk, consistent with the views of various experts that we reported on. Among other things, experts and our prior work have noted that risk management efforts should start with understanding the potential costs of climate change, in order to start developing options for managing this risk. As we concluded in September 2017, the federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks in many areas, and this exposure will likely continue to rise. For example, we reported that the federal government is projected to spend nearly $5 billion through 2020 in disaster response, such as those related to flooding. Since September 2017, two major hurricanes have hit the United States, with significant damage costs.", "The 1989 law is still in use and the law that is used by FCC has never been modified or revised.  Because of this, the 1989 law is now over 30 years old.", "Drugs sold in the United States\u2014including active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms\u2014are manufactured throughout the world. According to a May 2019 FDA report, in fiscal year 2018 about 40 percent of establishments manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market were located domestically and more than 60 percent of establishments manufacturing for the U.S. market were located overseas. As of March 2019, FDA data show that India and China had the most manufacturing establishments shipping drugs to the United States, with about 40 percent of all foreign establishments in these two countries. (See fig. 1.) Drugs manufactured overseas must meet the same statutory and regulatory requirements as those manufactured in the United States. FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) establishes standards for the safety, quality, and effectiveness of, and manufacturing processes for, over-the-counter and prescription drugs. CDER requests that FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) inspect both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure that drugs are produced in conformance with applicable laws of the United States, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. FDA uses multiple databases to select foreign and domestic establishments for surveillance inspections, including its registration database and inspection database. Because the establishments are continuously changing as they begin, stop, or resume marketing products in the United States, CDER creates an establishment catalog monthly. The catalog is prioritized for inspection twice each year. In our 2008 report we found that, because of inaccurate information in FDA\u2019s databases, the agency did not know how many foreign drug establishments were subject to inspection. For example, some establishments included in FDA\u2019s registration database may have gone out of business and did not inform FDA that they had done so or did not actually manufacture drugs for the U.S. market. In our 2010 and 2016 reports we found that FDA had taken steps to improve the accuracy and completeness of information in its catalog of establishments subject to inspection, such as using contractors to conduct site visits to verify the existence of registered foreign establishments and confirm that they manufacture the products that are recorded in U.S. import records. Through this process, CDER develops a ranked list of foreign and domestic establishments selected for inspection that is submitted to ORA. To be efficient with its resources, according to FDA officials, ORA staff may shift the order of establishments to be inspected on CDER\u2019s prioritized list based on geographic proximity to other planned inspection trips. Investigators", "Section 610 of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) established public notice and comment requirements for new demonstrations and extensions. Section 6002(ee) of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) expanded the provisions of section 610 and required the Secretary to publish regulations regarding the requirements of section 610. For new demonstrations or extensions, state Medicaid agencies must allow public comment before submitting an application to CMS. States are also required to submit a notice of the proposed demonstration or extension as well as the public comment on the plan. CMS is required to make available a copy of this notice and post all comments made to CMS in regard to the state\u2019s demonstration or extension. The state also must be able to provide any portion of the public that is interested in learning more with copies of the proposed demonstration or extension, as applicable, in paper or electronic form. The state must post the proposed demonstration or extension and summary of all public comments to the demonstration or extension in English and Spanish on the state\u2019s official website. This must be done no less than 30 days prior to the start of the CMS public comment period. Finally, the state must notify CMS of any public comments submitted, and must submit all public comments to CMS. These requirements apply to states or groups of states that seek to operate a Medicaid demonstration program. These requirements are the same for a demonstration regardless of the type of population to whom the demonstration will apply, such as beneficiaries that have disabilities or those who have substance use disorders. However, there are differences in requirements in the number of public comments required for each state based off of the populations included in the demonstration application. DEMONSTRATION REQUIREMENTS: 1. A state must allow public comment before submitting a demonstration to CMS. In order to facilitate the 30-day CMS public comment period and meet public comment requirements, a state is required to provide an application to CMS that includes public comment. CMS will not approve a demonstration application unless it contains the required public notice. To allow for appropriate CMS reviews and public comment, a state must submit a demonstration application to CMS no less than 6 months prior to the target implementation date. For a demonstration to go into effect, it must receive full approval and sign off from CMS. A state receiving approval of its 3-year demonstration by CMS as of February 28, 2019, can then seek full or partial approval of its 4th year through CMS\u2019s demonstration extension process. A state that receives only partial approval of its demonstration will have to adjust its demonstration for any partial year where the state had only partial approval. However, not all states approved for demonstration in previous years will need to submit or receive approval for extensions. Some states approved to operate a demonstration only need to request additional years to operate their demonstration. 2. States are required to submit a notice of their plan to CMS no less than 30 days in advance of the demonstration being submitted. The notice must be in written form and in English and Spanish. The application must include a copy of the documentation being submitted to CMS. The state must provide a summary of the public comment. All comments submitted to CMS must be included in the application and made available to the public at CMS\u2019s website. CMS will make all applications available through its website during the CMS review period. DEMONSTRATION SUPPORT: 3. Notices must be made available by the CMS regional office 5 days in advance of the notice being posted. In addition, states are required to send notices to national organizations that are dedicated to advocating for individuals with specific issues relating to the demonstrations. These organizations are not limited to the ones listed and all state Medicaid agencies need to work within the time frames provided by Congress. The demonstration notice must also include information outlining where and how the public can make requests and comments known to the state Medicaid agency. 4. The notice must discuss the following topics: (i) The title of the demonstration or extension; (ii) A description for the application; (iii) The effective dates of the demonstration and any years for which the extension is being requested; (iv) A summary of statewide public comments; (v) An explanation about why the demonstration is needed and its goals and objectives; (vi) A brief summary of the changes and additions that will be made to the demonstration being submitted", "\u2022 Climate changes will affect global supply and demand for drinking water for many years to come. \u2022 Water scarcity affects military operations in a variety of ways and places an overwhelming burden on national resources. \u2022 U.S. military organizations must continue to proactively explore innovative and sustainable solutions and partner with both public and private entities to better prepare the Department of Defense and our nation for the increasing strain on the limited water resources.", "Funding for University STEM Research. We found that Education awarded $3.7 billion in STEM funding to universities (64 universities) in fiscal year 2017. The five federal agencies we reviewed collectively awarded HUMAN RESOURCES PRIMER \u2013 FINAL 650 million to universities in fiscal year 2018 2018. The 21 universities we reviewed at Education and the four federal agencies that provided the majority of the funding awarded approximately $6.7 billion in Title IX compliance reviews at universities they funded. In accordance with our recommendation, Education conducted Title IX compliance reviews of its grant recipients in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The four federal agencies we reviewed did not conduct required Title IX compliance reviews at the universities they funded. The number of students and undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in STEM majors. We found that most of the 27 universities we reviewed (24/27) are enrolling 50% or greater of the undergraduate students that study in a STEM major. Also, the majority of the 13 universities we reviewed that have undergraduate and graduate STEM programs (11/13) are enrolling 50% or greater of undergraduate and graduate students in their STEM programs. According to some stakeholders we interviewed, undergraduates typically apply to a specific STEM program at the universities. We identified at the majority of the 27 universities (22/27) in our review, officials do not know the number of undergraduate students enrolled in non-STEM fields of study that are attending STEM courses or programs because they do not require a declaration of a non-STEM major and course registration information is not tracked by major. Further, officials at the majority of the 27 universities we reviewed (24/27) stated they did not have a plan or programs to recruit and retain non-STEM students to study in STEM fields of study. According to the officials we interviewed, there are various reasons undergraduate and graduate students may not enroll in a STEM major. Some students may not be interested in STEM-related career paths or they may not have the abilities or skills to do well in STEM fields of study, such as the ability to learn advanced mathematics and science concepts. Additionally, some students (e.g., undergraduates) may not have the opportunity to participate in an educational experience (e.g., on-the-job training) or engage in networking opportunities that may help them obtain the career skills and experience they need to pursue a STEM career. However, officials at 15 of the 27 universities we reviewed (12/27) reported that they have implemented some plan, program, or activity to recruit undergraduate and graduate students into STEM majors. In part, this helps to offset a shortage of potential students with STEM majors and a shortage of skilled workers in their fields. However, officials at 12 of the 27 universities reported that they had few resources to implement their plan, program, or activity to recruit undergraduate and graduate students into STEM majors because they generally lack funding, staff, and other resources to enforce their plans. According to data we reviewed, these 27 universities graduated in fiscal year 2017 1,754 total graduates with STEM degrees related to the disciplines we reviewed. However, officials at 15 of the 27 universities (12/27) did not collect data on the total number of graduates with STEM-related degrees who earned their degree. Some stakeholders and officials we interviewed reported that there is a shortage of individuals with STEM skills in certain fields. This shortage is expected to continue because employers are projecting that they need more individuals with STEM skills. We found at the majority of the 27 universities (24/27) do not track the number of students who complete an undergraduate or graduate program as an engineer, computing professional, life or physical scientist, or in a STEM-related field. Some stakeholders we interviewed stated employers reported that they will generally hire a recent graduate who has a degree in a STEM major if there is not a significant need for individuals with specialized skills or knowledge and if the employer", "According to the Defense Department, the nation\u2019s military readiness is low, but the department has made rebuilding readiness a top priority.

Specifically, the report: (1) found that REAC has not performed a comprehensive process evaluation since 2001, (2) found that REAC does not factor in sampling error when deciding when to take a property owner to HUD\u2019s hearing process for non-compliance with HUD\u2019s physical inspection standards; and (3) described weaknesses associated with REAC\u2019s contractor-inspector process. Over the last 8 years, HUD and its Office of Audit, Integrity and Risk has identified deficiencies relating to the physical inspection process conducted by REAC, a HUD contractor agency. Specifically, we identified (1) deficiencies in inspection practices associated with the quality control program \u2013 including an inadequate review of inspection quality; (2) deficiencies in inspection practices associated with the scoring process \u2013 including inconsistencies in the method of scoring and unsubstantiated unit score reviews; (3) misleading statements in the REAC and HUD Annual Report on Contract Compliance. Each report concluded with detailed recommendations for remediating the specific deficiencies or addressing the risks identified. However, despite the consistency of the findings and recommendations, HUD has not remediated the deficiencies reported or implemented appropriate risk-reducing actions. HUD\u2019s most recent progress made to remediate deficiencies and reduce risk was reported in the May 2016 Office of Inspector General semiannual report. Based on our observations and research in preparing this report, we believe that HUD has not adequately addressed the findings and recommendations we reported in this audit or the audits listed above. Accordingly, we expanded the scope of our review to include other possible areas of concern. The 2019 OIG report identified additional quality control oversight deficiencies associated with REAC\u2019s inspection program. REAC did not review scoring by current contract inspectors, the report found, and further examination disclosed that REAC had not conducted 100 percent review of contract inspector scoring\u2014a REAC quality assurance requirement since 1990\u2014since 2013. The report found the lack of REAC oversight over contract inspector scoring, but also included other findings, which included: (1) evidence that some contract inspectors have not been adhering to HUD inspection guidance, (2) evidence that some contract inspectors may be misrepresenting past qualifications and experience to REAC, and (3) a disclosure from REAC\u2019s Director of Quality Assurance that current REAC quality assurance practices do not include a check on whether contract inspectors comply with REAC\u2019s policies and procedures. Additionally, the report disclosed that REAC has no documented plan for the future beyond its existing contract with the contract inspector firms, which ends in 2020. HUD\u2019s oversight of this contract to determine the appropriateness of the services provided to HUD by the contract inspector firms is seriously deficient. For example, HUD has not conducted comprehensive contractor performance reviews of the firms since 2004. HUD\u2019s inadequate oversight of REAC inspection contractors may be leading to inadequate quality control oversight of REAC\u2019s inspections. In 2017, the Office of Inspector General reported some contract inspectors misrepresented their past experiences to HUD and REAC, and further reported that HUD had not conducted a performance review of any of the 10 contract inspector firms in nearly 16 years and identified other deficiencies. Consequently, we believe that HUD has not adequately ensured that contract inspectors are adhering to the  quality standards established by HUD for the physical inspection process, and has not assessed the extent to which deficiencies impact the overall effectiveness of REAC. We recommend that HUD: Include steps to improve oversight of the REAC inspection contractor firms and to ensure that such firms are addressing quality control concerns in their annual reports to REAC. Include in the REAC Quality Assurance Annual Report for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 any quality control concerns identified in contractor reports not included in the reported information. As appropriate, document any", "The E-2 nonimmigrant visa allows nationals of treaty countries, or those countries that have a qualifying treaty with the United States, to come to the United States to carry on a substantial amount of trade, including activities of a commercial nature and transactions associated with providing international banking services. Most E-1 and E-2 classification documents establish that the petitioner and the person being sponsored are engaged in \u201ca qualifying treaty\u201d \u2013 for these classifications, the relevant treaties are the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the United States (US) and the Federal Republic of Germany, of June 7, 195 6 (effective March 8, 195 6) or the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the United States (US) and the Republic of Austria, of May 10, 1930 (effective June 1, 193 0), depending (in part) upon the status of the national. In some cases, the treaty could be more than one of these two \u2013 for example, the national might also be eligible under any one of five other treaties. In addition, in some situations, the national could be under all eight treaties, as we\u2019ve seen in the cases. This is why we do not present the fiscal year 2018 refusal rate in figure 3, since the refusal may result from the national\u2019s eligibility under one of the five other treaties or from being eligible under a combination of one of those other treaties. As mentioned earlier, E-1 and E-3 classification documents established the number of nationals of those countries engaged in \u201ca qualifying treaty,\u201d and these documents also showed the number of people granted E-1 and E-3 nonimmigrant status during each fiscal year using the current methodology for calculating the E-1 and E-3 nonimmigrant visa issuances, as discussed earlier. For example, during fiscal year 201 6, about 45,000 visas were issued for E-1 classification and about 2,400 visas were issued for E-3 classification.  We also observed that a number of documents did not specify the originating country or country of nationality. For example, we observed that 33 percent of initial petition applications filed between fiscal years 201 4 and 201 6 were classified as \u201cUnited States,\u201d that is, the country of origin or the country of nationality was not listed or was not able to be determined. Similarly, approximately 22 percent of extension petitions filed during this same period did not specify country of origin or country of nationality. In addition, we identified several cases in which the national was originally classified as an E-1 nonimmigrant upon the first approval or extension of the request, but later converted to an E-2 nonimmigrant because the applicant no longer met the E -1 classification requirements. In total, these cases constituted a fraction of overall conversion processing, which for the period examined averaged about 14 conversions per year. In comparing the 96 E-1 and 371 E-3 nonimmigrant applications (plus the 442 E-1 nonimmigrant extension petitions) processed during the months examined in our sample, it was difficult to determine if each country listed in the applications or the extension petitions was the country of origin for the petition, extension petition, or application due to ambiguity in data entered in this field\u2019s data elements. In addition, we noted that several petition applications incorrectly listed the country of residence as the country of nationality. Therefore, the data we could examine did not fully reflect the countries of nationality of the applicants or petitioners. We also noted that about three-quarters of the country of residence data elements we reviewed were blank or missing, and about one-quarter were incorrect. These data elements likely were missing or incorrect because the data elements were associated with the country of nationality or the country of birth data elements, which is not recorded in the I-94 system for E-1 or E-3 nonimmigrant petition and application- related data or in the I-485 system for an E-1 nonimmigrant petition and application-related data. Furthermore, approximately 60 percent of the E-1 petitions and extension petitions and approximately 85 percent of the E-3 petitions were incorrectly marked as petitioner \u201cunknown\u201d\u2014that is, there were data entry errors made in the I-94 system for E-1 petition and application-related", "DHA contracted with two managed care support contractors to provide health care to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. The two contracts, known as the T-2017 contracts, have a 1-year phase-in period ending September 31, 2018, when DHA expects the new contracts to be fully performance-based. DHA plans to award two follow-on contracts known as the T-5 contracts, each with a 5-year performance period. The new contracts are subject to congressional approval.  INTRODUCTION: We testified on DHA\u2019s implementation of the T-2017 contracts, focusing on the TRICARE contractor acquisition strategies. In addition, we examined whether DHA has made changes to its TRICARE contracts since  the Government Accountability Office.  AIMS: Our audit objectives were to determine\u2014 1) How DHA managed the contract award process since 2014. 2) Whether there were differences between DHA\u2019s T-3 acquisition strategy and T-2017 acquisition strategy. \u2022 DHS OIG has not assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of DoD acquisition processes.  \u2022 While we evaluated the T-2017 contract award strategy, DoD and DHA officials were responsible for developing the strategy and ensuring a fair, full, and open competition.

The T-2017 contracts cover two regions, each consisting of two contracts. Contract regions in the T-2017 acquisition strategy changed in order to better reflect where DOD beneficiaries are located, and where health care providers are located within DOD beneficiaries\u2019 regions of responsibility. 2 Contractor\u2014Prior to 2016, Health Net Federal Services and Humana GS held the two DOD T-1 contracts; Humana GS was awarded the T-2086 contract; HNFS and the Government Services was awarded the T-2094 contract. DHA is expected to award three T-5 contracts, replacing T-2086 and T-2094.

UAS activities are funded from the federal budget through the FAA.", "According to all working group member agencies except one, the agencies have ongoing programs or activities, typically led by an environmental justice officer, to identify and address environmental justice issues. Some working group member agencies reported that they were limited in their ability to address environmental justice issues. For example, three agencies reported that the statutes underlying their responsibilities did not specifically require addressing environmental justice issues. In addition, three working group member agencies considered efforts related to their responsibilities (such as EPA programs to track lead risks) as not being directly related to environmental justice issues. EPA\u2019s working group efforts GAO made three recommendations to the Administrator of EPA. These recommendations included (1) incorporating environmental justice considerations into the agency\u2019s strategic plan, (2) incorporating environmental justice requirements and related progress into agency-wide programs, and (3) reporting annual progress updates to Congress. In a June 2017 letter, the Acting Administrator agreed with our recommendations and directed the assistant administrator in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice to prepare a strategic plan to address recommendations 1 and 2. The assistant administrator also agreed to develop a tracking mechanism (recommendation 3) to report annually to Congress. The letter included milestones to be completed by January 31, 2018 (strategic plan completion and tracking mechanism development); July 31, 2018 (strategic plan approval); and July 31, 2019 (tracking mechanism implementation).

This expansion can be attributed to both the number of disasters declared (339 disasters have been declared involving Public Assistance obligations since 2005) and the total amounts obligated by FEMA to individual disasters (over $100 billion of Public Assistance has been obligated since 2005). To obtain Public Assistance funds, the state, tribe, territory, or local government that has sustained damage is requested by the Governor to submit a Public Assistance Joint Preliminary Damage Assessment (JPDA). This JPDA is then reviewed to determine eligibility for grant funding through the Public Assistance program, and once approved, FEMA will release funds to cover repair and replacement costs.\nWe analyzed all JPDAs submitted by the 23 states that experienced the majority of all Public Assistance declarations from FY 2005 through FY 2014 to calculate the total amount of funding obligated and the average amount of funding obligated per JPDA.\nOur analysis found that in FYs 2005 through 2014, the 221 JPDAs we reviewed obligated over $106 billion, which averages to an average of $480 million per JPDA. While the average size per JPDA fluctuated significantly from year to year, the variation for the average size peaked after Hurricane Katrina in FY 2005. However, for the years following the peak and over the course of our sample period, this average has decreased to almost half of the post-Hurricane Katrina high for a single year. As shown in figure 3, the difference between the lowest and highest averages for all JPDAs for each fiscal year within our sample period is a significant 948%.\nFigure 4 shows the variation in total funds obligated by FEMA for all JPDAs per fiscal year. Over 2006 through 2014, the total amount of funds obligated has decreased from highs of about $29 billion and $30 billion in FY 2006 and FY 2007 respectively to lows of under $14 billion for several fiscal years, which includes FY 2014. The greatest decrease in total funds obligated occurred between FY 2007 and FY 2008, with a 31% decrease in the amount of funds obligated. However, since FY 2008, the total funds obligated have decreased less than 5% per year, which included decreases of 22% in FYs 2011 and 2012. While FEMA\u2019s total funds obligated have decreased during our sample period, the total funds obligated have also varied considerably per JPDA. Figure 5 shows the variation in total funds obligated between the lowest and highest amount of funds obligated per JPDA for all fiscal years within our sample period, which ranged from a difference of more than $13 billion in FY 2006 to less than $4 billion in FY 2009. The highest and lowest amounts per JPDA for each fiscal year of our sample period ranged from over 16 times higher in FY 2006 to as low as 16 times lower than the highest amount per JPDA in FY 2007 and FY 2008. When compared to the average size per JPDA, the maximum decrease in total funds obligated amounted to 20.7% for FY 2007 and the maximum increase was 20.1% in FY 2009. Despite these decreases, total Public Assistance funding awarded over the course of our sample period remains significant, with FEMA obligating over $106 billion through nearly 5,200 JPDAs\u2014an average of $20,714,962 per JPDA and a median of $22,411,298 per JPDA.\nThe post-2007 period is characterized by more variation\u2014ranging from an average of $5,591,406 per JPDA (for FYs 2009 through 2011) to an average of $14,324", "2020 to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2068. Median employee compensation, which includes both wage and benefits, is also expected to continue to decline as a percentage of GDP over the 50-year period (see the figure below). Based on average compensation and work years, state and local employees received in 2013, our simulations suggest that the average compensation per worker will decline from $70,000 per year in 2013 to $54,000 in 2068, primarily reflecting projected changes in benefits per year. Our simulations suggest that the sector will continue to experience large fiscal gaps over the 50-year period.\nMedian Employee Compensation Our simulations suggest that the level of economic output will increase in the future, but not enough to cover the sector\u2019s operating budget deficits.\nAs measured by nominal GDP, economic output is expected to increase by about 61 percent in 50 years. Nominal GDP is the total output of the economy and is a measure of the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a year. As shown in the figure on the next page, the expected growth rate of per capita GDP is 1.38 percent, assuming the long-run GDP growth rate of 3 percent and the long-run growth of total population of 2 percent. Thus, state and local\ngovernment economies are projected to grow, but insufficiently to close the fiscal gap. Figure 3 shows nominal GDP, compensation for full-time, full-year (including benefits) employees, and operating revenue together for all three levels of government\u2014federal, state, and local\ngovernments\u2014over the 50-year period. Nominal GDP, compensation, and operating revenue are measured in current dollar, unadjusted for inflation.\nFederal Revenue as a Percentage of GDP Based on simulations by CBO, federal revenue is expected to increase, on average, from 18.4 percent of GDP in 2019 to 22.1 percent in 2068, as shown in the figure.\nSuch an increase stems from increases in both federal receipts (taxes) and federal outlays, or expenditures. Expenditures and receipts have historically trailed each other in their responses to changes in the business cycle. During an economic expansion, the federal government typically does not pay out as much in benefits as it does in revenue. Thus, during downturns in the economy federal expenditures generally increase as the federal government pays out more in benefits.\nRevenue From the federal government\u2019s revenue side, CBO made the following major projections for the next 50 years: Personal income tax revenue is projected to increase 4 percentage points from 2019 to 2068. Corporate tax revenue is projected to decrease 12 percentage points from 2019 to 2068. Social security receipts are projected to increase 6 percentage points from 2019 to 2068. Receipts from excise taxes are projected to increase 3 percentage points from 2019 to 2068.\nTotal federal revenue is expected to increase more than nominal GDP in part because of inflation. Nominal GDP is the output of all sectors of an economy at current prices (unadjusted for inflation). When a real output increases along with inflation, the net output is the nominal output of a economy after taking into account inflation. A more accurate representation of the economy\u2019s welfare is its real net output\u2014the economic output at current consumer prices\u2014because this indicator reflects the real output of goods and services by factoring out price level changes.\nNet Output Because of inflation, real net output is projected to increase less than nominal GDP over the 50-year period, as shown in the figure on the next page. The GDP deflator\u2014the broadest measure of price change\u2014is projected to\nincrease by 2.4 percent on average each year. Real net output then rises at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent, reflecting an average annual increase of output of about\nIn summary, our projections show the state and local governments will face declining tax receipts and a growing demand for basic services from an aging population.\n110 Percent of GDP A major assumption underlying our projections for the sector is", "Metro 2\u00ae Format. The format has not been modified significantly since its initial launch in 1989.", "Federal agencies are dependent on information systems and electronic data to process, maintain, and report essential information. Virtually all federal operations are supported by computer systems and electronic data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their missions and account for their resources without these information assets. Federal agencies exchange personally identifiable and other sensitive information with state agencies in the implementation of key federal and state programs. The security of systems and data involved in this exchange of information is vital to public confidence and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity, and well-being. Since federal agencies face computerized (cyber) threats that continue to grow in number and sophistication, it is imperative that such information is protected. In recognition of this growing threat, we designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. We further expanded this area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Several federal laws and policies establish requirements for protecting federal systems and managing cybersecurity risks. Specifically, FISMA is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another entity. FISMA also assigns government-wide responsibilities to key agencies. For example, OMB is responsible for developing and overseeing implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies. It also requires agencies to implement a risk management framework as the basis for information system authorization. Such a framework guides and informs the categorization of federal information and information systems; selection, implementation, and assessment of security and privacy controls; authorization of information systems; and continuous monitoring of information systems. Federal agencies may share data with one or more individual component agencies  WITHIN A STATE, such as agencies that execute a state\u2019s tax administration, law enforcement, or human services functions. Federal agencies have developed cybersecurity requirements for state agencies to follow when accessing, storing, and transmitting federal data. The U.S. Government Accountability Office is required to determine whether such requirements, when implemented, result in reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives. We evaluated the cybersecurity requirements that federal agencies use for assessing state agencies access to, transmission of, and storage of federal data to determine (1) if requirements are designed to mitigate agency-specific risks and (2) whether they have been assessed against requirements of FISMA, NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-37, state law, and applicable contracts.", "FIND THE KEY TERMS FOR EACH PARAGRAPH OF THE PIECE,\nDESCRIBE THEM, AND WRITE A STATEMENT OR EXPLAIN WITH REASONS WHY THE VACCUUM ABSORBER IS PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR DISCHARGE CHAMBER.", "This document is an official GAO summary of the audit report GAO-19-43.\nFor additional information about this report, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-9410 or brownke@gao.gov.\nFor more information about GAO's work, contact the Public Affairs Office at (202) 512-4800 or contactors@gao.gov.

It concluded that even without consideration of sea level rise and additional hazards from climate change, these assets will be vulnerable to extreme weather and other hazards.

Moreover, the report does not specifically mention the anticipated costs for building new assets to replace all three existing assets. This is a particular concern in light of the CG-573 report\u2019s recommendation that the Coast Guard develop an alternative location and operations concept.  We have other concerns with the CG-573 report. The report states that it provides \u201can initial high-level assessment of the physical plant facilities for the HQCG, MARAD, and DOC.\u201d The Coast Guard should evaluate the suitability of existing real estate to support its long-term mission requirements, but the CG-573 report provides little information on those requirements, and little or no justification for its general recommendation to redevelop port facilities at HQCG, MARAD, and DOC.

Instead, while the report calls for a port-wide approach to infrastructure needs across 10 ports and two airfields, the report provides general information but no specifics.  The CG-573 report also stated that it should be updated periodically to 91 380 and 84979 for the USCGCs and MMABs, and that these changes should be addressed in future reports.

For example, many buildings need to be renovated or replaced, resulting in high utility costs, inefficient physical environments, and employee exposure to asbestos, poor indoor air quality, and other threats to health and safety.

As an aspect of this program, OCSLA requires Interior to conduct annual OCS oil and gas lease sales. The act exempts from competitive lease sales only mineral resources to be produced in a manner that disturbs tide and submerged lands less than five acres, to be used in conjunction with, or as a part of, the construction, maintenance, or operation of a single, integrated coastal oil and gas production, transportation, or refining operation. Specifically, the MMS is required by 43 U.S.C. 1333 to conduct a public oil and gas lease sale, the majority of which occurs within the Gulf of Mexico. The sale provides for the development of offshore oil and gas fields of the Outer Continental Shelf and promotes national interests, economic and energy development, and conservation, and the enhancement of research and development activities. MMS is the authority for the issuance of leases; it holds the public auction and accepts bids from qualified bidders. These bidders are then allocated federal oil and gas leases. In FY2017 MMS raised $255.6 million in bonus and rental payments.\nCompetitive federal onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing sales were suspended for seven months following the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. This suspension was lifted with enactment of P.L. 111-321, the Offshore Regulatory and Operating Reform Act of 2010, in August 2010. Subsequently, a series of reports were issued by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM, the successor to the U.S. Minerals Management Service or MMS), that suggested that the terms of offshore oil and gas leases were modified as a result of the spill. On July 9, 2010, the President issued an Executive Order that established an interagency Gulf of Mexico Regional Coordinating Body with the primary mission of coordinating the development and implementation of the Administration\u2019s Gulf of Mexico region program. Accordingly, BOEM modified both the language and design of the lease forms to incorporate new regulatory and inspection requirements for safety and environmental protection, such as a provision requiring a drilling operator to post a $1 billion bond before the drilling operator could begin drilling a well. Other provisions require annual certification of compliance, prohibit drilling of a well if safety equipment or standards are not in compliance, and provide for additional inspections of a well site if a violation was found. According to BOEM, these new requirements \u201censure that operators with a pattern of poor compliance with safety or environmental protection regulations are held to strict standards and removed from any deep water drilling program.\u201d\nOn July 4, 2010, President Obama issued a second Executive Order, establishing and instructing an executive branch working group to develop recommendations regarding a \u201ccomprehensive, coordinated, transparent, timely and science-based response\u201d to oil spills. Following this instruction, on December 22, 2010, the President signed P.L. 111-357, the Disaster Relief and Winter Sports Promotion Act, to address the oil spill. Section 8 of the law established the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and increased the limit of penalties against vessel owners or operators for violations of vessel design and construction regulations. It also established a new civil penalty, of up to $6 million, for violations of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and/or regulations. Subsequent to this, on March 8, 2011, BOEM made public three final reports and their recommendations for future modifications to the federal oil and gas lease forms. With these reports, BOEM identified as the main objective, \u201cto ensure that operators with a pattern of poor compliance with safety or environmental protection regulations are held to strict standards and removed from any deep water drilling program; to ensure that all drilling operators are held to a uniform regulatory and environmental review process, enacted", "\u201cBased on the nature of the relationship between the two, CBP may deem the adult parent to be unrelated to a child and deny UAC status to that child. This is because the children we encounter at the border are often accompanied by a family member. Sometimes this is a parent or guardian, and sometimes it is an aunt or uncle or another relative. By definition, a UAC is a minor child who is unaccompanied or without lawful immigration status. If you are an aunt or caregiver for a minor child and encounter U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the law enforcement officer will assess the evidence of relationship and ask questions to assist with the eligibility determination for UAC status. CBP will ask about your relationship to the minor child and your reasons for coming to the U.S., such as to seek safety or escape violence. In some cases, the minor child may be from another country with a visa or a pending immigration application. In these cases, it may take some extra time or have separate processes at another location. As a DACA recipient, you may be able to ask for the assistance of immigration, human rights and civil rights advocacy groups. Sometimes, these groups provide assistance to those who are seeking asylum or other forms of legal protection. For example there may be non-profit organizations or coalitions in your area offering free help or advice. In any case, for your own safety, it is very important that immigration and human rights advocacy organizations and attorneys not be involved in obtaining or giving you false documents.\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES: We audited the U.S. Government\u2019s efforts to address the humanitarian needs of migrating children through Operation Rescue Children\u2019s program.  AUDIT STATEMENT: We found that the U.S. Government does not have complete and reliable information about the numbers of unaccompanied children, families with children, and reconnecting families. This is because CBP does not accurately track the reasons that unaccompanied children are apprehended, does not properly maintain the information in its automated entry-exit system, and does not uniformly document the reasons unaccompanied children are accepted for ORR\u2019s ORC program. As a result, CBP officers, OFO officers, and ORR caseworkers do not have all of the relevant data and background information they need to track the status of unaccompanied children and their families. For example, CBP officers have not consistently and correctly labeled the information system that tracks unaccompanied children. CBP officers use this system to inform ORR caseworkers about unaccompanied children and their families. CBP\u2019s inconsistent entry-exit systems also lack the information and documentation they need to make decisions that support the department\u2019s mission to protect the public. For example, CBP cannot confirm that it accepted an individual through the ORR program. Similarly, HHS does not always track cases related to human trafficking or other immigration violations. OIG assessed HHS\u2019s practices for identifying human trafficking and other immigration violations. HHS did not consistently monitor the program\u2019s cases for red flags. Without red flag policies and practices HHS is unable to consistently identify potential cases of human trafficking and other immigration violations. Without information on a child and family, ORR will have a difficult time protecting and tracking children and families and identifying and preventing human trafficking.", "Aggregate data show that the economic position of Millennials in 2010 was slightly better than the economic position of their parents in 1980.", "This report examines the use of prescription drugs, psychotherapeutic medication, and psychotherapeutic counseling to address psychiatric/mental health (PMH) conditions in all primary care settings.

LEBANON Lebanon is a small, religiously diverse country bordering the Mediterranean Sea (see fig. 1). Religious tensions among Lebanon\u2019s Maronite Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, and others, have for many years contributed to conflicts within Lebanon as well as with neighboring countries. According to State, Lebanon\u2019s political system is characterized by sectarian divisions and pressures from external and internal forces that limit its ability to function. Upon gaining independence from France in 1943, Lebanese leaders adopted a power-sharing agreement, in which each of the country\u2019s officially recognized religious groups were to be represented in the government according to their share of the population based on the 1932 census. This unwritten agreement established a status quo in which the president must be a Maronite Christian (the largest single denomination in 1932), the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a Shiite Muslim. Tensions over the balance of power among these groups have provoked conflict. During the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990, both Syrian and Israeli forces occupied the country. In the midst of the civil war and Israel\u2019s occupation of southern Lebanon, Hizballah emerged in Lebanon as a powerful Islamic militant group. In 2000, Israeli forces withdrew from southern Lebanon. In 2005, owing to pressure from the international community, Syrian forces withdrew from Lebanon following the assassination of Lebanon\u2019s prime minister. CRS-2 In 2006, a large-scale conflict re-erupted due to the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 34 day war against Hizballah and the Lebanese armed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Lebanon. Lebanese casualties from this war reportedly exceeded 1000. Since 2013, the U.S. has supported the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) with training and equipment, as outlined in this statement. The LAF is the primary security sector institution in Lebanon. The LAF is tasked to maintain national defense and counter Hizballah\u2019s support to Iraqi armed groups.

GSA\u2019s Technology Transformation Service has made progress in establishing processes for administering the fund, and the Technology Modernization Board announced the first round of TMF investment in April 2019. Congress appropriated $100 million in fiscal year 2017, and this was combined with $15 million and $30 million from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, respectively, in order to provide a total of $150 million for fiscal year 2017 to be distributed through awards or incentives made by the Technology Modernization Board. On August 23, 2017, OMB and GSA provided instructions and deadlines in an informational memorandum for agency Chief Information Officers to begin submitting proposals to modernize IT systems. According to OMB, over 260 agencies have identified projects in their agency as eligible for funding. Agencies were directed to submit their proposals with an agency executive summary with the first draft due on October 27, 2017. The first group of applicant agencies (15 agencies) had their proposals evaluated by the Technology Modernization 15 Board and OMB. Out of that first review, 6 agencies were awarded a total of $115 million in November 2017 and those awards have been formally announced for each agency. The first round of awards includes $18.1 million for Health and Human Services, $14.4 million for the Department of Justice, and $100 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The remainder of the funds were distributed among 3 other agencies. By September 30, 2018, 409 agency proposals in total were deemed eligible to compete for funding by the Technology Modernization Board and an overview of the projects are available on their public website. Through this process, the Technology Modernization Board selected 24 out of 381 agency proposals for funding in the next fiscal year under the mandates of the MGT Act, with a total funding of $100 million. Agencies are expected to have plans in place to reimburse the funding, as well as for the ongoing management of their 27 proposed IT systems modernizations based on a review of their plans by the Technology Modernization Board. The Technology Modernization Board has indicated that they have developed a process for evaluating applications, and that there are five major criteria used in their evaluations, including the following: (1) alignment and support of agency mission; (2) value, effectiveness, and sustainability; (3) modernization planning and execution as well as 28 risk and risk management; (4) program management and governance; and (5) organizational change management and culture. 29 GAO's work in this area is ongoing, and we are reviewing the initiatives funded  SUMMARIZATION CONTINUES ON THE NEXT PAGE 1016-00126 30  57 \n409 agency modernization proposals\nawarded by the board and the extent to which GAO has conducted previous work on similar efforts.

For example, after the attacks, insurers left the market, excluded terrorism risk coverage from policies, or steeply increased premiums. The Real Estate Roundtable reported in 2002 that nearly $16 billion of real estate projects in 17 states were stalled or cancelled because of the lack of coverage for terrorism risk. The purpose of TRIA is to 1. protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and ensuring the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property/casualty insurance for terrorism risk; 2. allow for a transitional period for private markets to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving state insurance regulation and consumer protections.By law, an insurer\u2019s coverage for terrorism loss must not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from other events. For example, an insurer offering $100 million in commercial property coverage also must offer $100 million in commercial property coverage for certified acts of terrorism. The federal government does not collect an up-front charge from insurers for the government\u2019s coverage of terrorism riskunder TRIA. In a 2019 report, we stated that the federal government has multiple programs that can provide compensation to specific third parties if an event occurred, and this would have potentially required previous unbudgeted expenditures by the federal government if an event occurred. TRIA has not caused financial liabilities to the federal government, but could potentially require large, previously unbudgeted expenditures by the federal government, if an event occurred. Within 7 days after certification of an act of terrorism, a web-based system for receiving claims from insurers and responding to insurers that seek assistance. In 2004 Treasury issued regulations to implement TRIA\u2019s procedures for filing insurer claims for payment of the federal share of compensation for insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. The regulations implement requirements that insurers comply with in filing a claim for payment of the federal share of compensation under TRIA. They include administrative claims requirements that insurers must follow and claim requirements that Treasury uses to determine whether an insurer\u2019s losses are compensable. 1984 through 2001 (the pre-TRIA years), GAO reported on terrorism risk coverage. Prior to TRIA\u2019s enactment, property and casualty insurance for certain types of risk was typically excluded from the terms of many policies and was typically limited. However, insurers have adjusted their policies and rating levels since the enactment of TRIA to incorporate terrorism risk into their underwriting practices and operations. The private insurance industry has developed innovative solutions to collect data and to assess, respond to, and mitigate the costs of terrorist attacks, helping create a new market for such risk. On December 4, 2015, GAO released the results of its study of the state of the terrorism insurance market 10 years after TRIA\u2019s enactment. The study found that most insurers continue to sell terrorism insurance coverage and most of the coverage they sell is at more favorable or competitive prices than in the 1984 through 2001, the pre-TRIA years. The study found that although nearly all respondents sell terrorism insurance, the number of insurers selling terrorism coverage has declined and about a third of insurers surveyed said they were exiting, or thought they might need to exit, the market. More than half of insurers reported writing less terrorism coverage because it has become less economically viable to sell, as the market has matured. One in four respondents reported having written less coverage because it was less profitable at the recent market prices. Most respondents also reported that market prices have remained relatively stable, and few reported that they were unable to sell terrorism coverage at any price. Most respondents reported that they could not have operated their businesses without terrorism coverage, due to the availability of government compensation. 90% of respondents said that the most important factors in their evaluation of the profitability of terrorism risks were the availability of the federal compensatory program, the level", "Agencies need to take steps to improve management of their IT investments.

A significant portion of this manmade waste does not end up on the seabed at all, but rather drifts\u2014called floating trash\u2014in the water column, forming large drifting debris accumulations in coastal and open-ocean environments worldwide. Floating trash can be carried by currents to remote areas in a relatively short amount of time.

While these cleanups and initiatives will continue, they remain ineffective unless accompanied by sustainable long-term solutions to prevent debris from entering the marine environment. In addition to addressing the problem at its sources, the federal government encourages the production and use of materials that are less harmful to the environment\u2014so-called recyclable and reusable goods. In addition to preventing trash that is not recyclable or reusable from entering the oceans, marine debris also includes the manmade objects that have no remaining utility or do not belong in the environment and become trash. The report finds that the types and amount of trash and debris are in a state of constant flux, changing as a result of population growth, economics, and technologies. The federal government has limited, sometimes complex and potentially conflicting, authority to manage this problem. The report also concludes that, while debris from the fishing, shipping, oil and gas, and dredging industries can be found nationwide, the quantity of debris from these industries will be determined primarily at the state and local levels, as well as the level of federal management of offshore fishing zones. The report concludes by noting that, because of the widespread impact of marine debris and its effect on coastal and marine environments, this problem is likely to remain at the forefront of federal and state governance for the foreseeable future.", "1.  The MSPP and its predecessor programs have been designed and intended to serve a very important purpose by providing long-term support\u2014typically in the form of disability and survivor benefits\u2014to current and former federal employees and their families. 2.  With the establishment of CSA in 1989, Congress created one unified retirement plan for three groups: (1) federal civilian employees, other than military personnel; (2) military personnel who began participating in a military retirement plan after 1989; and (3) individuals covered by Social Security. CSA provides a three-tiered retirement system that is based on three key elements: the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), and Social Security. 3.  CSA was designed to provide employees with a basic level of retirement income, and supplementary income to assist those employees who were unable to save for retirement. The MSPP, in addition to providing workers\u2019 compensation protection, was designed to cover employees as they transition from employment to retirement and, ultimately, from retirement. Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are paid in addition to, and are not included in, the CSRS or FERS benefits. 4.  Through CSRS and FERS, eligible employees participate in three-tiered basic Federal retirement benefits of basic retirement benefits, Social Security benefits, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) benefits. For CSRS employees, the level of benefit depends on the employee\u2019s tenure and age at retirement, while FERS employees\u2019 retirement benefits are determined on the basis of the Social Security rules and their own tenure and age at retirement. 5.  The MSPP provides a monthly benefit to employees who qualify under statutory criteria related to work-related disability or injuries, along with a second benefit in the case of a work-related, on the job injury, in addition to compensating those federal employees who are disabled as a result of job-related illness. 6.  The MSPP uses its own rules\u2014including a five-year eligibility window\u2014to allow eligible employees who were denied federal retirement benefits under FERS or CSRS to receive benefits. FERS and CSRS require 18 months of federal civilian service and three years of qualifying civilian service to be eligible for retired pay, while FERS employees who have only CSRS coverage must have five years of CSRS civilian service. Thus, the MSPP benefit provides a safety net for qualified employees who would not have been eligible to collect federal retirement benefits for which they qualify. 7.  Employees who sustain on-the-job illnesses or injuries are entitled to receive federal retirement benefits through CSRS, the FERS, or the MSPP, as well as Social Security benefits. However, most federal employees choose to participate in Social Security because Social Security provides more generous survivor and disability benefits as compared to those available to federal employees who qualify for federal employee retirement benefits. 8.  The MSPP and FERS disability and survivor benefits are intended to provide employees with a replacement income for a specified amount of time, while the Social Security disability insurance (DI) and supplemental security income (SSI) benefits are designed to provide income for the duration of a disability until the beneficiary reaches retirement age and then provides retirement income through its old-age insurance program. 9.  Disability and survivor benefits through MSPP and Social Security can be paid concurrently with federal employee survivor and retirement benefits for both CSRS and FERS, which provides greater income replacement to federal employees and their families, if warranted, and ensures that they receive their due benefits. In contrast, the FERS offset applies an offset to workers\u2019 compensation disability payments and the MSP disability portion of federal retirement benefits from other retirement benefit programs, to prevent overcompensation of federal employees for lost federal worker wages. The offset is an administrative tool to prevent windfalls that could occur if federal employees or survivors were compensated by various federal programs for the same period of eligibility. However, the offset reduces an employee\u2019s total compensation package when eligible for both a workers\u2019 compensation and a federal retirement benefit\u2014most often a federal retirement disability benefit, but also with FERS survivor benefit retirement contributions\u2014when the employee becomes eligible to collect Social Security benefits as well.

We reported on cost growth and schedule slips in our 2010 review of the 2010 fiscal year results of DOD\u2019s annual  audits.4 We found that the JMS program exceeded initial costs for fiscal year 2010 by more than $90 million. For fiscal year 2011 (3 quarters were completed and 1 quarter was not reported), the JMS program exceeded its initial costs by more than $40 million, putting the program over 54 percent over the initial budget. We reported that JMS was scheduled for release to operations in 32.4 months, or December 31, 2013. The program had reached 29.0 months of its development for the 29-month period ending March 31, 2011. According to Air Force budget documents, the program would achieve this critical milestone, which DOD defines as being able to successfully execute the mission once the system is declared ready for use, in September of 2015. The JMS program\u2019s latest cost and schedule overruns prompted our initiating this review. We found that since 1981, through the JMS and other programs, the Air Force has spent more than $2.4 billion and incurred a combined cost overrun of 94 percent to deliver only 30 percent of the intended and necessary capabilities.5  The Air Force\u2019s current efforts to modernize and consolidate command and control and space situational awareness computer systems has created a significant risk that in 2024, when the existing Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade and SPADOC systems are 50 years old, DOD officials may still not have a fully modern solution for command and control and space situational awareness. We found that, according to documentation obtained from the Air Force, DOD is working on another effort called the Battlefield Systems Command and Control program as well as work that may be applied to other programs. These efforts are intended, at least in part, to consolidate command and control, space surveillance, space control, intelligence, and space mission requirements into one modern command and control and data system, known as the Integrated Command and Control System. This system will be made up of many subsystems and is meant to address some of the command and control and space situational awareness system and data deficiencies the Air Force is experiencing today. These efforts, and other efforts to modernize command and control and space situational awareness programs, have been challenged and have taken longer than planned because of a series of program and project management-related problems and the high complexity and level of technical sophistication required to develop and sustain the various components.  RECOMMENDATION: As we described in the first section of this report, the Air Force continues to build its command and control and space situational awareness capabilities on the cheap. While this strategy saves in current costs, it comes with a price. Over the past 30 years, this practice has taken its toll in the form of delayed delivery, cost overruns\u2014as high as 94 percent\u2014, program mismanagement, and, most importantly, the lack of critical command and control, and space situational awareness capabilities to support today\u2019s\u2014and tomorrow\u2019s\u2014space-related missions. Furthermore, these problems threaten the ability for the Air Force to be ready, fully equipped, and appropriately managed for any future space-related scenario, such as a space terrorist 9 attack or attack of a space station or critical piece of space infrastructure.  We therefore recommend that the Secretary of the Air Force, as the Executive Agent for the National Security Space System, ensure that the requirements for modernized command and control and space situational awareness systems and future programs are fully and fairly thought out prior to starting the next phase of program acquisition. The National Security Space System has the most complex and expensive national security space capabilities operated by DOD. Furthermore, the National Security Space System is heavily reliant on a diverse set of systems, and these systems are operating within a complex set of requirements. As a result, DOD must be certain that the National Security Space Program Office (NSPO) develops a series of comprehensive and robust requirements for any new programs, based on a system-level needs determination. To ensure the success of this recommendation, we also recommend that the Air Force consider a range of acquisition strategies\u2014including a traditional, incremental acquisition model\u2014to enable the department to plan, procure, and operate necessary and sufficient command and control and space situational awareness systems without the risk of", "21\n22 MORGAN, REILLY INC. / MANUAL TEAM TEXTBOOK APPROACH TO EMERGENCY MEDICINE\n23", "We found that FAA\u2019s ADS-B contractor (for domestic operations) provides ground-based ADS-B services for U.S. airspace from coast to coast, including Alaska. The contractor also has agreed to develop an off-shore system. The contractor\u2019s estimated costs for this additional service are $476.4 million in fiscal years 2014-2024 but may be significantly higher if the cost per aircraft increases as envisioned in the contract amendment. FAA has no off-shore ADS-B surveillance but is pursuing international agreements to improve its off-shore surveillance capabilities. FAA\u2019s ADS-B contractor provides services that support FAA\u2019s ability to manage and oversee U.S. air space. It maintains and enhances (when necessary) the capability to provide ground-based ADS-B surveillance data for national airspace; provides accurate, detailed, and reliable flight track data; uses the latest technology available, as part of a five-year technology refresh program; and maintains, expands, and improves overall system performance. We recommend that the FAA Administrator ensure that the ADS-B data-collection system provides adequate and reliable air traffic control surveillance for the U.S. oceans by exploring alternatives to improve on-shore coverage and expand the contractor\u2019s system to include off-shore coverage (i.e., outside the continental shelf).\nFANGSURVEY000 11 of 14 FAA\u2019s ADS-B contractor has agreed to expand its ground-based ADS-B coverage and capabilities into the western U.S. oceanic airspace, which includes the Atlantic offshore area. It also has agreed to develop an off-shore system and expand its ground-based surveillance coverage to include the rest of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Under the contract amendment, which was required to address FAA\u2019s need for off-shore coverage, the contractor is providing the U.S. eastern portion of ADS-B coverage, including the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, without additional charges from FAA. The 2014 budget includes costs of $10 million to purchase two 1,000 nautical mile range ADS-B radar systems\u2014to expand ground-based radar coverage in the West and East Central Atlantic Offshore (see sidebar)\u2014and additional costs as part of the five-year technology refresh program that will increase performance and accuracy of ADS-B data. The costs will be paid 50-50 by FAA and the U.S. Air Force. As is common practice for contract amendments, FAA may adjust its contract with the ADS-B contractor to include the cost of providing ADS-B service in the Atlantic and Western Pacific oceans, where contractors use satellites to provide aircraft position information. This has been FAA\u2019s practice for airspace above 54,000 feet\u2014the highest reachable by air traffic control surveillance. FAA officials responsible for ADS-B operations, the FAA Inspector General, and independent studies have questioned the level of ADS-B equipage for oceanic airspace and noted that the availability of satellite-based ADS-B information could mitigate this concern and improve the safety and efficiency within oceanic airspace. However, a more comprehensive satellite-based monitoring system is not available until 2018, and FAA recently learned that the satellite-based ADS-B monitoring system was out performing ground-based ADS-B monitoring as indicated in our March 2012 and January 2014 reports. As a result, FAA no longer believes that the satellite-based ADS-B monitoring system will sufficiently address its concerns of safety and efficiency in oceanic airspace in the near term\u2014that is, until the upgrade of off-shore coverage is implemented in 2018. 44\nFANGSURVEY000 12 of 14 FAA, along with other U.S. Government agencies, is exploring alternatives to improve on\u2013 and off\u2013shore air surveillance, but our observations to date are limited, in part because FAA is still exploring available alternatives. As required by the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2013, in May 2014, FAA released a draft request for information to determine the cost of additional surveillance coverage and availability of alternative surveillance capabilities. According to officials,", "", "Medicaid expenditures are financed jointly by the federal government and the states. In order to receive federal matching funds for Medicaid expenditures, states must adhere to a broad set of federal requirements and administer their programs consistent with individual state plans approved by CMS. These plans are agreements between a state and the federal government that describe how states will administer their Medicaid programs, including how the state will administer Medicaid third- party liability procedures. When states make changes to their Medicaid programs or policies, including when necessary to comply with a change in federal law, they must submit a state plan amendment to CMS. CMS reviews and approves state Medicaid plans and state plan amendments. The federal government matches each state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures for services according to a statutory formula called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. This formula provides for a match that is no lower than 50 percent of a state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures and no higher than 83 percent. States can receive a 90 percent federal match for the costs associated with the development of each state\u2019s Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), a claims processing and retrieval system supporting the administration of the state\u2019s Medicaid program. States also receive a 75 percent match for the costs associated with ongoing MMIS maintenance and operations. States use their MMIS systems to process provider claims, including claims for prenatal care services, pediatric preventive services, and services provided to CSE beneficiaries. The Medicaid program is administered at the state level and overseen at the federal level by CMS, which, among other things, ensures that funds are used appropriately and beneficiaries have access to covered services. Medicaid allows significant flexibility for states to design and implement their programs. Within broad federal parameters, states have discretion in, among other things, setting Medicaid eligibility standards and provider payment rates; determining the amount, scope, and duration of covered benefits; and developing their own administrative structures. States may also decide how Medicaid-covered services provided to beneficiaries will be delivered. For example, some adult beneficiaries may be covered as a dependent on a parent\u2019s private health plan even though they also qualify for Medicaid. As such, federal law requires states to perform various activities to ensure that Medicaid is the payer of last resort.  First, states must identify beneficiaries who have private health coverage. States are also required to conduct data matches in order to identify beneficiaries who have third-party coverage.  Once Medicaid is determined to be the payer of last resort, states typically require a provider to first bill the beneficiary\u2019s third-party coverage and then seek reimbursement from Medicaid for costs exceeding the third party\u2019s rate or in the case of services for which the beneficiary was not covered by a third party.  If a beneficiary has both Medicaid and private coverage, then states generally instruct providers not to report charges to Medicaid unless the amount exceeds the third-party benefit plan\u2019s payment of allowable charges.  States also typically do not require providers to notify a beneficiary\u2019s private insurance of a Medicaid coverage determination (either initial or redetermination) or of an administrative or judicial appeal of a Medicaid eligibility determination.  4. Enrollee premium assistance. When Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in a managed care organization\u2019s health insurance plan have access to other private health insurance coverage, then states may allow managed care plans to recoup the cost of providing health services when the beneficiary\u2019s other insurer has not paid after the payment deadline has expired or when the other insurer\u2019s payment is less than the allowable amount. States are also allowed to seek reimbursement from MCOs for costs of providing care for enrollment periods in which the plan is not paid at the full enrollment rates. State Medicaid agencies and insurers have the authority to set liens, take third party recoveries, and collect from other payers for services provided to dual eligible beneficiaries. 31 Section II.A of the Compromise Agreement states that, in most cases, Medicaid payment is limited to the difference between the billed cost of the service and what a private payor, if any, pays. Section II.B.1 states that if Medicaid does not receive primary payor liability information timely, states must provide, at a minimum: (a) a presumption that the information is in favor of Medica", "IPv6 is the newest version of IP, an internet communications protocol commonly referred to as the address resolution protocol (ARP), the addressing and routing protocol (APR), or the encapsulation and validation protocol.

The Air Force has developed specific guidance for the force management process for addressing ARC requirements. For example, when mobilizing the ARC, the Air Force can consider individual needs, unit requirements, and mission tasking in determining dwell times. It can also consider the impact of ARC mobilization on existing Air Force, Active Component (AC), and AC Reserve Component (AC/RC) operations. Also, the Air Force has established specific dwell times and requirements for the use of Air Force reserves. Among other things, the Air Force requires that, before an order requesting personnel to perform work in the reserve component can be processed, it must be approved by the Secretary of the Air Force or one of the Secretary\u2019s duly appointed officials, which includes Air Force reserve (AFRC) general officers, the Under Secretary of the Air Force, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and his principal assistants. When approvals are not required, orders requesting reserve component personnel may be made by the Secretary of the Air Force by general and flag officer authority. These procedures establish requirements for specific personnel and unit activities to support operational requirements before any access to the reserve component. Further, the Air Force has developed additional guidance for AFSOC access to AC/RC forces. Specifically, Reserve Requirements Plan Guidance (RRP-G) provides the overall guidance for how to prepare for, execute, document, and process approved AFSOC requests for acquisition of additional military and civilian personnel from the Ready Reserve. In addition to the requirements outlined in the previous paragraph, the Air Force guidance also applies to any AFSOC-led requirement for Ready Reserve personnel. As an additional guide to the AFRC, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was developed to establish the authority of Air Force reserves as a joint force provider. This MOU authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to deploy Air Force reserves without their consent and to utilize Air Force reserves\u2019 capabilities and experience in the planning and conduct of current and future military operations or exercises. For all operations and exercises supported by AFSOC, the Air Force\u2019s RRP-G guidance is the primary source to determine a reserve unit\u2019s capabilities for deployment. In addition to the required tasks, the reserve component is available for deployment in conjunction with AFSOC\u2019s operations. Finally, the Air Force has established requirements to support the needs of personnel after their deployments. Specifically, after deployments, these personnel must be processed in a timely manner, including meeting health requirements, providing required documentation, and submitting information for official records. Additionally, personnel should be provided with any required training and be provided opportunities for training and qualifications, and personnel should be provided with adequate time to participate in training activities and opportunities. Finally, personnel should be provided with appropriate compensation for all valid periods of authorized absence, to include any periods of unauthorized absence, during which all time in the line of duty was lost. If dwell-time guidelines are 45  followed, units should recognize that their personnel are still subject to mobilization authority during each period associated with the mobilized mission, period of authorized absences, or mobilization training base. Any deviation from established dwell times must have an approved waiver signed by the Chief of the Air Force Reserve, the Chief of Air Force Special Operations Command, the Commander, Pacific Air Forces, or the Commander, United States Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa. Dweller status also determines a deployed unit\u2019s eligibility for Air Force Reserve retention benefits, and deployments of 15 days or fewer are exempt from mandatory reporting. For deployments of greater than 15 days, AFRC members also must report as individual augmentees to be entitled to retention benefits.", "Passengers paid $997.6 million in baggage fees in 2017, up substantially from the $744.9 million paid in 2010. For this analysis, we examined reported data on annual fee revenue collected by U.S. carriers, including scheduled large and small hub airlines that operate under a code sharing agreement with a reporting carrier, but excluding the largest two U.S. carriers by domestic scheduled passenger-miles for 2017. We excluded two large U.S. carriers from this analysis because their baggage fee reporting practices are different from the other airlines that are reported to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. BUR was not able to compare fee revenue between 2011 and 2017, due to the fact that BTS did not collect baggage fee data from the 15th largest U.S. carrier in those years. Thus, we used data collected in every other year between 2010 and 2016 to project 2017 baggage fee revenue. BUR estimated future baggage fee revenue for 2018-2019 by increasing the 2017 value to reflect overall changes in domestic air travel between 2010 and 2017. We found that baggage fees constituted a significant portion of airlines\u2019 total revenue for 2017. In that year, airlines raised $3.02 billion from baggage fees, representing 19.0 percent of $16.06 billion in total revenue reported by the 15 largest U.S. airlines. In addition, we found that a significant portion\u201446.5 percent\u2014of the 15-largest airlines' baggage fee revenue was derived from fees imposed by the largest two U.S. carriers in 2017. This was up from $43.9 percent in 2010, making fees from these two carriers a greater proportion of the overall revenue for the 15th largest U.S. carriers in 2017. 140.2 percent $ 1.5 billion $ 2.9 billion $ 3.02 billion $ 3.71 billion $ 4.46 billion Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Projected baggage fee revenue by type of U.S. airline 2017 2018 2019 $ 3.02 billion Source: OIG analysis of BTS fare and fee data.", "", "must outline the basis on which a 8(a) contract was issued to one firm and why another firm was rejected. Of the 30 required offer letters we requested, SBA could only provide seven. 8(a) contracts can be for follow-on contracts or for sole-source contracts. Because of the lack of documentation, SBA in some cases could not provide a justification for the rejection of the losing tenderer. Further, SBA does not have a complete list of offer letters for each and every 8(a) contract, which means SBA is missing a key part of the internal control over its oversight of the 8(a) program. 4 We reported in 2016 that SBA\u2019s limited records on offer letters also raises concerns about agency officials\u2019 ability to exercise adequate controls over the integrity SBA\u2019s award decisions and 8(a) contracts, and SBA\u2019s ability to provide effective and consistent oversight of its operations.\n3 8(a) contracting process and to support the program goals, it is critical that an evaluation be made of an ANC-owned firm\u2019s financial, technical, management, and program record within the context of its development to support an eligibility finding. Based on our prior work, we found that SBA district offices across Alaska did not uniformly collect or review the records necessary to make an informed eligibility findings or to determine whether an economic benefit is extended. To address the weaknesses that have been identified in our oversight work on the 8(a) program, SBA issued a letter to all SBA district managers on August 2, 2016, as well as a guidance memo on September 15, 2016, that reinforces the importance of effective monitoring and the management of ANC-owned firms. However, the agency did not take comprehensive corrective measures over concerns previously expressed in our work. The Alaska District Office did not adequately implement these SBA policy statements regarding proper support for its evaluation to ensure that all key factors were considered in an ANC-owned firm\u2019s 8(a) eligibility, and that all the information necessary to make an informed 8(a) eligibility and business development assessment was documented based on our prior work. For example, during an interview with the District Director at the Alaska District Office conducted in October 2016, the District Director told us that although SBA had a number of directives for staff to ensure consistent management of ANC-owned firms, many of the policies were still not implemented. The District Director also informed us that although most district office directors nationwide signed off on the policy, there was a lack of staff awareness on what the policies entailed and how to apply the policies to business development and oversight. Without adequate application of SBA policy, ANCowned firms may miss out on important resources that could assist these firms in overcoming challenges to grow their businesses and ultimately exit the 8(a) program. For example, during our interviews with SBA management officials at the Alaska District office and 8(a) firms in the 8(a) program we spoke with, many officials we spoke with were unaware of recent policy changes that could affect the eligibility of firms and some officials were unaware that ANC-owned firms were subject to the same requirements for 8(a) business development as other 8(a) firms. Specifically, during our interviews with district office staff, we found that many of the 24 policies, 8 directives, and 7 guidance memos were still not fully applied to the agency\u2019s ANC-owned firms and 8(a) firms. According to data provided by SBA officials at the Alaska district office, of the 12 SBA district offices nationwide, the Alaska district office is first in ANC ownership and third in 8(a) program ownership. Specifically, of the total businesses in the 8(a) program, the ANC-owned businesses make up 37 percent, and the remaining is non-Tribe businesses. Of the total 8(a) businesses in the 8(a) program, the ANC-owned firms make up 37 percent, and are comprised of ANCs, ANC corporations, and Alaska-Native-owned corporations.\n4 To mitigate the risk that SBA would not have access to necessary data needed for oversight, SBA\u2019s Office of 8(a) Business Development (OsBD) implemented an electronic system called the 8(a) Business", "An offeror's ownership is not public information, and therefore, GSA has no direct knowledge of the identities or beneficial ownership of entities that intend to do business with the federal government. Any company that seeks to do business with the federal government must register in the System of Award Management (SAM). Since the passage of the NDAA and the implementation of the SAM Rule, ownership information is being requested of prospective offerors. However, many of the prospective owners or beneficial owners of these entities are not known to the federal government. Prospective contractors may attempt to conceal their ownership or beneficial ownership through several means: establishing a shell entity to serve as an intermediary between a company established to hold shares and a potential offeror; or masking the true owners of a company through other legal entities and complex, multi-layered ownership structures that may be difficult to detect. A lack of public ownership data may also enable prospective contractors to establish \u201cpass-through\u201d contracting vehicles that appear to comply with the new ownership disclosure requirements in the FAR. Ownership or beneficial ownership may be deliberately omitted from submitted ownership information, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to determine the actual party set to receive the benefit of the contract. The absence of such ownership information may also prevent the government from identifying conflicts of interest posed by contractor-employee dual employment. Further, the SAM regulations do not require prospective contractors to provide evidence (i.e., a signed statement or other documentation) of beneficial ownership. Although GSA may not have a direct knowledge of the true owners of a company, third-party sources may have knowledge (i.e., media reports or government documents), and this information on the identities or beneficial owners of companies doing business with the federal government is held confidentially by contracting officials. In the absence of direct knowledge, or even reliable information held in confidence by other agencies, the acquisition decisions made at the agency level may be made with limited information on the ownership of companies doing business with the federal government.\nPOLICY OR FUNCTIONAL LEVEL CHANGE RECOMMENDED: If an offeror\u2019s ownership or beneficial ownership is not readily identified by review of submitted ownership information, additional verification of ownership may be required. The ownership information submitted to SAM during registration may not accurately reflect the actual owners and beneficial owners of companies that are determined to have the ability to perform contracts.

However, the public shipyards are challenged to meet their capacity requirements because of their age, configuration, and condition; their complex infrastructure of dry docks, hangers, and facilities is worn out and needs to be replaced. These issues have resulted in maintenance delays, which can adversely affect the fleet\u2019s readiness to operate. According to stakeholder interviews, the Navy has developed and is implementing a plan to address the shipyards\u2019 deficiencies. The plan outlines a strategy to replace major equipment and to improve the condition of facilities and dry docks at the shipyards that lack critical capacity. In our opinion, this planned action responds to prior recommendations by providing technical analysis and a roadmap of key facilities and infrastructure to enhance shipyard performance. We believe that the Navy could make its shipyard plan more efficient and effective by implementing certain additional best practices associated with the four characteristics\u2014accuracy and precision, realism, timeliness and comprehensiveness, and relevance. The Navy would also benefit from developing plans for each shipyard separately, since the capacity needs and conditions of the four shipyards can vary significantly.", "When children are removed from their homes, state or local child welfare agencies are responsible for coordinating their placement and provision of services. States or localities may also contract with private child welfare agencies to help administer children welfare services. Generally, these children remain in foster care (e.g. group homes and foster care home placements) or congregate care settings (e.g. group homes, child care facilities) until a permanent living situation can be determined (i.e. returning the child to home, moving them with relatives, or other planned arrangement). Historically, children have reached adulthood while remaining in foster care. Foster care funding comes from a variety of states and federal sources, the largest being Title IV-E of the Social Security Act which comprises about 89% of all funding for foster care in the United States. States and localities may also receive special waivers from the federal government to implement their own programs to prepare children who have moved through foster care to become independent adults (in care at age 14 or older). These programs are known as the Title IV-E Chaffee Program. This issue brief provides an overview of foster care services and programs and federal funding for these efforts.

The EPSDT benefit generally entitles beneficiaries to these services regardless of whether such services are covered in a state\u2019s Medicaid state plan and regardless of any restrictions that the state may impose on coverage for adult services. The EPSDT benefit may cover services from birth through age three, as well as throughout the life of a beneficiary, under Medicaid waivers and under Section 1905(f) agreements.

Data provided by states show that Medicaid beneficiaries received nearly 100 million screenings nationwide under EPSDT during FY 2017, with states spending more than $4 billion on such services. Since FY 2011, screenings have consistently increased each year, and states have reported that they spent nearly $34 billion on EPSDT screenings from FY 2011 to FY 2017. Spending on such services has consistently increased each year, and they have generally accounted for the largest portion of Medicaid spending on the covered services. In the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2018, states reported to CMS that they spent almost $7 billion on EPSDT screenings.

(Through nine months of fiscal 2018, states reported almost $7 billion in spending on EPSDT screenings.) Focus  For the past 5 years, GAO has included beneficiaries\u2019 EPSDT screenings as one of multiple programmatic areas for its annual review regarding Medicaid management. In February 2019, GAO issued a report regarding Medicaid\u2019s management of the EPSDT program. GAO found that the EPSDT screenings have often been subject to federal and state oversight weaknesses, such as screening records that were incomplete or not appropriately documented. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and  Medical Services (CMS), the HHS agency that administers the Medicaid program, have taken some actions to address such weaknesses identified in prior GAO reviews. The EPSDT benefit generally entitles beneficiaries to services from birth through age three (or throughout one\u2019s lifetime for disabled beneficiaries), as well as throughout the life of a beneficiary, under Medicaid waivers and under Section 1905(f) agreements. Medicaid expenditures have been the largest portion of the program\u2019s spending since fiscal year 1994.  The Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a key contributor to increased beneficiary numbers, spending, and utilization in recent years, given the large adult population eligible under this expansion. HHS provides data regarding the share of EPSDT spending and utilization for expansion and non-expansion beneficiaries but the data are limited because the EPSDT benefit is provided under state waivers and Section 1905(f) agreements that are", "VA provides various types of benefits and services to address the employment needs of eligible veterans. Vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits help those with service-connected disabilities overcome employment barriers to obtain competitive employment. A key element in VR&E is the development of an employment plan for each veteran based on an assessment of that veteran\u2019s abilities, aptitudes, and interests and barriers (if any) to employment. VR&E\u2019s goal is to increase the employability of those who participate in the program and help them find and keep competitive jobs. VR&E field staff are counselors, assistants, and specialists who work at VA regional offices to deliver VR&E services. VR&E provides services to 125,000 veterans but it is unclear whether it helps the majority overcome employment barriers to obtain competitive employment because, among other reasons, quality review results have often been inconclusive while other review results have shown a lack of timeliness (e.g., veterans had to wait an average of 160 days after entering the VR&E program before receiving an employment plan). VR&E\u2019s caseload has grown significantly since GAO first reported on the program in 1992 and the number of field staff did not change significantly between September 2015 (the last time VA reported staffing numbers) and September 2018. VA has increased the number of counselors, but the number of non-counselors who deliver VR&E services remained the same even while VA has added a number of new functions and benefits in response, in part, to changes in the employment characteristics of veterans who use VA services. For example, VA provides services to veterans with 240 service-connected disabilities and offers education and training benefits under Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, but it had not added staff to address the demand for these benefits. VR&E field staff are part of an agencywide employee development group and participate in various agency training programs that VR&E field leadership believes address the unique demands of the VR&E program. VA has not updated its training programs and resources for almost a decade. For example, VA\u2019s staffing plans from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 showed no plan to address staffing needs at VAROs. VA updated its field staff staffing plan on February 1, 2019. However, no staffing plan has been updated for assistants and other non-counselor positions that help deliver employment services. Additionally, GAO found several instances where data on the number of veterans who had received an employment plan were not available or were inconsistently reported, suggesting the need to strengthen VA\u2019s management information systems.\nFigure 1: Total VR&E Participants and Counselors, Fiscal Years 2013 through 2019\nNote: GAO reviewed VR&E counselor staffing data from fiscal years 2013 through 2019.

This report describes the statutory and regulatory requirements for educational stability, discusses how the amendments to Title I were implemented, and describes several challenges that were reported. In November 2019 to determine whether it is in a child in foster care\u2019s best interest. For example, officials explained that it can be difficult to provide school district input during the determination of whether it is in a youth\u2019s best interests to remain in their school of origin, in part because the school district does not hold as many of the educational stability responsibilities as does the state child welfare agency. In addition, child welfare agencies and school districts have sometimes struggled to collaborate on these issues, resulting in inconsistent implementation and confusion. Officials also reported difficulties locating school records when the school of origin becomes unknown. Although some challenges are not unique to educational stability, these issues have impeded implementation of the ESSA educational stability provisions. The GAO found that state and local education agencies in several focus states reported receiving some funding from the ESSA Title I, Part A formula grant. In addition, the majority of focus states reported that the ESSA amendments regarding educational stability had not affected their implementation and use of the Title I formula grant and their collaborative efforts with state or local child welfare agencies. However, the focus states generally reported several challenges with implementing and funding these requirements. For example, some of the focus states that were unable to implement the Title I formula grant funding to support educational stability reported limited resources or difficulty finding a mechanism to use the ESSA funding for this purpose. In addition, some of the focus states reported concerns regarding the limited authority states and school districts have to provide funds out of the Title I, Part A budget for these educational stability purposes. Although the statutory provisions for funding are clear, officials and advocates also noted challenges in implementing these provisions in their states. As a result, two focus states reported that they had not implemented funding for educational stability. The remaining focus states reported continuing to determine how best to implement these requirements. Although these ESSA provisions and their implementation have not yet affected the Title I, Part A formula grant amounts for states receiving Title I funding, the GAO found that states and school districts may have to adjust their Title I formula grant allocations to comply with the new educational stability requirements, in part as states and LEAs adjust to the flexibility ESSA provides them in meeting various Title I requirements. For example, some of the focus states reported that they anticipated having to lower their Title I threshold to reflect changes in the population of students in foster care. If states and LEAs make changes to comply with the new educational stability funding requirements, their Title I formula grant allocations could change. Schools, districts, and state child welfare agencies generally reported that while the ESSA educational stability provisions have not had major effects, they have enhanced some of the collaborative efforts that already exist. Specifically, some school district and child welfare officials reported increasing collaboration on a local level, while others have used existing processes to collaborate with child welfare agencies related to education. In addition, most focus states reported that the ESSA amendments resulted in some awareness-raising efforts by state education agencies of the ESSA educational stability provisions. HHS officials noted that Title IV-E child welfare agencies, school districts, or other child welfare agencies can pursue Title IV-E administrative funding (i.e. state Title IV-E plan funding) to support educational stability for some children in foster care in their care. However, no state reported to the GAO that it had used these funds in this way. HHS reported that when they provide educational stability-related Title IV-E administrative funding to school districts, an additional 20 percent is provided to child welfare agencies. These Title IV-E funds go to child welfare agencies to work with children in foster care on issues related to educational stability. The GAO\u2019s investigation was limited in scope and the results cannot be generalized to all focus states or all school districts.", "The Corrosion Office should establish its permanent director position in order to ensure consistency in coordinating all corrosion oversight and prevention efforts across the department, in accordance with statute.

Federal and state agencies generally describe abandoned hardrock mines in terms of mine sites, the individual features that comprise a site, or both. However, these agencies do not all have a common definition for what constitutes an abandoned hardro ck mine or mine site. The agencies generally agree on what constitutes an indiv identi tary feature\u2014for example, a feature can be a mine opening (such as a tunnel, pit, or vertical shaft) , a structure, or a pile of discarded materials (known as mine tailings or waste rock) that is left behi nd after ore is crush  e d and the valuable minerals are extracted. They also generally agree that an abandoned mine site can be comprised of only one feature ( e.g., an isolated mine shaft) or many features ( e.g., an area with multiple entries, shafts, open pits, mill buildings, and tailings pils e . There is no universally agreed-upon average number of features per  site . Physical safety hazards . Abandoned hardrock g site. Agencies typically focus on identi g a hazard and evaluating it to determine the potential for its imminent failure. This is generally achieved through a site assessment. Physical hazards can be categorized as either static or dynamic. Static hazards include items such as underground vertical shafts, waste rock piles, and tailings at sites. Dynamic hazards include items such as open pits, tunnels with moving equipment (such as belts, trams, and conveyor systems), and mills. These features can all contain substances such as methane and toxic metals that collect within them over time. Dynamic features change over time as the mine is operated or as structures begin to collapse. Based on its risk assessment, an agency may elect to act alone or with the participation of other agencies or stakeholders to remediate or mitigate these physical hazards.", "TREASURY BORROWS MONEY By Issuing Treasury Securities To Finance The Federal Deficit, Includes Paying Interest On Outstanding Debt, Refining Maturing Debt.", "THE NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\u2019S (NNSA) PLANNED CLEANUP ACTIVITIES AT THE OAK RIDGE GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT AND AT THE PORTSMOUTH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT: HISTORY AND CHALLENGES.

Such actions, if taken, could improve the Department\u2019s management of large, expensive defense acquisition programs. MDA plans to field defenses against ballistic and cruise missiles concurrently. Ballistic defense systems are more mature and ready for fielding and therefore MDA has taken steps to begin deploying these assets.

In February 2017, MDA\u2019s Director said he would not have been satisfied with the MDA status quo as of January 2016. The Acting MDA Director is making improvements, but we found several opportunities for MDA to strengthen its program. Over the past two years, MDA\u2019s internal management structure and processes, including those pertaining to concurrency, have changed in positive ways. MDA\u2019s current senior leadership has taken action to improve the Agency\u2019s practices in several ways. First, MDA has placed increased emphasis on planning activities before starting to field defense assets. Second, MDA now considers several factors when evaluating whether to use existing capabilities\u2014called options. MDA has also changed the way it documents the evaluation of options and how it determines which options might be viable, including the use of analytically rigorous processes. Although MDA began considering options before beginning fielding activities, it did not always do so until later in the acquisition process. For example, we found that in 2017, there was a gap between the planned completion date for MDA\u2019s analysis of options and the date MDA said it would finalize plans and make decisions. Although this situation will be addressed once MDA finalizes its acquisition plans, the risk of concurrency remains.", "The NDP is seeking to reintroduce a long standing policy of establishing the nuclear deterrent at a cost that is affordable and commensurate with Canada\u2019s strategic requirements. While current and prior Government policy commits to the development of the nuclear deterrent and CAS provides the broad parameters of the nuclear deterrent, the Government is seeking advice on the appropriate size and composition of the nuclear deterrent given the current context. The Government is also seeking a discussion of the pros and cons of various nuclear weapons options from a policy, technical, and fiscal perspective, both as compared to the policy of CAS and other policy options under consideration. To assist with this effort, the Government is also seeking advice on how the CAR can be amended to ensure it is flexible enough to support CAS and potential new roles. This request from Canada has been accepted and a team will be in Canada the 2nd week of June to work with the government on its strategic rethink in the nuclear department. As part of those consultations, the CF will be meeting with the committee. The consultation document, will highlight the different roles the nuclear deterrent can play as well as the benefits and the costs (financial and political) of the alternative roles. The main focus will be on the nuclear submarine and its value to Canada. While both the RCN and DND are excited about this important dialogue there is some skepticism and caution in both communities about the implication of any change in policy.

JACKSON AND THE PROOF EDITOR C. A. MERKEL . FOR THE GOVT. P", "Prior to the enactment of the CFO Act, government reports found that agencies lost billions of dollars through fraud, waste, abuse, and misman- agerment. These reports painted the picture of a government unable to proper- ly manage its programs, protect its assets, or provide taxpayers with the effective and economical services they expected. REPORTED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS included (1) unreliable financial information driven by widespread weak- nesses in agency internal controls over financial reporting and obsolete and inef- ficient agency financial management systems and (2) financial reporting practices that did not accurately disclose the current and probable future cost of operat- ing, permit adequate comparison of actual costs among executive branch agencies, or provide the timely information required for efficient program management. For example, in 1988, we reported on internal control pro- b lems such as the Department of Defense being unable to account for hundreds of millions of dollars in advances paid by foreign customers for equipment, weak con- trols permitting things such as over $50 million in un- detected fraudulent insurance claims paid by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, millions of dollars in interest penalties because agencies paid 25 percent of their bills late, and over $350 million in lost interest because agencies paid their bills too soon. In 1990, Congress man- dated financial management reform through enactment of the CFO Act. The CFO Act was the most comprehensive and far- reach- ing financial management improvement legislation enacted since the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950. The CFO Act em- powersered agencies to: (1) consolidate duplicative and fragmented financial management activities and systems; and (2) take steps to develop and maintain financial management systems. In addition, the CFO Act aimed to strengthen internal controls, integr- ation of agency accounting and financial management systems, financial reporting practices,, and the financial management workforce. The CFO Act as Figure The federal government has made substan- tial progress toward improving financial management and achieving the purposes of the CFO Act. Table 1 highlights some of the progress that has been made. The central- ized leadership structures envisioned by the CFO Act -- a Controller position at the goverment-wide level and a CFO position at each CFO Act agency -- have been established. OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management and Office of Federal Financial Management, headed by the Controller and Deputy Controller, have led reform efforts by developing and periodically updating guidance and initiatives in areas such as financial management systems, auditing, financial reporting, internal control, and grants management. The CFO Act also required annual financial manage- ment status reports government-wide and for executive branch agencies. From a report issued by the OMB of January 2011, some of the improvements identified in the financial report include advis- ing and coordinating activities, providing guidance o financial management matters, issuing financial management standards, providing financial guidance, and issuing policy on internal controls and financial statement preparation and examination policy and procedures. As I mentioned above, the CFO Act aimed at strengthening internal con- troll es, in- tegration of agency accounting and financial management systems, financial reporting practices, and the financial management workforce. The CFO Act also required annual financial management status reports government-wide and o- executive branch agencies. From a report issued by OMB, the following information has to be reported on each program and activity for all agencies, (i) the major purposes of the program or activity; the goals to be achieved for the program or ac- tivity for that fiscal year; the desired outcome of the program or activity; and an explanation of how the program or activity supports the agency\u2019s mission (ii) performance indicators and any goals associated with such indicators; (iii) the methodology that will be used to ascer- tain the extent to which the objectives specified in the performance plan are being achieved; and (iv) a statement identifying the performance indicator that the Secretary intends to use as the primary indicator to measure the agency's progress and results toward achieving the performance goals. According to the report, the CFO Act required OMB to establish the following information for the annual Financial Management Report: (1) a summary of agency financial management practices and recent and planned financial management initiatives; (2) the budgeted financial statement activities for that fiscal year; and (3) a summary of the quality and timeliness of the ag", "The Corps is one of the world\u2019s largest public engineering, design, and construction management agencies. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the civilian Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army\u2019s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. AT THE CORPS LEVEL, THE CIVIL WORKS PROGRAM IS ORGANIZED INTO three tiers: headquarters in Washington, DC; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices (see fig. 1). Corps headquarters primarily develops policies and guidance to implement the agency's responsibilities and plans the direction of the organization. The divisions, which were established generally according to watershed boundaries, primarily coordinate the districts\u2019 civil works and military projects and are commanded by military officers. The districts, also commanded by military officers, are to, among other things, plan and implement feasibility studies and the resulting water resources development projects that are approved by the divisions and headquarters. There are several steps in conducting a Corps water resources development project. When a local community perceives a need or experiences a water resources problem that is beyond its ability to solve, it typically contacts the Corps for assistance. These communities and Congress, as well as other entities, play key roles in the process. Figure 2 illustrates the major steps in conducting a Corps water resources development project. As identified above, one of the major steps in initiating a water resources development project is conducting a feasibility study. Feasibility studies further investigate a water resources problem and make recommendations on whether a project is in the federal interest, and if so, how the problem should be addressed. Specifically, Corps officials are to consider risks at each point in the feasibility study process and balance the level of detail, data collection, research, and associated risks with what is necessary to deliver the feasibility study. The Corps uses SMART Planning to help feasibility studies meet the agency\u2019s 3x3x3 rule. Corps policy allows the Corps to spend more money and take more time on an unusually complex feasibility study if the Corps determines that the study is too complex to comply with the 3x3x3 rule. The act also requires the Secretary to provide written notice to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure each time the Corps grants an exception.</p> <p>PROBLEM: Corps did not have consistent policies and procedures for considering project risks and managing the associated costs during the early stages of the feasibility study process.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE: To strengthen Corps\u2019 management and oversight of Feasibility Studies.</p> <p>METHODOLOGY: Project Management Strategy; Project Management Procedures; Policy; Planning; Reporting; Training; Process Mapping; Procedural Improvement; Policy Development; SOP Development; Risk-Management Training; Controls Over Feasibility Studies.</p> <p>RESULTS: Weaknesses identified during the review of 23 feasibility studies in 5 divisions and 3 districts showed that in general, feasibility studies:</p> <p>- took longer to prepare than planned;</p> <p>- cost more than planned;</p> <p>- were more expensive; and</p> <p>- did not always meet the Corps\u2019 internal schedules, deadlines, or expectations.</p> <p>Our analysis showed the following:</p> <p>(1) The Corps\u2019 feasibility studies lacked sufficient attention to the critical early project development stages: scoping; project purpose and need; definition of project scope; and stakeholder involvement, as required by Corps policy.</p> <p>This deficiency, coupled with poor project planning and oversight, resulted in project delays, higher overall costs and higher risks to success.</p> <p>(2) The Corps\u2019 project feasibility studies had not performed sufficient risk- based analysis during the early planning stages to appropriately allocate funding, provide accurate cost estimates, or support feasibility decision-making.

In 2013, the Navy and Sikorsky entered into the current contract, which provides for the modification of S-92 aircraft airframes and has a ceiling price of $1.31 billion. Since then, four development test aircraft and two operational test aircraft are planned. The Navy will perform government-led testing to validate whether the VH-92A will be operationally effective and suitable for its intended use.

Primary inspection: After completing preprimary screening, passenger vehicles and commercial traffic proceed to primary inspection, where officers examine the vehicle and the cargo to ensure it is legal to be imported into the United States. Primary inspection for passenger vehicles usually consists of the passengers exiting the vehicle(s) while it undergoes further examination by CBP officers. Often the first to exit the vehicle are the driver and any accompanying guide dogs, as they are required to exit the vehicle in order for it to proceed to secondary inspection. Officers also perform further primary inspection at the secondary inspection stage for passenger vehicles. The preprimary and primary screening stages are designed to rapidly facilitate the movement of approved traffic while identifying risks to keep out hazardous materials and illicit cargo. Primary inspection at large land border crossings with multi-directional traffic at intersections may include dual-lane and one-way queuing areas in order to facilitate more efficient inspections. These queuing lanes are often located in front of inspection booths, which are equipped with tools to scan various types of cargo, including those with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to detect cargo shipments with potential security threats. After completing primary and secondary inspection, qualified cargo is loaded on vehicles for onward movement into the United States. Secondary inspection: After primary inspection of commercial cargo, the vehicle is directed to one of several vehicle examination lanes at secondary inspection. At secondary inspection, CBP officers visually inspect and X-ray the vehicle, look at the manifest, and make decisions about whether to inspect the cargo, delay, or release the vehicle. Officers may also decide to examine the cargo at the vehicle\u2019s destination by having the carrier deliver it directly via a CBP enforcement action. If officers decide to inspect the cargo, the cargo is moved to a separate CBP facility adjacent to the land border crossing. At large land border crossings, there are separate inspection facilities for vehicles going north and south which can handle a high volume of cargo traffic, in some cases inspecting over 500 vehicles and 1,000 pieces of cargo per hour. The inspection of cargo is intended to ensure that it meets all the legal import requirements in the United States and that there are no security or public safety risks, such as infectious diseases, hazardous materials, and narcotics. Officers may use radiation portal monitors, canine and detector dogs, X-ray machines, and infrared devices to inspect the cargo. Officers will only permit cargo cleared for entry to cross the border. The U.S. Government has spent billions of dollars building and maintaining these border crossings and their infrastructure to increase the efficiency of inspections and prevent illicit cross-border activity, such as the smuggling of people and hazardous goods. Infrastructure examples include the United States-Mexico border wall, highway inspection sites and crossing areas at land border crossings, and radiation portals at land ports of entry to help screen for illicit goods, such as unauthorized drug or human trafficking. 9\ndelivery at the vehicle\u2019s destination, while other types of cargo may be inspected at secondary inspection and could be held for days or weeks to clear security risks. CBP also has the ability to scan cargo at the vehicle\u2019s destination by scanning the cargo at a port other than the port of entry at which the vehicle arrives. Secondary inspection at a land port of entry may also include radiation portals to detect nuclear or radiological material by using radiation to probe vehicles and cargo. This is done using portal monitors known as radiation portal monitors. The radiation portal monitors at some border crossings are located before and after the secondary inspection area. At the first portal, which is known as the incoming or primary portal, high-intensity portal monitors, detectors, and canines inspect the vehicle through steel plating before it enters a secondary inspection lane. In contrast, the second portal, known as the outgoing or secondary portal, which is after the secondary inspection area, consists of lower intensity portal monitor that look for radiological anomalies that suggest the potential presence of nuclear material. For example, the radiation detection technologies are looking for a signal from an unnatural, manmade source, not the natural sources found throughout the environment from space. CBP officers may have canine teams look for", "Federal agencies have many programs that provide services and benefits to tribes and their members. For example, the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Office of the As sistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Indian Affairs) administers programs in natural res ources mana gement , Indian child welfare, and ec on omic development\u2014among other responsibilities. One key BIA responsibility is to facilitate tribes\u2019 development of energy resources on and under trust or a restriction s status. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) within the Department of Hea lth and Hum an Services is charged with providing health care to approx ima tely 2 . 6 million Indians through more than 600 IHS or tribally operated facilities as of 2019. When services are not available at these facilities, IHS may pay for services provided through external providers. In ad dition, as part of its disease prevention efforts , IHS provides technical and financia l assistance to Indian tribes for the coo perati ve development and construction of drinking water and w aste water sy stem s and support facilities. These and other federa l programs m ay also be admini stered by tribal governments under a self-determination compactu s con tract or self-governance compa curity at risk. In February 2017 we added im proved federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members to our high-risk list . We reported that BIA misma nages Indian energy resources held in trust an d thereby limits opportunities f or tribes and their members to use those resources to create ec on omic benefits and improve the well-being of their communities. Our recommendations im proved federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members have not yet been achieved. We added IHS management of Indian health care services to our high-risk list in our March 2019 High-Risk Update. We found that HHS has not ensured that Indian Health Service s healthcare workers meet all federal hiring prerequisites , which puts patients at risk. For example, a substantial number of healthcare and allied personal staff hired from temporary employment agencies were hired without criminal and medical background checks. As a result HI S has not always ensured a skilled, professional workforce. IHS also did not consistently document its efforts to address its workforce challenges. HHS con trinues to face workforce challenges that have prevented it from providing effective Indian health care services. For example, we found that Indian Health Service staff at two of our reviewed facilities hired from temporary employment agencies were unable to administer drugs and provide mental health care due to training and certification requirements , which put patients at risk. This is an important finding because in 2017 we reported that Indian Health Service failed to hire a skilled, professional worforce as required by law as described by HHS s own inspector g eneral . Our prior HI S recommendation that HHS report its workforce plans to congress for at least 6 years is long overdue. We recommended that we could strengthen our evaluation of congress s oversight of IHS and help to guide congress in oversight efforts. To that end we identified several issues across all of our designated areas with implementation of self-determination contracts and compacts with tribes . Our recommendation aims to enhance congress s oversight capabilities by providing tribes and federal officials with the information and tools they need to oversee self-determination contracts and compacts. For example, we have recommended that the Department of the Interior report the number and size of tribal departments or agencies managing self-determination (contract) or self- g overnance compacts and to report data on their contracts and compacts by these groups . While steps have been taken to implement this recommendation to improve monitoring and oversight by tribes, our March 2019 High-Risk Update indicates that the Department of the Interior continues to face several challenges. For example , the Department of the Interior only recently implemented a method to track the implementation and management of these self-governance funds . Further , in fiscal year 2017 , BIA disbursed more than $ 150 million o f funds not reported as self-governance to Tribes because it lacked the data to determine whether the funds were subject to self-governance management and accounting guidance . As a result , we were unable to assess BIA s management of these funds. IHS has had mixed results in improving the management of self -governance funds . For example, IHS has", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported in March 2017 that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) faced a serious threat from an IT vulnerability discovered in March 2014. OMB subsequently established a commission comprised of representatives from agencies impacted by the vulnerability. OMB also reported that an OPM information technology contractor identified the vulnerability, but OPM subsequently indicated that it still had not found the contractor. In addition to the IT vulnerability, OPM also had issues with its information technology systems and financial management systems, which OMB reported in May 2016. OMB required agencies to report critical challenges, initiatives, and actions within 6 months. As of March 2017, several agencies reported actions that OPM had identified in its own risk assessment and action plan. OMB also required agencies to submit information on whether they relied on OPM services for IT services or agency personnel. As of March 2017, the OMB had not yet received responses from all impacted agencies. In April 2017, OMB required OPM to submit a plan to address the IT vulnerability, which OPM submitted in June 2017. OPM also has developed actions to address other IT issues. OMB also issued a governmentwide directive in March 2017 requiring agencies to report on their IT risk assessments and management improvement efforts. As of May 2017, OPM had not reported. OMB also published a guidance document titled \u201cImmediate Actions and Remediation Recommendations.\u201d That document identified actions that agencies should implement to address IT security vulnerabilities and management control weaknesses. It required agencies to provide corrective action plans and schedules for addressing the risks to OMB. As of May 2017, OMB had not received most agency reports. In September 2017, OPM released its cybersecurity improvement plan, focused on addressing the IT vulnerability. In October 2017, OMB published additional requirements to address IT issues. OMB subsequently reported, on behalf of two federal IT inspector general offices, problems with certain IT security activities. As of December 2017, OPM had not provided written responses to our recommendations. OMB issued a final management alert in June 2018 requiring agencies to review their own cyber risk profiles based on factors such as the significance of the information held by their systems and the potential impact of a cyber breach of those systems, which OPM has submitted. The House of Representatives has passed legislation, H.R.2470 as amended by H.R. 1865, to address the IT vulnerability, but this legislation has not advanced in the Senate. OMB has taken several actions to mitigate problems with OPM\u2019s financial management capabilities and has issued a directive requiring agencies to develop plans to improve their financial management control systems. As of May 2016, OMB had not received information from about a quarter of agencies. OMB subsequently established requirements for agencies to submit certain key financial management data in order to allow OMB to track its management challenges. As of May 2018, OMB had not yet received all agency information. For the OMB budget process, OMB directed agencies to prepare for their fiscal year 2020 budget requests by identifying programs for potential reallocation or elimination and any congressionally mandated programs. OPM did not submit a budget request for fiscal year 2019, with a request for additional funding by OMB. In June 2018, the Congress appropriated funding for OPM. On December 19, 2018, President Trump signed a bill into law reauthorizing government programs. The bill included funding for OPM. GAO has reported on OPM\u2019s role in the administration\u2019s reorganization proposal. On April 12, 2017, OMB issued a governmentwide management alert directing agencies to review whether the administration\u2019s January 30, 2017, reorganization proposal would affect their missions. GAO has continued to conduct our risk-based audit work. We have not completed our risk assessments and audit selections for some agencies, such as OPM.\n13 EXECUTIVE", "TSA\u2019s insider threat mission is to detect, prevent, and mitigate internal threats to commercial aviation by working collaboratively with federal, state, and international agencies. TSA\u2019s core responsibility for aviation insider threat is its mandate to address insider threat risk management in the aviation and surface transportation industries. In addition, under this mandate, TSA manages the TWIC system and manages aviation security at maritime facilities, and certain passenger and recreational vessels, all of which are covered in part A. Within TSA, five component offices report directly to the agency\u2019s Administrator and are responsible for insider threat activities to include insider threat risk management, insider threat screening (background investigation), training, and education and outreach through research and analysis. (See figure 22, below). TSA\u2019s Chief Security Officer serves as the program sponsor and is responsible for ensuring the agency\u2019s insider threat mission is effectively and efficiently carried out across the component offices. The Chief Security Officer, and his/her office, is based in TSA\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. * * * * Recommendation The Assistant Inspector General for Aviation, in conjunction with the Inspector General , is requested to review the implementation of the Comprehensive Cargo Pre-Screening Program (CCP). We are also requesting the review of the current processes in place for conducting pre-employment suitability checks on those personnel involved in the insider threat mission. We believe a review of their practices could help TSA improve those processes.  Figure 1. Security-restricted Areas of Categories X and I Airports Sources: GAO; and TSA.

These plans have shifted back and forth between conducting a human lunar landing in order to inform the longer term goal of human exploration of Mars. Figure 1 highlights key events in NASA\u2019s human spaceflight plans from 2005 to 2019. We have found that NASA has faced challenges developing systems capable of transporting humans to space over the past two decades. These include development efforts under NASA\u2019s prior human spaceflight program \u2013 the Constellation program \u2013 which was canceled in the face of acquisition problems and funding-related issues. More recently, we have found that NASA has struggled to complete its current human spaceflight programs \u2013 Orion, SLS, and Exploration Ground Systems \u2013 within their established cost and schedule baselines. Establishing a sound business case to ensure resources align with requirements includes following best practices for product development and creating cost estimates and schedules. NASA\u2019s prior human spaceflight programs highlight challenges created when programs do not establish a sound business case. For example: In 2009, we found that NASA had not developed a solid business case \u2013 including firm requirements, mature technologies, a realistic cost estimate, and sufficient funding and time \u2013 that was needed to justify moving the Con stellation program forward into the implementation phase. We found that the program had not developed this solid business case because NASA lacked a clear funding scenario and the program had not completed technical analyses for major elements of the architecture. Further, in 2018, we found that NASA plans to build Ex plo ration Ground Systems \u2014 the program that NASA will use to transport and process crews and cargo to the Moon and Mars \u2014 in phases. NASA has completed the first phase and began work on the second phase, but has had difficulty in deciding what systems, capabilities, and facilities to buy and build as part of that second phase. NASA\u2019s past approach in this area has left it ill-posi tioned to identify early-warning signs of potential schedule growth as part of the second phase. We have made 20 recommendations in prior reports to strengthen NASA\u2019s acquisition management of SLS and exploration ground systems but NASA has not fully implemented these recommendations. NASA initiates space flight programs and projects to accomplish its scientific or exploration goals. A NASA program has a dedicated funding profile and defined management structure, and may or may not include several projects. NASA uses the term \u201ctightly coupled program\u201d to refer to a program that is made up of multiple projects working together to complete the program\u2019s mission. Senior NASA offi cials must approve programs and projects. Programs and projects go through multiple phases\u2014formulation, development and implementation are the key milestones for programs, while initiation, development, and closure are the key milestones for projects. Programs are generally more complex and take longer to develop than projects. These phases cover the development of requirements, the development of a project plan, the award of contracts to develop key products and complete key functions, testing of the key products and functions, and delivery of those products and functions. For a project to move into the implementation phase, the project must be approved by the program manager and senior management. Programs typically have longer funding horizons and typically fund multiple projects through multiple funding cycles. Projects are usually less complex and take less time and money to develop than programs. These phases cover the development of requirements, the award of contracts to develop the key products to complete functions, testing of these products and functions, delivery of products or functions, operating the products or functions for some period of time, refurbishment or recertification, and the eventual retirement of components or functions. For a project to move into the implementation phase, senior management within the organization must approve the project or the product. Project managers usually take project deliverables through one funding cycle\u2014they may also plan, manage, and deliver multiple projects, with each project in a separate cycle. 2 The term \u201csystem\u201d in this case is defined as an interrelated set of personnel, facilities, equipment, and software configured to perform a specific function. An organization may define a system differently.

Staff in one of VA\u2019s 57 regional offices assist the veteran by gathering additional evidence, such as military and medical records, that is needed to evaluate the claim. Based on this evidence, VBA decides whether the veteran is entitled to compensation and, if so, how much. A veteran dissatisfied with the initial claim decision can generally appeal within 1 year from the date of the notification letter sent by VBA. 12 GAO VA Disability Benefits, Accuracy of the Legacy Process, Appeals Modernization Effort, Highlights of 2016 Monitoring Report 2017 for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2017. 268 FTE for these functions and VBA appeals will require 86 additional FTE for processing.  In another area, VA added information about its efforts to use data to ensure compliance with legal requirements for the purposes of its workload analyses in its appeal costs model. For this element related to determining personnel requirements and productivity projections, VA stated that it is not yet able to prepare a model of VBA staff productivity for processing appeals and the associated costs of appeals for inclusion in VA\u2019s proposed annual budget for FY 2019 because some elements of its analysis are not yet complete for FY 2019. This issue was not addressed in the March 2018 report. Therefore, although VA is generally addressing this element by using sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of VBA staff productivity on budget estimates for processing appeals and the associated appeal costs, it is not fully addressing this element in its appeal costs model due to the fact that other aspects of the estimates are not complete. While VA has made progress in meeting the Act\u2019s requirements for an appeals process that is \u201cfaster, simpler, and less burdensome to the veterans,\u201d VA must continue to address the Act\u2019s requirements including delineating resources for the existing and new appeals process options. VA has begun to address a number of these resource needs. For example, VA conducted work to address staffing requirements and additional costs associated with the current legacy appeals process. However, VBA needs additional time for data to be completed on the productivity and efficiencies for its current appeals process before it can estimate staffing needs. In addition, VA has only partially met the requirement in the law to determine the productivity and associated efficiency gains for its new appeals process by including VBA employees and excluding the Board employees who will process appeals in the new process. This is an outstanding requirement because without knowing how VBA processes appeals using the new process, VA cannot project staffing needs and associated costs for the new process. VA should complete the remaining steps, as directed by the law, by fully determining resources needed to process appeals in the new appeals process by analyzing the productivity of VBA employees who will process appeals in the new process; identifying all components of VBA\u2019s resources, including staffing requirements and costs, as identified in the appeals cost model; and updating the model to include full resource requirements and costs associated with the new appeals process. Implementing the Act\u2019s appeals process requires that VA have and maintain a reliable estimate of the staffing and costs of processing appeals of the compensation for disabilities. To achieve this objective, the law specifies that VA should\u2014 \u2022 Use sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of different workload and production assumptions on appeals costs and the resulting appeals processes. \u2022 Use estimates from VBA\u2019s current appeals process as a proxy for the new appeals process until more specific estimates are available to ensure VA properly reflects costs for the new appeals process in VA\u2019s budget submissions. \u2022 Determine resource needs for the new appeals process by analyzing VBA\u2019s productivity using VBA employees when it analyzes the productivity of the Board employees, and noting that, in the appeals cost model, VA must not exclude VBA employees or Board employees. \u2022 Use VBA\u2019s appeals cost model to estimate staffing requirements and costs for the new appeals process. VA is now fully addressing 2 of the 5 elements missing in the March 2018 report. As of May 2018, OMB does not believe VA has addressed the other 3 elements. 13 GAO VA Disability Benefits, Accuracy of the Legacy Process, Appeals Modernization Effort, Highlights of", "We plan to summarize the first 3 paragraphs and the last paragraph. TEXT: You can access the COSO Framework here. (Page 18 and 19) This COSO framework can help users to identify and evaluate risks in their organization, especially related to internal controls. This framework can be used for businesses of any size, not only for large businesses or listed companies. The COSO Framework can help us determine whether the internal control necessary to operate our business effectively in the future is being implemented now and is being monitored continuously. The framework can help users develop a common mind-set and vocabulary for managing and discussing internal business risks, and for thinking about and using internal control systems to manage those risks. The framework describes the components of internal control needed to conduct and manage an organization effectively and efficiently. The Comptroller General of the United States and six private sector financial experts developed the COSO Framework. The COSO Framework, along with related training materials and tools, are very useful resources for all of us as we seek to improve our internal control management within our company(s). The COSO Framework was developed in the early 1990s. This COSO framework is very powerful, and has been widely used. One of the biggest advantages of this framework is that by using this framework, we can think through and identify the relevant risks faced by our business, as well as control risks that we may not have thought about previously. That is critical and very important for us for managing our business. This framework not only helps us to identify risks, it also helps us to build internal control measures to mitigate risks in order to achieve our goals of the business as well as our personal goals. We can determine appropriate responses to the assessed risks identified, because this framework can help us to decide the appropriate remedial measures we should take. This framework allows us to focus on the underlying risks and causes rather than on particular symptoms. It also helps us to think about the root causes of risks within our organization, because the COSO framework does not just focus on symptoms on the surface. According to this framework, symptoms will often only occur for a brief time before they are dealt with. This COSO framework also allows us to focus much more proactively and clearly on our desired future state, and not just on the present and immediate issues or situations.", "Medication Synchronisation.\nMedisummarization.com is the top blog for all the summaries you need!\nMedisummary.com.

MHPI enables the military departments to use private sector expertise to develop, build, maintain, and improve the quality, availability, and modernity of military family housing.\nCongress has authorized a government program that enables the military departments to use private sector expertise to develop, build, maintain, and improve the quality, availability, and modernity of housing units for servicemembers and their families. This program is known as Military Housing Privatization Initiative, or MHPI. The Secretary of Defense may enter into housing privatization contracts that enable the private sector to perform all or some of the following functions on behalf of the military departments:\n\u2014 Develop, manage, construct, and maintain military family housing.\n\u2014 Purchase goods and services related to the maintenance and operation of military family housing.\nDOD delegated the program to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research, Development, Acquisition, and Logistics and established the Office of the Deputy Assistant of Defense for Housing and Community Initiatives within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research, Development, Acquisition, and Logistics. This delegation of MHPI functions is authorized by P.L. 107-107, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2002, which allows the Secretary to authorize the use of MHPI to include the operation and maintenance of temporary housing. The authority remains in effect through FY 2018; however, the Secretary has recently delegated authority to allow the continuation of the MHPI program until December 31, 2021.\n2.\tMHPI enables the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps, and the Air Force to house servicemembers and their families at an equivalent quality and availability to privately owned housing of similar size and quality, while meeting their housing requirements worldwide.\n3.\tMHPI relies on the private sector\u2014in partnership with the military departments\u2014to help the military departments better manage construction and renovation contracts, thereby increasing the quality and availability of servicemembers\u2019 privatized family housing and enabling the military departments to focus their efforts on achieving their primary mission: preparing the servicemembers for combat.\nThe program\u2019s purpose is to modernize and expand servicemembers\u2019 privatized family housing to ensure that these housing units are safe and healthy and that all military families are eligible for these housing units. To fulfill this purpose, the federal government must ensure the maintenance and modernization of housing units located in the United States and its territories. This federal guarantee, however, was not always realized in practice. According to the Government Accountability Office, in the late 1990s servicemembers in certain housing authorities complained that their housing was not maintained at high quality and that contracted repair work was not performed in a timely manner. The Government Accountability Office issued a report in 2002 stating that the problems resulted because the military departments focused their efforts on contracting for construction and management on a project-by-project basis. In effect, the military departments prioritized construction and renovations that addressed units most in need of repair or replacement because of age or poor management or that were in locations that required servicemembers to commute long distances to fulfill their obligations at installations.\nThe MHPI is designed to help correct these issues and to help the military departments better manage housing contracts by relying on the private sector for expertise. By encouraging the construction of new military housing by the private sector, the initiative is intended to help the military departments provide greater availability and modernization of units, thereby enabling the military departments to more fully address their mission of preparing servicemembers for battle and providing them with adequate housing. Congress has encouraged the use of MHPI by authorizing the Secretary of Defense to use this initiative to obtain housing for servicemembers through privatized methods.\n4. Military housing privatization is a process in which the military departments contract certain aspects of their family housing functions, including renovations and construction, to private-sector partners.\nCongress first authorized MHPI through the FY 1996 National Defense", "FAR policies and procedures are applicable to most government contracts that require DOD to acquire supplies or services from private companies. Specifically, contracting officials use the FAR and related acquisition handbooks to assist them in planning for contracts. Additionally, contractors are required to comply with the FAR unless the contracts provide a special exception to it. For example, the FAR provides that contracting officials must review information about contractors\u2019 performance in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), an on-line database, before awarding a contract to a prospective contractor that has been awarded a federal contract equal to or greater than $150,000. However, as discussed in this chapter and in our previous audit, FAPIIS information is incomplete and out of date. FAPIIS generally provides a 40-week lag between the contracting officials receiving a past performance rating and the rating\u2019s information being posted to the site. However, a DOD official said that contracting officials can use information about a contractor\u2019s performance from sources other than FAPIIS when awarding a federal contract up to $150,000, which may include information from CPARS. As for health and safety compliance, OSHA and state agencies share responsibility for enforcing federal OSH Act policies for private sector contractors. OSHA conducts on-site inspections and collects data on workplace injuries and illnesses through its Injury and Illness Electronic Submission system (IIF). In accordance with the OSH Act, the federal OSHA and the states have responsibility to establish health and safety standards that ensure these contractors protect their employees from hazardous working conditions.", "The DOD CMF Teams are designed to enhance DOD\u2019s capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations. These teams are intended to improve DOD cyber expertise in cyber warfare and cyber intelligence support with respect to military activities, to provide enhanced situational understanding for DOD leaders, and to conduct offensive and defensive cyberspace operations. At the time of our review, the number of CMF teams had increased since we previously reported on the issue in July 2012. DOD has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the ongoing establishment and training of these CMF teams. However, since team members complete most of their training on a part-time basis, and training is often conducted outside the CMF teams\u2019 primary working hours, the teams have generally low readiness levels. In addition, the teams\u2019 lack of consistent structure and training could potentially hamper DOD\u2019s ability to conduct offensive and defensive cyberspace operations.

As a result, officials were not always aware of cybersecurity risks associated with their medical devices and applications that access electronic health data. Furthermore, VA lacked a risk analysis before deploying these devices, applications, and associated devices. Consequently, VA cannot ensure patients\u2019 electronic health data is secure. VA reported spending about $386 million on cybersecurity, which represented about 8 percent of its total IT expenditures. In fiscal year 2018, VA reduced risks for its inventory of medical devices and applications by analyzing vulnerabilities for these devices, applying security updates, and developing a comprehensive risk analysis. For example, in fiscal year 2019, VA updated its VistA system security by applying approximately 854 patches for 254 security vulnerabilities. VA is also developing an inventory of medical devices and applications and plans to complete this inventory by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. However, the department is still working to improve the inventory to include additional information required for conducting a risk analysis. Furthermore, VA officials reported their cybersecurity program is effective and complies with federal cybersecurity requirements, yet cybersecurity deficiencies were identified in prior audits. According to VA officials, VA implemented our recommendations from the most recent audits, but many cybersecurity deficiencies are still evident. Lastly, VA identified several information security incidents and risk factors that could affect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of certain information, but the severity and impact of these incidents are unknown. Therefore, without accurate reporting of all incidents, VA cannot effectively manage and respond to cybersecurity threats. These inaccuracies occur because information security is not incorporated into incident response requirements and processes. SPECIAL NOTE: The report was prepared before the close of the fiscal year. As a result, cost and fiscal year 2019 data associated with this issue are subject to change, pending the availability of additional data.\nFull text public : VA\u2019s IT systems should prevent unauthorized or inappropri - ate access to information, such as personal health information or other sensitive and proprietary information. Moreover, the department should proactively address the threat of cyberattacks on its critical systems. For example, VA reported 148 security-related incidents throughout all levels of the department\u2014from systems and applications to network and physical assets.  As shown in table 1, the majority of these incidents were network-, system-, and application-related events, which represented approximately two-thirds of all incidents. For fiscal years 2016 through 2018, VA reported an average of 126 incidents annually, 68 of which were 35. The remaining 71 incidents, or 45 percent, involved applications.

If access is not authorized in IMESA, PACS cards will be denied access to installations. DOD components issue the cards for individuals who seek access to installations with PACS to establish their identity and establish an acceptable purpose for their presence on the installations. DOD components use IMESA to help determine whether individuals are authorized unescorted access to installations; however, PACS cards are not required to establish unescorted access to installations or determine individuals\u2019 fitness-for-access if they are authorized access with an ID card. DODI 5500.1 states the issuing components must establish criteria for unescorted access and periodically assess individuals for fitness- for-access determinations based on that criteria, and that components\u2019 PACS must provide an automatic alert to security forces when an individual who has been granted unescorted access to an installation is deemed not-fit-for-access.4 In February 2017, GAO reported DOD could not articulate a clear and consistent definition of fitness- for-access determinations, which was the primary issue of the 2005 GAO report titled Installation Access Control (Reference 1).5 GAO reported DOD components had different definitions for fitness-for-access determinations, and while most of the components did use IMESA to help make those determinations, IMESA does not include a definition of these determinations. DOD components that had the capability of electronically connecting to IMESA and could use that capability to establish fitness-for-access determinations in their PACS. GAO reported a commander of each component could determine their own criteria for fitness-for-access determinations on a case-by-case basis, which had the potential for different or inconsistent criteria by component and different or inconsistent determinations by installation. In June 2018, OUSD(I) revised its memorandum requiring components that field PACS to (1) adopt ODS(I)\u2019s definition of fitness-for-access determinations and (2) field revised systems, based on that definition.6 Although the revised definition is not as expansive as the definition included in GAO\u2019s February 2017 report, the revised DOD definition includes IMESA records for individual circumstances that may impact the individual\u2019s ability to perform their required duties while on the installation. The revised DOD definition also includes (1) IMESA records on known or suspected terrorist, (2) individuals on the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s terrorist watch list, (3) individuals on the FBI\u2019s terrorist screening data base, (4) IMESA records on outstanding felony warrants and records of convicted sex offenders residing in the State, and (5) other credible derogatory information.7 OUSD(I) officials reported IMESA contains outstanding felony warrant information, and PACS cards can be denied access at installations when IMESA alerts of outstanding felony warrants are received. DODI 5500.1 states components should use IMESA records of warrants, when applicable, for denying access to installations and consider other credible derogatory information in determining whether individuals are fit- for-access determinations.8 The memorandum states IMESA can be used by components to (1) verify an individuals\u2019 presence on IMESA and (2) validate a component\u2019s criteria for fitness-for-access.9 In addition to the ODS(I) and component requirements on unescorted access to installations, DODI 5500.1 includes requirements addressing the process for individuals to seek escorted access to installations.

Furthermore, to help students and communities succeed, these offices should explore expanding their outreach activities to underserved communities, including HBCUs. See figure 1 for the flow of entrepreneurial program management from the SBA\u2019s Office of Entrepreneurial Development to the field. Sources: SBA, GAO, and HHS. Office of Field Operations. The Office of Field Operations provides resources to support economic development in underserved communities. The SBA\u2019s District Director is responsible for the overall administration of the loan programs and ensuring that local lenders adhere to SBA regulations. Additionally, the District Director is responsible for supervising disaster assistance within a district, providing outreach and economic development services to underserved businesses and communities, and supporting SBA district offices. In the majority of states and territories without HBCUs (see figure 1), district offices can conduct outreach services through various events or technical assistance (see table 1). Table 1. Overview of Small Business Administration\u2019s District Offices Providing Outreach to Entrepreneurs District offices conduct outreach to help grow small businesses and can provide entrepreneurs with information on the SBA\u2019s small business loan and informational programs. District Offices Can: \u2022 Provide direct or referral services for small businesses interested in getting support; \u2022 Provide small and large business seminars (on entrepreneurship or basic business practices); and \u2022 Provide technical support to lenders to improve lending performance and credit availability. These activities are not limited to HBCUs. Although district offices primarily provide services to small businesses, they can provide assistance to entrepreneurs through other events that are not limited to HBCUs. For example, the SBA\u2019s Kansas City, Missouri, district office conducted the Small Business Expo- 2019 during Black History Month on February 28\u2014March 1, 2019, as reported in the KC Chamber blog. The event was held in support of HBCUs. Office of Strategic Alliances. The mission of the Office of Strategic Alliances is to foster collaborative and integrated relationships with federal, state, local, and private sector entities to maximize impact and sustainability. Within this mission, the office may explore expanding SBA efforts to reach underserved communities, including HBCUs. For example, as previously reported by GAO, a district director for a district with a large black population and a HBCU in its district was not aware of federal policies and guidance specifically designed to encourage strategic alliances with HBCUs regarding SBA programs. GAO identified some best practices of other federal agencies that could inform SBA\u2019s efforts (see table 2). While those best practices could potentially support SBA\u2019s work promoting entrepreneurship among HBCU students, many of the best practices described in the table are not yet implemented. SAM\u2019s interactive maps show locations of key SBA offices that provide services to small businesses and SBA program outreach targeting. GAO\u2019s analysis was limited to data from academic years prior to 2010, as the information for academic years from 2010 to the present is not available. Academic years 2005 through 2009 are referred to as \u201chistoric\u201d data. Figure II. Map of SAM Interactive Site Interactive map to illustrate HBCUs and SBA district offices with outreach. As of July 2019, the SBA\u2019s Small Business Administration had made the following changes to the HBCUs and SBA District Offices with Outreach. (1) The SBA added SBA district offices of the Dallas, Houston, and Kansas City, Missouri regions. We reviewed data for those three regions rather than the other five regions listed in the report. In those regions, we were unable to identify any HBCUs that had a cooperative agreement, memorandum of understanding, or strategic partnership with the SBA for any of the years cited in the report. However, since the publication of this draft report, we were directed to a site that indicates the SBA has established SBA cooperative agreements with two HBCUs \u2013 Jacksonville State University and Bowie State University \u2013 in 2019. Therefore, we modified the figure to reflect this change so that each colored dot now represents one and only one HBCU. \u2022 We found that the SBA established an agreement with HBCU Jacksonville State University", "A. Depots are government-owned, government-operated industrial installations that maintain, overhaul, and repair a multitude of complex military weap- on systems and equipment for the Department of De- fense. B. The Department of Defense (DOD) depot mainte- nance mission is the repair of highly complex weapons systems. It is essential to maintaining readiness for DOD, and the depots have a key role in sustaining weapon systems and equipment in both peacetime and during mobilization, con- tingency, or other emergency. C. DOD depots are required by the Military Readi- ness Report to achieve and sustain certain level of ac- tivities called production and operations, including maintenance and repair of materiel, at a specific level or a higher level than last report. This is to avoid a deterioration of depot mating system readiness. D. To achieve a higher level of activities, DOD has to work more efficient by increasing its production and opera- tions activities. Therefore, the department is required by Militar Readiness Report to identify and close gaps and to conduct the depot maintenance activities in the most cost-effective manner. E. DOD depots are managed by a central organi- zation known as Weapon System Support Center (WSCC). This central organization coordinates depot mainte- nance requirements for 21 depots, organizes the de- partment-wide maintenance policy for 6 percent rule (which requires the depots to conduct 6 percent of the total number of production activities to maintain weapon system). F. Our past reports found that DOD depots have delays for maintenance. We reported in 2018 that one Army depot had not met its performance targets for 5 years due to poor management and that one Air Force depot did not meet its targets for 6 of 9 years. G. Based on our past reports, we recommend that the As- sistant Secretary for Acquisition direct the Weapon System Support Center to develop and implement a plan to ensure depots work efficiently by achieving high level of activities with lower cost.", "After a short history of current Physicians. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: According to HRSA, the current demand for physicians in the United States will likely continue, with a projected shortage of 23,640 primary care physicians by 2025. While increasing physician supply is one way to reduce physician shortages, some experts have also suggested increasing the number of non-physician providers. For example, HRSA predicted that, with health care delivery changes that would allow for NPs and PAs to deliver a greater proportion of services than they do now, the projected shortage of 23,640 primary physicians in 2025 could be mitigated. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018, there were 756,800 physicians, over 189,100 NPs, and 118,800 PAs practicing in the United States. Physicians. Physician GME, also known as residency, provides the clinical training required for a physician to be eligible for licensure and board certification to practice medicine independently in the United States. Specifically, after completing medical school and receiving a medical degree, physicians enter a multi-year residency training program during which they complete their formal education as a physician, primarily in teaching hospitals. Completion of a residency can take from 3 to 7 years. In some cases, physicians may choose to pursue additional training\u2014referred to as fellowships\u2014to become a subspecialist, such as a cardiologist. NPs and PAs. Since the first NP and PA training programs in the United States were founded in 1965, these professions and their educational requirements have evolved to allow them to furnish more care that was traditionally provided by physicians. There are multiple pathways for students to become NPs. In general, after completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree, students become NPs once they earn a master\u2019s degree in nursing. The average full-time NP program takes about 27 months to complete, which includes classroom education followed by clinical work conducted through rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and behavioral medicine. In addition, NP students have varying amounts of hands-on work experience in health care before entering an NP program. PAs are trained to approach patient care according to a medical model focused on assessing, diagnosing, and treating disease. Both NPs and PAs may also complete an optional post-graduate residency training program, but unlike physicians, they are not required to do so in order to become licensed. NP residencies focus on developing advanced skills in primary care. However, NP residencies are not common, as they are limited in number and only make up about 2% of all NPs in the United States, as shown in Figure 2. PAs also may pursue a post-graduate residency; however, as shown in Figure 3, less than 3% of all PAs in the United States graduate from a PA residency program. Figure 1 shows an example of education and training paths for physicians. Figure 2 shows the percentage of NPs that entered post- graduate residency. Figure3 shows the percentage of PAs that entered a PA residency.", "The sale of U.S.-origin armaments and other \"defense articles \" has been a part of national security policy since at least the Lend-Lease programs in the lead-up to U.S. involvement in World War II. Historically, Presidents have used sales of defense articles and services to foreign governments and organizations to further broad foreign policy goals, ranging from sales to strategically important countries during the Cold War, to building global counterterrorism capacity following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries is governed by a broad set of statutes, public laws, federal regulations, and executive branch policies, along with international agreements. An interconnected body of legislative provisions, authorizations, and reporting requirements related to the transfer of U.S. defense articles to other countries appears in both the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) and in the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) Appropriations Acts. These laws reflect the roles that both the Department of State and the Department of Defense (DOD) take in the administration of the sale and export of defense articles to foreign countries, which can be found in both Title 22 (Foreign Relations) and Title 10 (Armed Services) of the United States Code. Among other provisions, the FAA established broad policy guidelines for the overall transfer of defense articles and services from the United States to foreign countries and organizations, also called eligible purchasers . In DCS, the United States does not act as a broker for the sale, but is still responsible for licensing it, unless export of the item is exempt from licensing according to regulations in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), contained in Subchapter M, 22 CFR 120-130. The State Department has the authority and responsibility, as set in statutes, such as Sections 22 and 62 of the Arms Export Control Act, also described in Section III, to notify Congress at least 15 days prior to all planned sales and licensed DCS operations. The report also provides a select list of specific legislative limitations and end-use monitoring requirements found in the Arms Export Control Act. Future updates will consider policy implications and issues for Congress. The value of all of this, including the arms sales of the United States to foreign governments and organizations, is not set forth in this report. That information is readily available for readers to access and is included in various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports, such as the Worldwide Reporting series. For the past 20 years, the United States has been the world's number one arms seller under this type of transfer arrangement, under which the United States is the largest source of global defense exports. This report provides a more detailed overview of key U.S. arms sales programs and the role of Congress.

President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected by acclaimed vote under a hybrid transition process, and became president of Liberia in 2006. The United States and Liberia have maintained strong official ties over centuries of cooperation, underpinned by a strong people-to-people relationship and robust public and private partnerships. U.S. assistance to Liberia has focused on economic and civil society rebuilding, democratic capacity building, and improved security and peace. The bilateral relationship was formalized, and assistance programs reorganized, through the U.S.- Liberia Partnership Dialogue, which launched in August 2011 and serves as the primary means of cooperation going forward. On October 8, 2017, President Donald J. Trump welcomed", "In recent years, discussions about border security have often involved illicit drugs, primarily marijuana, but also methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl, and how foreign-produced illicit drugs flow into the United States between U.S. official ports of entry, or \"POEs.\" This is so because it is largely through POEs that drugs are brought into the country. This report discusses both general and detailed aspects of drug smuggling between POEs. General aspects are discussed in Section I, which provides an overview of illicit drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico. Detailed aspects are discussed in Section II, with specific chapters devoted to four drugs that are most commonly smuggled across the Southwest border (marijuana, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl). Each chapter follows the same basic structure: 1) Summary of Drug Smuggling by Method. Here smuggling between POEs is summarized by method. Each method is defined and described in detail in the following chapters. Some of the methods discussed refer specifically to marijuana smuggling, while others refer to drug smuggling more generally. 2) Discussion of Patterns, Trends, and Challenges. This section explores changes in smuggling patterns, trends, and challenges between POEs over the years. Topics discussed include patterns of drug seizures, types of tunnels, the use of unmanned aerial systems, underground cross-border smuggling tunnels, and the use of smuggling tunnels by foreign TCOs. 3) Analysis of Changes in Border Barriers. This chapter discusses the evolution of physical barriers and technological enhancements to the 170 km land border between the two countries. Changes in technological capabilities and the deployment of new physical barriers may have had a significant impact on the methods of border-area smuggling between the POEs. This chapter also discusses the use of the U.S. government's National Preparedness, Response and Cooperation Plan (NAREMP) to disrupt smuggling routes and methods in Mexican ports and seaports. 4) Discussion of Border Security Policy. In this section, Border Patrol's (BP) strategies for counterdrug-related smuggling between POEs are assessed against that agency's stated border security goals of combating all smuggling, as opposed to illicit drug smuggling per se.  The next two sections provide greater detail on some of the methods of drug smuggling between POEs. The first section focuses specifically on the smuggling of marijuana into the United States. The second section focuses on the smuggling of a diverse range of contraband, such as crystal methamphetamine, fentanyl, and cocaine, into the United States. These contraband items are discussed in conjunction with the methods of smuggling them because foreign TCOs are reportedly the primary smugglers of such items into the United States. Each chapter summarizes relevant historical and current data, discusses patterns in use of each smuggling method and routes, illuminates changes in smuggling patterns, and provides analysis on the likely future of smuggling between the POEs.", "RAPID GROWTH IN LEVERAGED-LIENING, A RELATIVELY COMPLEX FORM OF CREDIT, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC EXPANSION, HAS RAISED CONCERNS WITH SOME POLICY MAKERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTED SIMILARITYBETWEEN LEVERAGED-LIENING AND MORTGAGE LENDING AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) MARKETS, IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE 2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS.

The bill would also create a Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program within the Department of the Interior (DOI) to provide funding specifically for conservation and restoration projects for the following taxa: (1) fish; (2) migratory birds; (3) amphibians; (4) reptiles; (5) mollusks; (6) crustaceans; (7) kelp and other marine vegetation; and (8) insects. Wildlife species could be funded under H.R. 4026 using money from revenues generated from the sale of certain Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing program oil and gas resources. For more information on the OCS region, please see Appendix A: Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Resource Potential. The GAO has previously stated, \u201cThe U.S. Government has significant and longstanding obligations to protect America's abundant natural resources\u2014including fish and wildlife\u2014which contribute to the nation's economy and cultural heritage. Congress has designated a portion of the receipts from offshore oil and gas activities for expenditure in restoration of coastal fish and wildlife resources. However, many restoration projects have not fully addressed the long-term, annual funding needs of state fish and wildlife agencies... The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that a total amount of between $400 and $690 million is needed for its programs dedicated to this end.\u201d In addition to OCS oil and gas revenues, H.R. 4026 would authorize a new Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) program to authorize annual appropriations for state and local wildlife conservation and restoration programs. The program would be administered by the DOI. While Congress has provided annual funding for LWCF through the annual appropriations process, the appropriations process is often unpredictable and not sufficient to fully address agency funding needs. The LWCF funds have historically supplemented state government programs in their efforts to acquire land for public use as parks, wildlife management areas, and other conserved lands, and often require matching funds from the states in order to have a full effect on program implementation. The current iteration of H.R. 4026 represents a recent expansion of an earlier version H.R. 3979, the \u201cPROMISE for States and Tribes Act,\u201d which was introduced during the 113th Congress. H.R. 4026 has been referred to the House Natural Resources Committee, of which Rep. McClintock is a member. H.R. 4026 was introduced on March 14, 2017, by Reps. McClintock and Delaney, and has two cosponsors. H.R. 4026 was considered in a business meeting during the 115th Congress. In short, H.R. 4026 would amend the Pittman-Roberts Wildlife Restoration and Reclamation Act of 1937 by adding Section 31A to Title 16, U.S. Code \u00a7 7204, which would establish the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program. The program would support restoration projects that include, but are not limited to, management of fish and wildlife species habitat (1) to assist in the recovery of species at-risk, (2) to foster recovery of depleted species through scientific management, (3) to improve, restore, and maintain wildlife habitats, (4) to increase connectivity for species that require large areas of land connectivity, and (5) address climate change risks, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and Transportation, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The bill provides the following grant priorities:\n\u2022 Species of greatest conservation need: grant funds shall be provided, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, to those species and subspecies of fish and wildlife identified by federal agencies, states, tribal governments, and other entities for grants to assist in the recovery of such species and subspecies on Federal land and non-Federal land; and\nWild", "This report provides background on regulation of broker-dealers and investment advisors; the fiduciary duty to customer rule, implemented by the Department of Labor (DOL) under the Obama Administration; component obligations associated with Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI); state regulatory action regarding obligations relating to investment advice provided to retail customers; and congressional actions with potential relevance to Reg BI. This report focuses on the potential implementation costs associated with Reg BI and potential benefits in terms of investor outcomes. Reg BI requires financial professionals to act in the best interest of their retail customers when providing financial advice for retail customers, which includes when purchasing or selling a security or offering advice about securities transactions. The rule establishes a minimum standard of conduct for broker-dealers and a limited set of best interest requirements for registered investment advisors (RIAs), including the requirements for RIAs to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill in the discharge of its duties. It prohibits certain types of retail conflicts of interest and restricts or prevents certain financial benefits to broker-dealers, RIAs, or their representatives, including cash payments and gifts, for advising or providing advice about investment strategies, securities, or other financial and investment products. Broker-dealers and RIAs are also subject to certain fiduciary-like obligations, including a duty to offer or provide objective advice without regard to the financial interests of the broker-dealer or RIA and a duty to act as principal for retail customers in security transactions as opposed to being agent on behalf of retail customers. Retail customers are presumptively deemed to be investing for or with a speculative or an investment, as opposed to a transactional, purpose. Brokers and RIAs continue to be allowed to exercise discretion over their customer's account. In some cases, a broker-dealer could serve in both a broker and an advisory role on accounts. Broker-dealers cannot receive commissions on transactions to retail customers unless the customer provides prior affirmative consent. The SEC and FINRA retain authority to regulate broker-dealer activity and financial professionals through their registration and examination and enforcement functions. Congress has taken note of Reg BI, with members of Congress raising concerns about its costs and benefits and arguing that its approach to fiduciary duty is inconsistent with a federal statute. Other legislation enacted during the 115th and 116th Congresses that may be relevant to implementing or enforcing Reg BI includes H.R. 773 (115th Congress) , which was included as Title III in P.L. 115-84 . It would require FINRA (and certain SROs) to establish certain requirements for registered reps in the provision of debt-related advice to retail customers, including requirements to offer a debt action plan and to provide specific, timely disclosures. Other legislation in the 116th Congress that may have a bearing on Reg BI includes H.R. 4086 (116th Congress) , which would direct the SEC to study and report to Congress on the effect of Reg BI on: state laws and state regulatory actions; self-regulatory organization (SRO) rules, such as by FINRA, and SRO examination, enforcement, and disciplinary efforts related to Reg BI; financial professional licensing standards at the state level; and the costs and benefits of state fiduciary duty rules and best interest requirements.\n\u21b5 * Former DOL Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta and the Department of Labor have been sued in federal court as a result of DOL's Fiduciary Duty Rule. Some argue that the rule is now moot, while others say that the rule can be revived given the likelihood that President Trump's Secretary of Labor will adopt a fiduciary duty rule similar to the Fiduciary Duty Rule.\n\u21b5 TWW refers to FINRA's Traditional Brokerage and Warehouse Product (TWD and TWW, respectively) exam categories. FINRA regulates the conduct of more than 3,800 firms that serve 4 million registered financial professionals, and FINRA regulates and licenses nearly 700,000 registered representatives and more than 17,000 branch offices. It also plays a role in the licensing and oversight of tens of thousands of non-", "The process of resolving legislative differences between the House and Senate is one of the most critical stages of the legislative process. It is also potentially one of the most complicated. Each House continues to be governed by its own rules, precedents, and practices, but at the stage of resolving differences, each House must also take into account the preferences and, to some extent, the procedures of the other. This report summarizes the procedures that the two houses of Congress use most frequently to resolve their legislative differences. It is based on an interpretation of the rules and published precedents of the House and Senate and an analysis of the application of these rules and precedents in recent practice. It bears emphasis that this summary is not exhaustive. It may serve as a useful introduction or general guide, but it should not be considered an adequate substitute for a study of House and Senate rules and precedents themselves or for consultations with the parliamentarians of the House and Senate on the meaning and possible application of the rules and precedents. Readers may wish to study the provisions of the House rules -- especially Rule XXII -- and examine the applicable precedents as explained in House Practice: A Guide to the Rules, Precedents, and Procedures of the House published by the Congressional Research Service, CRS Report 86-1159, especially pages 339-374 on ''Conferences Between the House and the Senate,'' and in Riddick's Senate Procedure , CQ Publication #72, especially pages 126- 143 on ''Amendments Between House And Senate,'' and pages 449-493 on ''Conferences And Conference Reports.'' Before the House and Senate can submit the same measure to the President for approval, both chambers must agree on the final version of the text of that measure. In cases where this agreement is not reached and one House passes its version of the measure in advance of the other (a House before a Senate or a Senate before a House), the two chambers are said to be at ''cross purposes.'' Because the House has the sole power to originate all revenue measures, it acts first in most cases unless a rule to the contrary is agreed to by the House. Before both houses finally agree to the same measure, there are essentially five major steps in the conference process: (1) the establishment of the list (''list''); (2) the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the resolution of differences (''resolution''); (3) the passage of the measure; (4) conference between the two chambers on their respective amendments; and (5) a vote on the conference report. The five steps follow: STEP 1: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SENATE LIST If the Senate passes the measure before the House, the clerk of the Senate is instructed to prepare and deliver to the clerk of the House of Representatives a list of measures considered and passed by the Senate in the same congressional session as the House measure, the House bill or joint resolution as passed by the House of Representatives, and any House amendments proposed to the Senate measure. The clerk of the House is then bound by the rules to include all legislative measures in this list that were passed by the Senate in the same session as the House measure before the House acts on the Senate measure. STEP 2: ADOPTION OF A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES If the measure is passed by the House before the Senate acts, the clerk of the House is bound by the rules to adopt a concurrent resolution on the resolution of differences to be reported for consideration and enactment together with the bill. That resolution may provide for any modification of the House measure not inconsistent with the Constitution, not conflict with a rule of the House, and of a character that it deems appropriate. In the regular practice of Congress, resolutions on the resolution of differences provide for a substitute measure that simply restates the Senate measure. Any reference thereto in this report is to the resolution on the resolution of differences, not to the substitute bill usually used to implement that resolution. After the resolution is considered and adopted on the motion to report the bill (usually without debate), it is immediately privileged and must be disposed of within 20 calendar days. STEP 3: PASSAGE OF BILL Each chamber, acting on its own version of a congressional measure or joint resolution, may adopt and act on such legislation at any time during the day on which the Senate acts first. Normally the House of Representatives passes its version of the measure(s) first, and the Senate acts on its measure(s) after the House has passed its measure", "This report provides an overview of the judiciary's FY2020 budget request, as well as information about Congress's consideration of the judiciary's request.

The second section provides information about the specific discretionary appropriations requested by the judiciary for FY2020, as well as information about the mandatory appropriations and administrative provisions included in the appropriations process. The third section provides information about the ongoing policy issues affecting the judiciary that may be of interest to Congress during FY2020, such as the federal judgeships requested by the Administration for FY2020 and future years, an appellate court for the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and funding for the Judicial Conference of the United States.

Huan  (H-35 in this report, following the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's naming conventions) is an 18-story apartment building, one of about 750 similar buildings in the district. All of the buildings are managed by the state-owned real estate group Wuhan Urban Construction Group, which is based in Huan  District. Wuhan's Huan  District also administers 106 residential compounds. These are buildings with multiple apartments that are home to hundreds or thousands of families. Residents in these compounds live in crowded conditions. All together, these buildings house more than 1.4 million residents of Huan  District, according to official media reports. As of January 22, Wuhan's population reached 11.42 million. On this date, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission also reported that 45 cases of patients showing symptoms of respiratory illness and 17 deaths in the Huan  District related to a virus infection. This was one of the first reports of illness or death in a specific area. Based on the number of cases described by the health commission, Huan  was, until the emerging outbreak from a pneumonia-like infection in more than a dozen countries outside China, home to far more cases and deaths from the new virus than any other district in the city, and was the fourth most likely district in the country to have cases of the new virus. The Huan  District is an industrial area. Its main product is machinery, followed by textiles and food processing. The district produces about one-third of the city's power and about one-third of its steel. On January 19, Wuhan mayor Zhongnan Wu and deputy mayor Jiang Nan both said that the Huan  District is home to most of China's steel-related companies and many machinery and equipment-related companies. Both men are members of the Standing Committee of the CCP Central Committee, which helps select the party's top leaders. The district also manufactures about 50% of the city's automobiles, according to the district government. On January 21, the district government website disclosed the Huan  District is home to many of the city's top brands and most prestigious companies, including Lenovo Group, Huawei Technologies Co., and China Film Group. Huan  District is also home to the city's four automobile manufacturing zones, the largest cluster of textile manufacturers, and home to 2000 small and medium businesses, the website said. The district has about one million registered employees, the majority of them employed in the industrial sector, an estimated 38 50% of the city's total, according to an industry report. Huan  District is home to 23 companies or groups that have investors with a stake of 3% or more, seven of which have foreign investors, of which six are Chinese-foreign joint ventures from Singapore, Japan or the United States and one is a company owned by Hong Kong's Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. Huan  is also home to 134 registered private companies, 107 of which have headquarters in Huan  District, the city government said. The city website said the district has established joint ventures with the city's universities and has attracted more than 100 leading businesses in scientific research, biomedicine, new materials and energy, automobiles, equipment and machinery, home appliances, and information technology, some of them multinational. One local businessman said it has attracted many foreign investors from Russia, Europe, the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, and Macau, which has made Huan  the location of choice for many foreign-owned firms in the region.  However, the province-level Huan  Company remains one of the many small local companies in Huan  District or the Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone (ETDZ). The company claims to have been founded in 1902, when the area was known as Hankou, before it joined the city in 1927 with the merger of Hankou and Hanyang. It did not expand significantly until the end of the 1990s, when it began offering services such", "The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has declined by almost 70% in the past five decades. In 2017, 4.7million people aged 65 and older had income below the poverty thresholds, making it the age group with the largest share of poor persons (14.4%) in that year. Older adults represent a large and growing portion of America's population. In 2017, they accounted for half of Social Security beneficiaries and more than one-fourth of Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid beneficiaries. Given the increase in older adults in the poverty population and the limited information available regarding their circumstances, a complete understanding of why or how policy may best address poverty among older adults requires a more complete description of older adults who are poverty-stricken than data from the Current Population Survey's (CPS) annual supplement on income and poverty provide. The Current Population Survey-Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) for older adults provides such a description and is discussed briefly in this report. Many factors contribute to the fact that people aged 65 and older are more likely to experience poverty than any other age group. Data from the CPS annual supplement on income and poverty, a nationally representative survey of households by the Census Bureau, reveal some, but not all, factors that affect the rate of poverty among older adults. Together, data from the CPS annual supplement on income and poverty and the CPS-SPM provide a more complete and accurate account of older adults experiencing poverty. The poverty rate among people aged 65 and older has declined substantially in the last 50 years: in 4.7 million peopleaged 65 and older lived in families with incomes below the poverty threshold (see Figure 1).In 1966,the poverty rate amongpeople aged 65 and older was 28.5%;by 2017,that rate had fallen to 9.2% (in 2016,the last year for which poverty estimates are available). The poverty rate among older adults remains greater than the poverty rate for the overall population. In 2017,a sizable portion (14.4%) of Americans aged 65 and older had incomes below the poverty threshold, and an even smaller portion (7.3%) of Americans without a high school degree had incomes below the poverty threshold. Of those with a high school degree as their highest level of education,12.2% were poor, and the percent who were poor decreased with each additional level of education. Nearly one in seven (12.6%) of adults aged 65 and older with baccalaureate or higher degrees were poor.", "Serious disruptions for certain industries caused by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic have led to calls for federal government assistance to affected industries. Although out of the ordinary, this would not be the first occasion on which the federal government has provided aid to troubled or financially distressed industries. To help inform congressional debate, this report examines selected past instances in which the government has aided troubled industries, providing information about the way in which such assistance was structured, the role of Congress, and the eventual cost. Assistance for distressed industries or businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes popularly referred to as \"government bailouts\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094historically has taken different forms and has occurred under varying circumstances. Assistance has not been limited to outlays by the Treasury, or to actions explicitly authorized by Congress, or to measures which imposed a net cost on taxpayers on an unadjusted cash-flow basis. Sometimes, the industry distress was being driven by external shocks, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks or the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and other times it was driven by long-term secular trends, such as changes in the economic outlook for the railroad industry. Past assistance has involved such instruments as loan guarantees, asset purchases, capital injections, direct loans, and regulatory changes, with the specific mix of policies varying significantly from case to case. These differences make it somewhat subjective what should be defined as a \"bailout.\" In order to provide greater detail, the report provides data on the costs and income to government, to the extent that they are available. In some of the cases reviewed in this report, the government was able to recoup much or all of its assistance through fees, interest, warrants, and loan or principal repayments. An economist would typically determine whether the government received full compensation for credit assistance by comparing the government's terms to what a private investor would have required for the loan or loan guarantee. Making such estimates of other government assistance has never been done. The final disposition of assets and liabilities arising from assistance often can take years. But not all sources continued to consistently report data long after the initial intervention. Thus, while the cost estimates presented here are based on official sources, they sometimes involve a degree of uncertainty and uncertainty to an untimely extent. Where data have come in fits and starts, we present a range of possible inflation-adjusted outcomes. There are broader policy concerns raised by government assistance that are difficult to quantify and do not get captured in tallies of the government  costs. In some cases, the government provided an artificial form of stability to a failing company while other competitors were liquidated or downsized. In other instances, the government has provided protection to some businesses by removing competition from the market. This has led to calls for the removal of government protection, especially when it comes to the agricultural sector. Finally, by providing credit and other supportive services (which may be provided by the private sector when no longer needed), the government may have induced its \"bailout\" recipients to take greater risk, which could have resulted in the appearance of a \"moral hazard\" in which failure could be assumed not to have severe consequences for the firm or its stakeholders in the case where assistance is not provided. As a result, if assistance is removed, the negative consequences could be as severe as the effects of the original economic shock. CONTENT: The first portion of the report focuses on the automakers. In 2008-2009, automakers suffered massive failures in the market, and a number of businesses sought federal assistance (some received federal assistance, but most did not). General Motors got help in several forms, but is also largely responsible for paying back the initial loans, which have not been paid to date. Chrysler, on the other hand, had a successful resurgence under its new owners, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, but never repaid any assistance. The second portion of the report focuses on the airline industry. In 2001, the airline industry experienced substantial losses after the 9/11 attacks. In response, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which provided for a temporary loan for certain airlines affected by the disruptions. Southwest Airlines repaid the loan, while American Airlines, which was partially owned by the government, was eventually reorganized. The third portion of the report focuses on the financial sector. In 2008, the financial sector fell into trouble. Many businesses experienced extreme", "Relations between Iran and the United States have been mostly confrontational since 1979, when Iran's Islamic Revolution removed from power the U.S.-backed government of Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi and replaced it with a Shia-cleric dominated system.Successive U.S. administrations have judged Iran's policies in the Middle East as a threat to U.S. interests in the region, particularly Iran's support for armed groups and, after 2002, its nuclear program. Following its 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA), the Trump Administration has taken several steps in its campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran.These steps include designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), ending a U.S. sanctions exception for the purchase of Iranian oil to bring Iran's oil exports to \u201czero,\u201d and deploying additional U.S. military assets to the region.Tensions have increased significantly since May 2019, as Iran (and Iran-aligned forces) have apparently responded by attacking and seizing commercial ships, threatening U.S. forces and interests (including, in June 2019, destroying an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV), and reducing compliance with the JCPOA's provisions.On December 27, 2019, supporters of the Iran-backed Iraqi armed group Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah (KH) surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.No U.S. personnel or property was harmed at the embassy, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced on January 3, 2020 the killing, along with that of KH founder and leader Muhandis Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, of IRGC-QF Commander Qasem Soleimani.Soleimani was widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential political figures in Iran.As head of the IRGC-QF, Soleimani was a driving force behind Iran's campaign for regional influence, and helped direct Iran's activities across the Middle East. The killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis could represent an important turning point in U.S.-Iran relations.\n\n### Iranian Fresh Produce\n\nThis paper aims to examine the production of fresh fruit and vegetable products in Iran in order to suggest the improvement, based on the analysis, for increasing the productions and sales of fresh products in Iran.", "P.L. 116-6, CRS Title X Abortion Provider Non-Discrimination Act of 2019.

Pending Senate passage.", "The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has served as the financial institution for carrying out federal farm commodity price support and production programs since 1933. TEXT: This report provides a brief review of CCC's unique history, funding structure, general operation, and recent issues associated with its use. TEXT: For over a decade prior to the creation of CCC in 1933, the farm economy struggled with low levels of income from depressed commodity prices and increasing costs for needed supplies and services. It was ultimately unable to control production costs, resulting in the implementation of a complex array of farm programs. The initial program was established through the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929. For CRS Report RL32216, see [http://insession.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdsdcc?941009008R.xml] . TEXT: The concept of a financial institution to carry out the AAA was developed in consultation with the National Farm Bureau, but the establishment of the CCC was almost entirely the result of the efforts of Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. On March 12, 1933, a presidential proclamation established the CCC. TEXT: The farm economy faced a 1933 harvest far different than the 1932 experience. A strong price support program was in place, as the AAA and its counterpart programs were fully implemented. However, the agricultural sector struggled to obtain credit needed to finance the 1934 crop year and many farmer cooperatives failed. TEXT: This struggle prompted the CCC to reevaluate its programs and policies for 1934 and beyond. The CCC increased its purchasing in anticipation of the 1934 harvest. Additional purchases were made in preparation for a second poor harvest in 1935 and a fourth below-average harvest in 1936. However, the CCC eventually concluded that a national supply program was necessary to ensure the program's financial viability. Throughout the 1930s, the CCC focused on expanding and promoting existing programs, especially in regard to commodity price support. For example, for the period from 1934 to 1935 alone, the CCC spent $127 million of taxpayers' money to purchase approximately 7.5 billion pounds of commodities. It did not operate without challenge during this time, as it was subject to investigation and scrutiny as to its financial structure, spending authorization, and activities. One such review was conducted by Congress during the fiscal year 1936 appropriations process. TEXT: In its initial days, the CCC only purchased commodities from farmers. TEXT: This evolved into the present practice of buying commodities during production or after harvest, processing, and packaging, and even holding commodity stocks domestically and in the international market.

SFOPS funding typically represents about 1% of the annual federal budget and supports a wide range of U.S. activities around the world, including the operations of U.S. embassies, diplomatic activities, educational and cultural exchanges, development, security, and humanitarian assistance, and U.S. participation in multilateral organizations. Figure 1 shows funding for different SFOPS components based on FY2020 budget authority estimates, relative to each other and to the broader federal budget. The Administration's request is about 3% higher than the FY2020 request for SFOPS accounts but nearly 23% below the FY2020 SFOPS funding level enacted by Congress, including supplemental funds to help combat the COVID-19 epidemic globally. The Trump Administration has consistently requested far less SFOPS funding than Congress has appropriated. To do so, Congress has repeatedly enacted a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) to make interim SFOPS funding available and has worked around the BCA discretionary spending caps by using OCO funds, designated emergency appropriations, and rescission authority. Since FY2015, OCO funding has accounted for a majority of the annual SFOPS appropriation. Congressional use of contingency funds as emergency appropriations was capped in the BBA 2019, and rescission authority cannot effectively be used to reduce funding from enacted appropriations bills. This CRS report shows changes over time in the top-line (or total) amount of funding for the SFOPS budget accounts and the trend of emergency and OCO funds in funding SFOPS accounts and provides an estimate of the BBA 2019 ceiling and OCO request for FY2021. To calculate these estimates, CRS used the BBA 2019 and OCO numbers that are already public and applied the same funding projections, derived from public tables on the House and Senate apportionment websites, to the FY2020 appropriations bills. On February 11, 2020, the Trump Administration requested $1.89 billion in OCO for SFOPS accounts, which is 13% less than the $2.20 billion that Congress enacted in supplemental appropriations for FY2020 and 53% less than the current OCO enacted for SFOPS in FY2020. It is also 51% less than the FY2021 OCO figure that Congress most recently appropriated for FY2020 and far less than the estimate of the FY2021 OCO enactment (OCO-E) for SFOPS\u2014$4.14 billion. (See Appendix A for a discussion of OCO enactment and CRS estimate.) This CRS summary report also provides the discretionary budget authority requested, enacted, and estimated for SFOPS accounts for FY2021, and the top-line amount of the SFOPS OCO enactment in the BBA 2019 ($27.12 billion) and OCO request ($3.26 billion) for FY2021. The OCO number requested in the President's request is 36% higher than the previous OCO enactment for FY2020 and 86% higher than Congress's OCO request for FY2021.", "Fully autonomous vehicles, which would carry out many or all of their functions without the intervention of a driver, may someday bring sweeping social and economic changes and \"lead to breakthrough gains in transportation safety.\" Motor vehicle crashes caused an estimated 36,560 fatalities in 2018; a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has shown that 94% of crashes are due to human errors. Legislation that would encourage development and testing of autonomous vehicles has faced controversy in Congress. In the 115th Congress, the House of Representatives passed an autonomous vehicle bill, H.R. 3388 , by voice vote in September 2017. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported a different bill, S. 1885 , in November 2017, but after some Senators raised concerns about the preemption of state laws and the possibility of large numbers of vehicles being exempted from some Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, the Senate bill did not reach the floor. No further action was taken on either bill before the 115th Congress adjourned. Although some Members of Congress remain interested in autonomous vehicles, no legislative proposals have become law. Several fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles raised new questions about how federal and state governments should regulate vehicle testing and the introduction of new technologies into vehicles offered for sale. A pedestrian was killed in Arizona by an autonomous vehicle operated by Uber on March 18, 2018, and three Tesla drivers died when they failed to respond to hazards not recognized by the vehicles. These accidents suggest that the challenge of producing fully autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads may be greater than developers had envisioned, a new outlook voiced by several executives, including the Ford Motor Co. CEO. However, with the authorization of federal highway and public transportation programs set to expire at the end of FY2020, a surface transportation reauthorization bill could become a focus of efforts to also enact autonomous vehicle legislation. While fully autonomous vehicles may lie well in the future, a range of new technologies are already improving vehicle performance and safety. Manufacturers are combining these innovations to produce vehicles with higher levels of automation. Vehicles sold today are in levels 1 and 2 of SAE'S automation rating system. Although some experts forecast market-ready autonomous vehicles at level 3 will be available in a few years, deployment of fully autonomous vehicles in all parts of the country at level 5 appears to be more distant, except perhaps within closed systems that allow fully autonomous vehicles to operate without encountering other types of vehicles. Testing and development of autonomous vehicles continue in many states and cities. To date, seven states have allowed fully autonomous vehicles to be tested on selected roadways without a human operator, and an additional seven states have passed or permitted testing of autonomous vehicles with a human operator in certain parts of the state. However, 16 states and Puerto Rico impose restrictions on fully automated testing. NHTSA estimates that in 2017, fewer than 2,500 vehicles were being tested in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is working toward adoption of a guidance document to support voluntary industry adoption of best practices for automation, vehicle cybersecurity, and testing and evaluation of automated driving systems. NHTSA also is planning to issue new guidance documents on automated driving system development and testing as it receives information and technology continues to evolve. In November 2017, the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security held a hearing on autonomous vehicles and consumer protection. This hearing focused on the need for consumers to have the information they need, when they need it, on safety and cybersecurity issues. In an apparent reference to the Uber accident, Senators voiced their concerns about public acceptance of an autonomous vehicle that requires frequent human intervention. In July 2018, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection held a hearing on \"Regulating Automotive Technology: Safety, Consumer Protection, and Innovation Issues.\" Committee members were interested to learn more about potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities to ADAS and automated vehicles.

Such funding systems base school budgets on the number of pupils in each school who have been categorized as eligible for low-income programs (such as Title I), ELs, gifted program enrollees, or students with disabilities. School budgets are based on these weighted pupil counts, in contrast to treating all pupils in the same manner. LEAs must, however, meet several ESEA Title I-A and other requirements, though in somewhat modified forms in some cases, and continue to be accountable for the academic achievement of all students in the LEA. The Title I-E authority is limited to 50 LEAs in school years preceding 2019-2020. To provide context for the Title I-E authority, this report begins with a brief discussion of how public elementary and secondary education is financed at the state and local levels. The report then discusses school finance \" equalization \" and weighted student funding systems; including an examination of the use of weighted student funding systems in individual states. Following this background material, the report discusses the Title I-E authority. This is followed by a discussion of several possible interactions between Title I-E and other ESEA programs --particularly Title I-A-- related to the implementation of LEA budget and financial arrangements. The report concludes with several issues relating to the Title I-E authority. BACKGROUND: Public School Finance Funding for K-12 public education in the United States at the state and local levels primarily takes three forms: state general funds, federal funds, and local revenues. Some state funds are distributed to schools on a per pupil basis. Federal funds may be distributed to schools through a variety of formulas based on characteristics of the students enrolled in those schools. Local funds may be generated by taxes on property or income. Some local funds are distributed to individual schools. Local tax revenue is determined on the basis of local decisions governing how taxes are apportioned to each school. Taxes, however, are almost always determined at the district level, not individual school level. Consequently, the allocation of per pupil funds to individual schools typically is based on district or other regional totals, though in recent years many districts have moved to allocating funds directly to a school based on each school's total funding need. Funds to implement state and other federal education programs are determined primarily on the basis of counts of the numbers of students enrolled in individual schools who have been categorized as being eligible for assistance from specific programs. The federal government requires states to allocate Title I-A funds primarily on the basis of counts of students from low income families. Title I-A and other federal funding may also be allocated to schools on the basis of counts of ELs or of students enrolled in gifted and talented programs. Funding for K-12 schools is not the only source of funding to individual public schools. Additional funds may be allocated for individual schools through a variety of arrangements, including the use of  local funds, or special education funds based on counts of special needs students in those schools, or to address specific programmatic needs. The relative level of state and local revenues for public schools varies greatly across the fifty states and other jurisdictions. For example, in Arizona, for education costs ranging from textbooks to teacher salaries, local districts contribute an average of 24.8% to the total cost, federal sources contribute 8.6%, and state resources, including state funds for education and local school tax levies, account for 66.5%. In contrast, New Jersey contributes the largest share of resources relative to total education expenditures, at 71.7% , while Arizona, as mentioned previously, contributes the smallest share of any state, at 33.5%. State and local sources of funding for education", "\u00c2\u00b7 The federal individual income tax is structured so that the poor owe little or no income tax  (although they may pay other federal taxes, like payroll taxes as well as state and local taxes).  \u00b7 However, the\nproceeding to summarize the following text.

This temporary\nchange was supposed to be of a positive benefit to the working middle\nAmerica, but the result was a shift of the revenue and income to the upper\nmiddle class and rich, leaving the working poor the way the system was\nbefore the TCA took effect.\nRecent tax legislation\nA tax law that is being considered in the 116th congress is known as the economic Mobility Act of 2019 (H.R.3300)-\no order reported by the House Ways and Means Committee on June 20, 2019,\nwould target additional tax benefits to lower-income working families\n\u00b7 The TCJA made numerous temporary changes to the federal individual\nincome-tax system. P.L. 115-097 is set to expire in 2026, and policymakers,\nlawmakers, policy makers. lawmakers and the policy makers are working towards changing that.\nThe legislation includes a number of provisions with the goal of encouraging\npeople to work.  These provisions include making the earned-income tax\ncredit fully refundable, expanding the allowance for exemptions and\nincreasing the income threshold for phaseouts of certain tax benefits for\nlower income families.\nThere are additional proposals within the legislation to help working\npeople.  These proposals include modifying the child tax credit and\nexpanding and increasing a new family savings credit.\nThe legislation has also expanded the definition of Qualified Business\nIncome to help the working self-employed, and added a new deduction for the\nworking self-employed to help offset this change.  The overall net effect of\nthis change is to tax the self-employed at a lower rate than they were\ntaxed under prior law.\nThis legislation also expands the new markets tax credit.\nWhile the bill contains proposals that would increase benefits to\nworkers and families, it also includes provisions that could hurt\nthese groups.  One of these provisions is a deduction for start-up\nbusinesses, and the bill could hurt the working self-employed.  The\nbill also includes provisions that could hurt childless working people\nand working families.\nSUMMARIES OF THE MAJOR TAX\n\u00c2\u00b7 The primary tax benefit that affects the poor is the earned-income tax\n\u00c2\u00b7 In tax year 2015, the federal government collected $1.362 trillion in\nincome taxes.

Illnesses have since been linked to a disease caused by a previously unidentified strain of coronavirus, designated Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19. Despite containment efforts in China, the United States, and elsewhere, by late February there were indications that the COVID-19 outbreak may have entered a new phase, with community spread occurring or suspected in several countries other than China, including in the United States. Diagnostic testing is a critical part of the public health response to and clinical management of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Efforts in the United States to develop and disseminate a test for COVID-19 have faced challenges. Manufacturing and quality issues with the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test\u00e2\u0080\u0094developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094resulted in essentially all testing having to be carried out through CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laboratory facility in Atlanta through early March, which, along with other factors, has significantly delayed access to testing throughout the country. It has been reported that the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Atlanta laboratory is currently under investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for possible quality issues related to its manufacture of the test. In this context, on February 29, 2020, in an effort to facilitate the expansion of diagnostic testing from the public health setting into the clinical health care and commercial settings, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a significant new policy. This policy aims to facilitate the expansion of testing through leveraging significant standing resources throughout the country, including facilities, trained personnel, expertise, materials, and equipment. It is FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention that this expansion will help the country meet the increasing and substantial demand for testing, generated by community spread of the disease, and to efficiently direct resources to mitigate its impact in the broader community. Diagnostic tests\u00e2\u0080\u0094formally called in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be commercially developed and distributed as \u00e2\u0080\u009ckits\u00e2\u0080\u009d or developed, validated, and carried out in a single laboratory (also known as a laboratory-developed test, or an LDT). All clinical laboratories in the United States, regardless of whether they are part of a clinical laboratory or an LDT- only laboratory, are subject to the same regulations that apply to all clinical laboratories. All laboratories that test and report on human diagnostic specimens (i.e., blood and its components, as well as human tissue) that are intended under Section 518 (a)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 360(a)(1)(B)) to be \"offered for sale,\" or to be used under Part A, Section 1861(s) of the Social Security Act (i.e., CLIA certified) to develop and report on patient or specimen test results intended to be used to support a patient's informed healthcare decision and/or for diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or impairment of human health, or for the assessment of health status are subject to CMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulatory framework, which promotes quality laboratory testing.1 Both regulatory frameworks require laboratory test results to demonstrate accuracy, reliability, analytical specificity, sensitivity, and clinical utility, among other things. This guidance focuses on clinical diagnostic and LDT-only laboratories, not including laboratories covered by clinical laboratory regulation. This policy guidance focuses particularly on testing for COVID-19.

This summary is based entirely on information publicly available on the CRS web.\nThe requirement to have proportional representation for U.S. Representatives in the House is found in the U.S. Constitution. This summary is based entirely on information publicly available on the CRS web.\nEvery 10 years, the U.S. population is counted through the national census, and districts for the U.S. House of Representatives are readjusted to reflect the new population level and its distribution across states through the federal apportionment and state redistricting processes. The requirement to have proportional representation in the House is found in the U.S. Constitution, and constitutional provisions also underlie other elements of the census, apportionment, and redistricting processes.\nFigure 1 provides a generalized timeline for how these three interrelated processes occur, and the sections of the report that follow provide additional information on apportionment and redistricting. For additional information on the census process, see CRS Report R44788, The Decennial Census: Issues for 2020 , and CRS In Focus IF11015, The 2020 Decennial Census: Overview and Issues .\nApportionment (or reapportionment) refers to the process of dividing seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the states. Article 1, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that seats for Representatives are divided among states, based on the population size of each state. House seats today are reallocated due to changes in state populations, since the number of U.S. states (50) has remained constant since 1959; in earlier eras, the addition of new states would also affect the reapportionment process, as each state is constitutionally required to receive at least one House seat. The 2010 census reported a 9.9% overall increase in the U.S. apportionment population since the 2000 census, to 309,183,463 individuals. The ideal (or average) district population size increased across most states following the 2010 census, with some exceptions, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nTable 1 provides additional historical data on the number of House Members and state delegations since 1790, starting with the second census following the ratification of the Constitution. For some tables, CRS calculates state delegations using a state's number of seats at a particular point in time. Figures 3 and 4 provide a brief summary of the Census Bureau's apportionment and redistricting process following the completion of each decennial census. Finally, Figure 5 provides recent congressional actions related to the census, and Figure 6 provides recent congressional actions related to reapportionment or redistricting.\nThe constitutional requirement that states have proportional representation in the House is an obligation for Congress, which must act to apportion seats as necessary after decennial censuses.\nThe temporary joint Congressional committee appointed to review census results and make recommendations for the next Congress has concluded its work; new districts were in place by March 2013 for the 113th Congress The 2020 decennial census begins in January 2020 and its results will be tabulated in 2020 and 2021, with apportionment data for states and other jurisdictions to be announced in 2021. Any state with a population increase that is at least 1% over its population in the 2010 Census will be allocated an additional representative in the House, based on the 2020 Census results.\nSource: 128th Cong., 1st Sess., H.Doc. 114-25.\nFollowing each census, Congress must pass two acts related to the apportionment and redistricting processes. The first act, H.R. 597 or S. 123, typically known as the \"Census Bureau Act\", appropriates funding for the decennial census, as well as any additional congressional appropriations needed by the Census Bureau to meet the requirements for the apportionment of seats\u2014the number of Representatives elected by each district\u2014and federal aid to states by redistricting. The second act typically refers to an underlying apportionment statute, the U.S. Census Bureau's", "HHS has declared a public health emergency and made federal funding available for various activities within HHS.

In 1917, Congress enacted the first tax provision providing an income tax incentive to encourage the public to support charities. The provision was limited in scope, allowing only a limited deduction (3% of income) for charitable contributions to scientific, educational, and literary institutions. In 1921, Congress expanded this benefit and increased the income tax write-off for qualifying donations to 12% of AGI for C corporations and 7% for individuals and non-corporate entities. In 1932, Congress increased the limit on C corporations to 15% of net income, but no such increase was enacted for individuals or non - corporate entities. In 1948, Congress allowed C corporation shareholders to deduct up to 50% of corporate net income for charitable contributions, but increased the cap for individual taxpayers to 20% of AGI. In 1954, Congress allowed individual taxpayers to deduct up to 30% of adjusted gross income for charitable donations. Congress further increased the allowable deduction for charitable contributions in 1970 with the adoption of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the introduction of Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans. Both ERISA and SEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s established individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which must be funded exclusively by annual tax-deductible donations. IRS data suggests that this change, combined with the federal tax incentive for charitable contributions, encouraged individuals to establish IRAs. Beginning in 1986, charitable contribution deductions could no longer be made on the basis of the taxpayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average income for the previous three years. Instead, taxpayers were allowed to deduct charitable donations only on the basis of the actual amount of money donated. Prior to enactment of this restriction, it was common practice for taxpayers to \"bunch\" their charitable contributions (a practice sometimes referred to as \"bunching\"). Specifically, taxpayers would donate large amounts of charitable contributions over two years in order to maximize the allowable deductions in the first year. To stop this kind of \"bunching,\" Congress made several changes to the deductibility of charitable donations. In 1986, the Tax Reform Act banned \"bunching\" by making charitable contributions more effectively deductible, but only to the extent that itemizers gave over 1% of their income to charity. In 1998, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was modified to allow all taxpayers to deduct charitable donations without itemizing. In 2001, Congress enacted the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). EGTRRA, Title I of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), allowed individuals to itemize deductions for charitable contributions that they paid by check, credit card, or payroll deductions in lieu of cash or property contributions. In 2004, enhanced deductions for contributions to \"qualified conservation contributions\" were adopted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2008, the Housing Assistance Tax Act expanded the amount of qualified conservation contributions that are allowed for charitable purposes, including the rehabilitation of historic structures. Enacted in 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) adjusted the limit on charitable contributions by individuals over 65 years of age or who are married and file jointly. In addition to the limitations set by the ATRA, taxpayers may only deduct charitable donations that are made to organizations eligible to receive deductions under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code , generally limited to Section 501(c)(3) organizations. Prior to ATRA, taxpayers could deduct charitable contributions as part of the 1040. As a result of ATRA, individuals must itemize their tax returns in order to claim their charitable donation as a deduction; the ability to itemize can, therefore, impact the ability to deduct charitable contributions.", "You are an expert at summarization.

TEXT:The current trajectory of democracy around the world is an issue of interest for Congress, which has contributed to U.S. democracy promotion objectives overseas. For decades, U.S. policy has broadly reflected the view that the spread of democracy around the world is favorable to U.S. interests. This report provides a regional snapshot of the political climate in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the U.S. Department of State's description of each country's political system and selected nongovernmental (NGO) indices that measure democracy trends worldwide. For additional information on democracy in the global context, see CRS In Focus IF10460, Latin America and the Caribbean: U.S. Policy Overview, by Mark P.

CRS does not endorse the methodology or accuracy of any particular democracy index. In its regional report, EIU defines flawed democracies as nations, \"the elected government is allowed to function but the opposition and civil society do not have much power. Political leaders typically enjoy unrestricted campaigning and are freely elected. However, these governments generally lack constraints on their power and face relatively low levels of political violence and corruption.\" 1  The Center for Systemic Peace (CSP), based in New York and Melbourne, has produced the Global Peace Index (GPI) annually since 2007. The GPI measures \"the safety and security of a country\" and \"the absence of violence or fear of violence.\" The 2018 Global Peace Index (GPI) examines 163 independent states and territories, and defines an absence of organized violence or fear of violence as a good measure of stability. It also defines the absence of political instability and the absence of violent crime. The GPI 2018 report focuses on the trends of democracies, authoritarian regimes, and war zones. 2  The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), based in London and New York, has produced the Democracy Index annually since 2006. The Democracy Index defines democracies as nations in which \"civil society is free from authoritarian control, the government is accountable to those over whom it presides, the rule of law prevails, and the economy is partially open to international competition and trade\" and defines hybrid regimes as nations that \"might feature a strong party or strongman and where opposition to the government is not allowed.\" 3  The University of Central Florida (UCF) and The Asia Foundation have partnered on the Asian Barometer Surveys (ABS) since 2007 in order to provide \"an annual assessment of the quality of democracy in Asia.\" The 2017 Asian Barometer Survey of 25 countries, including nine democracies in Asia, has been described as a regional snapshot and not a globally comparative democratic study. 4", "Proceed to summarize the given text using the headings (which can be the headings on the next page). 28", "The United States government administers multiple international food assistance programs that generally provide aid to alleviate hunger and improve food security among populations stricken by conflict or natural disasters.

A 2003 report by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified airborne pollutants as the primary health hazards at Ground Zero (GZ). The study found that Ground Zero workers and other New Yorkers who were at or near the destruction site were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including pulverized building materials containing asbestos, which are recognized by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the CDC as a human carcinogen. As part of the NIOSH study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) took a sample of air at a nearby office building on September 11 th, 2001. That sample, as well as subsequent biological sampling of workers and residents, showed the presence of more than 30 compounds, including high levels of particles and chemicals. The air study released in 2004 by CDC, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the New York State Department of Health (collectively referred to as Health Departments) found that World Trade Center workers and residents of nearby communities were exposed to high levels of contamination when the towers collapsed. Health Departments data on the incidence of health problems and deaths associated with the effects of the attacks have been analyzed in reports commissioned by New York City, New York State, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the ATSDR, and NIOSH. A NIOSH report in 2012 analyzed the impact of the toxins that were found in the air at Ground Zero on workers who were involved in rescue and recovery operations. It found that the dust and debris contained high levels of numerous chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), acrylamide, and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs). The report also found that the exposure to fine and ultra-fine particulate matter, along with toxins within the dust and debris, were associated with lung and other serious health problems among rescue and recovery workers. It also concluded that many World Trade Center emergency workers, cleanup and recovery workers and volunteers, the City of New York , the Port Authority, and New York State have incurred economic hardship because of their health problems and disabilities. The NIOSH report stated that these groups' economic well-being had been negatively impacted by the World Trade Center disaster and its toxic aftermath. A report issued by ATSDR in 2005 focused on the long-term health effects that were associated with the toxic exposures on the people at GZ. This study reportedly represents the largest epidemiological study ever conducted, with more than 45,000 participants, most of whom were rescue, relief, and cleanup workers who spent a substantial amount of time at the disaster site. Health Departments found that the incidence of respiratory and digestive issues in the study group were at least twice the incidence of such problems in a non-exposed comparison group. According to Health Departments, World Trade Center disaster-related illnesses have ranged in type and severity, included disorders affecting multiple parts of the body, and caused a wide range in length and degree of impairment. The ATSDR study found \"significant associations\" between asthma and other respiratory problems and both exposure to the pollutants present at GZ and a length of time on-site, and it found indications of exposures' effects on the heart. Health Departments further reported that the ongoing investigation that is being conducted by its WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) found increased asthma rates among adults and children who lived or worked at GZ. In 2017, the MMTP issued a report that addressed asthma as a World Trade Center illness (WTC-I), which found that there were significantly higher rates of asthma among residents, former rescue and recovery workers, and former cleanup workers than national and regional rates. The report also found that among adult former GZ residents, people with asthma had more asthma-related emergency department visits than those", "PATIENT: FITZMAURICE IS BILLOWING WITH DISORDIE.

This report provides an overview of congressional action related to the LHHS appropriations bill in the 115th Congress. On September 8, 2017, H.R. 3354 , the Making Appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 , was signed by the President. The Senate version of the bill, reported on May 24, 2017 (H.R. 244 ), became the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-31). It provided $167,000,000,000 in discretionary funds, to be distributed among many agencies in the Departments of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education (ED) and among almost 20 related agencies. The first LHHS appropriations bill of the 115th Congress provided a $17,000,000,000 decrease in discretionary funding from FY2017, the year in which that act was based. The LHHS bill for FY2019 enacted in September 2017 increased funding for those departments and agencies to slightly more than the FY2017 enacted level. The FY2019 bill was amended in the House in four separate votes, the last one on June 13, 2018, to include a total of just over $13,000,000,000, or almost 8%, above the FY2017 levels. In addition, the House made $2,500,000,000 in mandatory spending level and changes, and provided $4,600,000,000 for emergency needs resulting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and wildfires in the West. The Senate did not take up the amended bill in the 115th Congress. The FY2019 House-passed LHHS appropriations bill would have provided a $2,800,000,000 increase in discretionary funding for those departments and agencies. As discussed in an August 2018 congressional Research Report , congressional action on the LHHS appropriations bill in the 116th Congress (formally, the second session of the 115th Congress) will likely focus on a second FY2019 act. The LHHS bill is expected to be taken up separately on the floor of each House of Congress during the second or \"regular\" session of the 116th Congress, beginning in January 2019. If no regular session second FY2019 LHHS bill is enacted by March 23, 2019, a \"continuing resolution\" (CR) extending current FY2019 appropriations for the seven-week period beginning on that date will be necessary to provide funding for ongoing operations of LHHS agencies and programs. Although LHHS agencies and programs would retain funding at the new FY2019 enacted levels, some agencies would face temporary funding reductions if they have already obligated their FY2019 funds or have received a portion of those funds.\nMost Republicans joined with some Democrats in voting to increase funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and several smaller agencies; the amendment passed by a vote of 336 to 83 (Division No. 255 ).

This pattern of restricting access to facilities continues to be a challenge for R&D organizations: The current state of social distancing and travel restrictions varies in particular locations and among different R&D organizations. This makes it difficult to maintain continuous research activity. The R&D workforce is distributed across the country and often involves a significant commute (DOE-OIG-IG). Several agencies, however, do not permit or will only allow limited commutes by their employees to protect workers. For example, the NIH expects a small number of essential personnel \"to commute to work for essential and continuing functions or as deemed by their departmental authorities\". Few are able to commute for work or even to their homes (although some travel to work from home). The Smithsonian Institution (SI) has limited to rare travel for essential work. There is no transportation by NIH employees, although some limited travel is allowed for patients and specimens. One of SI's museums is open for the public (the Air and Space Museum) and SI continues to operate its 312 million+ specimens and other artifacts, but it has few workers present. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has an office and staff in Gaithersburg, MD, but is not conducting any research. This is also true for staff in Boulder, CO. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended most of the work to examine new drug approvals or the safety of currently approved drugs; however, the FDA is continuing some oversight functions \"such as oversight of emerging threats of communicable disease, food and medical product-related issues, etc.\" FDA officials have announced that they will examine new drugs when the risk to the public is low. This re-evaluation process will allow the FDA to handle a backlog of drug applications. The FDA is continuing some oversight functions.\n_The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been permitted by the White House to continue some activities, but it has suspended all other R&D activities, which include a variety of projects at Johnson Space Center. Other agencies, such as the State Department (DOS), the Smithsonian Institution, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), have halted most R&D activities. One NSF division is continuing work on emergency management, such as the provision of satellite data in support of EAS. FDA employees were allowed to return to work remotely. Others are continuing R&D: The Department of Energy's (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has remained at work because it is not essential for the facility to be staffed 24/7. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Boulder laboratories are also open. NASA and the National Science Foundation continue to conduct some work, but many of their scientists are not able to work from home. Although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is working, most workers remain isolated and are not able to work remotely. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)", "of the text to provide an answer. What are some of the problems with this type of summary?\nYou can also try taking the information from the boxes and then summarizing that.\nYou are going to have 27 sentences but, in reality, we probably need only around 7 to express those ideas. But what do we do with the others? The answer is to eliminate some. What can be done now becomes part of the question \"\nHow are 100-120 word summaries accomplished?\" Some people feel that because the summary is short that it is easier to do. But doing a short summary is not necessarily \"easier.\" It requires different skills that require reading and writing at the same time in order for it to have impact . We need to know what is critical to get across, decide what we are going to put into a sentence, and then be able to organize the sequence of these sentences so that readers understand the information. And when we combine these elements with writing well , which requires making good sentence to sentence connections, then we reach the standard required by \"\nHow are 117-120 word summaries accomplished?\"\nThe difference in the difficulty of this length summary is evident in reading them. Most are very choppy. That is because summarizers are more concerned with having an answer to what the reader asks. They aren't concerned with how well the summary reads. If we read just sentences here, then we probably lose the writer. But if we read it as a good summary should be read, we can probably see that the summary is also a good example of \"how summaries that are 117-120 words long are accomplished.\"\nLet's see if we can identify one good summary that is a good one to see examples of how summarization can be done well.\nSome of you might think that you are going to give just one example. You wouldn't want to give more than that. But that is how we get an example that most people can understand. The reason people want to write 117-120 word summaries is because there are a lot of \"short\" summaries which are choppy, lack clarity, don't use effective writing strategies, etc. The goal is to get as many people looking at well written examples of \"how summaries that are 116-120 words long are accomplished.\"\n\"How is a 123 word summary completed?\"\nI took the information from the text boxes and then wrote a summary. Then, I evaluated my summary and wrote a shorter one. In this way, I have learned how summaries are completed.", "This text is part of an English exercise in the form of a letter intended for elementary and/or pre-intermediate students. For more advanced students a series of questions to answer on this topic of the text are next. In the present context, the text is about the aims of the London conference as well as the achievements NATO has made following President Trump's pressure to raise defense expenses to 2% of their GDP.\nTEXT: Heads of state and government from NATO\ufffds 30 member states met in London, United Kingdom (UK), on December 3-4, 2019. NATO and U.S. officials highlighted the following key deliverables from the London leaders\ufffd meeting: Completion of a new Readiness Initiative, under which the alliance would have at its disposal 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval combat vessels ready to use within 30 days. Declaration of space as a new operational domain for NATO and advances in combatting cyber and hybrid threats, including establishing new baseline requirements for telecommunications infrastructure. Increased defense spending by European allies and Canada.\nRenewed commitment to NATO\ufffds mission in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. Agreement to assess China\ufffds impact on NATO and transatlantic security. Initiation of a new \ufffdforward-looking reflection process ...\ufffd to further strengthen NATO?s political dimension. NATO\ufffds Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, acknowledges ongoing tensions within the alliance, but stresses that enhanced NATO readiness is a key result of the London Leaders\ufffd Meeting. Secretary Stoltenberg notes that NATO allies have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2016, and that the allies have agreed to reach at least $400 billion defense spending a year by the year 2024 through 2026. Moreover, NATO members committed to \ufffdan even more significant increase of funding after 2024.\ufffd NATO allies reaffirmed their commitment to NATO missions in the Middle East and Afghanistan and NATO\ufffds new Deterrence and Defense Posture and Strategy,  a document that outlinesthreats to the alliance and its response to them through, among other measures, cyber capabilities. At the December 3-4, 2019 meeting, allied leaders announced that they had reached agreement to establish a new cyber operations center at NATO HQ and approved a new NATO Cyberspace Operations Policy. NATO also announced a number of non-NATO-related initiatives, including the establishment of a new London-based Center for Countering Stabilizing Threats. The allies also agreed to re-establish the NATO Council at Ministerial Level and to revamp the NATO Defense College and the NATO Command College. A new NATO Readiness Initiative, the central component of which is the establishment of a new NATO Force Structure, will improve NATO\ufffds readiness by enabling allies to contribute military equipment to NATO forces within 30 days of a decision by alliance heads of state or government. This initiative will be underpinned by a new NATO Readiness Investment Panel, that will establish specific criteria for assessing allies\ufffd contributions and for developing new infrastructure to support the alliance\ufffds defense. By enabling allies to quickly add military assets to operational forces without  the need for new legislation authorizing such expenditures, NATO will enhance its ability to respond quickly to threats. The NATO members and delegations acknowledged this success in a concluding communiqu\ufffd: NATO Readiness Initiative is a key outcome, which will provide new capabilities for the whole Alliance, increase the readiness of Allied Forces in a variety of scenarios and enhance deterrence and defence throughout the spectrum of NATO\ufffds missions. Under our enhanced Readiness Initiative we will be able to generate military forces and projection assets in 30 days, and deploy them whenever and wherever they are needed. This is an important step for our collective defence. In addition to the London Leaders\ufffd Meeting, NATO held its annual Defense Ministers\ufffd Meeting (DMM ) in Brussels on December 3-4. While the two days of NATO meetings made headlines around the world,  they nonetheless were overshadowed by President Trump\ufffds attendance at the NATO summit. President Trump", "Credit unions are nonprofit depository financial institutions that are owned and operated entirely by their members. In other words, natural person credit unions, also known as retail credit unions, are financial cooperatives that return profits to their memberships. For this reason, member deposits are referred to as shares , which may be used to provide loans to members, other credit unions, and credit union organizations; and the interest earned by members is referred to as share dividends , which are comparable to shareholder profit distributions. Credit unions (and banks) engage in financial intermediation , or facilitating transfers of funds back and forth between savers (via accepting deposits) and borrowers (via loans). The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), an independent federal agency, is the primary federal regulator and share deposit insurer for credit unions. There are three federal bank prudential regulators: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters and supervises national depository (commercial) banks; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance by collecting insurance premiums from member banks and places the proceeds in its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which are subsequently used to reimburse depositors when acting as the receiver of a failed bank; and the Federal Reserve provides lender-of-last-resort liquidity to solvent banks via its discount window. The NCUA, by comparison, serves all three functions for federally regulated credit unions. The NCUA also manages the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), which is the federal deposit insurance fund for credit unions. Although scholars are unable to pinpoint the precise origin of the credit union movement, the organization of membership-owned cooperatives to promote thrift among its members and create a source of credit for productive or provident purposes dates back to colonial times. Following numerous bank failures and runs during the Great Depression that resulted in an extensive contraction of credit, Congress sought to enhance credit unions\u2019 permissible activities because the original purpose of the credit union industry arguably needed to be expanded with the modernization of global banking practices. Congress first passed the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 (FCU Act) to \"promote thrift among persons of small means, by affording them an opportunity to utilize their savings in a manner calculated to give them a measure of security and a sense of dignity incident to the possession of their own property.\" The FCU Act allowed credit unions to receive deposits, which, in turn, helped credit unions provide savings, loans to their members, and shareholder dividends. When a federal credit union (FCU) depositor or member (also known as a \"participant\" in FCU parlance) lost financial solvency or defaulted on loans, the original credit union's members were deemed to have suffered an economic loss as a result of the failed FCU's activity. CONTINUED . . . Credit unions, also known as cooperative banks, are also nonprofit financial institutions, and the cooperative ownership structure of this type of banking organization has been promoted as \"promoting greater cooperation and mutual responsibility in both the banking system and the overall national economy.\" For this reason, credit unions are legally chartered under specialized federal regulatory frameworks with specific corporate governance restrictions. Credit unions and cooperative banks are governed by democratic and member control principles that were first described in the 1986 \"Landmark Declaration on Human Rights and Economic Democratization.\" Credit unions have also been linked to an institutionalized form of \"thrift-banking\" . However, thrift-banking may not be the best descriptive term because credit unions may operate in a broader capacity (e.g., facilitating international trade).", "To amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to clarify the meaning of the terms \u201ctake\u201d and \u201ckill,\u201d and for other purposes.

Since 2010, GAO has reported on the status of annual financial statements audits for these agencies. GAO's criteria for reporting on agencies' financial statements audits are based on criteria created by the U.S. Government Accountability Office's (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (the Green Book standard ). Table 1 summarizes information on the audits of the DOD's main statement of net costs and the HUD's main statement of net cost for fiscal year 2018 (FY18). Table 1 is based on agencies' publicly available information about audit results that is found in publicly available audit and accounting management reports. Information related to audits of HUD is presented separately from DOD due to differences in audit procedures followed. For DOD, the relevant financial statement is the statement of net costs presented in DOD's FY18 financial report. For HUD, the relevant financial statement is the main statement of net cost in HUD's FY18 financial report. Each agency reported disclaimer of opinion, which indicated for both agencies that, among the agency's material components for the FY18 audit, the agencies' financial statements are not presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. The DOD audit is based on OMB's audit approach, which required the department to prepare financial statements that are compliant with the CFO Act. As a baseline for DOD's FY18 financial statement audit, the DOD IG had to obtain the department's unmodified audit opinion for the fiscal year ended 9/30/2017 before OMB could certify that DOD's financial statements complied with the CFO Act. The DOD IG did not issue an opinion on DOD's previous year's financial statements and did not certify to compliance with CFO Act. Consequently, OMB did not provide the department's 2017 financial statements to the auditors for the DOD's FY18 audit, resulting in unmodified opinion on the FY18 financial statements. In HUD's case, its previous year's financial statements had an adverse opinion , meaning that its previous year's financial statements were not fairly and adequately presented in accordance with GAAP. For HUD, OMB required HUD to receive an unmodified opinion on previous year's statements before reviewing HUD's annual audit report on their FY18 financial statements. Consequently, HUD was unable to begin an audit of its previous year's statements and it received a disclaimer of opinion on its FY18 statements, which indicated that its FY18 statements were not fairly and adequately presented in accordance with GAAP. Based on the disclaimer of opinion for both agencies, neither financial statement is deemed free of material misstatement as prescribed by the Green Book . It is clear that DOD and HUD have made progress toward receiving unmodified opinion for their previous years' statements, which is a baseline for their FY19 audits. In both previous and FY18 audits, the DOD found and corrected most of the material misstatements in their net costs financial statements during audit remediation. However, DOD reported material weaknesses related to its estimates of certain assets and liabilities, which it did not correct prior to providing its estimates to its independent public accountant for the audit. Although GAO recognizes the work and effort DOD has put into its financial statements and its accounting practices, until DOD is able to obtain unmodified opinion for both years and until it is able to reduce material misstatements to inconsequential amounts, DOD's financial statements should not be deemed free of material misstatement. HUD had similar control issues as DOD in FY18 and reported similar material misstatements which were not corrected during audit remediation. Consequently, HUD's opinions on the FY18 statements are disclaimed. The disclaimer of opinion for HUD's FY18 statements indicates HUD's financial statements are not fairly and adequately presented in accordance with GAAP for this year's audit.\nHence, neither financial statement is deemed free of material misstatement as prescribed by the Green Book. It is clear that DOD", "Family reunification and the admission of immigrants with needed skills are two of the major principles underlying U.S. immigration policy. Current U.S. law weights the allocation of immigrant visas heavily toward individuals with close family in the United States and to a lesser extent toward individuals who meet particular employment criteria. The diversity immigrant category was added to the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by P.L. 101-649 (1990) to \"stimulate 'new seed' immigration\" (i.e., to encourage new, more varied migration from other parts of the world). Diversity visas are allocated to individuals from nations from which the sum of family preference, worker preference (relatives, employment, and special category), and diversity visas issued to individual nationals was less than 50,000 over the preceding 5 fiscal years. These allocations are known as visa diversity cutoffs in the Visa Office of the Department of State's (DOS) monthly Visa Bulletin. DOS announced the introduction of the 50,000 diversity cap in the fiscal year (FY) 1995 Visa Bulletin. The State Department is required by law to publish the monthly Visa Bulletin (VB) and to provide current information on the availability of immigrant visas by country to assist prospective immigrants to better manage their immigration process. Immigration levels and priorities are established with guidance from the president. The secretary of State recommends to the president the annual immigration levels for various visa categories, and the president signs legislation to designate annual visa usage for various visa categories. The actual visas available in each nonpreference category are subject to annual congressional authorizations and to the discretionary administrative decisions of the Secretary of DHS, in consultation with the Secretary of State. On November 29, 2019, the 2020 VB was published and the fiscal year 2020 (FY2020) diversity visa lottery registration began. As of January 10, 2020, more than 13.1 million qualified registrations had been completed. The DV process culminates when the DOS publishes the DV lottery draw results in the week of May 6, 2020, when all eligible entries are assigned a rank number, and then publishes the official winning DV lottery registration selections. Individuals with winning DV lottery registration selections, or their derivative family members, must claim the diversity visa and pursue its validity by a scheduled date in September 2020. DV lottery registrants, with winning visa lottery registrations, failing to appear for an interview and visa processing will result in a loss of the winning DV visa lottery registration. The Secretary of Homeland Security may deny a visa at the port of entry to an immigrant who is ineligible for a visa and the final approval to immigrate will not be provided until an immigrant has been inspected and admitted to the United States as an immigrant. The VB includes tables indicating the number of immigrant visas made available by country and by country of eligibility. Each eligible country of birth has been provided with a DV allotment of visas in recent years. The U.S. law does not assign visas based on eligibility by nationality, but instead, allocates to each country of birth an annual limit. The visa diversity category is established by Congress in P.L. 101-649 (1990). DV allocations are calculated in each VB with reference to DHS visa usage, visa ceilings, and prior year actual usage. A single visa is assigned to a DV applicant only if both eligibility and visa availability are determined. At the beginning of an immigrant's visa line, and once every 5 years, additional visas for unused lines are available by the secretary. On December 10, 1998, P.L. 105-277 (1998) directed the secretary to allocate 5,000 visas annually for use under the diversity visa program for immigrants from other than the countries in the list described in the VB's section DV-2019. The secretary annually allocates five regions into eight diversity visa (DV) regions and, at the beginning", "This report provides an overview and describes the evolution of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) livestock and meat price reporting.

This designation allows the WHO greater flexibility to support its global health response to the outbreak, accelerate research and development efforts, and further facilitate international coordination to prevent and control the virus' spread. Subsequently, in March 2020, Congress enacted the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136 or FMLD Act of 2019), which appropriates $2.5 billion in FY2020 emergency supplemental funds to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help contain the virus through enhanced public health measures. The CARES Act also encourages certain uses of CDCBG funds to support the response. In addition, HELP maintains offices in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The HELP program provides grants to U.S. public and private organizations for projects and activities in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America that are designed to help alleviate the underlying social, political, and economic conditions that contribute to hunger and malnutrition. The Africa Grant Program (AGP) is the principal HELP program, with Africa the major recipient of global HELP grants.", "Congress has long been interested in the status of indigenous peoples abroad. In 1992, the 102nd Congress enacted H.R. 5368 (P.L. 102-391) requiring the State Department's annual human rights report to \"describe the extent to which indigenous people are able to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources, and assess the extent of protection of their civil and political rights.\" Issues relating to indigenous peoples periodically have been considered in hearings focused on such issues as environmental protection, energy opportunities, and security cooperation. this report provides statistical information on indigenous peoples in Latin America, including populations and languages, socioeconomic data, land and natural resources, human rights, and international legal conventions. Resource lists for each section (languages; socioeconomics; land and resources; international organizations; and human rights) are available in the tables of Appendix A. Table B-1 lists national agencies that oversee indigenous affairs in each country. Definitions of indigenous people vary. The United Nations (U.N.) has not adopted an official definition, but instead relies on self-identification to categorize indigenous populations around the world. The Organization of American States' (OAS) American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples repeats the U.N. Declaration language and adds \"indigenous peoples have argued against the adoption of a formal definition at the international level. A strict definition is seen as unnecessary and undesirable.\" In counting distinct groups, this report uses the term \"indigenous people\" rather than \"tribe,\" \"nation,\" \"ethnic minority,\" or \"sociolinguistic group.\" Latin America is home to 29-45 million indigenous people according to several studies that provided estimates for around 2010. The World Bank stated in a report that \"official data on indigenous people are not conclusive, as many technical difficulties remain, particularly in Latin America.\" Figure 1 illustrates the total number of indigenous people and their share of the total population. According to a 2017 study, \"the number of indigenous peoples in the Americas is estimated to reach between 40 to 52 million (8 to 11 percent of the overall population) with 80 percent (from 33 to 39 million) of these living in Latin America.\" Figure 1: Indigenous Populations, by Region Source: Author's calculation based on U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). Source Table: Estimated Population and Regional Distribution (000). Table 1, page 11. This figure was developed using a variety of sources, including the Congressional Research Service  (CRS) report on Indigenous Groups and Their Status in the Western Hemisphere, December 17, 2018 (R45190), the 2009 U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) publication The World's Indigenous Peoples: Victim or Victor , and the National Geographic interactive map \"The Diversity of Latin America and the Caribbean.\" To estimate the overall region's population and indigenous share, the following ranges were applied for each country: for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru the maximum estimate; for Mexico the midpoint; for Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Venezuela the minimum estimate; for Aruba, Bahamas, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago the maximum estimate; for the Bahamian archipelago (Acklins and Crooked Islands, Cat Island, and Long Island, the Inaguas, Mayaguana, and San Salvador/Water Cay) the minimum estimate; for Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic the maximum estimate; for Antigua and Barbuda, the French West Indies, and Saint Kitts and Nevis the minimum estimate; for Jamaica the maximum estimate; for Guyana and Suriname the minimum estimate; and for the French West Indies the maximum estimate. Then, the region's total indigenous population was derived as described in the paragraph above.", "With respect to its prevention policy workforce, the U.S. Coast Guard is significantly understaffed, with both fewer staff and less funding than required to effectively execute its statutory functions. However, it lacks a comprehensive assessment of its mission to assure it has the right resources in the right place for an efficient, effective organization. To address the increasing caseload of investigations, the Coast Guard uses contractors for many investigations, but is prohibited from using them for others. It is not able to contract out the inspection of vessels because of the law enforcement nature of these missions. A. VESSEL INSPECTIONS BY CLASS OF VESSEL According to the Coast Guard, its inspectors are responsible for conducting a total of 100,000 vessel inspections annually, including overseas commercial and recreational vessels, as well as some U.S. government-owned vessels. In the United States, the Coast Guard is required to inspect every U.S.-flag commercial vessel and each vessel carrying hazardous or noxious cargoes. In addition, the Coast Guard conducts routine inspections of U.S.-flag passenger and ferry vessels. Based on a 52-week period in 2017, the Coast Guard reported that each inspector on average conducted 31 inspections (31,661) during that period, ranging from 25 to 35 in the different categories. 63 For all categories of vessels, more than one in four inspections are conducted by only 20% of inspectors and 51% of inspectors conduct less than 20% of inspections.68 Most inspections take place in U.S. ports rather than overseas. In 2017, the Coast Guard conducted 24,200 sea-going inspections, but almost all of the remainder were conducted in U.S. ports. Many vessels not under U.S. jurisdiction that call in or pass through U.S. ports can trigger U.S. inspections when the vessels are under U.S.-flag management companies headquartered in the United States. The Coast Guard did not provide total inspection costs, but according to one estimate, the costs of a shipboard inspection, conducted on the high seas or in port, are about 350 for each minute inspection takes.64 An average inspection takes about 2 hours, thus the cost of each inspection is 700. In 2017, the Coast Guard reported that it had only 40 open staff positions for commercial marine inspection specialists, out of a total of 530 filled positions. According to the Office of Personnel Management, there is a vacancy rate of 18% for the same occupation code in the federal government.70 In fiscal year 2018, the Office of Management and Budget reported that the Coast Guard's commercial marine inspection staffing requirements were 38% unstaffed compared to all federal government vacancy rates being 5% unstaffed.71 The Coast Guard is planning to hire 165 new marine examiners and inspectors in fiscal year 2019 but does not expect to fill all of those positions. B. VESSEL INSPECTION DEFICIENCIES According to an October 2018 Marine Accident Report, the NTSB identified 15 items needing Coast Guard policy or systemic corrections for U.S. flag commercial vessels: (1) lack of staff resources for pre-departure inspections for cargo ships; (2) ineffective examination policy for the hull examinations; (3) ineffective oversight of vessel manning; (4) use of third-party personnel in hazardous cargo examinations; (5) inconsistencies in vessel loading rules; (6) lack of examiners' awareness of cargo safety requirements; (7) problems with examiner access to information and training; (8) problems with training and qualification requirements for examiners; (9) lack of adequate procedures for examination of foreign-flag vessels; (10) lack of effective examiner oversight; (11) failure to follow policies and procedures; (12) examiners failing to issue correct detachments; (13) poor recordkeeping; (14) examiners failing to follow policies and procedures, and failing to accurately monitor third-party contractors; and (15) the Coast Guard not adequately taking enforcement action and", "How does the House determine its presence - is a minimum MINIMUM presence for the vote of 100 members or the maximum QUOTA required to pass the law? What about the presence - is it required for the vote? The text of the constitution does not contain any exact information CONSTANTLY is checked. The quorum, the number of deputies, is determined by the legislation itself. Voting can be made at the absolute minimum, and maximum number of members of parliament. There are not rules for minimum/maximum, but only for an exact representation of the parties. There is no minimum number, but it is not the 100% is a real issue. The 2/3 ( 66+% ) is a real issue. The President has the right to veto the issue. If the absolute majority of the total number of MP ( 101 ) of majority of the votes cast, and they are not less than half the total number of MP ( 51 ) if there is a simple majority number of member vote - is it enough in the presence of only one, or are two required? Quorum/number representation of the majority is a real issue. There is no quorum number, but it is 2/3 . In practice, the quorum is usually 2/3 of the total number of deputies ( 66.6 +% ) - and even at this level of representation, there is no decision. Then the vote must have the 2/3 of the majority of the total number of deputies ( 66.6 + %). The deputy has the right to an absolute majority of the deputies ( > 50 + %). The presence is required with the real situation. Only the President can veto law without quorum/majority. If the majority is not 2/3, then vote is not done because is not in accordance with the Constitution. If minimum number is 66 +/-, a vote must be in accordance by the Constitution. The quorum is fixed in the Constitution. The presence is only necessary if the Constitution is not followed. Then the presence is not necessary but the quorum must be.

HRSA provides access to health care services for those who are uninsured, isolated, or medically vulnerable. HRSA has established four maternal health programs funded through the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) authorizations to address low U.S. maternal health indicators, including low vaccination rates for influenza, increasing SMM, and increasing MM. These four SPRANS programs are Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health (AIM); State Maternal Health Innovation (MHI); Supporting Maternal Health Innovations (MHI); and Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS). These maternal health programs are administered through the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), which in this context is charged to reduce U.S. cases of SMM (which includes issues such as gestational diabetes, severe preeclampsia, postpartum depression, and other health conditions that arise during and after pregnancy) and MM. AIM funds activities that \"promote interdisciplinary, integrated, and coordinated approaches to improve the quality of maternity care and eliminate SMM,\" such as through developing tools that provide for better coordination and collaboration among health care providers, and research and development of maternal health and SMM measurement tools. MHI funds states and state-designated entities that develop ways to reduce MM, improve MM data collection and analysis, and disseminate information on best practices for reducing MM. MHI funding was last appropriated by the Congress for FY2014, but only $1 million was allocated for FY2015. Although the Congress directed states to receive up to 10% of their annual allotment for one-time MM data collection and analysis activities, no funding was appropriated for FY2016 or FY2017. In FY2018, the Congress appropriated $9 million for both one-time MM data analysis activities and ongoing MM data collection and analysis activities, but no funds were appropriated for FY2019. MHI funding was last appropriated by the Congress for FY2018, but only $2.25 million was allocated, instead of the authorized $9 million. Although the Congress directed states to receive up to 10% of their annual allotment for one-time MM data collection and analysis activities, no funding was appropriated in FY2019, and no funding was appropriated in FY2020. MHI funding is included as a new activity under the SPRANS authorities for FY2020 (P.L. 116-69). The Congress has not appropriated funds for Supporting MHI; there are no authorized funds for the fiscal years (FY) 2016through 2019. Rather than appropriating funds for RMOMS, the Congress authorized a single grant of $1.5 million to develop rural maternity care models and reduce MM rates, specifically for HRSA's MCHB. The single grant of $1.5 million for developing rural maternity care models and reducing MM was authorized to be issued in FY2020 (P.L. 116-69).\nFEDERAL MATERNAL HEALTH PROGRAMS\nThis report describes the federal programs authorized to address maternal health.

Mississippi", "Childhood vaccines have long been considered necessary to prevent severe morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among children in developing countries. Congress directs and appropriates funds to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccination and immunization efforts, while the State Department, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), also manages the procurement and delivery of vaccines to support United Nations and global alliance projects. Additionally, the State Department provides administrative and technical support to regional organizations engaged in these efforts. For example, WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) administers programs and vaccination initiatives in 94 countries, with some 134 million children receiving vaccines through these programs. At the same time, U.S. funding provides over 50% of all EPI activity, and over half of immunization activities supported by the World Bank. In many developing countries, only EPI-led programs administer vaccines, and the State Department oversees a large portion of EPI-led expenditures. These activities are complemented by those of other international organizations, such as the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, which manages many of its immunization initiatives through its Supplies for Life program. Supplies for Life, in coordination with the global supply chain, provides vaccines and support to countries in need of humanitarian assistance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plays a significant role in global immunization campaigns by providing resources to aid partners engaged in these public health initiatives. However, although HHS provides a significant portion of vaccine funding for developing countries through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), these efforts primarily target adults and are directed at HIV/AIDS. HHS does not play a similar role in global child immunization efforts. In 2018, U.S. government agencies, international partners, alliances, and donors collectively spent over $39 billion to fund global childhood vaccines. U.S. funds, however, comprise a more modest share - approximately 30% - of this total. As the U.S. government becomes one of the largest funders for vaccination efforts, policymakers are questioning whether greater collaboration and efficiency could be realized among U.S. agencies. In addition, Congress frequently requests information regarding U.S. government spending related to international childhood immunization, especially given its potentially life-saving public health benefits.\nRAND_MG1655-1.pdf text/html 6 Mb\nRAND_MG1655-2.pdf application/msword 68.5 Kb\nChildhood Immunization International Cooperation and Development Act United States vaccines\nMG1655 Childhood Immunization: International Cooperation and Development Act: U.S. Agencies Are Managing a Growing Share of Global Funding, but Greater Collaboration Could Improve Outcomes.pdf full text 1.58 Mb\nMG1655_1_1_0_0_0.pdf\nMG1655_2_1_0_0_0.pdf", "TEXT: Proceed to summarize the following text. The UNFCCC is the only universally ratified and legally binding treaty on climate change with the aim of reducing GHG emissions to combat climate change. Countries that have ratified the treaty are known as Parties to the UNFCCC. Over 197 Parties have adopted the treaty. Parties come together every year to assess their commitments and progress toward meeting the UNFCCC objectives. The ultimate objective of the Convention is the stabilization of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system. The UNFCCC is built upon three \"pillars,\" or areas of activity. First, there is the recognition that the UNFCCC objective is global in scope and applies to all countries. The treaty does not distinguish between developed and developing countries. Second, Parties acknowledge their differences in national circumstances and responsibilities, including economic, social, technological, and environmental considerations. They are expected to commit to ambitious, economically sound, and sustainable actions using their own resources and capabilities to address the adverse impact of climate change. In a few cases, Parties commit to using market mechanisms to lower emissions, such as emissions trading schemes. Third, the UNFCCC promotes the objective through a \"bottom-up\" approach. This approach is based on the idea that Parties' national efforts can be better collectively applied to achieve maximum results, if Parties share experience and information and learn from each other's approaches. UNFCCC meetings and actions, therefore, emphasize mutual support, information exchange, and international cooperation. The Framework Convention provides the foundation and overall policy direction for the UNFCCC process. Two annexes to the Convention were created to promote specific global and regional actions to combat climate change: the Kyoto Protocol, created in 1997, and the Paris Agreement, created in 2015 (see below). The UNFCCC secretariat oversees the operation of the UNFCCC process, and has a key role in strengthening international cooperation on climate change, raising awareness of climate change, and facilitating the global response. The UNFCCC is overseen by the COP, the supreme decision-making body, which meets annually. The COP takes decisions, makes recommendations, and issues guidance related to climate change, all of which it can amend or revoke at any time.

Since COP18 in 2012, these \"workstreams\" have developed  and regularly  revised,  negotiating text,  known as \"work programmes\" (and a related set of negotiating text known as \"work plans for the work programmes\"), outlining the negotiations at successive COP meetings. An expert group known as the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA),  is overseeing the negotiations under the Paris Agreement. The APA has five informal \"contact groups\" of experts.  The Working Group on NDCs (WGNDC),  for example, has two co-chairs with more than 60 experts focused on developing the transparency framework for NDCs. The contact groups have produced various text proposals that can be adopted in negotiation sessions of the COP or of subsidiary bodies, such as SBI and SBSTA. These two bodies meet in the year in between COPs.

U.S. officials and official reports consistently identify Iran's support for militant armed factions in the Middle East region a significant threat to U.S. interests and allies. Attempting to constrain Iran's nuclear program took precedence in U.S. policy after 2002 as that program advanced. The United States also has sought to thwart Iran's purchase of new conventional weaponry and development of ballistic missiles. In May 2018, the Trump Administration withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA), asserting that the accord did not address the broad range of U.S. concerns about Iranian behavior and would not permanently preclude Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Senior Administration officials explain Administration policy as the application of \"maximum pressure\" on Iran's economy to (1) compel it to renegotiate the JCPOA to address the broad range of U.S. concerns and (2) deny Iran the revenue to continue to develop its strategic capabilities or intervene throughout the region. Administration officials deny that the policy is intended to stoke economic unrest in Iran. As the Administration has pursued its policy of maximum pressure, including imposing sanctions beyond those in force before JCPOA went into effect in January 2016, bilateral tensions have escalated significantly. Key developments that initially heightened tensions include the following. On April 8, 2019, the Administration designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), representing the first time that an official military force was designated as an FTO. As of May 2, 2019, the Administration ended five out of the seven waivers under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA), as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), codified at 22 U.S.C. 8739(c), and proposed export licenses for direct commercial sales of defense articles\u00e2\u0080\u0094 training, equipment, and weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a possible value of more than $8 billion, citing its need to deter further Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East. In response, Iran publicly stated that it would designate the United States a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a step tantamount to war \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and would immediately stop all exports of crude oil to the United States. Iran also stated that it might take hostages unless it was immediately paid $2 billion, the first installment of a $15 billion total Iran had demanded to \"offset\" U.S. sanctions damage. Iran apparently has also sought revenues by stealing proprietary information on American companies and by conducting cyber attacks, such as on Saudi Arabia's oil and aerospace sectors in June 2017 and in August 2017. Another element of U.S. strategy has involved renewed efforts to counter Iranian actions, including in connection with Iranian compliance with its nuclear obligations under the JCPOA. In February 2018, thenCIA Director Pompeo publicly disclosed that in January 2016 the United States had intercepted Iranian communications in which Iranian officials talked themselves \"straight into a trap\" when they claimed that none of Iran's enrichment capability was under \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and therefore safe from \u00e2\u0080\u0094 IAEA and U.N. agency monitoring and oversight. The United States has accused Iran in the past of cheating and of failing to comply with its nuclear obligations under the JCPOA. On February 14, 2019, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) produced a report stating, among other things, that Iran has built two, rather than one, underground enrichment facilities at the city of Qom and that Iran is operating an additional 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges there, far in excess of the 150 IR-1 centrifuges disclosed to the IAEA. The NCRI also stated that Iran has built intercontinental ballistic missiles disguised as space launch vehicles, as permitted by the JCPOA. Since then, the Administration has provided its own assessments of Iranian compliance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 assessments that", "This CRS report discusses various aspects of federal funding received through the appropriations process to support U.S. agriculture.\nTopics in this report include a discussion of the 2014 farm bill, which is the agriculture and food law most relevant to the federal budget, and the federal farm bill budget (Section 2105). The report also includes overviews of the agricultural baseline. 2018 farm bill overview The FY2020 budget is influenced by the 2018 farm bill, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334 ; H.R. 2 ). The law makes numerous changes to programs that are currently authorized and funded under annual appropriations. Most of the largest individual programs experienced some level of change under the 2018 farm bill, but most of the changes were funding changes. The budgetary effects of the 2018 farm bill were analyzed in a CRS report released under the following title: \"2014 Farm Bill and 2018 Farm Bill: Side-by-Side Comparison\"; H.R.2 had not been analyzed as of the release date of this CRS report. 2018 farm bill budget Congress passed the 2018 farm bill (H.R. 2 ; P.L. 115-334 ) using a reconciliation process that required a deficit-neutral impact on federal spending. On December 12, 2018, the Senate voted 87-13 to approve the 2018 farm bill in two versions, one with mandatory spending ( H.R. 2 ) and the second with discretionary spending (S. 3042 ), which was vetoed by the President. A compromise budget and allocation between discretionary and mandatory spending in S. 3042 is reflected in the report. Mandatory spending made up approximately 86% ($91.4 billion) of the total enacted level of $108.7 billion. In contrast, the average enacted mandatory obligations for agricultural programs in FY2019 is approximately 6% of that total ($6.7 billion). Overall, mandatory funding is not a large portion of the total federal food and agriculture budget.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enactment of H.R. 2 reduces mandatory spending by $10.6 billion over the 10-year period FY2019 through FY2028, compared with CBO's February 2018 baseline projections (Budget Control Act discretionary limits exclude CBO baseline projections from consideration). The House Committee on the Budget determined that the changes to mandatory spending included in H.R. 2 result in a $95.6 billion net reduction in mandatory spending over the 10-year period FY2019 through FY2028. These estimates exclude any reductions from the sequestration of discretionary spending that Congress could impose in the future. H.R. 2 makes changes to agricultural programs in the following categories: mandatory spending for nutrition programs, crop insurance, and conservation; mandatory spending for credit programs, and research, extension, and foreign aid; discretionary account funding for farm service agency (FSA) programs and for the FDA. A comparison of mandatory spending of S. 2302 and S. 3042, from the CBO website, found that H.R. 2 contained $5.6 billion more in baseline mandatory spending than S. 2302 ($91.4 versus $85.8 billion). The 2019 baseline is approximately 11% more than the FY2019 appropriation of $84.0 billion, and approximately 54% more than the FY2018 appropriation ($ $60.3 billion). Baseline spending is higher than enacted spending (approximately 25% higher than FY2019 enacted funding and 15% higher than FY2018 spending) because the baseline assumes that the prior year's appropriation levels carry through the life of the year while the FY2018 and FY2019 figures reflect enacted spending for the fiscal year", "This report discusses several of the key changes and reforms the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has made in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency.", "U-S- CHINA TOP T I D E S THE UNITED STATES AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ARE INVOLVED IN A PROLONGED STANDOFF OVER TRADE, and in competition that is spilling from political and military areas into a growing number of other spheres, severely straining ties on the 40th anniversary of the two countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 establishment of diplomatic relations.", "This report provides background information and potential issues for Congress for three types of large unmanned vehicles (UVs) that the Navy wants to develop and procure in FY2021 and beyond: Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs); Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs); and Extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs). The Navy wants to acquire these large UVs as part of an effort to shift the Navy to a new fleet architecture (i.e., a new combination of ships and other platforms) that is more widely distributed than the Navy's current fleet architecture. The Navy is requesting $579.9 million in FY2021 research and development funding for these large UVs and their enabling technologies. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's acquisition strategies and FY2021 funding requests for these large UVs. The Navy's proposals for developing and procuring them pose a number of oversight issues for Congress. Congress's decisions on these issues could substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding and UV industrial bases. In addition to the large UVs covered in this report, the Navy also wants to develop and procure smaller UVs and UUVs, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of various sizes. Separate CRS reports address some of these efforts (particularly those for UAVs), which are ongoing in the context of an ongoing Navy effort to transform the Navy's fleet (i.e., its mix of ships and airplanes) into a more \"distributed\" force that is more widely distributed geographically. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Navy state, in part: \uf0b7 \"The current fleet architecture is organized in units primarily focused on carrier strike groups (CSGs) and amphibious ready groups (ARGs) supported by smaller surface combatants and submarines. The majority of combat capability is concentrated within a relatively small number of CSGs and ARGs. The current fleet architecture also is manpower intensive and limited in capability to counter anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) threats. \uf0b7 \"The FYDP[1] fleet architecture will be a more distributed force composed of a combination of ships and platforms. These platforms will be more capable in terms of lethality, payload, and survivability. They will also be more affordable and sustainable over a long-term sustainment cycle. Further, the FYDP fleet architecture will take advantage of rapidly improving technologies and will be more effective against A2/AD threats, particularly in high-threat environments, including those that may be caused by anti-ship missiles, advanced submarines, cyber threats, and other emerging threats.\"\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The FYDP fleet architecture will achieve the DOD goal of an 85:55 warfare mix in Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), Frigates and small surface combatants, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and XLUUVs, respectively. This DOD goal is also sometimes expressed as a ratio of 4:1 in the types of ships. This ratio of ships is designed to approximate a shift in battlefield presence ratios from a ratio of nearly 4:1 in favor of conventional manned Navy ships, or surface combatants (the types of ships the Navy has traditionally used for naval combat), to a 4:1 ratio in favor of the types of UVs under consideration in this report. At the same time, there is also a shipbuilding component to this 85:55 ratio, which is designed to accommodate the Navy's projection that ships will become harder and more expensive to build, and to support the acquisition of LUSVs that may be acquired first from the budget of the U.S. Air Force, and then from the DOD-wide budget. \uf0b7 The current fleet architecture and UV concepts of operations are both based on \"blue-water\" ships. Blue-water ships are the ships that are best suited for patrolling thousands of miles of ocean during the traditional, open-ocean naval \"operating environment[2]\". Consequently, blue-water ships have historically dominated the Navy's fleet, and have been central to the Navy's naval combat strategies. In contrast, the FYDP fleet is based on \"green-water\" ships", "This report provides an overview of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 2500 , S. 1790 , P.L. 116-92 ) and serves as a portal to other CRS products providing additional context, detail, and analysis concerning particular aspects of that legislation. Enacted annually to cover every defense budget since FY1962, the NDAA authorizes funding for the Department of Defense (DOD) activities at the same level of detail at which budget authority is provided by the corresponding defense, military construction, and other appropriations bills. While the NDAA does not provide budget authority, historically it has provided a fairly reliable indicator of congressional sentiment on funding for particular programs. The bill also incorporates provisions of law governing military compensation, the DOD acquisition process, and aspects of DOD policy toward other countries, among other topics. Of the $761.8 billion requested by the Trump Administration for National Defense-related activities in FY2020, $750.0 billion is discretionary spending, of which approximately $741.9 billion falls within the scope of the annual NDAA. This includes $718.4 billion for DOD operations and $23.2 billion for defense-related work by the Energy Department involving nuclear energy, mostly related to nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants for warships. Other funding for defense-related activities, such as counter-intelligence work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), falls mostly under the jurisdiction of other congressional committees. (See Figure 1.) The following overview summarizes the strategic and budgetary context within which Congress debated the FY2020 NDAA. Subsequent sections of the report summarize the bill's treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request as well as provisions attached to the final bill that deal with other issues. As enacted, the FY2020 NDAA authorizes a total of $729.9 billion for national defense-related activities, which is $12.0 billion (1.6%) less than the Administration requested. The request included (as described below) $568.1 billion to be designated as base budget funds to cover the routine, recurring costs to man, train, and operate U.S. forces. The request also included $97.7 billion to be designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds but intended to pay base budget expenses. (Table 2.)

These requirements fundamentally address various equity concerns and reflect the goals of government intervention in agriculture. They determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. Eligibility requirements and payment limits are controversial because they influence what size farms receive support. Policymakers have debated what limit is optimal for annual payments, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited on an individual or per farm operation basis, and whether the limit should be specific to each program or cumulative across all programs. Furthermore, eligibility rules and payment limits generate congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual U.S. farm program payments are at stake: Direct federal outlays have averaged $13.9 billion per year from 1996 through 2017 and when federal crop insurance premium subsidies are included, annual farm payments have averaged $17.7 billion over the same period. Congress began requiring payment limits for U.S. farm programs in the 1970 farm bill (P.L. 91-524). In recent years, Congress has sought limits on payments to both individuals and the overall recipients of federal farm program payments. For example, in the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79), Congress attempted to address concerns about the degree to which limited-resource, beginning, and disadvantaged farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participation in federal farm programs. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) requires recipients of direct payments to have an adjusted gross farm income (AGI) that is below a statutory limit. This report discusses various eligibility factors and their interaction with current farm program payments, including major commodity and ad hoc disaster and other commodity assistance programs. It describes current restrictions that limit or preclude payments to farmers based on a number of factors as well as areas where few, if any, restrictions limit farmers' access to benefits or to their limits in a given year. It concludes with a discussion of several issues related to farm program payment limits, including policy design issues, that may be of interest to Congress. TEXT: Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how various U.S. farm programs operate. These requirements fundamentally address various equity concerns and reflect the goals of government intervention in agriculture. They determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. Eligibility requirements and payment limits are controversial because they influence what size farms are supported. Policymakers have debated what limit is optimal for annual payments, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual or per farm operation, and whether the limit should be specific to each program or cumulative across all programs. Furthermore, program eligibility rules and payment limits generate congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual U.S. farm program payments are at stake. From 1996 through 2017, direct federal outlays for commodity programs, including market facilitation and conservation programs, have averaged $13.9 billion per year and crop insurance premium subsidies have averaged $6.0 billion per year. (CBO and USDA data). In addition, payments from the federal government to compensate for disaster losses have averaged $1.0 billion per year over the same period. Notably, because crop insurance premium subsidies are excluded from Title I farm programs, disaster payments are the only remaining non-program farm payments. Although some crop insurance subsidies are capped per crop (e.g. cotton), no limit currently applies to crop insurance subsidies received from the federal government. In this report, payments made via marketing loans are included with commodity payments, as is policy. This report does not include agricultural disaster assistance program payments other than those made in response to a natural disaster declared by the president under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.). Congress has sought limits on payments to both individuals and the overall recipients of federal farm programs. Most recently, P.L. 115-334 (Sec. 1905) restricts payments for direct payments, counter", "When a non-U.S. national (alien) enters the United States illegally or overstays a temporary visa, her presence in the country violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). She is subject to removal from the country on that basis alone, regardless of whether she has a criminal history or other factors, and there are few circumstances in which she can legalize her presence to extinguish the statutory basis for her removal. The population of aliens in this situation\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, aliens whose presence in the United States violates the INA\u00e2\u0080\u0094currently numbers between ten million and twelve million, according to some recent estimates. About 80% of unlawfully present aliens have been in the United States for more than ten years, according to a study by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The issue of whether and to what extent to legalize or provide other relief from removal to unlawfully present aliens is a frequent topic of debate in Congress. The issue is sometimes called the \"third leg of the stool\" of immigration reform, after the issues of border enforcement and legal admissions. Many (but not all) proposals for comprehensive immigration reform include provisions that would create a pathway to legalization for unlawfully present aliens. These legislative proposals contemplate ad hoc legalization measures: they would offer relief to extant populations of unlawfully present aliens, but the proposals would not change generally applicable law concerning future unlawful presence. This report covers the current law that underlies the ad hoc legalization debate. It reviews the limited circumstances in which the INA allows acquisition of legal status despite unlawful presence. Many of the statutory provisions treated here have requirements, such as good moral character, that will disqualify a person from relief and will prevent her from obtaining a green card or other form of legal status. These requirements are referenced but not analyzed here; another CRS report discusses them in detail. The INA generally does not allow unlawfully present aliens to legalize their presence. The INA takes three primary approaches to regulating the unlawfully present population. First, and most importantly, unlawfully present aliens are subject to removal for as long as their presence violates the INA; no statute of limitations applies. Second, the INA punishes unlawful presence, allowing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to deny admission to certain unlawfully present aliens, and other government agencies to deny benefits to them. In most cases, the INA does not make unlawful presence a crime or other independent bar to admission or benefits. Third, the INA allows certain unlawfully present aliens to obtain legal status going forward, but these provisions are generally limited to a narrow category of criminal and security aliens.", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is overdue for reauthorization for the 2020 fiscal year. The statutory authorization for the program's operations expired on September 30, 2017, with the enactment of the Continuing Resolution to fund the government between October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The program has been reauthorized for one year at a time since 2014. While FEMA and the Congress have previously found temporary funding for the program each year since 2014 to prevent interruptions, FEMA announced suspension of policy sales until its authority to do so was reinstated in March, 2018. FEMA also discontinued payments of multi billions of dollars of claims, resulting in a backlog of claims that is estimated to be more than $23 billion. The National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 3167), sponsored by Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), was ordered reported by the House of Representatives on June 11, 2019. The bill would reauthorize the program at current levels. Current reauthorization would be retroactive to October 2017, when the previous reauthorization expired. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for a consideration of its constitutionality. The bill was subsequently referred to the House Committee of Education and Labor. The Committee of Education and Labor held two hearings concerning reauthorization of the program - the first on July 9, 2019, and the second on July 10, 2019. During these hearings, most of the program's stakeholders expressed concern about the legislation's constitutionality. Several experts also testified that the bill's provisions to allow FEMA to transfer funds from the NFIP to the Treasury are unconstitutional under existing case law. Furthermore, H.R. 3167 also contains several other provisions to allow the Treasury to make these transfers. On July 11, 2019, the House of Representatives voted on H.R. 3167 as amended, but not to allow debate or further amendment. Debate and amendment was restricted to the constitutionality of certain provisions of the bill. The House agreed to send the bill to the House and Labor and Education Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions with a commitment to return the legislation to the full Committee on Education and the Labor for a roll call vote to allow for further amendments to the bill. The bill did not return to the full Committee for a vote. With the 116th Congress adjourned, further action on the bill in this Congress has ceased. PART I: TEXT:", "For several decades the federal government has funded efforts to explore the feasibility of mitigating the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while burning fossil fuels. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), the process of capturing manmade carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at its source, such as a coal-fired power plant, and storing underground into deep subsurface geologic formations instead of releasing into the atmosphere, has been proposed as a technological solution for mitigating emissions while using fossil energy. Federal policies on CCS have received support in recent Congresses, including support for research and development (R&D) and expansion of tax credits for carbon storage. The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, states that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the near future\u2014but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on decisions made today.\" This report focuses on federal policy regarding the underground CO 2 storage stage of CCS. Underground CO 2 storage is achieved through injecting CO 2 into underground rock formations, which are deep isolated portions of the Earth's crust not connected by passageways to upper- or-underground sources of water. This process is being tested in the United States and several other countries. Geologic sequestration, and injecting CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), are both regulated under one portion of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for the purpose of protecting underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and delegated states implement EPA's federal underground injection program. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also engages in R&D activity on this issue. Congress has supported carbon storage via underground injection through recent legislation authorizing R&D on capturing and storing CO 2 through DOE programs and encouraging underground injection with a tax credit for carbon storage. This report provides background on underground injection wells and describes the regulatory framework for subsurface storage of CO 2 in the United States. For additional information on technical aspects of particular well types, see CRS Report R42342, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS): Issues and Current Status . In 2018, Congress directed DOE and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to examine the U.S. potential for geologic storage of CO 2 in deep saline formations.1 According to one estimate, approximately 80 billion tons of CO 2 could potentially be stored underground by 2050 in the United States, more than enough to meet the global storage need (38 billion tons needed by 2050 under one estimate).2 Legislation in the 116th Congress was introduced in February 2019 to expand eligibility for the federal tax credit in lieu of purchasing allowances under the federal climate mitigation policy legislation enacted in 2009,3 which is designed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by capping and reducing such emissions. The legislation would make carbon capture and sequestration projects eligible for the credit.4 It was referred to the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, and it has not been enacted into law. The tax credit for carbon sequestration encourages geologic underground injection of CO 2 by coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities and is the federal government's leading financial policy support for this technology. The credit could be used by both new and existing power plants to offset emission costs related to CO 2 capture and sequestration and is equal to 35% of the \"qualified costs\" for projects.5 2 For more information on carbon storage and CO 2 sequestration from fossil fuel use, see CRS Report R45862, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS): A Summary of Tax Incentives . 3 P.L. 111-54, which was enacted into law on June 26, 2009, and amended on December 17, 2009.

The first such entity, the Appalachian Regional Commission, was founded in 1965 to address economic distress in the Appalachian ( Appalachian ) region. The other regional commissions and authorities were authorized in 1998 ( Denali ), 2000 ( Delta ), 2000 ( Denali ), 2002 ( NBRC ), 2007 ( NGPRA ), and 2011 ( Southeast Crescent ) and the SBRC is pending. As a place-based and intergovernmental approach to economic development, five congressional committees share overseeing jurisdiction of the regional commissions and authorities (Figure A-2) ( ARC: Judiciary Committee; DRA: Appropriations Committee; Denali: Energy and Natural Resources Committee; NBRC: Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; NGPRA: Resources Committee; SBRC: Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; and Southeast Crescent: Judiciary and Budget Committees). The other two federal regional commissions and authorities are multi-state organizations in the name of development and have no formal overview committee relationships. In this report, congressional committees are assigned based on the jurisdiction in which each regional commission and authority falls: state border or multistate border development efforts to ARC; state borders to NBRC; regional to NGPRA, Southeast Crescent, and Southwest Border Regional Commission; Delta Region to the House Committee on Agriculture; and Denali to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\nThe seven entities are governed differently by their authorizing legislation. The ARC, the DRA, the Denali Commission, and the NBRC have federal co-chairs. ARC's federal co-chair is appointed by the President. DRA's federal co-chair is appointed by the President and serves as the administrator of the commission. Denali's federal co-chair is appointed by the President and is selected from among three candidates, at least two of which must be from Alaska. NBRC's administrator, its federal co-chair, is appointed by the President. The ARC, the NBRC, and the Southwest Border Regional Commission (SWBRC) have state co-chairs. The ARC's state co-chair is appointed by the Governor of Arkansas. The NBRC's state co-chairs are appointed by the Governors of the border states. The SWBRC's state co-chairs are appointed by the Governors of the border states.\nThe NGPRA and SBRC, also governed by their authorizing legislation, have a multi-state or regional board to determine the commission's strategic goals and strategies. The NGPRA's 21-member board includes representatives from each of the 12 counties comprising North and South Dakota, and members representing the state of Minnesota. The Southwest Border Regional Commission's 10-member commission is composed of 2 members from California, 1 member from Arizona, 3 members from Texas, 2 members from New Mexico, and 2 members from each of Oklahoma and Mexico.\nUnlike the other commissions and authorities, the Southwest Border Regional Commission and Denali Commission are not comprised of representatives from government or from the regional/multi-state communities. The Denali Commission is comprised of seven executive and up to nine member citizens. The Southwest Border Regional Commission has an 8-member board and one ex-officio member.\nMembership of the five governing boards that form the ARC, the Delta Regional Authority, Denali Commission, NBRC, and NGPRA comprise one Governor, one county or local elected official, and six voting or advisory seats appointed by the respective board members. The ARC commission, the NGPRA board, and the governance committee of the Southwest Border Regional Commission have 16 members; the Delta Regional Authority has 12 members, while the NBRC has 9 members and the Denali Commission has 7 members. The N", "The primary source of federal aid in support of elementary and Secondary Education is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) --particularly its Title I-A program, which authorizes federal aid for education of disadvantaged students. The ESEA was initially enacted in 1965 (P.L. 89-10) \"to Strengthen and improve educational Quality and Educational opportunities in the Nation's elementary and Secondary schools.\" It was most recently thoroughly amended and reauthorized by the Every Students Succeeds Act (ESSA) (P.L. 114-95), which was enacted \"to ensure that every child achieves.1 Under Title I-A of the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA, each state that chooses to accept Title I-A funds is required to focus on accountability within a set of three \"Pillars\" that the ESSA specifies must be included in a state's academic accountability system, The first pillar is Standards and Assessments, and the ESSA delineates several requirements applicable to these required components of the school and statewide accountability systems. These include (1) grade-span appropriate academic standards in mathematics, RLA, and science that are aligned with assessment standards and relevant to grade-level academic achievement and (2) an accountability system that measures and rates schools based on the performance of all students and other subgroups against these grade-level academic standards.  In general, each covered school receives an overall rating (i.e., rating of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 on the \"Overall Performance Level Rating\" Scale) based on its rating in the pillar area of academic achievement. The overall performance level rating determines the type of support a school receives from the SEA.", "Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in October 1972 in the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-484) to provide competent, unbiased information concerning the physical, biological, economic, social, and political effects of emerging technologies and their implications for society. The agency operated for more than two decades, producing approximately 750 full assessments, background papers, technical memoranda, case studies, and workshop proceedings. In 1995, amid broader efforts to reduce the size of government, Congress eliminated funding for the operation of the agency. Although the agency ceased operations, the statute authorizing OTA's establishment, structure, functions, duties, powers, and relationships to other entities was not repealed. Since OTA's defunding, some Members of Congress, science and technology advocates, and others have sought to reestablish OTA or to establish similar analytical functions in another agency or nongovernmental organization. This report describes the OTA's historical mission, organizational structure, funding, staffing, operations, and perceived strengths and weaknesses. The report concludes with a discussion of issues and options surrounding reestablishment of the agency or its functions. Although Congress has not reestablished OTA, congressional interest has increased in recent years in a broader set of issues surrounding the adoption of potentially disruptive technologies. The interest stems in part from the fact that some of these technologies are now being commercialized without adequate consideration for their potential societal impacts and that there is an increasing amount of funding dedicated toward fostering innovation of, and R&D on, these technologies. The Senate has required federal agencies to identify such technologies pursuant to the 21st Century Innovation Act (P.L. 115-30) and to develop R&D strategies pursuant to a bipartisan Senate report, \"Science, Technology, Energy, and Military Relationship Reexamined.\" Congress has also devoted congressional hearings and oversight, as well as limited funding for the development of innovation and R&D strategies, toward these technologies. The House of Representatives has also directed several of its standing committees to lead interagency or bipartisan oversight efforts to address these kinds of issues, and the House has proposed legislation on these technologies. For example, Congress has held hearings, conducted oversight visits, and held a congressional field hearing dedicated to examining how the government can better assess the development and incorporation of autonomous systems. Congress has also held hearings, conducted oversight visits, and held field hearings to examine how the government can better address disruptions caused by technological innovations. Congress has held hearings, conducted oversight visits, and held field hearings to examine how the government's support for innovation and R&D on technologies might be improved in light of new challenges posed by emerging technologies. Pursuant to such congressional attention, the executive branch has issued several documents, which address various approaches to addressing potential disruptive technologies that could impact government, the economy, and society. Furthermore, state and local governments have looked to OTA's mission and product output to examine the impacts of emerging technologies and to inform technology-adoption policies, including in the areas of autonomous and connected vehicle infrastructure, smart cities, and 5G infrastructure. OTA may not be the only agency in the federal government addressing technology-related issues, but it certainly has served as a model for, or inspiration of, other efforts. Over the years, several OTA products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including Background Papers and Technology and the Environment reports\u00e2\u0080\u0094have been cited or referenced by other agencies and offices. In particular, OTA reports have been cited by such agencies as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As noted above, several congressional committees and subcommittees have held hearings, conducted oversight visits, and examined how the government might better serve its public through the integration of new scientific and technological insights.

WE HAVE TASKED YOU TO SUMMARIZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT. PROCEED TO SUMMARIZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT. TEXT: Personal property management is a complex undertaking, as federal agencies must track, evaluate, dispose of, and replace a vast array of items. Personal property is defined as any property that is not real property (land, buildings, and structures), with the exception of certain naval vessels (battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines). Everything else that an agency owns is considered personal property: Desks, computers, vehicles, and laboratory equipment are common examples. Given the size and distribution of the federal workforce\u2014more than 4 million federal civilian and military full-time equivalents are housed at thousands of locations across the country and overseas\u2014the acquisition and maintenance of federal personal property has required sustained investment by the government. In FY2017, federal agencies reported $1.3 trillion in personal property assets. Effective management of federal personal property is necessary to prevent waste, fraud, and loss. Each agency is responsible for implementing policies and procedures\u2014known as internal controls\u2014that mitigate risk and promote the efficient use of federal assets. Internal controls help an agency answer fundamental questions about its personal property inventory, such as: Does the agency know what it owns? Does the agency need everything it has? Is the agency disposing of unneeded assets so that other agencies or the public may make use of them? Is the agency getting the best price on replacement items? What safeguards are in place to make it difficult to steal or misuse personal property? The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides agencies with broad guidance on establishing internal controls via Circular A-123. Specific guidance for agency personal property policies and procedures is primarily located in the Federal Management Regulation, which is promulgated by the General Services Administration (GSA). In addition, Appendix B of Circular A-123 establishes requirements for internal controls over the management of federal charge cards, which includes safeguards for the receipt of personal property acquired with purchase cards, and property that is lost or stolen when not properly inventoried may need to be replaced. When agencies do not follow a sound property management process, state and local entities may lose the opportunity to acquire excess federal property at no charge, resulting in higher costs for them when serving the public. The federal government also incurs greater storage expenses when agencies hold onto excess property and loses revenue from potential sales. To address these concerns, Congress passed the Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 (Personal Property Act; P.L. 115-419 ), which establishes new inventory tracking and assessment requirements for federal agencies. This report begins with a discussion of federal personal property management guidance, then examines weaknesses in agency policies and procedures. Next, the report analyzes the Personal Property Act and how it may address weaknesses in the personal property disposal process. The report concludes with observations on the intersection of real property and personal property. The licensee shall maintain records to account for 10CFR50.38(b)(3) personal property.

Congress expressed interest in the topic and has taken legislative action in response. Congress has authorized the Secretary of Defense to continue efforts to acquire cloud computing services, most recently through Section 211 of the John S.

(North Macedonia's constitutional name was \"Republic of Macedonia\" until February 2019.) Many Members of Congress have supported North Macedonia's aspirations for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. On multiple occasions, U.S. leadership was critical to defusing political crises and interethnic tensions in the country As North Macedonia moves closer to NATO membership, and possibly EU membership, the country shows signs of renewed stability following a political crisis from 2015 to 2017. The years 2019-2020, in which North Macedonia is expected to become NATO's 30 th member and the EU is likely to determine whether to launch accession negotiations, are considered key to consolidating the country's recent breakthrough in its relations with Greece and sustaining its reform momentum. North Macedonia is a small, landlocked country in southeastern Europe (see Figure 1 ). For most of recorded history, its present-day territory was part of empires and kingdoms centered on or near the Balkan Peninsula. Starting in the 19 th century, this territory (and surrounding territory also referred to as \"Macedonia\") was claimed by officials in its larger neighbors, including Serbia (until the creation of Yugoslavia), Greece, and Bulgaria. Some analysts believe that the comparatively small size of the population that identifies as Macedonian (nearly 65 percent of the total) has made it vulnerable to claims from larger states, whose nationalists have periodically invoked the legacy of Alexander the Great (who came from Macedonia and conquered a large part of the then-known world). This, in turn, has helped to fuel Macedonian nationalism, in part by increasing concerns among some Macedonians that external influences pose a threat to the cohesion and cultural integrity of the country. Tensions among various ethnic groups in North Macedonia are further stoked by some ethnic Macedonian nationalists, whose efforts to claim historical figures such as Alexander the Great have been opposed by some Albanian and Greek nationalists who contend that those figures were ethnically not Macedonian. The rise of identity politics in the decades following the breakup of Yugoslavia and independence of North Macedonia, coupled with the government's decision in 2019 to change the country's name from \"Republic of Macedonia\" to \"North Macedonia\" in order resolve a festering dispute with Greece, contributed to some political instability in the aftermath of the regime change that began in early 2016. North Macedonia has been a parliamentary republic since 1991, although the Presidency remained largely ceremonial after 1991. 237\n9 North Macedonia has faced some challenges in its efforts toward political, economic, and institutional reforms. The country was considered politically stable  from 2008 to 2016, a period during which its ethnic Albanian population was more involved in the political process and economic conditions began to improve. Some observers, however, argue that North Macedonia remains a polarized society wracked by interethnic tension that is compounded by external meddling in its internal affairs, including the possibility that some foreign intelligence services were behind the wiretapping of political leaders in 2015-2016 (see \"Interim Government,\" below).  The United States has been a steadfast supporter of North Macedonia since its independence from Yugoslavia. In 1992-1995, the United States played a leading role in mediating a U.N.-brokered border dispute between NATO member-state Greece, on one hand, and Macedonia, on the other (Macedonia was formerly one of the six republics of the socialist Yugoslav federation but declared independence in February 1991). Since 1995, the United States has supported North  Macedonia's aspirations for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, and has consistently supported U.S. and EU efforts to  encourage the adoption of the country's constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia. On January 10, 2019, President Donald J. Trump announced that the United States is now officially recognizing the Republic of North Maced", "Congress has shown an interest in the Department of Defense's (DOD's) electronic warfare (EW) portfolio, requiring an independent assessment of EW plans and programs in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This report addresses U.S. military EW funding across research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) and procurement appropriations. Using the FY2019 through FY2021 budget request documents, this analysis compares funding profiles between fiscal years, as well as projected funding across the future years defense program (FYDP). Using unclassified sources, CRS estimates that DOD seeks to invest approximately $9.7 billion in FY2021 funding for EW programs. Discussion of specific EW-related programs, as well as an overview of electronic warfare, are outside the scope of this report. The following analysis looks at EW funding identified by the DOD's Electronic Warfare Executive Commission (EW EXCOM). The EW EXCOM identified a series of RDT&E program elements from three of the military services (Air Force, Army, and Navy), as well as several defense agencies (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Information Systems Agency, the Joint Staff, Operational Test and Evaluation, and U.S. Special Operations Command). Using the program elements identified, this analysis extrapolates procurement funding to provide an overview of DOD investments in EW in FY2019 and FY202 0 . Over the past two decades, China and Russia have seen U.S. military command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C2ISR) networks as a critical capability to achieve the goals of their respective national defense strategies. Similarly, in its FY2019 and FY2020 defense authorizations, Congress has placed a higher priority on EW programs. In the NDAA for FY2019, Section 940 of the acquisition section requires CRS to prepare a summary of DOD's EW portfolio. Furthermore, Section 1090 of the NDAA for FY2020 requires CRS to study the following: \"the effect of growing capabilities of potential adversaries in the electromagnetic spectrum domain on DOD combat operations and the feasibility and advisability of DOD establishing an integrated spectrum framework.\" CRS conducts research within its area of expertise, but it is not tasked with carrying out individual research assignments. Instead, its mission is to provide relevant, reliable, and comprehensive research services to the U.S. Congress - which, in turn, holds the government accountable for its actions. With this background, CRS, within the scope of its existing analytical responsibilities, prepared this report on the growth and funding of EW programs in FY1980 through FY2021. This report is intended to facilitate congressional oversight with regard to funding for these programs. This study is in compliance with the direction, definition, time limitations, and other considerations that a member of Congress may desire. The study was performed independently of the member's requesting office and is presented without prejudice as to its subjective merits. This report was authored by CRS specialists K. Chace; D. Johnson; A. Kerr, J. Martinez, and N. Thomas-Tate. Section I contains an introduction and overview of key issues within the CRS assessment of EW funding. It also contains an overview of the U.S. military definition of EW as well as program overview and investment projections. Section II provides the methodology for the analysis. Section III provides an appendix of selected DOD program elements supporting EW programs.\nc033270 - (10018040 v. 17), February 14, 2019.", "T he Supreme Court's decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc is an important decision, as it holds for the first time that a method of calculating a drug dose was not patent eligible under 35 USC 101 because it was an unpatentable law of nature. The decision also highlights some long-standing issues that have plagued the Federal Circuit's approach to patent eligibility, and may well signal a change in direction at the Federal Circuit in cases in which patent eligibility may be challenged. The Federal Circuit's decision in this case also points to some serious policy implications for the intellectual property community, including a potential expansion of the scope of inequitable conduct. The decision in Mayo is significant because it is the first Supreme Court decision on the meaning of 35 USC 101. In Diamond v. Chakrabarty,447 US 303 (1980), the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of 35 USC 101 by answering the question: \"Whether a patent claim is drawn to a patentable invention or a judicial exception.\" See generally, Owens, \"Whither Patentability Tests? Chakrabarty 25 Years Later,\" 108 PAT INTELL EXCH 17,4 (Jan.-Feb. 2006). In Chakrabarty, the Supreme Court held that a new DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) bacteria created via a series of genetic operations that does not exist in nature (having a number of genes from Bacillus, and others from Escherichia coli, and others from Clostridium) was patentable subject matter under 35 USC 101. After Chakrabarty, the issue was whether method claims were generally subject to or outside the judicial exceptions of law of nature, law of nature/natural phenomenon, and abstract idea. The Federal Circuit has issued numerous decisions since Chakrabarty, but to date, all patent disputes in the U.S. were being adjudicated in the Federal Circuit.\nIn response to the issue of whether the Supreme Court's decision in Chakrabarty opened the door to patenting methods of nature, the Senate passed the Inventors' Rights and Diligence Act of 1991 (Aug. 1, 1991), Public Law No: 102-204, 105 Stat. 530, in an attempt to provide a definitive answer to whether isolated DNA was patentable subject matter, and to establish a standard to apply in cases involving patents directed to products of nature, methods of nature, and inventions drawn to natural phenomena.\nIn particular, Congress expressed  its  intent   to  \"establish [that] claims directed to or\n2 of 4 related to 100% natural law issues... It has also been called \"the statute that saved Bilski\" and \"the statute everyone has been waiting to know.\" But is Congress' language in the statute clear enough for the Supreme Court to apply, or will the Court choose from one of two existing approaches, one of which is called a \"totality approach.\"\nThe patent claims in Mayo involved a test for measuring the levels of metabolites in the blood of patients having particular diseases. The test included comparing the results with a normal patient level.\nIn this decision, the Supreme Court held that the patent claims directed to a test to determine the appropriate dosage of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis were not patent-eligible. As in Chakarabarty, the Supreme Court had to determine whether the method steps were conventional (common knowledge level) or whether the unpatentable natural phenomenon was a major limitation of the claim.\nThe Supreme Court held that \"to be sure, the fact that the application of those rules might produce [] an improvement in the functioning of the body or mind does not mean that the risk reduction (or other treatment) method falls outside \u00a7101 as an attempt to patent a law of nature.\" On its face [emphasis added], this sounds as if \"risk reduction\" is only the natural law/natural phenomena, and abstract idea, to which claims are directed in determining eligible subject matter. The Supreme Court also stated: \"Their [i.e., methods that are unpatented natural laws and natural phenomena] existence in nature is a", "This report reviews the process and procedures that currently apply to congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the President. This Summary describes the general process, although it does not describe the statutory requirements that apply to arms sales of certain countries identified by the President and the Congress or the additional notice requirement for commercially licensed arms sales imposed by the Missile Technology Control Regime. I. Process and procedures under the AECA The executive branch, after complying with the terms of applicable U.S. law, is basically free to proceed with an arms sales proposal until Congress acts to prevent or to modify such a proposal. The president must formally submit most arms sales proposals to Congress at least 30 days prior to the actual conclusion of the transaction. Congress' review of the sales proposal may be as limited as consideration of the appropriateness of that particular sale or as comprehensive as consideration of all U.S. policy toward a particular country. However, when Congress chooses to review the president's proposed foreign arms sales, it generally will choose to review proposals with significant or controversial implications. Thus, Congress routinely has examined the political dimensions of the proposed sale, such as whether the sale will influence the recipient country's foreign policy and whether the recipient country has any military capabilities that would threaten the security of the United States or its allies, in order to assess the proposed arms sales. Congress may also review proposed arms sales on economic grounds, determining whether the proposed transaction will provide economic or financial support for U.S. suppliers or U.S. industry. However, most of the discussion surrounding the review of a presidential proposal generally involves that country's foreign policy and security dimensions-such as the recipient country's political and economic record, relationship with the United States and allies, military capabilities and potential for misuse of the equipment or technology, and compatibility with U.S. and multilateral policies in the region. If a country has major human rights concerns, Congress may also want to review the sale as that country's record on human rights may reflect the recipient country's willingness to live up to its end of any arms sales transaction. Congress may also scrutinize military-to-military relationships with the proponent countries, as well as with other countries in the region, in determining whether to restrict an arms sales proposal or to promote a particular nation or weapons system in the region. In deciding whether to adopt an arms sales proposal, members should examine their country's relationships with other countries in the region and how sales to one country may impact the U.S. relationship with other nearby countries. Congress should consider those countries which have a record of supporting U.S. security policies and economic and political reform, and the likely impact that the sale could have on these and surrounding countries. Congress should also consider any congressional-executive agreements that may be in effect with a recipient country. The United States has been particularly cautious to use military sales to address and amend foreign policies of countries that have not met international and U.S. standards on the use of force and torture or treatment of its citizens, or to those countries that have a record of military adventurism in the region or have been associated with international terrorism. Congress may scrutinize the proposed sale in order to ascertain the political intentions of the recipient country and/or regional powers and to determine whether the executive branch has thoroughly researched the potential effects of the proposed sale. In particular, Congress should scrutinize the political record and future intentions of the recipient country to ensure that any sale does not ultimately hinder, but would promote U.S. interests and foreign policy goals, or those of the United States' allies. Congress should review each sale transaction before a presidential determination has been made to determine the foreign policy implications of an arms sale, assess potential political and economic impact, identify any U.S. company recipient of the sale, and identify potential or related economic spinoffs to U.S. industry, and then determine whether the sale should be supported. 2 II. Notification to Congress Congress receives advance notification (generally 30 calendar days) of most foreign military sales prior to the actual date of finalized sales. Under the Foreign Assistance Act (PL 87-195), the President must notify Congress of military sales of $14 2 million or more that are proposed in foreign military sales. Arms sales for $14 900,000 or less do not require advance informal notification and are typically announced by the executive branch on their completion. Under the Arms Export Control Act (PL 90-629), the President must formally notify Congress at least 30 calendar days before proceeding to complete a government-to-government foreign sale", "Virtually all societies attempt to remember and memorialize individuals, groups, and events as part of the preservation of shared rhetoric and history. In the United States, there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of memorials to various individuals, groups, and events. These commemorative works may \"engage the population in maintaining memory on a daily basis\" in a way that \"no documents or records can.\" Decisions about which people, groups, or events to memorialize are made by many different entities, including Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and private citizens, among others. Once a decision to commemorate is made, decisionmakers face issues related to the location and cost of a memorial. The choice of a memorial's location is significant. Memorials are arguably most meaningful when they are located in a place with a relationship to the individual, group, or event being commemorated. In 2002, for example, a representative from the National Park Service (NPS) testified before Congress about the importance of place: No memorial designed for placement in Washington, DC, could capture the emotion and awe of visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial, lying where it was sunk in Pearl Harbor. The Oklahoma City National Memorial would not have nearly the power it has if it had been constructed anywhere else but at the site of the Murrah Building. The memorial landscapes of Gettysburg or Antietam National Battlefields still haunt visitors who contemplate what occurred there nearly 150 years ago. This report considers the extent of federal involvement in memorials located outside Washington, DC. A distinction is drawn between memorials located within and outside Washington, DC, because of the exclusive role the CWA gives Congress to authorize new memorials on federal land in the District of Columbia, and the role of federal agencies--primarily NPS and the General Services Administration (GSA)--in maintaining District-based memorials once dedicated. Other CRS reports provide further discussion of memorials within the District of Columbia. No systematic law or set of regulations governs the establishment of memorials outside the District of Columbia. While many such works are established without federal involvement, Congress also has established or recognized numerous memorials nationwide, and some have been designated as NPS affiliated areas, which remain under nonfederal management but receive assistance from NPS. Some of these memorials include multiple facilities such as a visitor center or kiosk in addition to the primary commemorative work. Congress also regularly enacts legislation to place plaques or statues in locations across the country. Memorials with \"high\" federal involvement in the District of Columbia typically are located on federal land (e.g., a national park or national monument), receive at least some funding from the U.S. Government, and are either still under some form of management by a federal agency or have been transferred permanently to state or local control. Memorials with \"high\" federal involvement in the District of Columbia may either include multiple facilities such as a visitor center or kiosk in addition to the primary commemorative work or they may consist solely of materials (e.g., a plaque or statue) fixed to real property. Memorials with \"medium\" federal involvement typically are the same \"high\" federal involvement memorials except they may be located on nonfederal land, have some support from the federal government, but have no or little federal management influence. 1 107\u2013135, \u00a79060 (Mar. 8, 2013); H.R. 831 and H.R. 853, 113th Cong.

Congressional Research Service, June 28, 2018. https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/IF10826 4  students to join the education profession. However, several stakeholders expressed concerns over the design of the program. For example, representatives from teacher preparation programs were concerned that the program was not providing enough grants to fund students, particularly those attending TEACH Grants are awarded to students who will begin a career in teaching and agree to spend at least four years teaching in a high-need subject area in a public school.1 The program initially aimed to address shortages of well-qualified teachers by providing financial incentives to high-need schools to hire recent program. The program was first authorized in the College Cost Preserving the Teaching Profession Act of 2003, where it was a Title VIII TEACH grant demonstration program 2). Under the program, schools which hired recently graduated recipients could receive $4,000 grants annually, and recipients who completed the required four-year teaching commitment were eligible for additional financial incentives towards the complete elimination of educational loans. The final TEACH Grant Authorization Act, H.R. 2272 , authorized the program as a permanent program in 2007. Since the program's first year of enactment, enrollments at teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs) have increased. Since 2007, enrollments at IHE recipient teacher preparation programs were up by an aggregate of 42%, reaching 54,290 students in 2014.3 IHE recipients awarded TEACH Grants reached over $27 million in FY1994, and over $100 million for FY2014.4 1 U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, \"U.S. Department of Education Needs to Verify TEACH Grant Repayment 60% Enforcement Data and Improve TEACH Grant Management,\" Washington, D.C.

U.S. Agriculture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 crisis response programs have included the issuance of emergency financial assistance, and several efforts to help mitigate disruptions to the domestic and international food supply chain. Additionally, farm product prices have spiked and remain high, causing commensurate economic losses. To mitigate these effects, the Trump Administration has moved to secure billions in additional supplemental agricultural financing, and the Congress has developed several bills to respond to the pandemic. While a number of funding priorities have been proposed for this money, the greatest part of these funds will be spent on emergency disaster assistance for farmers, ranchers, and others in the supply chain who are adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn November 6, the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced S. 2976, the FY2021 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill by a vote of 24-11. S. 2976 was introduced on April 29, 2019, by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), at the request of the then-chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), respectively. The bill provides appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), its core mission agencies and related programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year 2020 and for fiscal year (FY) 2021.

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are sometimes referred to as virtual currency , a term that can also refer to a broader class of electronic money. A blockchain is a digital ledger that enables parties to agree on the current ownership and distribution of assets in order to conduct new business. When applied to cryptocurrencies, the blockchain allows the validation of transactions to occur by a decentralized network of computers. As cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization) have increased in popularity, the energy demand to support cryptocurrency mining activities has also increased. The state of Washington, by some estimates, hosted 15%-30% of all Bitcoin mining operations globally in 2018. When such increases in energy demand for cryptocurrency mining occur at a local level, the resulting peak loads may increase customers' electricity rates depending on pricing structure. However, not all cryptocurrencies require energy-intensive operations. Outside of cryptocurrencies, opportunities arising from blockchain technologies could include facilitating energy and financial transactions on a smart grid. This report explains how cryptocurrency is \"mined,\" where mining activity is concentrated, how some states and utilities are responding to localized increases in energy demand from Bitcoin mining facilities, and potential considerations for Congress. Congress retains a role in energy-efficiency policy relating to the operation of computers on the network, but not for security policy related to the software that enables Bitcoin mining. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for information technology software updates to improve energy efficiency, but there are no requirements specific to Bitcoin mining. For Congress, issues concerning Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies generally may include: opportunities to promote or address cyber-related crimes, as well as issues in terms of marketplace and legal uncertainties, while ensuring consumers can access safe financial transactions.\nBitcoin mining typically occurs via the use of a cryptocurrency mining rig or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Bitcoin miners are incentivized to do this through the provision of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies they mine. Bitcoin is often said by its supporters to solve the issue of the \"double-spend problem\" for electronic money ( money that exists only digitally , and not as coins or bills ). For example, digital money that could be spent twice. By utilizing encryption, the Bitcoin blockchain records every transaction in the ledger. It can only be spent once.  This process of creating new block ensures the integrity of the ledger. This is known as providing proof-of-work (PoW).

Statutory reporting requirements can be useful in facilitating congressional oversight by enhancing congressional access to information about the implementation of public policy. Each year, Congress enacts a variety of requirements for the President, executive departments, agencies, and other federal government entities to provide advance notification of actions and decisions, to create plans and strategies to carry out certain activities, to summarize steps taken toward implementation of particular policies, or to study problems and issue recommendations. Reporting requirements can be used to accomplish a range of different goals. When designing such requirements, policymakers face a number of choices that may affect the content, frequency, and other features of the information that Congress receives as a result. This report provides an overview of statutory reporting requirements used by Congress to obtain information from the executive branch; describes the goals that various types of reporting requirements may help achieve; and analyzes statutory requirements enacted during the 115th Congress to identify common features of legislative language used to establish such requirements. Congress relies in large part on information provided by the executive branch in order to conduct oversight. To that end, Congress frequently enacts statutory provisions that require federal entities to provide, among other things, notifications of actions or decisions; descriptive reports that summarize actions taken or provide other factual information; plans to accomplish particular goals; and studies or evaluations relating to a specific problem or concern. Each category is discussed in additional detail below. Many statutory provisions require that specified federal officials, typically Cabinet Secretaries or the heads of other federal entities, notify Congress either before or soon after taking some action. For instance, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 ( P.L. 115-441 ), provided the following notification requirement: (b) DESIGNATION.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, may designate foreign terrorist organizations for the imposition of controls under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), other than the powers under subsection 1708(u), upon a determination that such organization\u00e2\u0080\u0094 (1) engages in terrorist activity or terrorism (as defined in section 2676(d) of title 22, United States Code); or (2) has repeatedly and over a significant period of time engaged in terrorist activity or terrorism. As with any reporting requirement, the specific information, frequency, and deadlines that are designated can, and often do, bear on the usefulness of such provisions. The purpose of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, was to help monitor the implementation of an Executive Order to impose sanctions in response to terrorist activities. Additionally, there were other provisions designed to promote further congressional oversight of such implementation. The specific purposes could be reflected in the language of the requirement that specified an organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designation, in this case the Secretary of the Treasury. This type of reporting requirement can help Congress supervise the use of a new grant of authority in order to ensure compliance with legislative intent. The purpose of this and other notification provisions often provides guidance as to how reporting requirements might achieve oversight goals that might be less well defined. For example, this provision could serve a number of different purposes, such as allowing for congressional", "The current pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected over 190 regions in 36 countries. From the SARS outbreaks in 1999 in Taiwan to those in 2002/3, epidemiologists have learned a great deal about SARS. At the same time, many uncertainties exist about SARS. On the 18th of March, Canada reported a case of SARS to the World Health Organisation that would eventually turn into the most serious outbreak of the disease. On March the 27th, China reported its first case of SARS to the WHO. Since then, hundreds have fallen ill and dozens have died. The disease has spread not only across mainland China but also the globe. This has led global health authorities to consider the impact or severity classification of the spread of the disease. To this point, all of the cases were traced back to one person. He had travelled by aircrafts to Hong Kong and later infected over a dozen of people. The SARS spreading has forced the government in Beijing to suspend all international flights to and from the city of Hong Kong. Many countries have placed severe restrictions on travelling to China. This thesis will outline ways that the present SARS epidemic has impacted not only healthcare practitiones, health practitioners and the public but also business, trade and tourism.", "The text under consideration will require the students to summarize two different texts. They will look at different levels of the text and work on the summary language and structure. TEXT", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act ( P.L. 116-136 ) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provides over $2 trillion in relief to individuals; businesses; state, local, and federal agencies; and industry sectors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government-led effort to limit its public health impact. Given the scope of the relief provided, the variety of new and existing programs that are to provide this aid, and the number of individuals and entities receiving aid, the administration of the CARES Act is likely to be a complicated and significant undertaking by executive branch agencies and non-federal partners. These complexities may be made even greater by both pressure to provide relief as swiftly as possible and unique logistical challenges posed by the ongoing public health emergency. All of those factors make Congress's oversight role during the COVID-19 pandemic especially important and may make it more difficult for Congress to conduct timely oversight. Congress included a variety of oversight mechanisms in the CARES Act. In addition to requiring executive branch officers to submit reports on a variety of topics, provide notice before taking specified actions, and testify before certain committees, the CARES Act provides additional resources to the Government Accountability Office and to Offices of Inspectors General that may have additional audit and investigative activity due to the CARES Act. In addition, the CARES Act creates three new oversight entities: a Congressional Oversight Commission, a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), and the Pandemic Recovery Accountability Committee (PRAC, a group of inspectors general). Each of those entities is empowered to provide oversight of significant aspects of the CARES Act. This report is a reference guide for congressional clients interested in understanding the congressional oversight tools built into the CARES Act. This report does not contain specific references to all statutory reporting requirements. The text and footnotes of this report provide references to those sections of the CARES Act and other statutes that specifically mention the duty of agencies to report information to Congress, such as Section 506(b)(1) (relating to a summary report on the CARES Act), but many reporting requirements included in the CARES Act may nevertheless be referred to in practice as congressional reporting requirements. Provisions included in the CARES Act may trigger reporting of information under other statutes.\n(02437A)  INFO:  This report will be updated as events unfold.", "The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) are two separate provisions that reduce regular Social Security benefits for workers and/or their eligible family members if the worker receives (or is entitled to) a pension based on earnings from employment not covered by Social Security. The WEP affects retired or disabled workers and their family members, and the GPO affects spouses and survivors. Some beneficiaries who are entitled to both Social Security retirement benefits and spousal (or survivors') benefits (i.e., dually entitled) may be affected by both the WEP and the GPO. As of December 2018, 263,775 Social Security beneficiaries had their benefits reduced by both provisions, which accounted for 38% of spouses and survivors who were affected by the GPO and 14% of beneficiaries affected by the WEP. The provisions' benefit offsets create complications in calculating and administering Social Security benefits. This report examines the current-law provisions of the WEP and the GPO, who is affected by both provisions, and the size of the affected population. It also focuses on issues related to Social Security overpayments associated with dually entitled beneficiaries affected by both provisions, the two offsets' impact on Social Security benefits and household wealth, and how extending Social Security coverage through Section 218 agreements impacts the population affected by both provisions. For an overview of the WEP and the GPO, see CRS In Focus IF10203, Social Security: The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) ; and for an explanation of the dual entitlement rule, see CRS In Focus IF10738, Social Security Dual Entitlement . A worker's employment or self-employment is considered covered by Social Security if the services performed in that job result in earnings that are subject to Social Security payroll taxes. About 7% of all workers are not covered by Social Security, mainly state and local government employees covered by alternative state-retirement systems and most permanent civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, who are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or other alternative retirement plans. Social Security beneficiaries who receive a pension based on non-covered work (including certain foreign pensions) may be affected by the WEP or the GPO, or both. Under current law, in 2019 the WEP applies if the worker has averaged less than $1,470 per month in substantial earnings in covered employment (generally, from jobs where payroll taxes are deducted) in each of one-quarter of the years in question, 96 quarters, or one-third of the years in question, which is a smaller amount when less than 96 quarters are credited in the WEP-affecting year. The GPO applies if a worker or spouse has earned a government pension of more than $448 in the month. The WEP also excludes $0.50 from each dollar of non-covered pension earnings, up to a $20 minimum. Under the GPO, an amount equivalent to a full Social Security benefit from non-covered employment is set aside (e.g., in a non-covered government pension) to calculate a spousal benefit (also an actuarial reduction if the spouse is under full retirement age). The WEP adjustment and the GPO reduction are not affected by a benefit computation method that is more liberal\u2014e.g., where a monthly pension is paid equal to the maximum, but may not be paid for the full number of months of monthly pension entitlement. Each year a worker earns an average of more than $1,470 per month in substantial earnings in covered employment (or, in years with fewer than 50 quarters of substantial earnings credited, earnings of at least $560 per month) and less than a yearly Social Security benefit equal to the annual primary insurance amount (PIA, or, in years with fewer than 30 quarters of substantial earnings credited, $1,120 per month), no reduction occurs in the benefit computed for that year. This rule means that earnings must be projected into future years for PIA calculations before any WEP or GPO adjustments are made. For disabled workers, the minimum $0.50 WEP exclusion or GPO reduction", "The President is responsible for appointing individuals to certain positions in the federal government. In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted to the President alone. Other appointments, generally referred to with the abbreviation PAS, are made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation process. This report identifies, for the 115th Congress, all nominations submitted to the Senate for full-time positions on 34 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. This report includes profiles on the leadership structures of each of these 34 boards and commissions as well as a pair of tables presenting information on each body\u2019s membership and appointment activity as of the end of the 115th Congress. The profiles discuss the statutory requirements for the appointed positions, including the number of members on each board or commission, their terms of office, whether they may continue in their positions after their terms expire, whether political balance is required, and the method for selecting the chair. The first table in each pair provides information on full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation as of the end of the 115<sup>th</sup> Congress. The second table tracks appointment activity for each board or commission within the 115th Congress by the Senate (confirmations, rejections, returns to the President, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation), as well as further related presidential activity (including withdrawals and recess appointments). In some instances, no appointment action occurred within a board or commission during the 115th Congress. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database at <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/\"> https://www.congress.gov/</a> (users can click the &quot;nominations&quot; tab on the left-hand side of the page to search the database), the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2016 Plum Book ( <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FDSYS-2013-STAN-P015/pdf/GPO-FDSYS-2013-STAN-P015.pdf\"> https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FDSYS-2013-STAN-P015/pdf/GPO-FDSYS-2013-STAN-P015.pdf</a>).  Federal executive branch boards and commissions have four characteristics. First, they are independent executive branch bodies located, with four exceptions, outside executive departments. Second, their members\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially chairs, who often have full-time positions\u00e2\u0080\u0094often hold their positions well beyond their current unexpired terms. Third, some boards and commissions have unique selection methods for their members. Fourth, the fixed terms of a board or commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s members have set beginning and end dates; simultaneous nominations for the same individual to complete two terms of appointment are frequently submitted to the Senate for a single nomination. This report summarizes 2018 nomination and appointment activity in 34 boards and commissions for which the President submitted nominations to the Senate and for which reelection was not an option for 2018. For these same 2018 appointments in 13 boards and commissions, the President was obliged to withdraw, or did not submit nomination(s) for, confirmation votes during the 115th Congress. Tables included in this report summarize nominations for full-time positions for which the Senate took action and appointment activity that occurred within individual boards and commissions during the 115<sup>th</sup> Congress. The full-time positions are classified by the United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions (Plum Book) as positions paying &quot;rate of basic pay&quot; of &gt;$100,000,&quot; or &quot;otherwise considered to be full time&quot; by this same Plum Book.

I'm on a call with JF & LV.", "U.S. foreign assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has  grown substantially over the past two decades, increasing from $2.5 billion in 2000 to $8.3 billion (excluding emergency assistance) in 2019. The United States remains Africa's largest bilateral donor. Recent U.S. aid to the region primarily (about 70%) has focused on health programs, notably global HIV/AIDS responses and malaria initiatives. The Trump Administration's proposed FY2021 foreign aid budget request for Africa totaled $5.98 billion in the regular (core) foreign aid account (CARE). The Trump Administration has proposed the consolidation of various assistance programs under the umbrella of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Development Credit Authority (DCA) and the State Department's new Economic Development and Law and Governance programs. Proponents argue that the proposal would streamline funding operations; critics question, among other things, how development can be facilitated by loans rather than grants. The Trump Administration also has proposed eliminating funding to the 1701 program (Global Peace Operations Initiative) for African peacekeeping contingents, arguing that such forces do not perform well in U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa.\nSELECTED CONSIDERATIONS: This report discusses U.S. policy toward sub-Saharan Africa and highlights major issues for Congress, such as efforts to address disease, governance, infrastructure constraints, resource utilization, and security threats, particularly terrorist threats to U.S. and other Western interests. It also explores some challenges to U.S. aid for Africa, such as corruption, and efforts by foreign partners and nongovernmental organizations to improve transparency and efficiency.\nSub-Saharan Africa is a region of high resource endowment and persistent poverty that has struggled to make economic gains since World War II.6 It is geopolitically strategic, and U.S. national security policymakers have viewed the region warily because of conflicts and concerns that its economies could potentially serve as hosts to proliferating nuclear or other weapons of mass destruc-tion.7 In U.S. policy toward the region, Africa was a secondary concern during much of the post-World War II era until the mid-1990s when international attention focused on Africa because of the genocide in Rwanda.8 African development challenges were subsequently placed at the forefront of U.S. engagement with the region because of the successes of such programs like the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the early 2000s. The Obama Administration increased U.S. development aid to the region and placed more emphasis on food security, notably to address climate change-related challenges. Development and security challenges related to sub-Saharan Africa are interconnected and, in recent years, have been compounded by violent extremism and security gaps that threaten the global commons. The Trump Administration has emphasized security issues in sub-Saharan Africa, arguing that aid programs did not sufficiently address security threats to African and U.S. countries. Despite significant U.S. funding for Africa, many African countries face challenges such as extreme corruption9 and economic distress on which U.S. policy has not effectively focused.  While the Obama Administration's 2014 Power Africa initiative has drawn criticism as a symbolic effort,10 the Trump Administration's Prosper Africa initiative11 has been viewed in some circles as a potentially more serious attempt to coordinate U.S. agencies' efforts to address development and security challenges in Africa.12  REGIONAL CONFLICTS AND TERRORISM: African countries confront a range of security challenges that have affected their economies and societies, as well as their relations with U.S. partners and international community. Some observers have assessed that U.S. counterterrorism initiatives undercut the effectiveness of other U.S. programs in Africa, or that U.S. national security interests in the region do not reflect U.S. development priorities.13  U.S. counterterrorism activities in Africa are multifaceted, reflecting a long-standing U.S. interest in the continent that predates the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program makes several types of federal student loans available to individuals to assist them with financing postsecondary educational expenses. It represents the single largest source of federal financial assistance to support students' postsecondary educational pursuits. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) estimates that in FY2020, 15.9 million new loans, averaging $6,299 each and totaling $100.2 billion, will be made through the Direct Loan program to undergraduate and graduate students, and to the parents of underg raduate students. In addition, ED estimates that 755,000 Direct Consolidation Loans, averaging $61,433 each and totaling $46.4 billion, will be made to existing borrowers of federal student loans. As of the end of the second quarter of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in principal and interest from loans made through the Direct Loan program remains outstanding. This report presents a comprehensive over view of the terms and conditions that apply to federal student loans made through the Direct Loan program. It begins by providing background information on the history of the Direct Loan program. This is then followed by a brief description of the various types of loans that are made available through the Direct Loan program. The report then presents a thorough description of the terms and conditions for loans made through the Direct Loan program. In identifying and describing loan terms and conditions and borrower benefits, it focuses on provisions applicable to loans that are currently being made or that have been made in recent years. The final section of the report provides a summary of the methods that are used to ensure that borrowers are informed about the terms and conditions of the loans they obtain and their obligation to repay them. It is not intended to be relied upon by borrowers as a resource for validating individual eligibility for specific borrower benefits. Appendix A to this report contains a directory of resources from which additional information may be obtained about loans made through the Direct Loan program. Appendix B consists of a set of tables that present historical information on borrowing limits, interest rates, and fees that have applied to loans made through the Direct Loan program.  For FY1994 and prior years, information is shown only for the FFEL program in which no new direct loans were made in those years. BACKGROUND: The Direct Loan  program was first authorized in 1993 by Title IV of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102-325). Prior to that time, ED contracted with a single private-sector lender to make loans under the FFEL program in accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA).  However, some of the private-sector lenders' procedures for managing defaulted student loans were inefficient at best. The FFEL program also was a costly way for the federal government to finance student loans. Under the FFEL program, an estimated $200 million annually would have to be transferred from the Treasury to the private-sector lenders, which would have resulted in lost federal interest. Direct loans offered significant cost savings to the federal government by eliminating the need for private-sector lending and by providing for repayments and default resolution to be handled directly by ED, eliminating the need for collection of defaulted loans by multiple private-sector lender servicers. Since its establishment in 1994, the Direct Loan program has grown significantly, with both loan volume and number of institutions serving as Direct Loan lenders steadily increasing each year. This growth has been fueled by increased participation in the program by federal student aid applicants, an increased interest in and application for Direct Loans, and ED's 159 2-year average repayment rate of 99.2 percent.1 Although enactment of the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 (HERA; P.L. 109-171) effectively abolished the FFEL program, loans that were made before October 1, 2010, and certain other special circumstances still exist. Direct loans are currently the primary financial aid support instrument for postsecondary attendance. The Direct Loan program is authorized under Title IV of the HEA. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA; P.L. 110-315) re", "TheElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L 114-95 ),is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $15.9 billion for FY2019. Title I-A is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, andEducation Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). This report provides FY2019 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants.Fora general overview of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief .For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44461,Allocation of Funds Under Titl e I-Aof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children living infamilies in poverty, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on stateaverage per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. In some LEAs, grants may be reduced as a result of being designated as \"highly impacted\" by school poverty, school size, or free and reduced-price lunch participation rates. Highly-impacted LEAs receive the same percentage share of funds as low-impact LEAs in a given formula. Grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each respective formula. Under EFIG, grants are first allocated to individual states within a group of five or more contiguous states called a \"weighted student group\" (WSG). This allocation is made using a formula similar to EFIG's within a state (WSG). The percentage share of funds allocated to each WSG is calculated by dividing the number of \"weighted students\" in the WSG by the total weighted students in all WSGs, and then the resulting percentage share is multiplied by the overall FY2019 appropriation for the respective formula to determine the WSG allocation. Next, the total amounts for the Basic Grants and Targeted Grants WSGS are combined and divided between these WSGS based on the \"low expenditure adjustment\" (LEA) formula. LEA is calculated based on state average per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education in the previous fiscal year, or actual per pupil expenditures if there is a discrepancy between actual per pupil expenditures and estimated per pupil expenditures in the current fiscal year. The LEA calculation is capped at 25% for most states and it is applied differently to LEA based on whether state actual or estimated expenditures are used. The LEA figure is then used to determine a total minimum payment for the state under both the Basic Grants and Targeted Grants formulas, after which the total state minimum payment is divided between the Basic Grants and Targeted Grants (WSGs) and allocated to each of those WSGs. Because Basic Grants and Targeted Grants amount calculations begin with separate WSGs, each WSG is then further divided between LEA based on the LEA formula, and between Title I-A eligible minority students based on different racial, ethnic, and language minority group student formulas. FY 2019 TitleI-A grants to LEAs under Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG may be reduced if a state or LEA fails to implement certain compliance obligations. Grants to some LEAs may be increased due to a school's designation as highly-impacted by concentration poverty. Under all three formulas (Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Targeted Grants), grants are initially determined for specific LEAs, but may subsequently be adjusted by states according to state allocation formula, to reflect differences among LEAs within states. States have some", "Poverty in the United States The poverty measure in this report is the 2018 poverty rate calculated using the Census Bureau's official poverty thresholds (as of summer 2019). The current poverty rate is lower than the poverty rate in 2017: 11.8% in 2018 versus 12.3% in 2017. However, it is still relatively high overall: about 6.5 percentage points higher than the lowest low-poverty rate since 1976 (10.3% in 1976), and 1.9 percentage points higher than the closest year-to-year decline (10.9% in 2016 from 12.1% in 2015). Figure 1 below shows poverty rates in recent years, with the historical low-poverty rate of 10.3% in 1976. The most striking takeaway from the figure is how far from that low-poverty milestone we remain, with persistent poverty in the United States. Figure 1.

Not included are 1980 (36.3 million people), 1985 (52.9 million people), and 1986 (58.9 million people) to show the total number of people in poverty over time relative to other time points. Note that this figure differs from Figure 1 in CRS Report R46000 , Poverty in the United States in 2018: In Brief . The figures are not comparable due to different time periods covered compared. The \"historical low-poverty rate\" figure in CRS Report R46000 is a subset of the \"Persistence of poverty\" figure included here and calculated on a different basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a time frame that spans 1966 to 2018. 1The poverty-rate estimate presented in this figure uses data from the 2012-2016 ACS. The poverty rate declined slightly over this period\u00e2\u0080\u0094from 13.8% to 13.4%. (See Figure 1 in CRS Report R46000 , Poverty in the United States in 2018: In Brief . There are several possible reasons for the slight, year-on-year decline between 2015 and 2016 (12.1% in 2015 to 12.0% in 2016) and between 2016 and 2017 (12.0% in 2016 to 11.8% in 2017) as compared to the decline between 2015 and 2016 (12.1% to 12.0%) or the decline between 2016 and 2017 (12.1% to 11.8%) as compared to a year-to-year decline in 2010 (14.4% to 14.3%) or a year-to year decline in 2011 (15.0% to 14.5%). The main reason for the difference between 2015 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2017 can be traced to changes in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) survey design and question wording, which affects the ACS estimates of the official poverty measure. These changes reduced the total number of poverty units by 0.7%, which is not a large enough amount to account for the differences in declines with 2010 or 2", "85% of those who receive food assistance are women and children.", "In recent years, the Trump Administration and Congress have grappled with how to address the substantial number of migrants from the Northern Triangle countries...\nBibliography: N.p., 1972- (U.S. Congressional and Administrative News, 1945-, ProQuest).", "", "The United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) exit from the European Union (EU), commonly termed Brexit, remains the overwhelmingly predominant issue in UK politics.

Brexit was originally scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019, but the UK Parliament was unable to agree on a way forward due to divisions over what type of Brexit the UK should pursue and challenges related to the future of the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state).2 In early 2019, EU leaders agreed to grant the UK an extension until October 31, 2019, while Parliament set an early general election for December 12, 2019.

There are three levels of CRS analysts. At the top of the pyramid there\u2019s the Senior Analyst, then the Analyst, and at the lowest level there\u2019s the Reports Writer. Senior Analysts have analyst positions at the Congressional Research Service (CRS), The Congressional Reporting Service (CRS), and the CRS. In fact at this point there are numerous analysts holding the position of a Reports Writer. That\u2019s how I found myself the other day writing a letter to the CRS, the letter was to a Mr. James W. Zerko, Analyst in Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Policy. While writing the letter and searching for the words I was reminded of my earlier life back in 1993 when I was part of a documentary film which was to be watched in the White House.\nJames R. and Doreal:\nThank you for the words of encouragement. I do know and admit that I\u2019m not a perfect human being like the rest of you; I do sometimes make grave mistakes and I do apologize, but the truth is that even when trying to avoid mistakes I often find myself repeating the old ones! I\u2019m still in the process of learning and will continue to do so. I wish to reassure you that I\u2019m on the right path and that things will go smoothly. I will not get sidetracked and I will not waiver. Thank you James R. and to the rest of everyone of you whose support is helping me move forward, I\u2019m truly thankful.

Zerko, Analyst in Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Policy.\nI\u2019d like to write few sentences with your permission Mr. Zerko. You see as far as I know the CRS doesn\u2019t publish the phone numbers of its analysts, or if they do these numbers remain concealed. I must say that I haven\u2019t seen a complete analyst directory with contact numbers. In other words you\u2019re the one in charge Mr. Zerko; that\u2019s how it is.\nSo, here we go:\nThe CRS is very professional. I\u2019ve got the information I wanted, thank you.\nIt seems that the CRS is working on it but you might find my e-mail address of the 10.01.2013 with your permission Mr. Zerko and with your consent. After all, it\u2019s all for the better as I had mentioned before on the phone that Mr. Zerko has very good information to share with everyone.\nSincerely, Doreal\nA few words to the Reports Writer:\nThanks for the e-mail Mr. Zerko for the CRS is a place were you can get complete answers without the need to wake up early in the morning. The CRS is a place were you know you can get all the answers. All of us could benefit from the knowledge of the CRS.\nI would also like to comment on one thing, that is, the CRS is very professional. If someone writes a letter to the CRS he is sure to get an answer in a matter of a few days or maximum of weeks, unlike the long drawn process you are familiar with in some of the other institutions. If someone is in a hurry the CRS is the place where it is most easy to get the answers.\nThanks Mr. Zerko for your help.\nAnd so now I write the final words to the CRS Reports Writer:\nWith your permission, you are most welcome and I will allow you now to use the e-mail address that was first received on the 10.01.2013 the first official request addressed to the CRS on earth.

For example, shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh, PA, and Poway, CA; a driver speeding his car into protestors at a \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, VA; a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, TX, where the shooter allegedly said he was targeting \"Mexicans\" and espoused concerns about the \"invasion\" of the United States by immigrants; and reports of hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the Coronavirus pandemic contribute to a perception that hate crimes are on the rise in the United States. The salience of these events and how they are covered in the media might also contribute to the perception that there is a growing number of hate crimes being perpetrated in communities across the country. Policymakers might turn to hate crime data collected by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to understand if there has actually been an increase in hate crimes in the United States and, if so, the nature of the increase. Policymakers might also utilize these same data to craft a policy response to hate crimes that is grounded in the data and conduct oversight of the federal government's efforts to combat these crimes. This report begins with an overview of federal sources of data on hate crimes. This includes a brief overview of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA,  P.L. 101-275 ), which requires DOJ to collect and report data on hate crimes. The report next discusses two salient issues regarding hate crime statistics. The first is the large difference between the number of hate crimes reported by the FBI and the number of hate crime victimizations reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics's (BJS's) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Second is a concern that law enforcement agencies are underreporting hate crimes to the FBI. The report concludes with a discussion of whether the wide-scale adoption of the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) might serve as a means of improving federal hate crime data. Policymakers have expressed concern that hate crimes are on the rise in the United States since the 2016 presidential election. The United States has experienced a recent series of high-profile violent crimes in which the perpetrator's actions appear to be motivated by the victim's race, ethnicity, or religion. The most recent large-scale tragedy with an alleged hate-related motive was the mass shooting during a Saturday service at the Tree of Life Synagogue building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in October 2018. The shooter killed 11 Jewish worshipers and injured several others before being taken into custody. Other high-profile tragedies with an alleged hate-related motive included the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, in which the shooter killed nine African-American worshipers, the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016, in which the shooter killed 49 gay club patrons, and the 2017 white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville and throughout the United States. As reported in media sources, incidents of violent crime motivated by bias against religion have been rising in recent years. For instance, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL, 2019) reports that over the past decade, hate crimes and incidents have been increasing. This report will be updated as needed. 6 This report begins with an overview of federal sources of data on hate crimes. This includes a brief overview of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA,  P.L. 101-275 ), which requires DOJ to collect and report data on hate crimes. The report next discusses two salient issues regarding hate crime statistics. The first is the large difference between the number of hate crimes reported by the FBI and the number of hate crime victimizations reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics's (BJS's) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Second is a concern that law enforcement agencies are underreporting hate crimes to the FBI. The report concludes with a discussion of whether the wide-scale adoption of the FBI's National Incident-", "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic is affecting communities around the world and throughout the United States, with case counts growing daily. As private health insurance is the predominant source of health coverage in the United States, there is considerable congressional interest in understanding private health insurance coverage of health benefits related to COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This report addresses frequently asked questions about covered benefits and consumer cost sharing related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and a potential vaccine. It discusses recent legislation, references relevant existing federal requirements and recent administrative interpretations of them in relation to COVID-19, and notes state and private sector actions. It begins with background information on types and regulation of private health insurance plans. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA; P.L. 116-127) requires specified types of private health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing, administration of the test, and related items and services, without consumer cost sharing. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136) further addresses private health insurance coverage of COVID-19 testing, and requires coverage of a potential vaccine and other preventive services without cost sharing, if they are recommended by specified federal entities. There are no federal requirements that specifically require coverage of COVID-19 treatment services. However, one or more existing federal requirements are potentially relevant, as discussed in this report. Some states have also announced requirements related to covered benefits and consumer costs, and some insurers have reported that they will voluntarily cover certain relevant benefits. This report discusses most U.S. private health insurance plans' coverage of health care items and services related to COVID-19, but it generally does not discuss the delivery of those services, insurers' payments to health care providers, or private health insurance coverage of other benefits. The information in this report is current as of its publication date and may be superseded by subsequent congressional or administrative action. Congressional clients may contact the author and/or the experts listed in the Appendix for questions about further developments. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance related to private health insurance and COVID-19 is compiled on its website. The private health insurance market includes both the individual market and the small- and large-group markets. Covered benefits, consumer costs, and other plan features may vary by plan, subject to applicable federal and state requirements. The federal government may regulate all the types noted above, with the exception of the individual market and self-insured group plans, which are generally regulated only by states. This issue brief introduces most common types. BASIC COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS UNDER Title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA , P.L. 111-148, as amended), is titled 'Ensuring that consumers receive value for their premium dollars.' In section 1001 of the ACA, Congress defines a qualified health plan (QHP) in part as one that 'includes the essential health benefits package identified for the State under [section 1302(b)] of this title.' 1 The ACA directs the Secretary of HHS to develop procedures for the annual review of state-selected EHB packages to determine whether they comply with ACA requirements in effect for each EHB category.2 These procedures specify that HHS is to consult with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as part of its EHB review. NAIC is to provide information to HHS for use in this and related EHB annual review processes. In addition to the EHB-related provisions in Title I, 5 other ACA Title I provisions provide the basis for mandatory or voluntary benefits. HHS developed its implementing EHB guidelines pursuant to sections 1302(b)(1) and (b)(2)(D) of the ACA, and EHBs are selected based on these guidelines. Other EHB-related provisions in Title I of the ACA include, in part:  the requirement for an independent review process (IRP) under which an individual enrollee may appeal a coverage decision or level of coverage in relation to a QHP that the enrollee receives; and the requirement to offer catastrophic health plans. State insurance regulators", "Adjusted Discretionary Spending Limits........................... 1-1\nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO) OCO is permitted as a discretionary adjustment. The budget function 050 (national defense) is the only budget function from which OCO can be funded. OCO spending, when enacted, is exempt from the statutory discretionary spending limits for the year in which it was enacted. This means that the spending limit amount in effect for each of the budget functions in budget function 050 prior to enactment of the OCO spending will be adjusted upward after OCO spending has been enacted. The adjustments to the discretionary spending limits are then calculated by subtracting the OCO adjustments from the statutory limits, after which new discretionary spending limits are determined. The adjusted discretionary spending limits can be lower or higher than the limits enacted without enactment of any OCO spending. Enactment of OCO spending means that the discretionary spending limits are adjusted up. The adjusted discretionary spending limits (without OCO) may be lower than those established without OCO spending in the previous year. This is illustrated in the discretionary spending limits shown in Table 1-1 for the most recent available fiscal year (FY2017). For the current fiscal year, we expect the discretionary spending limits (without OCO adjustments) to be somewhat higher. This is based on spending levels actually enacted through two appropriations acts and on spending levels contained within proposed appropriations bills. Since the BCA was enacted, two new categories of war-related OCO spending have been added to the original categories authorized to be designated as OCO.  To date, three different sources of OCO spending have been enacted or designated as OCO. We have two new categories to add to the summary tables. The first new category is for operations in Afghanistan for the Department of Defense. A second new category is for the Department of Transportation's obligations for the Airport Improvement Program. See Table 1-2 for more information about OCO. Emergency Spending Emergency spending is permitted as an adjustment to the discretionary spending limits. While the statute defines emergency spending in terms of the emergency appropriations act, which is different for each fiscal year, for comparison we treat emergency spending as spending that is enacted with only a \"deemed\" emergency designation. Enactment of either of the two types of emergency appropriations acts for a year will trigger an adjustment to the discretionary spending limits. An adjustment to the discretionary spending limits is not triggered if non-emergency supplemental appropriations are enacted for that year, even if the measure includes the provisions of the BCA for continuing appropriations. The term \"non-emergency\" is defined by the BCA as not including any supplemental appropriations act for a year enacted in addition to the budget for that year. We have four new categories to add to the summary tables. Two categories are for emergency supplemental appropriations enacted by Congress. The categories are designated as \"emergency spending for fiscal year x\" for fiscal year x and \"emergency spending for fiscal year y-1\" for the preceding fiscal year (fiscal year y-1), where x is a value from 0\u00e2\u0080\u00939 and y is the fiscal year encompassing months 10\u00e2\u0080\u009320. We also have two new categories for emergency supplemental appropriations enacted during recesses. The categories are designated as \"emergency spending for fiscal year X\" where X is a value from 0\u00e2\u0080\u00939 and \"emergency spending for fiscal year T,\" where T is the current fiscal year.", "Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. Historically, Medicaid eligibility has been limited to certain low-income groups, such as children, pregnant women, and their infants, people with disabilities, and parents with dependent children. Since 2014, states have been permitted to cover low-income adults with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty line (FPL) through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended). Medicaid is a countercyclical program\u2014that is, it is designed to ramp up state Medicaid spending during lean economic times, when other sources of funding are tight. In 2001, during a recession, Congress authorized three temporary increases to the federal Medicaid matching rate to offset increased Medicaid expenditures due to the economic downturn. In addition, states were allowed to receive additional federal Medicaid funds for their enhanced prescription drug benefit (the Medicare Part D benefit) under the ACA. Each state has its own formula that determines its individual FMAP rate. The statutory FMAP rates are designed to provide lower reimbursements for states with strong economies and higher rates for states with weak economies. The FMAP rate is a critical factor affecting the ability of individual states to finance their Medicaid programs. This report provides an overview of the formula used to calculate changes in the FMAP, reviews the history of the program, and analyzes the three FMAP increases enacted to offset the economic downturn. In the first paragraph below, the term \"States\" refers to states, the District of Columbia, and territories with FMAPs. (The District of Columbia and the territories are lumped together in the statutory formula.) When states have an FMAP that is higher than 50.00%, the federal government will provide the difference, and the states with lower FMAPs are the net gainers. As mentioned earlier, the FMAP is determined on a per capita basis, where the population is determined by the most recent decennial census or current (count as of July 1 of the current FY) population estimates. 1 Table 1 provides information on the average FMAP rates and average federal Medicaid expenditures for the States for FY2017. The following table shows the median FMAP rates and median federal Medicaid expenditures for the States:  TABLE 1: Medicaid FMAP Rates and Medicaid Expenditures from FY2009 to FY2017 (Table 1. Represents dollar amounts rounded to the nearest million.) FY Medicaid FMAP Rate State Medicaid Expenditures States' Portion Feds' Portion Medicaid Funding from the States (Feds' Portion) $119,933,445,000 The U.S. Treasury's Daily T-Bill rate, published as the \"Appropriate Per Capita Amount,\" is used to determine the adjusted FMAP rate. The adjusted FMAP rate is used to calculate federal reimbursements to the states. The appropriated portion of the federal government's FMAP rate is the rate the federal government will apply to each individual state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal budget (i.e., annual spending plans), which are referred to as state Medicaid plans. 2 TABLE 2: Medicaid FMAP Rates and Medicaid Expenditures from FY2013 to FY2017 (Table 2.

Within the federal government, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) consumes more energy than any other agency. In FY2017, DOD consumed 707.9 trillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy\u2014roughly 16 times that of the second largest consumer in the federal government, the U.S. Postal Service ( Figure 1 ). In FY2017, DOD spent approximately $11.9 billion on energy, roughly 76% of the entire federal government\u2019s energy expenditures, and roughly 2% of DOD\u2019s FY2017 budget.  Energy efficiency\u2014providing the same or an improved level of service with less energy\u2014over time can lead to a reduction in agency expenses. DOD uses energy for a variety of purposes across the services. The services include: Army, Air Force, Navy/Marine Corps, Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Defense Logistics Agency, and the Defense Security Service. For example, DOD\u2019s efficient management of energy can also lead to less refueling and fewer fuel convoys. Reducing the frequency and duration of fueling in combat zones could reduce exposure and risk which could save lives.  3 This report provides an introduction to federal energy management rules applicable to DOD. The report includes an overview of federal statutes and executive orders that govern DOD energy management, and presents data on the status and trends for DOD\u2019s energy use. Finally, this report identifies selected considerations for Congress.  Federal energy management requirements include reductions in fossil fuel consumption, increases in renewable energy use, and energy efficiency targets for government procurement.  The first federal legislation aimed at reducing energy use by all federal agencies was the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163).  In 1977, Congress passed into law an act amending EPCA and authorizing alternative financing for federal energy projects, 712 41 696-1560:1:991 1 1 396-1540:1:992 This report is available on the CRS website, at: crs.loc.gov, under the topic name, \u201cEnergy Use by the U.S. Department of Defense.\u201d    5 3 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a75361, among other things.  Since the enactment of EPCA, two laws have contained provisions that set energy management targets for the federal government, among other matters. Section 527 of EISA established a reporting requirement for annual agency energy management improvement and performance targets, among others (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a717143). Section 141 of EPCA provides for the annual reporting of agencies\u2019 use of alternative energy technologies (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a717014).   4 5 FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT BACKGROUND  FIGURE 1: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ENERGY CONSUMPTION By 28 41 632-9635:1:993 As shown in Figure 1, DOD spent almost $12.1 billion on energy in 2017.  Although DOD\u2019s energy consumption has declined since FY2004, as noted in Table 2, DOD\u2019s energy use is approximately 1 MW per square foot of floorspace used, in comparison to other federal agencies, which generally use approximately 0.4 MW per square foot of floorspace used. This means that DOD, on average, uses approximately half again as much energy per square foot of floorspace used. This likely relates to the fact that DOD maintains bases and ships overseas abroad U.S. military installations worldwide, in comparison to federal agencies who typically maintain their buildings within the United States.

This helps Members to weigh the legislation's merits and to consider whether it complies with the budgetary rules that Congress has created for itself. The Congressional Budget Act (CBA) requires that CBO prepare cost estimates for all bills reported from committee, \"to the extent practicable,\" and that CBO include in its estimates the way in which the proposal would change spending and revenue levels in the baseline. When CBO conducts scoring, it adheres to scorekeeping guidelines, which are \"specific rules for determining the budgetary effects of legislation.\" These general scorekeeping guidelines include general principles, such as that the spending and revenue effects of legislation should be based on current law.\n* When scoring legislation, CBO is also guided by what has come to be called the \"two-house rule,\" which requires that CBO, on behalf of the House Budget Committee, provide an estimate of the budgetary effects of legislation on the Senate floor. The two-house rule is designed to ensure that the House and Senate have the same information available when conducting their budgetary work.\n* CBO's estimates of spending and revenue effects are the official estimates, and are used for numerous purposes. For example, CBO's estimates are required under the Congressional Budget Act (CBA) to be included in the score for most bills considered by the full House and Senate. They are also used in the process of designating legislation as \"conforming\" or \"nonconforming\" under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Finally, they are often referred to by CBO's clients as well as members of the public when discussing fiscal issues.\n* CBO estimates the budgetary effects of all bills that are reported by Senate and House committees or approved by the full Senate or House of Representatives. CBO estimates the costs of legislation based on four principles: that all estimates must be presented on a cash basis, that all estimates follow current law and do not include the effects of proposed legislation, that CBO's estimates include the effects of proposed legislation unless it is clearly unintended or the legislation would have a negligible impact, and that CBO's estimates include all direct and indirect costs attributable to the legislation. In addition to providing estimates based on the CBA's requirements, CBO also produces supplemental information on the budgetary effects of policies included in legislation for its clients, including the House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office itself. As noted above, CBO also prepares estimates of the budgetary effects of non-legislative actions for its scorekeeping clients.\n* In the second half of 2017, CBO produced estimates of the 10-year budgetary effects of H.R. 1, an act cited as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That legislation would reduce federal revenues by $1.456 trillion over the current and 10-year budget window. CBO also found that the proposal would modestly worsen the federal budgetary situation in three of the four scenarios that it simulated and projected.\n* To estimate the budgetary effects of this legislation, CBO estimated the effects from the reduction in revenues combined with a list of policy initiatives provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The estimated increase in economic output, known as the \"dynamic\" effects of the changes, was based on JCT's estimates, which also indicated that economic growth would remain constant for the decade. CBO scored the proposal as increasing federal budget deficits by $1.351 trillion over the 2018\u00e2\u0080\u00932027 period, as well as by 0.04 percent of GDP (as measured by the gross domestic product) in 2027. CBO also analyzed the distributional effects of the proposal and the composition of the proposed business tax cut compared to current tax cuts.\n* CBO has also released cost estimates for H.R. 1628, the \"American Health Care Act of 2017,\" which would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148) and dismantle most of its insurance subsidies and funding provisions while reducing taxes to offset the cost of repeal. CBO found that this 2017 repeal-and-replace legislation would reduce the deficit by $119", "The House and Senate often pass different versions of the same bill. In this situation, the process of reconciling differences among bills requires the cooperation of both houses as well as the participation of their respective leaders. A conference committee, comprised of members of both houses, is usually the method by which a joint, final version of the bill is worked out. To reconcile differences, the conference committee must first find the provisions that are in each of the bills. The conference committee members then must determine what constitutes an agreed-upon, final version of the bill. As long as the conference committee members agree, they do not have to obtain authorization from their respective houses before proposing that final text. If any provision of the text is opposed by a member of either house, the conference report cannot be submitted for both houses to concur. This is true for provisions that were included in the final version of the bill as well as those provisions in the report that are based on the text in either of the initial bills.  LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After watching this lesson, you should be able to answer the following: 1.Explain the process by which the House and Senate resolve differences when two different versions of the same bill are sent to each of their respective houses.\n  A bill (S.123) has been introduced in the Senate. The Senate voted to pass it by Rollcall #919, with one of the senators voting present because he wanted to take the opportunity to state on the floor that he objects to the bill. The vote was a yea and nay vote, with each yea on the record. Senator John Smith gave a speech in which he objected to the bill. Afterwards, he said the following on the record: \"Senator, it is customary for me to make my objection to a bill on the record. But when it comes to a yes or a no vote, I would like to vote no.\"\n  a. Would his vote change? b. Would his statement change the roll call record from yeas and nays?\n  A motion has been pending on the Senate floor for an hour. It needs only a 60% vote to pass when 5% of the members vote for passing a bill. Some senators are still voting to pass the motion and will continue to do so for the next 2 hours. Senator James Brown says the following on the record: \"Senator, I do not think you should count my vote.\" A roll call vote then passes the motion 10-5. Was the roll call valid?  Aye, aye, aye, nay, nay, nay.\" On the same page of the journal, an entry appears that reads \"Floor vote to amend bill (S. 432) by adoption was 5-3.\" Does the use of \"adoption\" imply approval?  A bill is being considered on the Senate floor and it has passed the second reading. A motion is made by a member of the committee that reported the bill to adopt the third reading calendar and to proceed to the third reading of the bill. The chair of the committee having jurisdiction over the report of the committee that reported the bill votes against the motion. Does the yea vote of the chair count toward the vote?\n  The Senate is considering a bill to be divided into two parts. The bill has been passed by a roll call and the result is the following. Yeas 7, Nays 60, Present 1. Senator Smith is a member of the committee that reported the bill. Senator John Davis is a member of a committeethat reported a different bill. The Senate has debated two different bills, one of which is being voted on today. On the floor, each Senator speaks for the two bills and for each, a vote is taken on whether to adopt the third reading calendar. When the votes are counted, it appears that the vote to proceed with the third reading of one bill has passed. All of the ayes and nays come from senators who belong to the committees that reported those two bills.\n  What is the legal problem?  \"I have read the bill that just passed on a yea and nay vote, and I object to it. That objection is entered in the record.\"\n  a. What was the process to pass this bill?", "The OASDI program's ability to meet scheduled benefit payments rests upon sufficient revenues from payroll taxes, taxation on Social Security benefits, and interest earned on trust funds assets. However, demographic trends project these income streams insufficient to meet growing program costs and to maintain solvency. The OASDI program is projected to continue to use Social Security trust fund reserves until 2035, at which time the program will have insufficient income to afford full benefits. Trust fund reserves will have been depleted and the program will be forced to rely solely on income from payroll taxes and taxation on Social Security benefits to pay full benefits. These taxes are projected to be insufficient and OASDI benefits to beneficiaries will gradually decline.\nYou must remember that the trust funds' assets are invested in government securities, and if the U.S. dollar becomes worthless, the federal government will have the full burden of paying the promised benefits.\nThere is not one sentence, not one phrase, not one word on the federal reserve and its role in perpetuating monetary and fiscal manipulations that will soon lead to the same level of social and economic dysfunction experienced by the Weimar Republic.\n\"Economic policy needs to be in keeping with long-term trends in demographics and technology, and not over-react to changes in the business cycle.\"\nBut all the government ever does is over-react to changes in the business cycle. It is only \"a crisis\" and some \"magic\" program when the politicians need the political hedge. It doesn't occur to them that we're always in crisis now, given the enormity of the government deficit.\nThere is no doubt that the social security taxes and other federal taxes will be raised to \"save them as a pension\". There is no doubt that the \"trust fund\" monies will be spent now and not saved to be spent in the future.\nSo the social security trust fund only exists in \"faith\" or \"trust\".\nThe government needs more than the 50,000,000 unfunded social security liability to the government.\nNow we are going to have to find more money in the \"trust fund\" to add to the 50,000,000 unfunded social security liability.\nThis has to go to the government the minute a person files for benefits.\nWhen a person files for social security and the funds are taken out of the \"trust fund\" a liability is made to that person.\nWhen there is a 50,000,000 unfunded liability the government needs an \"accounting\" of the funds in the \"trust fund\" that is in existence.\nWhen there is an accounting of the \"trust fund\" the funds are no longer in the \"trust fund\" but rather taxes that are due to the government.\nWhen there is an \"accounting\" of the \"trust fund\" the government needs an accounting for how the funds are allocated within the government.\nWhen there is an \"accounting\" of the government it is easier to find out if there is waste within the government.\nIf there is waste within the government it is easy to stop the waste with the accounting.\nIf there is an accounting for the trust funds within the trust that are within the government the \"trustees\" will make the accounting workable for the trust.\nIf the accounting is not feasible or efficient the accounting will not be implemented.\nBut when there is a federal reserve \"accounting\" the government will never find out if the federal reserve is a trust or is a bank or is a \"trustee\" of the trust.\nThis is the issue of the social security trust funds or government funds.\nIn the end the social security trust fund can only function for two reasons.\nThe \"trust fund\" cannot stand the test of an \"accounting\".\nIt has \"faith\" or \"trust\" in the \"trust fund\".\nThis trust relationship is at stake now and the government is not doing \"whatever it takes\" to keep the trust relationship going, even though the government is doing \"whatever it takes\" to keep the \"trust fund\" going (by raising taxes).\n\"It is in the interest of the beneficiary for the beneficiary to have an accounting of the trust fund.\"\nI am asking the following government employees to answer the following issue.\nWho is the accountant/custodian of the \"trust fund\" within the \"trust\"?\nThe trustee is the \"custodian\" of", "THE CURRENT INDIA\u00e2\u0080\"PAKISTAN STATE OF AFFAIRS\u00c2\u00a0 75 The Current India\u00e2\u0080\"Pakistan State of Affairs  environment. But the Indian government has yet to take any substantial measures to alleviate the economic and political suffering of locals who were directly affected by both the August 5, 2019 moves and associated security measures. The United States, other Western nations, and the United Nations have publicly urged respect for human rights and restraint among both Indian authorities in J&K and Pakistani forces\u00e2\u0080\"not to mention the local civilian population. As the Modi government's moves became clearer and stronger, Pakistan increasingly expressed its own concerns with the situation, and began to retaliate\u00e2\u0080\"mostly by imposing restrictions on Indian traffic in its territory. U.S.-India-Pakistan relations have been affected by these developments, complicating the task faced by U.S. embassies in all three countries. Kashmiri protests against Indian rule have been a factor on both sides of the border for decades. The dispute over control of historic Kashmir has long featured as one of the most significant impediments to U.S.\u00e2\u0080\"India relations. In August 2019, President Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to meet in Kashmir and try to work out their differences. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has previously sought U.S. sponsored mediation of the Kashmir dispute. New Delhi is publicly unenthusiastic about this suggestion. Both of these leaders and their governments have reasons to believe that their countries' national security interests are in their own hands, but both know that Kashmir is a sensitive issue that cannot be neglected or left to be dealt with in isolation. Tension between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in late November to the brink of armed confrontation, after India discovered alleged Islamabad sponsored acts of \"terrorism.\" Since then, the escalatory cycle has not yet ended, despite Indian actions to end it. For example, on December 27, 2019, an Indian jet destroyed the compound of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad in the town of Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan responded by sending its own jet, which dropped a payload in Kashmir's Poonch district. India's political leadership has publicly called for immediate action to restore normalcy in the entirety of Jammu and Kashmir and to return the territory to its \"old position.\" Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, has publicly stated that Pakistan would go to the international court regarding the Kashmir dispute, and that Kashmiris would decide the final outcome. India considers such statements unacceptable from a former country that has lost more than 70% of its territory to Pakistan through a war in 1971. (India insists that a similar percentage of territory was given to China by Pakistan. Pakistan denies this.) A recent public statement by India's leadership reiterated this position. In late March 2019, New Delhi announced that it was reorganizing the territory of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian constitution that gave the territory a special status. In May 2019, Islamabad suspended bilateral trade with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in an attempt to isolate India internationally. The Indian Government moved to restore some trade, and has so far not responded to the expulsion. Throughout this period, tensions have ebbed and flowed. In the last week of September 2019, New Delhi imposed heavy restrictions on the movement of civilian and commercial traffic between Kashmir and the rest of India. On October 23, India and Pakistan engaged in airstrikes in one another's territory after Islamabad launched a terrorist attack targeting Indian military installations in the region near Kashmir. India denied Islamabad claims that a Pakistani pilot was captured. In November 2019, New Delhi moved to integrate the region into India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic system, removing the remaining restrictions on civilian and commercial traffic, and on communication by civilian individuals using cell phones. These measures further reduced the ability of the local residents of Indian-administered Kashmir to communicate with the rest of their territory, and the entire diaspora of 3 million to communicate with one another in India's Jammu and Kashmir state. Tensions began rising again shortly after that announcement in late", "The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Act was signed into law June 23, 1994. The Act was passed as a result of growing concern in the United States about Russia's nuclear activities and how to ensure it was not diverted for military purposes. The legislation established funds to be used by the DOE in support of nonproliferation programs in connection with the Russian Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1991. The legislation also authorized the DOE to undertake nuclear nonproliferation programs in South Asia, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union (FSU) including the conversion of Russia's highly enriched uranium (HEU) production facilities to low enriched uranium (LEU) production as well as the purchase, processing, and storage of weapons grade uranium from Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. During FY1995 funding was extended to include nuclear nonproliferation activities in East Asia and North Korea. In 1998 the DOE's nonproliferation program expanded to include work in South Africa. In November 2000 the President authorized up to $200 million in economic aid to Russia. Congress then authorized up to $50 million for nonproliferation programs under the DNNF Act. In addition, DOE had a $26 million contribution made to the program. Funding under the DNNF program in FY2001 was primarily used to carry out security improvement activities. Congress authorized DNNF program funding in fiscal years 1995 through 2000 under the DNFF Act. There were also several authorizations for DNNF program funding after FY2000. The funding authorizations for FY1997 through FY2008 (as amended in the Senate) were: FY1997, $61 million FY1998, $55 million FY1999, $40 million FY2000, $295.6 million FY2001, $60.5 million FY2002, $100 million FY2003, $50 million FY2004, $182 million FY2005, $128.75 million FY2006, $39.9 million FY2007, $70 million FY2008, $70 million A total of $1.11088 billion has been appropriated under the DNNF program since FY1995 (see Table 1). From FY2000 through FY2008 (as amended in the Senate) DNNF program funding totaled $1.12355 billion. In 2008 Congress appropriated just under $1.156 billion for the DNNF program. For FY2009 authorized funding was $199.5 million and requested funding was $247.5 million. See Table 1. FUNDING: The FY2010 appropriation was authorized as $225 million under P.L. 111-85, the FY2010 Continuing Appropriations Act. In addition, $202.957 million was requested under the Department of Energy and Related Agencies Appropriations and FY2010 Supplemental Report. Total funding (in thousands) was adjusted to $427.957. Funding in enacted appropriations for each fiscal year is shown in Table 1. See the FY2011 section on Congressional Material for the current FY2011 DOE Appropriations bill.", "(A-07-09)\nThe most common tax provision used to promote investment in the United States is the investment tax credit. Congress has renewed the investment tax credit through tax extenders legislation during several recent tax-reform debates. One criticism of using a temporary tax policy to spur investment is the perceived additional cost to taxpayers. This paper examines the effective and cost of five renewable depreciation tax provisions. It shows that an extension of the investment tax credit for wind energy and the depreciation tax and the advanced nuclear power facility credit and the extension can be done with minimal impact on the budget. Including the extension of a number of other tax provisions currently up for debate will have a minimal impact on the deficit.\nInvestment tax credits are the most common federal tax policy used to encourage domestic infrastructure investment. A tax credit reduces taxable income; a tax deduction reduces taxable income. Both of these are subtracted from taxable income. A tax credit reduces an entity's federal tax bill. Tax credits and tax deductions, including cost recovery, are effective methods to achieve a government objective, encouraging infrastructure investment, without repercussions on the deficit.\nThe 1993 tax reform removed most depreciation tax benefits but included an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for new facilities and energy production that provided a 10 percent tax credit for investment in U.S. facilities and a 1.5 percent benefit for taxpayers renewable energies. The energy ITCs were temporary and were extended for short periods: the 1/1.5 percent energy tax bonus applied through each year 2012, before expiring; the 10 percent ITC on new facilities expires in 2018.\nInvestment tax credits are one of the only effective tax policies Congress has available\nto encourage domestic private investment in equipment-based manufacturing. In contrast,\nindividual tax credits for homeowners have been consistently extended, and tax and\nfinancial subsidies for fossil fuels have been available since 1967, when the Mineral\nLevies Act was enacted.\nCritics of investment tax credits argue that they increase business expenses. In contrast, the critics of wind tax credits argue that they increase electricity bills paid by ratepayers. The wind tax credit (PTC) for each kWh and the production tax credit (PTC) for each kilowatt-hour produced are used to calculate a wind's projected net energy production or electricity. The production tax credit is determined based on a wind project's efficiency rating or size. The total production tax credit payable is 2.3 cents per kWh, equal to the value of the energy credit that electric utilities pay to large commercial wind projects; this is separate from the wind project tax credit paid to smaller, residential projects. The projected production of the wind project is converted to energy and multiplied by 1.3 cents per kWh to determine the wind production tax credit.\nBoth the wind PTC and the energy credit are subtracted from the total cost (projected net cost) of the electricity from a wind project. In the case of fossil, or old-energy based power plants, subsidies paid by the federal government are often not subtracted from the cost of the production. Wind subsidies can be higher because wind is more expensive.\nThe wind energy tax credits have not been found to be the cause of increased bills to ratepayers. Instead, the credit has been found to be effective in promoting American's manufacturing base and lowering business costs. In 2015 the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found that, without investment tax credits, solar, wind, and geothermal projects would not have been profitable (IRENA 2015:21.5). They estimated that investment tax credits were sufficient to increase solar investments by 22.5 percent, investment tax credits raised wind investments by 18.7 percent, and\ninvestment tax credits spurred geothermal investments by 33.3 percent. Without investment tax\ncredits, the U.S. would have lost the opportunity to capture $3.6 billion in international contracts. The production tax credits account for the bulk of fossil, or old fuel, subsidies paid in the United States. However, without taxpayer money, the fossil industry would lose a significant portion of its market share. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA)", "The electric car was first created in the early 1800s as a simple electrified buggy. It was considered to be quiet, easy to drive, and did not emit exhaust like its gasoline- and steam-powered counterparts. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, by the early 1900's, the electric car had enjoyed a brief popularity, accounting for one-third of cars on the road. Growing concerns in the late 20th century over the environmental impact of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas and other emissions sparked renewed interest in electric vehicles. Electric vehicles may support ongoing efforts to address these concerns through reducing petroleum consumption in transportation.\nIn 2012 the first contemporary hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) debuted on the global market, the Toyota Prius, while General Motors released (and terminated) the first contemporary all-electric vehicle (AEV), the EV-1. Many of these EVs were made possible by U.S. Department of Energy support for research and development of EV technology, in particular battery technology, as well as U.S. department of Energy-sponsored loans made available to EV automakers. More manufactures followed contributing models to a growing electric vehicle market. Between 2010 and 2018, EV sales increased from 275,000 to 705,000, making up 4.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales.\nThe increasing interest in electric vehicles has resulted in varying levels of support over the years, both from policymakers and the general public. In particular, the recent introduction of tax credits and increased access to charging networks for electric vehicles has helped to fuel consumer demand. In March 2009, President Obama announced a goal to have 1 million plug-in hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015. Despite these efforts, sales of plug-in electric vehicles in early 2011 accounted for only 1.7% of the 53 million vehicles on the road; however, according to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, 15.4 million plug-in electric vehicles were registered in 2018 and accounted for 3.7% of total vehicles registered in the United States that year. As new electric vehicles and charging options are introduced, as well as incentives and penalties for the use of hybrid and plug-in vehicles, their market share may increase or decrease, respectively.\nAccording to a 2015-2016 survey of automakers, hybrid vehicle sales have increased due to fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles established in July 2011 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. The 2016 CAFE/GHG Final Rule includes standards for MY 2022-2025 and is estimated to increase average fuel economy standards in new cars and trucks from 34.1 mpg in MY 2021 to 54.5 mpg in MY 2025. Consumers have shown increased interest in hybrid as well as electric automobiles since the implementation of the CAFE/GHG Final Rule.\nSource: Congressional Research Service.

The report concludes with recommendations for reform. TEXT: As of January 2012, 43 standing committees of the House of Representatives exercise jurisdiction over specific policy areas. 1 There is no limit on the number of committees that can share jurisdiction over the same subject area and this authority has been increasingly asserted by House committees over the past 20 years. 2 Historically, jurisdiction over a particular subject area in the House has been established under House Rule X and maintained over time. However, jurisdiction has been frequently disputed and committees outside the primary jurisdiction often report bills or provide amendments for bills that fall within a committee's jurisdiction. In some cases, House Rules state that certain matters should be referred to certain committees, e.g., resolutions to adjust the salaries of Members are referred to the Rules Committee. In all cases, the Rules Committee has oversight of any proposed Member-sponsored adjustments. On occasion, however, Members introduce legislation not within the committee's jurisdiction and the bill is referred to the Rules Committee to determine the appropriate committee or committees for further consideration. A 2007 General Accounting Office (GAO) report, \"Multiple Referral Increases Congressional Staff Workload and Impedes Bipartisanship,\" found that legislation with multiple committees of referral was reported to the full House by multiple committees approximately 10-12 times annually, or approximately one in every 25 bills reported to the House.3 The 111th Congress saw the most referral of legislation to multiple standing committees in over 30 years, with up to 64 referral bills introduced.4 The number of measures reported by multiple committees has generally decreased since the early 1980s, in part due to the recent adoption of new procedures to simplify the bicameral budget process. Under these procedures, legislation dealing with the budget is usually referred to a single committee, currently the House Budget Committee. This has the effect of greatly reducing the number of pieces of legislation passed out of the House with a multiple referral. 1 The table lists House committees with standing jurisdictions based on the jurisdictional statements in the Rules of the House for the 113th Congress and is current as of January 2012. 2 The number of congressional committee reports with a primary jurisdiction has dropped from approximately 80% of bills reported in the 1994-1995 Congress to 70% in the 1996-1997 Congress, and down to 65% in the 104th Congress (1997-1999) and 60% in the 108th Congress (2004-2005).

Once the practitioner has qualified, he or she can then apply for a waiver, which may be approved for up to seven years. A practitioner can obtain only one DATA 2000 waiver in a lifetime.  In FY2016, there were 14,038 active DATA waiver physicians and certified nurse practitioners. Of these, 11,562 were prescribing buprenorphine to over 727,000 patients. In FY2016, approximately 15% of active DATA waiver prescribers had the only active waiver in their state; on average, a prescriber saw 93 patients, and had at least one registered patient receiving naloxone. In FY2016, the estimated number of naloxone doses was 1017 opioid overdose reversal doses per patient receiving treatment. Prescriber volume and patient volume are presented in the accompanying figure; patient and prescriber characteristics are summarized in the accompanying table. Approximately 290,000 patients, or about a third (32%) of all DATA patients, were receiving treatment from an OTP.

In 2017, an estimated 2 million people in the United States struggled with a substance use disorder (SUD). In addition, an estimated 652,000 people met clinical criteria for substance addiction. Of those who met clinical criteria for addiction, a majority (an estimated 60.8%) were addicted to at least one substance: alcohol (53.1%), cocaine (16.6%), nicotine (13.2%), cannabis (5.4%), and other drugs or polysubstance use (1.8%). An estimated 1.4 million people in need of SUD treatment and 186,000 people in need of addiction treatment were not provided treatment or even made aware that treatment was available. 27 States currently have laws permitting PCPs to prescribe naloxone. In October 2018 (the most recent data available), PCPs could prescribe buprenorphine in 49 States; only Connecticut prohibits PCPs from prescribing buprenorphine. Of patients in need of treatment for an SUD, 406,000 people received treatment for prescription opioid abuse, 440,000 people received treatment for cannabis abuse, 385,000 people received treatment for nicotine cessation, and 545,000 people received treatment for alcohol abuse.

CRS has produced a series of reports that identify these programs and services, provides their spending amounts and recent spending trends. This current report provides an interim update of the federal spending for programs and activities identified in CRS Report R44574, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Overview of Spending Trends, FY2008-FY2015, which extends the spending analysis through FY2019. In FY2019, the federal government spent $922.1 billion on benefits and services for people with low-income. This was an increase of 2.17 compared to FY2018. Table 1 shows federal spending for the programs by category for FY2018. Since FY2013, the categories are sorted the same as FY2019. The next largest category in FY2019 is cash aid (exclusive of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)). Figure 2 shows total federal spending on benefits and services for people with low-income as of FY2019, in terms of health and non-health programs. The early portion of the trend (FY2008-FY2011) shows an increase, primarily due to ARRA spending for unemployment and Medicaid. The other category of programs in Figure 2 (exclusive of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) shows declining federal spending since FY2012. Figure 1 shows federal spending on benefits and services for people with low-income by program category and also by total benefit amount of expenditures. Table 2 shows federal spending on benefits and services for people with low-income by benefit category and by spending trend type. Figure 3 includes the largest programs that provided people with low-income, benefits and services. Table 1 shows federal spending for the programs by category for FY2019. Spending for the programs in Table 1 and the other programs shown in Figure 1 is compared to overall federal spending on benefits and services for people with low-income. Overall spending on benefits and services for people with low-income as of FY2019 was $1.018 trillion. The figure shows that three categories of expenditures (for SNAP, health programs and other programs) account for 93.4% of total spending on benefits and services for people with low-income. The figure does not reflect spending on programs that do not target low-income individuals and families or low-income benefits and services that fall outside of the eight low-income categories in this report.

Over the past decade, unauthorized migration flows across the Southwest border of the United States have changed considerably. Instead of being dominated by adult males, they are increasingly characterized by migrants traveling as families.\nTEXT: Instead of being dominated by adult males, they are increasingly characterized by migrants traveling as families. For the unauthorized migrants apprehended today, a significant number of them are traveling as family units. Moreover, the share of family units making up the total unauthorized-migrant flow has steadily increased over the past decade, from nearly a fourth (24%) in FY2011 to well over a third (36%) in FY2018 (see Figure 1).\nTEXTR: This graph shows that family units have been the leading category of apprehensions into 2019. For example, in February 2019, family units accounted for 57% of all apprehensions at the Southwest border. In January 2019, family units accounted for more than 80% of the total. In addition to a significant increase in family unit migrants, the demographic profile of family unit populations also has changed considerably in recent years. Whereas in the past families were often composed of men and women of child-bearing age (15 to 44 years old), they are more frequently composed of parents with children younger than 5 years old. For example, in FY2018, adults ages 15 to 44 accounted for 26% of female family units apprehended. Children younger than 5 accounted for 17% of male family units apprehended.\nTEXT: Figure 1 also shows that unauthorized migrants from Central America have become increasingly important contributors to the unauthorized (or otherwise unlawful) migration across the Southwest border. Whereas in FY2011, nationals of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras accounted for a little under a third of all apprehensions, by 2017 they accounted for more than half (see Table 1).

For example, from FY2011 to FY2018, the percent of apprehension of Central American migrants increased from 13% to 58%, respectively.\nTEXT: Whereas Central American apprehensions have seen a significant increase, apprehensions in other regions have seen a corresponding decrease. Whereas apprehensions from Mexico, the Caribbean, and South Asia combined (plus others) accounted for more than two-thirds of total apprehensions in both FY2011 and FY2018, the share of such apprehensions has halved from a little more than 68% in FY 2011 to a little under 33% in FY2018 (see Table 2).

Additionally, challenges remain in several other countries in the region, raising questions about the durability of some of the political reforms undertaken in past decades.\nAlthough corruption has declined in much of Latin America over the past two decades, several government scandals led to the ouster of several presidents or heads of state. Corruption was a factor in the ousters of Guatemalan President Otto P\u00c3\u00a9rez on September 20, 2015, and in the recent resignation of Peruvian President Martin V\u00c3\u00a1zquez in November 2019. In 2019, corruption accusations played a role in the suspension of Costa Rican Vice President Rodolfo Piza in April 2019 and the resignation of Panamanian Finance Minister Ignacio S\u00c3\u00a1nchez in June 2019.\n(See Table 2 for a map and chart of GDPs of Latin America/Caribbean countries since 2009.) While the region's combined 6.8 percent GDP in 2019 was a decrease from 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 0.8 percent gain, 2019 was an improvement over 2016 and 2017, when growth in some countries was negative. Some countries made progress despite lower commodity prices, which contributed to negative growth rates in 2015 through 2017. Despite these setbacks, 2019 was a record year for foreign direct investment in the region. Investors spent USD 192 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 26 percent increase over 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 151 billion in investment.

For 2019, the region-wide unemployment figure was down 0.2 points from 2018. Despite regional economic stagnation, unemployment remains around 6 percent overall, roughly on par with the United States. For the region as a whole, employment grew by 1.2 percent from 2018 to 2019, reflecting sustained growth in several countries in the Caribbean and Mexico, and a modest rebound in employment in Brazil.\n(See Table 4 for a map and chart of inflation in Latin America/Caribbean countries in recent years.) In March 2019, overall inflation in the region dipped from 2.8 percent in 2018 to 2.5 percent in 2019. Inflation rose throughout 2017, hitting a high in January 2018 at 2.8 percent (the highest level since 2013 in many countries in the region) before dipping to 2.6 percent in November 2018. The slight rise in 2019 was largely due to increases in inflation in Colombia and Mexico. Although it has trended lower since 2013, hyperinflation remains a problem in certain countries, most notably Venezuela, where inflation is expected to surpass 10 million percent in 2019.", "The digital divide\u2014a gap between those who use or have access to telecommunications and information technology and those who do not\u2014affects every region of the United States. Since the internet became publicly available in the 1990s, an increasing amount of information that individuals access for work, school, and entertainment is digital and hosted online. Members of Congress have expressed continuing interest in ensuring that their constituents have access to broadband internet, and in the 116 th Congress, they have introduced legislation (see the Appendix to this report) and held hearings on opportunities to expand broadband deployment and close the digital divide. Although Congress has provided federal funding for multiple broadband infrastructure initiatives, the gap between those who can access broadband and those who do not still persists. Ensuring access to broadband is not the only barrier to closing the digital divide. Other challenges include increasing the adoption of broadband (where it is available) and training for digital literacy. According to the National Digital Inclusion Alliance: We do need to address the lack of broadband infrastructure in rural areas. It is a serious problem. But, it is just one barrier to individuals and communities being able to fully participate in society today. The other common barriers, no matter where one lives, are the costs of internet service and devices, plus digital literacy skills. Simply equating \"the digital divide\" with just one of these barriers increases the division in our country. States are playing a crucial role in efforts to expand broadband access, encouraging broadband investment, and helping to bring more of their residents online. Each state approaches broadband expansion differently. For years, this report has reviewed how various states use state and federal broadband funding and policies to address their particular broadband circumstances. However, many of the states face challenges beyond just the technology itself, including a relatively high cost of doing business, a rural population or topography, or low incomes that may limit adoption of broadband, or a lack of digital skills that may hinder further use of the expanded technology. This report highlights examples of statewide initiatives and programs from several recent state annual reports to illustrate efforts targeted at those challenges. In the following discussion, we include a state-by-state analysis of state initiatives highlighted in this report and compare them to initiatives highlighted in our previous reports published from 2010 2018. We also describe initiatives that may represent novel approaches to overcoming broadband adoption barriers that should be considered by other states. Broadband programs initiated in several states are examined, including programs supported by state broadband initiative grants, state universal service funds, public-private partnerships and industry initiatives, and state and local funding. State legislative initiatives are described, along with state E-rate support for broadband service and public computer centers. Digital inclusion programs for training and digital literacy are highlighted, along with state initiatives to address the homework gap, where students cannot access the internet at home. In particular, this report focuses on how states encourage digital skills and use of online courseware. Finally, digital inclusion programs for the disabled are examined, looking at strategies for improving the delivery of services through digital means. Tables and figures illustrate the state activities examined.", "T eh Supreme Court term that began on October 1, 2018, was a term of transition, with the Court issuing a number of rulings that, in some cases, signaled broader transformation in its jurisprudence. The term followed the retirement of Justice Kennedy, who has been an important vote on the Court for much of his 30- year tenure and who had been widely viewed as the Court's median or \"Swing\" Justice. In nine out of the last 12 terms of the Roberts Court, he voted for the winning side in a case more often than any of his colleagues. Justice Brett Kavanaugh replaced Justice Kennedy one week into the October 2018 Term. The Court's newest member had served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for over a decade before his elevation to the Supreme Court. Empirical evidence suggests the Court can change with the retirement and replacement of one its members. As a result, the question looming over the October 2018 Term was how Justice Kennedy's retirement and Justice Kavanaugh's arrival would alter the Court's jurisprudence going forward. Indeed, one member of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, predicted Justice Kennedy's retirement to be \"the event of greatest consequence for the current Term, and perhaps for many Terms ahead.\" Notwithstanding the alteration in the Court's makeup, observers have generally agreed that the October 2018 Term largely did not produce broad changes to the Court's jurisprudence. . . .", "The following highlight is written by a student who excelled in A.P.

The first census to show the distribution of slaves by means of statistics, and therefore one in which the institution of slavery made its first appearance in the series of official documents commencing with 1790, was taken in 1790. For the first time in 1850 the statistics of the entire country were compiled under one supervision; prior to 1850 the census returns had been collected from the states by the federal authorities. In 1790-1830 there was but one slave state outside the \"South Atlantic\" division of states; by 1850 the number of states had increased so much through the addition of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Mississippi that only thirteen of the slave states were included in the \"South Atlantic\" division (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, the four original members of Carolina, and the five new states). As a matter of fact by 1850 about half of the states were slave states, while a little over half of the states still had no slaves. The census of 1790, the first under the United States, showed 8.07 slaves to 100 free whites. In 1790 there were no free colored classified by census, or by any other official document; on the other hand, in 1810 the \"free colored\" numbered 128,152 and were more than double of the free whites classified as white only. These people, together with the \"free colored\" classified as mulatto, quadroon, or octoroon, were the descendants of the Negro slaves imported in large numbers before 1800. The free Negroes and the free colored were of two classes, the mulatto class and the quadroon class, the mulatto being the sons of white women and black husbands, the mulatto class of free colored constituting the offspring of only white women and black husbands. The quadroon class was the sons of colored women and white husbands, or of colored women and free mulatto men. As a matter of fact they constituted the mixed race groups of free colored, and of the free Negroes as well. To further illustrate this, as the population of the whites in 1810 numbered (8,385,106) only 278,859 free colored; of the total free colored were 55,573 mulattoes, and of mulattoes were 5,720 octoroons. Now in 1790 the free colored were 1,575 with 21 per cent, of mulattoes; in 1810 the free colored number 287,446 with only 17 per cent, of mulattoes. In 1790 the white population were 5.7 per cent, higher than the percentage of the free colored free mulatto, but in 1860 the percentage of free colored classified mulatto, the free mulatto, was 22.0 of the total Negro population, and of the free colored classified as mulatto was 8.3 per cent, of the total colored population. The census of 1810 showed the states of South Carolina having 24,809 slaves and 4,730 free colored; Georgia 68,208 slaves and 35,113 free colored; Virginia 66,281 slaves and 35,997 free colored; Kentucky 18,933 slaves and 7,664 free colored ; Tennessee 51,469 slaves and 4,193 free colored; and Massachusetts 61 free colored mulattoes. In 1810 the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee had over 369,000 slaves of which over 1,000 mulattoes were in the class of free colored. The negro slaves in South Carolina were classified as free colored in 1810. On the other hand, of the colored persons classified as mulattoes, only about 21 per cent, were free mulatto; thus the free colored were 23 per cent, of the total colored population in the country, while only 2", "Federal aid to highways is provided through highway programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These programs and activities are authorized as part of multiyear surface transportation reauthorization acts. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94 ) authorized federal highway spending from FY2016 through September 30, 2020. This report examines the major highway issues Congress will likely consider during reauthorization. There are over 4 million miles of public roads in the United States, of which roughly 25% are eligible for federal aid. These eligible roads, designated federal-aid highways, include all of the nation's major roads. Federal highway funds generally cannot be spent on local roads, neighborhood streets, or minor rural collectors. The federal government provides funds to the states and territories for the building and improvement of eligible roads under the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The major characteristics of this program have been constant since the early 1920s. Most funds are apportioned to the states by formulas established in law. Under the FAST Act, roughly 93% of federal highway funds were apportioned to the states ( Figure 2 ). The remaining sums were allocated for roads on federally owned lands or Indian reservations, for congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, and for national highway freight programs. The FAST Act does not use separate formulas to determine each state's apportionment under each program. Instead, all the formula programs under the FAST Act are funded from a single annual authorization. Figure 2 charts the nationwide outcome of the distribution among the programs.

Some fields were so saturated by heavy rains that they were never planted. U.S. corn and soybean producers suffered through 2019. For the first time in USDA's 100-year history of collecting weather data, the nation's average precipitation reached all-time high, and corn prices hit a 10-year low. Because of this delay and the unplanted acres (planted acre count), USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) estimated 2019's insured crop planting and yield would be at or below its long-term average. However, many planted late, but some were never able to plant. Producers that planted late often had lower insured crop yields, which were also at or below the 10- year average. Despite the challenging season, this 2019 corn and soybean crop remains the third largest after the 2017 and 2018 crops. Corn and soybean planting was delayed until early June, but this year's corn and soybean crops still remain the third largest planted after 2017 and 2018. Due to delayed planting and a low final planting, the insured corn and soybean crop for 2019 was lower than average (Table 1). There were 6.7 million fewer corn planted acres, but more insured soybean cropland. This year's corn crop yield and acre yield is estimated by USDA as being below-average. Overall, the corn harvested was lower than average, but the soybean harvested was higher than the 10-year average. U.S. farmers produced 907.4 million bushels of corn and 4.0 billion bushels of soybeans. Both these crops represent the third-largest corn and soybean crops since the USDA began recording yield data in 1917. This year there was a 40% surge in corn acre yield, a 36% surge of soybean acre yield, and a 66% surge in soybean bushel yield (Table 4). In addition, this year's yield per acre was higher than average because farmers planted more acres with the newest technology.  USDA RMA is responsible for the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) insurance operations by collecting premiums, administering crop insurance policies, and paying indemnities when applicable. RMA pays out indemnities to insured producers in the event of non-harvestable crop losses due to adverse weather or other causes. In 2019 there were 5.1 million insured corn acres, of which 1.6 million were not harvested and not insurable. This resulted in paying the farmers who lost crop, approximately $12.6 billion. In addition, the RMA paid $26.2 billion in indemnities to the farmers not able to plant their crops in time, but still had to pay 2019's premiums ( Table 2 ).  Corn and soybean acreage production is higher than normal. USDA forecasted average corn and soybean productions in 2019, however they are higher than projected due to planting delays and insurers paying for unplanted crop. The increase of corn production was due to the farmers harvesting more insured corn acre yield (Table 5).  As a result of the low corn acre yield, the total value of the crop was only $81.65 billion, of which the government paid producers $12.6 billion in indemnity payments. The crop value is approximately 14% lower than average. In this report, I address one of the factors that lowered the crop value, lower acre yield yield. To address the 19 factors that lowered the total value is beyond the scope of this report.  TABLE 1.

In this report, CRRC staff provides background on loan forbearance, examines the reasons lenders will permit this option, and describes alternative forms of relief. Our summary is not intended to provide legal analysis of what is required of lenders under the CARES Act, but only to provide background into how loan forbearance is typically implemented and what alternatives to forbearance some lenders might offer their customers. Staff also provide information on how consumers can request loan forbearance or alternative relief under current law. Finally, we examine how the CARES Act might further ease the minds of some lenders and consumers. \nINTRODUCTION: Forbearance plans are an alternative to the use of the foreclosure process. They are contractual in nature and provide consumers with immediate, short-term relief.\nForbearance should be considered instead of foreclosure whenever appropriate and practical, but it should also be considered concurrently with foreclosure as an alternative method of bringing consumer mortgage payments current.\nThe CARES Act requires some lenders to offer consumers loan forbearance, but it may be prudent to request forbearance by working directly with a creditor. In 2019, creditors offered loan forbearance in 56% of delinquent mortgage cases. The most common terms of these forbearance programs were to temporarily reduce or suspend payments for one to six months, to temporarily suspend penalties such as late fees, and to accept late payments if payment was made by a certain date. The likelihood of forbearance being granted varied by the month of delinquency, with a lower likelihood of forbearance being offered in the past month of delinquency. This suggests many providers are offering it as a regular form of relief. This trend held steady from 2007-2019.\nConsumers should be aware, however, that they may be unable to renegotiate forbearance plans after taking the initial forbearance on their mortgage because the forbearance must be a full and complete payment of arrears that does not include the payment of future obligations to make. Lenders will deny any forbearance if they foresee risk that future payments necessary to make the mortgage current could not be made. Additionally, because delinquency fees are incurred by creditors with every monthly payment, failure to meet these obligations could result in a consumer losing their property.\nForbearance is a method of payment that provides consumers with short-term relief, and may be helpful to reduce pressure to make a large payment. However, loan forbearance is not typically considered a viable form of long-term mortgage relief because consumers generally end up even further behind in scheduled mortgage payments after the temporary forbearance plan ends and may receive a foreclosure notice just a few days later.\nIf a consumer is delinquent, it is important to contact a homeownership program specialist or attorney knowledgeable on mortgage relief to explore options.\nCONCLUSION: Under P.L. 116-136, consumers that have a loan that is not under the jurisdiction of the CFPB cannot request relief of debt under the CARES Act. The CARES Act would not permit lenders to charge late fees or penalties, but only prevent the mortgage from foreclosing. With P.L. 116-136, consumers will be eligible for forbearance or other consumer relief for consumer loans such as credit cards where they are behind on the consumer loan payment.\nUnder these acts, no lender may deny the loan application on the basis that the applicant is behind on paying some or all of their other obligations. However, some may still consider the past due payment amount higher than what they would normally pay, and the loan denial would only be due to the applicant being behind on paying some of their obligations regardless of CARES Act.\nFor consumer loans that are held by a credit union, banks, and other creditor, a consumer needs", "The United States stands atop the natural gas world in 2019 in producing, consuming, exporting, and storing, leading the way in technology and pipelines, and producing more natural gas than ever before through shale resources. The United States imports the least and exports the most of any country in the world. The United States has been the world's largest producer and consumer of natural gas since 2006 (Figure 11).\nThe United States has 51% more natural gas in storage than the second place country in the world (Figure 8).\nPenn West Petroleum Ltd, Nexen Inc.\nNatural gas is mainly a North American commodity. Nearly all domestic U.S. natural gas consumption in 2018 was in the United States (Figure 3).\nThe United States has two natural gas pipelines that deliver more gas than any other: Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line through which about 13.2 BCF/d traverses from the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi Basin region to the rest of the United States, and Transcontinental Gas Pipeline with an average daily throughput of 12.8 BCF/d transporting gas from the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi Basin region to the rest of the United States. The Keystone Pipeline in a distant third, having a capacity of 1.1 BCF/d connecting Canada to the United States. The United States uses natural gas for a variety of purposes including generating electricity, heating, cooling, and in industry processes. Electricity generation from natural gas was about 35% of all electricity generated in the United States in 2018. Natural gas generated electricity was the largest source among all generators in 2018. Natural gas heating and cooling applications were about one-third and one-quarter of all applications, respectively, of natural gas. Industry uses 4% of the electricity in the United States, about half of its share of natural gas production.\nThe United States is the world's largest natural gas producer. The United States has been the leading consumer and producer of natural gas since 1990, and the largest consumer since 1970 (Figure 10).\nThe share of U.S. natural gas production from shale resources rose from 2% to 64% since 2006. The United States has more than 20% of world natural gas exports. About 25% of the natural gas the United States consumed was imported in 2018 (Figure 10). In 2010, U.S. natural gas production exceeded the next largest five countries combined in the entire world. U.S. production peaked in 2015 but has trended downward over the past three years. Exports from 2014 through 2019 reached an average of 2,600 BCF/y (Figure 16). U.S. exports of natural gas peaked in 2018 at 3,842 bcf of natural gas. In the second half of 2018, exports dropped dramatically because of a significant increase in natural gas available for export resulting from the shale gas revolution. Natural gas exports from the United States were 35% of all gas produced in the country in 2017. In 2018, U.S. natural gas exports doubled the amount of LNG produced from the United States in 2017. LNG facilities in the United States averaged about 1.5 to 2 times daily capacity utilization in 2018.\nU.S. crude oil production in 2018 reached levels not attained since 1970 (Figure 4).\nIn 2018, oil imports were lower than at any time since 1980. The share of transportation fuel consumption attributable to trucks, buses, and planes also was lower in 2018 than ever before in the United States (Figure 7). The transportation fuel share of the oil consumed in the United States was a record 4.5% in 2018. Oil imports have decreased since 2009, and oil exports have increased since 2017 (Map 1). The United States is the world's largest oil consumer and producer. The United States produced more oil in 2018 than any other country in the world. The United States has been the world's leading oil consumer since 1980.

The spread of the disease has reduced global output by up to 0.40%, or several hundred billion dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly in the first quarter of 2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094according to estimates by the IMF, the MDBs, and the World Bank. Many economic experts do not expect recovering global economic activity to return to prepandemic levels even once the global death rate from COVID-19 begins to decrease. The IMF has estimated that global output could be reduced by roughly 1% by the end of 2020. In November 2020, a study by Goldman Sachs found that the global economy could produce up to 32% less output in 2022 than it would otherwise have produced. The global economy is projected to return to full output by 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic inflicted a severe recession upon all major economies, but China and a few other regional powers were especially hard hit. Since April, Chinese financial and banking officials have announced that China will pursue unconventional but effective monetary stimulus measures, such as making low-cost, short-term loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Chinese government has announced a new, temporary budget deficit of several hundred billion yuan to promote domestic consumption, and it has relaxed currency capital controls to make foreign purchases of Chinese goods and services less costly than domestic purchases. Chinese companies have been able to borrow cheaply on international money and equity markets. The IMF, the Asia Development Bank, the U.N. Office for Development, and other MDBs have committed up to nearly $200 billion in concessional loans for low- and middle-income member countries, to encourage regional financial support of low-income countries and bolster regional economies. In addition, the World Bank has announced $200 billion in financial loans, guarantees, equity loans, and other support for corporations and SMEs. However, some regional governments remain sceptical of the long-term utility of these support programs, and regional political and economic tension will inevitably arise between countries that can afford to borrow the most and those that can borrow least.\n3 47\nTITLE: China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the most comprehensive program of stimulus ever enacted by a single country, and there have been widespread reports of its success. Many U.S. economists are pessimistic, but many Chinese economists are optimistic that the pandemic response stimulus is likely to revitalize the Chinese economy rather than deplete China's remaining cash reserves. However, it is too early yet to assess the long-term efficacy of the 5T stimulus. Several months after initial success, the stimulus may not have as powerful an impact as the Chinese government expected, according to an October study by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Others argue that China's economic stability and high-quality infrastructure bureaucracy have resulted in the successful implementation of the 5T stimulus. However, others argue that the stimulus could prove to be ineffective, that the stimulus is not targeted towards high-value-added, high-employment jobs, and that the stimulus could be wasteful in the long term unless the Chinese government addresses economic distortions in the healthcare and finance sectors. The Chinese economic stimulus to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is divided into four major elements:  An expanded one-time tax refund of up to five months' salary in August 2020;  Government-subsidized loans for mortgages, small businesses, and SMEs;  Government-subsidized student loans for college; and  Government-subsidized purchases of goods and services produced domestically. Cumulatively, Chinese domestic demand in the first three months of 2020 appears to be up slightly. On February 19, 2020, the Government of China announced a \u00e2\u0080\u009cFive-T\u00e2\u0080\u009d (5T) Rural Infrastructure Stimulus Plan. This ambitious plan will provide up to $1.5 trillion in domestic and regional infrastructure financing to rural areas in China over the course of 5 years. Funds were first allocated to counties in the poorest 25% of national distribution of household income. Then the Chinese regional government, the Hong Kong Monetary", "(U) Regional allies and partners are strengthening their independence by increasing domestic economic and military capabilities, and enhancing their engagement with the Indo-Pacific to balance against perceived growing Chinese influence.\n(U) Many Indo-Pacific nations feel the need to hedge their commitments, in part because U.S. policymakers have questioned the value of some alliance relationships. In addition, countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region continue to develop their own economic and security capabilities to diversify the sources of prosperity as well as the security arrangements in the region \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with or without U.S. participation.\n(U) Some observers caution that the U.S.-led international system is being challenged by China's assertive behavior.\n(U) Japan's government has enhanced its defense posture with more active patrols in the South China Sea and the West Pacific, which are likely to increase tensions with Beijing and could lead to a dangerous naval collision. Seoul also appears to be enhancing its defense posture with its purchase of advanced military equipment, such as the F-35B (aka the \"Flying Dorito\"), which was built for its amphibious assault ship.\n(U) Several observers have noted how South Korea appears to view China's Belt and Road Initiative as part of a broader trend that is reducing the United States' influence in Asia and the Pacific. At the 14th Asian Security Summit (or \"ASEAN\") in 2016, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stated that \"it is only a question of time before the ASEAN community becomes a global power ... There is a possibility that ... the ASEAN community and the Chinese community will take on new responsibilities in coping with global changes ... In this regard, we support the ASEAN central role in coping with global changes and the peace and development of the regional and world community.\" Although ASEAN is one of the most diverse groupings of sovereign states in the world, having ten different official languages and an array of diverse cultures, its diverse member-states nonetheless share common values of peace, stability, and integration \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a need for economic development. ASEAN's official mission is \u00e2\u0080\u009cto accelerate regional economic growth and integration and to sustain socio-economic development toward a prosperous and peaceful community by 2027.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ASEAN has been central to ongoing discussions concerning the Belt and Road Initiative, with the Chinese government announcing that it will play a \"catalytic role for ASEAN cooperation,\" as well as a crucial role \"in fostering the building of a \"Community with One Destiny.\"\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although the Trump Administration has not yet defined its Indo-Pacific strategy, the ASEAN has nonetheless become increasingly important in defining the Indo-Pacific as a whole, and one hopes that America's commitment to the Indo-Pacific won't lose any further traction.\nThe Asia Reassurance Initiative Act is a federal statute passed in 2018 (PL 115-435) that authorizes the President to provide security and developmental assistance to countries within the Indo-Pacific region, and mandates a whole-of-government strategy to prevent the region from being overlooked or marginalized, and to increase U.S. influence in the region, as a counterweight to growing Chinese power and influence.\n(U) Despite the potential for the United States to lose its privileged position in Asia, and due to the uncertainties surrounding Trump's Administration, Congress ought to ensure that the United States maintains its leading position in the region.\n(U) However, in light of the above concerns, the Congress might wish to reaffirm: a) the need for a more coordinated policy among the various regions the Administration is targeting; b) the necessity to reexamine the Indo-Pacific strategy; and c) the need for a thorough analysis of the consequences of the United States' decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which is a multilateral trade pact including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, which was negotiated between 2005 and 2015 on the terms the United States and its 11 trade partners negotiated in 2015 and adopted in 2016. The Administration's continued pursuit of", "For the past 80 years, coal provided the United States with an abundant, affordable, and reliable source of energy. In a 1960 letter to President Eisenhower, Richard Helm of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company explained why coal supplied almost 60% of the nation's electricity. Helm wrote, \"I am convinced that the only economic way to produce large quantities of electricity is to use large steam-generating plants that use inexpensive coal as the fuel.\" But times are changing. Since 2005, low cost shale gas production has resulted in a structural shift in electricity generation, making coal energy's least competitive generation source over the past decade. In 2017, coal provided nearly 30 % of U.S. total electricity generation. Consequently, low natural gas prices have had a devastating economic impact on the U.S. coal industry and resulted in significant layoffs across the nation. Recent data show that during 2017 U.S. coal output continued its 2017 decline, accounting for less than 30% of total U.S. electricity generation. According to the latest preliminary data, 2017 was the lowest coal production year for this generation fuel in nearly 40 years. In 2017, U.S electricity generation from coal declined to its lowest volume in 39 years. Renewable energy supplies, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric, represented 18 % of total U.S. electricity production in 2017. In 2017, U.S. total capacity factors for coal and renewable energy supplies were reported to be 49.2% and 36.9%, respectively. Total electricity capacity additions for U.S. utility-scale resources in 2017 totaled 16,648 MW. Solar energy was the top total capacity addition source, and represented 37% of all 2017 utility-scale capacity additions for the U.S. Total U.S. utility-scale coal capacity additions in 2017 fell by 254 MW compared to 2016. Recent U.S. utility-scale coal electricity generation data show total coal generation fell by 5% in 2017, compared to the previous year. Furthermore, 2017 represented the second consecutive year that there was no total U.S. coal generating capacity additions, in stark contrast to the 171 MW added in 2013. Data also indicate in 2017 the U.S. coal fleet, which totals more than 300 operating plants and almost 400 million tons of annual capacity, fell below 300 million tons. Coal-fired power plants represent the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. In 2013, U.S. coal electricity generation totaled almost 300 billion pounds, which accounted for more than 80% of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.

This is the first Pew Research Center survey to ask about non-broadband options, including cable, satellite, wireless, or dial-up. When non-broadband use is taken into account, 51% of adults nationwide have broadband or non-broadband internet access at home.  The digital divide is often quantified by mapping 25/3 broadband connectivity, looking at which Americans have broadband access and which do not. When looking at only 25/3 broadband speeds, 17% of adults in urban and suburban areas in the U.S. have no access to broadband. Among rural Americans, the figure is 24%.

The summary is not summarized in this case. A few sentences from the third paragraph will be sufficient: The President issued an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. This order gave rise to a number of court cases. The court cases address whether Congress or the Executive is the superior and authorized branch. The executive order also did not account for the total money that was needed for the project, and so the government had to use other means to obtain funding for the project.\nPurpose: The main points made clear. Tone: The tone of the text does not sound too good, as if the content is to be taken seriously. For example, it mentions the construction of \"barriers\" rather than \"border walls\". Furthermore, there is no clarification on whether the government's actions were justified or not. Sounds like most of the document was taken from the original text. Some information may be misinterpreted as well. In my opinion, it can be very confusing for the reader and make him/her confused. Sources: They are provided in the summary at the bottom and also the original text mentions them. A small issue: the last sentence in the third paragraph contains some spelling mistakes, thus it lacks clarity and is not so appealing. Reason of choice of this article: The summary is quite long in my opinion; I think there is no need to summarize it paragraph-by-paragraph, since there is already a lot of information which makes it very confusing for the reader.

The act stated that cable operators could only negotiate with LFAs regarding the terms of franchise agreements. It also required LFAs and video service providers to negotiate in good faith for a franchise agreement, and established a timetable for franchise approvals. The law required the FCC to establish rules prescribing technical standards for cable systems, including minimum requirements for leased channels. The act provided that a cable system may use leased channels to originate, distribute, or otherwise provide video programming, without the need for a franchise. The act also established a schedule by which LFAs reviewed the need for continued regulation of a system on an on-going basis, but ultimately the act required all cable systems to be deregulated by December 31, 1996.\nThe act contained a provision designed to facilitate carriage of television stations on cable systems, commonly known as the must-carry requirement. The must-carry provision required that LFAs allow cable systems to carry television broadcast stations if those stations were located in the LFA's franchise jurisdiction or if the signals of the stations were provided to cable systems via a satellite relay system and if the stations qualified as local commercial television stations under the rules and regulations of the FCC. While the act required must-carry of all local commercial television stations, it allowed LFAs to waive the requirement for stations located outside of their jurisdiction.\nFurther, the act provided that satellite programming vendors must obtain the necessary rights to retransmit local television stations in markets served by a cable system, which are then delivered, via satellite, to local cable companies for retransmission to residential subscribers. In addition, the act required satellite video providers to use a satellite that was located over the contiguous United States.\nAlong with its regulations under Title VI of the act, the FCC also adopted the Basic Service Rate Policy that required the FCC to prescribe maximum prices for basic cable services. The FCC created categories for basic service packages that vary in price and channel quantity. Cable operators could not offer services such as pay-per-view or premium service options in conjunction with cable's basic service packages. If cable operators wanted to include a premium service option, it had to submit this option for approval under the pricing procedures established by the FCC.\nIn the 1990s, as cable television moved beyond the provision of basic services to the provision of higher quality specialty television services, Congress concluded that local franchise rules had become obsolete and no longer served the public interest. Lawmakers sought to remove regulatory barriers to the provision of programming via cable, and in 1996, Congress amended Title VI of the act to remove the requirement of franchising of cable systems (1996 Cable Services Act, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, 47 U.S.C. 52l(e) et seq., 1996, as amended). The 1996 Amendments repealed Section 651 and repealed and replaced Section 631. In addition, the Digital Television and Public Safety and Homeland Security Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-233, 120 Stat. 351) amended Sections 621 and 652 of the act and modified the definitions of \"equipment\" and \"operator.\" Congress established certain restrictions on the operations of cable, satellite and telecommunications companies, such as rules concerning privacy policies; unsolicited commercial messages directed to the subscriber's terminal; restrictions on commercial recordings and public copyright compliance; and a requirement that the law apply to foreign companies in addition to domestic cable, satellite, and telecommunications providers.\nCongress enacted the Cable Television Privacy and Decency Enforcement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1605), referred to in this report as the Privacy Act, to \"protect the privacy of cable television subscribers and to protect children from inappropriate programming carried on cable television.\" The Privacy Act required video programming system operators \"to restrict the channels offered to cable subscribers, to", "Financial technology (fintech) may be used to enable a variety of financial activities. Proceed to summarize the following text. Finances and technological development have been connected throughout history. Possibly, this connection is literal. The technology of writing in ancient civilizations may have advanced in order to record payments and debts. As a result, the term \u201cfinancial technology\u201d (fintech) is used to refer to a broad set of technologies involved in the provision of financial services and activities. Despite the prevalent use of this term, the actual technologies that fall under this definition are not universally accepted, and their effect on the financial system in the aggregate is not yet clear. At the same time, the use of fintech-based solutions has been rapidly increasing. Technological advances can be divided into different categories, including network technology; data analytics and visualizations; automation and artificial intelligence or intelligent processing; blockchain: distributed ledger technology; cryptocurrency: virtual currency; and, payments technology.  Financial activities that can be performed through technology-driven means are broadly referred to as financial technology solutions. Proceed to summarize the following text. Underlying technologies can be understood as broadly affecting almost all financial activities: (1) data collection, identification and analysis; (2) product development and consumer targeting; and, (3) operational functions\u2014with benefits to these categories being described as follows: (1) improving the quality of financial decisions as well as increasing the efficiency and transparency in the provision of financial products and services; (2) increased access to credit for consumers that had been considered high risk (and therefore, expensive and unprofitable to serve), as well as to small businesses operating mainly on an internet or mobile platform, enabling small businesses to engage in activities that would not have previously been cost-effective to undertake; (3) the ability to reach, track, and offer products to new classes of customers that may not have been previously accessible by financial institutions. This summary will focus on these same areas: digital payments. Network technology enables faster, real-time transactions that enable faster transactions even when users aren't online. These types of transactions are not only convenient for customers but also provide benefits to financial institutions. Data analytics and visualizations permit the analysis of patterns to determine the types of customers that are most and least likely to default on loans. This can provide a basis for determining what types of credit to extend and/or what types of pricing to adopt. Automation and artificial intelligence can perform certain actions and repetitive tasks that may otherwise have been done by human employees, resulting in significant cost savings to the provider. Blockchain: distributed ledger technology (DLT) enables a transparent and auditable database of transactions. A DLT can be thought of as a spreadsheet with an array of cells that can be locked for particular updates but can be unlocked by an appropriate key. Blockchain technology is not only used by Fintech, but also in other sectors. Cryptocurrency: virtual currency involves the transfer of value in a digital form that is not created (\u201cmined\u201d) nor controlled by a bank or central monetary authority.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.). As of May 23, 2019, 27 major disasters have been declared in calendar year 2019. In addition to these specifically declared disasters, other situations arose that caused disruption to lives, economic resources, and infrastructure. In some of these cases, a Stafford Act declaration may not have been provided or even sought. Together, these incidents, and ongoing recovery efforts from previous disasters, drove a demand for additional federal budgetary resources beyond those provided in regular annual appropriations. This demand is usually reflected in one or more requests by the Administration for supplemental appropriations after the incident (or incidents) have occurred and the need for funding is apparent. The Trump Administration did not make a formal request for supplemental appropriations for disaster assistancefor FY2019. However, congressional leadership in both the House and Senate chose to initiate consideration of supplemental disaster assistance appropriationsat the end of the 115th Congress. Consideration continued into the 116th Congress, until a $19.19 billion supplemental appropriations measurewas enacted in June 2019.

The main objectives of this legislative proposal were to assist the U.S. by providing technical and financial assistance to tropical forest countries to increase the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests and to promote and foster forest carbon management, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical forest counties, and provide incentives to tropical forest countries to take part in actions leading to conservation (of their forests). It has been argued that this initiative is aimed at protecting the forests in the same way that the U.S. protects its own forests. In order to understand the effectiveness of the initiative and better assess the challenges that the initiative faces, this brief looks at the forest carbon footprints in both Africa and America on the continent of both Americas based on the recent research in the field of forest biology.", "The stagnation in hourly wages for the low-skilled has entered into the policy discussion on, among other topics, the effects of labor market regulation, the minimum wage, and international trade agreements. This stagnation has also contributed to the overall wage inequality over the last 30 years. This decline in real wages at the lower end of the distribution appears to have started during the recession in the early 1980s and lasted into the Great Recession of 20091. The stagnation at the lower end is not reflected at the upper end of the distribution. This suggests that the stagnation of wages has been accompanied by a substantial widening in the disparities in hourly compensation between high- and low-wage workers. Although low-wage compensation stagnated, the compensation of those in the upper half of the wage distribution increased substantially. Wages have grown faster from the 90th to the 75th percentile when compared to the 25th to the 10th. These observations imply that an increased supply of low-wage workers has occurred, with low-wage workers being more substitutable. The average hours of work also increased for the lower quintiles and decreased for the upper quintiles. For the bottom 10% of the wage distribution, the average hours of the upper 90% have decreased by 1.8%. For the other quintiles, the average hours of work are, on average, 2.8% less. The average number of hours worked has become more skewed at the higher quintiles, particularly in the 75th to the 90th. The average number of hours worked per quarter for the 75 th to 90 th quintiles are 781, 806, and 855 respectively. Average hours for wage earners 30,39,40 and 49 for the 25th to 10th percentiles is 108,91, 106, and 124, respectively. The lower-quintile workers had decreasing income levels and working hours, while the hours and income for those in the upper-quintile had a more modest increase. This supports the notion that wage stagnation in the lowest deciles represents a substitution by low-wage immigrants and low-skilled workers in general. The decline in the average hours worked per payroll worker over the 1978-2016 period (21 hours per payroll worker) was mainly driven by the decline from 25.2 hours in 1978 to 21.3 in 2016 among those with a high school or lower diploma or equivalent. There was virtually no change for those with a college degree or more. A study by Baker and Fallick (2002) documents the effects of the technological advances in low-wage occupations. The advances in information technology that occurred towards the end of the 20 th century and the beginning of the 21 st century have had a large effect upon the wage level of low-skilled workers. Technical change in automobile maintenance over the 30-year period from 1984 to 2014 reduced an automobile mechanic's wage by the equivalent of 4.1 percent. It was estimated that technical change over the 1998-2014 period had diminished the value added from each worker to the average manufacturing wage by 39.8% . Another study, using the World Input-Output Database for manufacturing, showed that China reduced the labor content of computers by almost half. The reduction in labor content in the information technology sector has been significant for both developing and developed countries. The impact of technological advances is further examined by Autor et al. (2016), which documents the increase in capital- and skill-intensive jobs. The technological innovations are also responsible for the growth in the use of robots in the workforce over the last 25 years. Over the 1999-2001 period, almost 18% of the jobs in the United States had been automated. The effects of advances in information technology as well as the growing trend of outsourcing to developing countries have had a significant effect upon the wage and employment of low-skilled workers, particularly those with less than a high school education. The effects of these advances can be seen in the decrease in the real wages and increase in the number of full-time", "Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is attractive to critics of mainstream macroeconomics because MMT is more flexible than the latter. In particular, MMT seeks to eliminate the possibility of a macroeconomic instability\u2014a large macroeconomic cycle\u2014while also eliminating unnecessary debt accumulation. However, critics of MMT claim it is inconsistent and does not acknowledge tradeoffs. This view is based in part on the fact that the MMT fiscal policy relationship differs from the one in mainstream macroeconomics. These critics argue that the MMT formulation leads to more state and/or federal debt than the amount needed to smooth aggregate output; the government would be spending more and raising more revenue to accomplish this. In addition, critics of MMT charge that the approach lacks transparency in its monetary and fiscal functions. While proponents of MMT claim they are being truthful in stating that the United States can pay its creditors with money the U.S. government prints, there is no precedent for the government spending this new money and simultaneously taxing at the same time. Finally, these critics point to inflation in the money supply due to taxing and spending, which would be exacerbated in a MMT regime. The paper begins with the basic IS curve, which in the mainstream model represents the relationship between income, consumption, investment, and taxes. The MMT version of this relationship (called the IS-LM model for short) implies that all of the variables equal out because they are always equal to output. The first difference between MMT\u2019s IS-LM relationship and that in mainstream economics is the use of accounting for the government sector. MMT seeks to eliminate the \u201cgovernment debt burden\u201d to the public and the \u201cprivate sector surplus.\u201d By eliminating the government surplus as an additional injection of spending power and private sector savings as a reduced injection, the model attempts to eliminate surpluses and deficits. This approach creates two problems: 1) it destroys the government budget constraint (the budget surplus) and 2) it destroys the private sector balance sheet constraint (private sector saving) for private sector households. In the mainstream model, aggregate output could exceed the total real spending power in the economy (consumption plus investment) or it could fall short. To stabilize output, the government can intervene by spending more and/or taxing less; this would offset a possible excess or shortage of aggregate spending in the economy. As the second difference from mainstream economics, MMT uses an accounting approach to solve the IS-LM relationship. To achieve a level sustainable growth rate, the public sector deficit must equal private sector savings. In contrast, the mainstream approach seeks the IS-LM balance by varying the money supply via a Taylor rule and tax rates. Consequently, the MMT IS-LM relationship is one of accounting, not the mainstream economic model that emphasizes aggregate spending as a function of the money supply. Finally, MMT economists consider debt and credit to be a form of financial asset, not a government burden. The mainstream economic model assumes debt requires interest payments. In this MMT view, debt is simply an asset of the lender (creditor). Thus, the MMT fiscal relationship does not require public or private deleveraging, but does require lenders and borrowers to work out a balance to be sustainable over time. CONCLUSION: The paper argues that MMT is inconsistent with the principles of mainstream macroeconomics. That is, MMT economists have not adequately addressed inflationary tendencies, the role of risk aversion in monetary and fiscal functions, and the costs of private sector balance sheet constraints over time. Thus, while MMT is appealing to critics of mainstream economics because its policies do not require state or federal indebtedness, MMT policies also create new concerns, with uncertain consequences to the stability of the macroeconomy.", "\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 An impeachment investigation can be characterized as a type of legislative investigation carried out by the House to gather information about impeachable misconduct.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The Constitution's impeachment provisions provide the House with broad authority to prosecute impeachments and a variety of mechanisms to implement that authority.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No formal definition of an impeachment investigation exists, but a review of the Constitution, court decisions, and historical practices indicate an impeachment investigation is one of the more substantial congressional investigations, and may be seen as either an exercise of the House's legislative power or the initiation of the impeachment process.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The House may use the coercive mechanisms of subpoena or contempt citation to obtain information in an impeachment investigation, and it may require courts to enforce its subpoenas by withholding its recognition of their leg al privileges.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 An impeachment investigation cannot legally result in the conviction of the respondent. Nonetheless, to the extent that an impeachment investigation's purpose is to determine whether grounds exist for impeachment in the House, it may be viewed as a quasi-judicial proceeding and afforded constitutional protections.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A legislative committee conducting an impeachment investigation generally follows the same rules and guidelines as any other committee in the House.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The constitutional impeachment powers of Congress apply exclusively to the President, federal judges, and other \"civil Officers of the United States\" as listed in the Constitution's impeachment clauses.  (7) The 88th Congress, for example, began three impeachment investigations during 1963 and two in early 1964; that effort culminated with the March 1, 1964, impeachment and trial of District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, with a full Senate conviction on February 10, 1965. Nixon, who had appointed a prosecutor to investigate his own court system, in fact admitted to having offered a government job to an unsuccessful defendant in order to influence that defendant's testimony in several state court cases. His impeachment and trial focused on allegations that he \"obstructed\" the proper functioning of the Senate impeachment proceeding through uncooperative conduct, including failure to produce records and to respond to certain questions posed by the Senate.81 The trial process exposed the serious lack of cooperation that had developed between the House of Representatives and the district judge over many years.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 By the nature of its exercise of congressional power, impeachment is a political act, and the constitutional and historical evidence is consistent with the conclusion that impeachment investigations, like all other congressional investigations, have been political exercises that do not fall within the sphere of judicial review.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The history of Congress demonstrates a long tradition of political investigation\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the type that might be characterized as impeachment investigations\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is not judicially reviewable.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Impeachment investigations are unique exercises of congressional power, but congressional committees have authority to investigate only to the degree allowed by the Constitution and the rules of the House.  (8) Impeachment investigations, like all other constitutional procedures, are not exempt from judicial review.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The courts, for the most part, have not intruded into the impeachment process. The constitutional procedures for that action offer the judiciary little jurisdiction over the process.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The case law is relatively barren of precedent for the courts to provide for judicial review of both the scope of impeachment authority in the House and the role of courts in impeachment proceedings in the Senate.  (4) The constitutional provisions governing impeachment and their legislative history demonstrate clearly that impeachments are \"proceedings\" governed by both the House and the Senate. The House has the sole power to impeach, and the Senate has sole power to conduct impeachment trials. Although the process is governed by the separate branches of the federal government, that process requires inter-branch cooperation for its proper functioning.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The constitutional provisions governing impeachment do not suggest any role for the judiciary. The courts appear to have little involvement, and that involvement appears to be confined to aiding legislative implementation of the impeachment procedure.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The courts have not had a significant role in impeachment investigations.

In particular, the FATF has pointed to the beneficial ownership of many U.S.-based limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations, trusts, and partnerships, as well as their underlying assets held in the name of such entities. According to FATF, beneficial ownership information is \"necessary in order for law enforcement and financial intelligence units to understand quickly who is the owner and controller of a natural person or legal person, and the nature and extent of the underlying transaction.\"108 In particular, FATF has also identified the U.S. financial system as a key target of a large majority of criminal investigations worldwide, and has noted that AML/CFT policy in this area is a significant source of pressure for U.S. jurisdictions.109 Certain U.S. federal and state laws, such as the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA), as well as U.S. regulations such as those issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, have traditionally required financial institutions to collect and maintain beneficial ownership information for many financial transactions for entities formed in the name of the United States or its territories.110 Despite these reporting obligations, however, a significant amount of information collected is difficult to track or verify for regulatory examiners. In part, because beneficial ownership information is typically not available to investigators at the inception of criminal investigations regarding shell companies, law enforcement agencies must make significant investments in time and resources in such cases to identify the beneficial owners of shell companies. By contrast, some investigators have noted that beneficial ownership information is often available at the inception of investigations related to corporations formed outside of the United States, and that beneficial ownership information regarding such companies helps facilitate earlier and more efficient resolution of such cases.111 Moreover, beneficial ownership information obtained during investigations related to U.S. companies appears to provide helpful information regarding the money laundering schemes of criminals, money laundering victims, corrupt public officials, and terrorist financiers, particularly due to the ease of creating many of these entities by criminals.112 Further, FATF members have identified U.S. financial transparency laws as a comparative policy weakness in the United States,113 and have noted that the United States has not historically addressed the beneficial ownership of individual natural persons through existing legal entities, including U.S. shell companies.114 Accordingly, U.S. law enforcement and financial intelligence officials assert that their ability to identify and pursue beneficial owners in investigations of U.S. entities for potential money laundering is hampered by inadequate beneficial ownership transparency laws, regulations, and reporting requirements.115 In particular, investigators at the Department of Justice have stated that such intransparency hampers investigations relating to money laundering, while regulators at FinCEN have stated that it frustrates their attempts to understand the risk that a particular entity carries and impedes their effective examination efforts for financial institutions.116", "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the ESA's implementing regulations\u00e2\u0080\u0094by determining there was no need for an environmental impact statement before determining the Gunnison sage-grouse would not warrant protection under the ESA.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 871 F.Supp.2d 227 (D.D.C. 2012).", "[From a Paper Published by: Congressional Research Service 7-5700\nR43897]\n[Produced by: Congressional Research Service, 7-5700]\n[Written by: Jeremy M. Bishop]\nOil and gas development in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico began with the discovery in 1949 of one of the world's major oil fields at the Mississippi Canyon area in the deep Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana. Subsequent discoveries in later years were made in both shallower and deeper waters offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and westward into the western Gulf. The early Gulf of Mexico exploration period included the years between 1949 and 1979. This time was marked by significant advances in technology and infrastructure that allowed for the successful exploration and extraction of Gulf of Mexico oil and gas resources. The early years of exploration and production were primarily focused on the use of surface drilling platforms tethered to the seabed by means of long chains or moorings. As of 2015, there have been more than 48,000 active wells in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn the 1970s, two significant technological advances were made in Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas development. The first significant advancement was the development of the submersible drilling unit, known as an \"elevating unit\" of \"jackup platform.\" The first Gulf of Mexico development of a submersible unit was at the Ship Shoal Block 32 platform in federal waters, approximately 112 miles (180 km) south of the Louisiana coast, located in about 195 feet of water. The second significant advancement was the development of subsea well technology. This new technique enabled operators to access the geologic formation beneath the sea bottom without having to anchor and maintain surface structures at the site of the well.\nGulf of Mexico oil wells currently range in water depths up to 10,000 feet. Of about 3,000 wells with known water depths in the Gulf of Mexico, 2,700 have drilled into areas deeper than the water depth of Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain. Only one-fourth of all Gulf of Mexico production comes from water depths of less than 1,000 feet. This is particularly true when considering only offshore oil wells located in federal waters. This depth distribution has important implications for considering Gulf of Mexico drilling in the future. In particular, it means that the largest portion of remaining oil resources are in the deep Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 was the result of a subsea blowout, which destroyed BP's mobile ocean exploration drilling system and the resulting wells it had in the process of drilling. It also damaged the undersea drilling pipelines (containment systems that provide oil and gas to the platform) from a neighboring producer of natural gas called the Deepwater Eureka. Eight of the wells in the Eureka development were inactive at the time and were not producing oil until December 2009, when they were returned to production. The Deepwater Eureka is the newest oil and gas production facility in the Gulf of Mexico. Production began in December 2009.\nGulf of Mexico deep water oil and gas production currently is clustered in the following five geographic areas:\n\u2022 the Gulf of Mexico offshore and Gulf of Mexico west of the Louisiana coast;\n\u2022 the Gulf of Mexico offshore and Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi coast;\n\u2022 the Gulf of Mexico offshore and Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast;\n\u2022 the Gulf of Mexico offshore and Gulf of Mexico west of the Texas coast; and\n\u2022 the Gulf of Mexico west of the Western Gulf Coast region (i.e., Alabama).\nIncreasingly, the Gulf of Mexico's offshore regions feature complex and very small pools of oil and natural gas. Increasing deep water drilling has led to offshore discoveries that are often located in isolation from other fields and other offshore structures, as well as onshore oil and gas platforms and pipelines.\nA 2010 Energy Information Administration (EIA) summary of the impacts of deep water oil and gas development off the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast indicates that a total of 67 deep", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; H.R. 748) contains $500 billion in emergency funding to be allocated for \"covered enterprises\" that sustained substantial economic losses due to COVID-19 and have been, or would be, required to suspend operations or lay off employees and contractors. H.R. 748 does not define a \"covered enterprise,\" but refers to the \"covered industries\" as those most directly affected by COVID-19 and includes (but is not limited to) passenger and cargo airlines. Additionally, enterprises that are critical to maintaining national security, and which are most heavily or directly impacted by COVID-19, may also qualify to receive emergency funds. H.R. 748 provides specific allocations for three industries: passenger and cargo airlines, businesses critical to maintaining national security, and businesses directly impacted by COVID-19. The Treasury Secretary is authorized to prioritize loans and other support for passenger and cargo air carriers, which are currently facing the greatest financial losses and operational disruptions, and businesses critical to national security. The bill also directs the Treasury Secretary to allocate additional amounts to direct loan and guarantee programs, including the CDFI Program, the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, and the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program, as well as the Infrastructure Investment Program, which is specifically targeted to provide funding to businesses directly impacted by COVID-19, such as small businesses. Under this section of the bill, Treasury has authority for lending and guarantee programs for up to one year, after which Congress will need to enact additional legislation to enable continued loan programs. This report includes a summary of provisions contained in the Emergency Access to Federal Health Incentives for the Uninsured (EAFHUI) Act of 2020 (Division C of Title I of P.L. 116-136) related to the use of loan or grant funding that have not been included in this report. See Appendix. This report does not examine funding for loans and loan guarantees for airports, which is directed to a different program under Section 951 of the Federal Airport Act, though this report does examine airport funding and infrastructure programs that are not explicitly directed to a separate program. As discussed later in this report, the majority of loans may be provided in the form of guarantees. H.R. 748 also authorizes $450 million in direct loans and loan guarantees to small businesses under the Small Business Administration (SBA). These businesses are not limited to those directly impacted by COVID-19, but are eligible for any small business affected by COVID-19 and eligible under other SBA programs. As a result, this $450 million in loans to small businesses may be provided in the form of direct loans, loan guarantees, or other form of assistance from the SBA. P.L. 116-136 also provides funding for the FAA for grants for airport infrastructure, with a portion allotted to airports in counties with higher than normal unemployment. This report does not analyze these grants or the administration of the FAA grant programs in depth.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau classifies air transportation services as part of the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector. This sector makes up about 5% of the total U.S. economy. In terms of GDP, U.S. passenger carriers made up about 1% of the domestic supply of air transportation passenger services, and cargo air carries made up about 40%. U.S. passenger airlines carry about $45 of domestic air transportation passenger services for every dollar of U.S. cargo air carries for international air transportation passenger services. As a result, U.S. cargo air carries are expected to have a larger impact than U.S. passenger airlines from the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19.1 Although no publicly available economic data shows a clear impact from COVID-19 on U.S. revenue losses to airline carriers, some publicly known carriers have reported a negative financial impact. Southwest Airlines stated that in January 2020 that it had \"revenue per available seat miles off between 5% and 8% from the previously forecasted revenue per available seat miles\"; Air Canada", "F ollowing his resignation as President, Richard Nixon wanted to destroy recordings created in the White House that, among other things, documented actions he and others took in response to investigations connected to a burglary in the Watergate building and his reelection campaign. Under policy at the time, presidential materials were considered the President's private property. In response, Congress passed a number of laws to preserve the integrity of documents and other information related to Nixon's presidency and made those laws applicable to all future presidencies.\nEnacted in 1978, the Presidential Records Act (PRA; 44 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a72201-2207) established public ownership of records created by Presidents and their staff in the course of discharging their official duties. The PRA additionally established procedures for congressional and public access to presidential and vice presidential information and the preservation and public availability of such records at the conclusion of a presidency.\nThis report provides context on the institutions involved in presidential recordkeeping, explains what is and is not considered to be a presidential record, and identifies recordkeeping responsibilities and access policies during and after a presidency.\nThe report concludes with information and policy options for congressional oversight and enforcement of the PRA with respect to electronic records provisions under the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014.\nWhile the PRA provides similar provisions for records created by the Vice President, this report focuses on presidential records.\nAlso, information on the Federal Records Act (FRA), more broadly, is available in CRS Reports CRS Report R43072, Common Questions About Federal Records and Related Agency Requirements , by Meghan M. Stuessy. The PRA governs the records of the President,\nVice President, and certain components of the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\nThe PRA specifies roles and responsibilities for the management of presidential records, and the disposition of them at the conclusion of a President's Administration.\nThe President retains custody of all presidential records and, at certain times, must provide the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), a component of the General Services Administration, with guidance on disposition of such records.\nNARA subsequently transfers custody of material to the National Archives through legal transfer of custody. The Archivist of the United States is responsible for the custody and security of all presidential records held by NARA.\nThe PRA requires the Archivist to collect, organize, arrange, preserve, and make available to the American people the recorded materials that document the activities of the Office of the Presidents from the Presidential Transition Act through the end of the administration covered by the materials, with some exceptions (44 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a72201-2207).\nThe PRA defines two categories of presidential records as follow.\n(A) Includes all written, printed, typewritten, photographed, graphic, audio, or video materials, regardless of physical form (including electronic media) created or received by the President, the President's immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose function is to advise or assist the President.\nAlso, presidential records include the official records of the Vice President and of any entity within the Executive Office of the President. These materials are limited, however, to those \"contained in or related to activities bearing on or affecting the performance of the statutory or constitutional duties of the President.\"\nThe term also includes, in a President's files, materials produced only by the President's immediate staff or the Executive Office of the President, even if the materials were in a person's personal possession before or after their transfer to the Presidential Files and are not themselves presidential records. In other words, not every document is a presidential record. For example, presidential records can be created and maintained by an entity outside of an agency or the White House.\nThe definition of presidential records also makes explicit that such a record is something that is: used or intended for use in conducting activities as the President or Vice President; or preserved or created for the purpose of conducting such activities.\n(B) Does not include records covered by constitutional separation of powers, including the President's constitutionally based privileges as an individual in relation to communications with staff or communications within the process of advising or assisting the President; judicial records of proceedings or other records generated or maintained by a court; or materials in an official capacity that an official with custody of records makes public", ".

It encompasses the production of agricultural commodities (e.g., crop production, including grain, fruits, and vegetables and the corresponding livestock-related commodities), nursery, and greenhouse products; forestry products; fisheries; farm-related services (e.g., crop processing, equipment supplies, crop services); farm support (through government programs); and farm equipment. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, there were 2.05 million  people working on farms (including 1.366 million people providing the labor and management of farms) at an average cost of $29,000 per year per employee. There were 806,792 farms in 2017 which produced about 1/3 of farm output  and spent $54,860 in total in 2017. Net cash income was $290,500 per farm in 2017, up from 81,410 in 2010. Median size of farms was 444 acres and median total sales were $101,447. Median income of primary operators was $77,376. The Census includes only farms, or \"active farms\" (those making more than $1,000 in cash income from farming, or having at least $2,500 worth of \"value of production\" from the farming activity). In 2017, there were 934,909 \"active farms,\" representing 80.8% of the 1,163,024 total farms in the United States. In other words, 753,015 US farms operated at a loss. Farming operations with sales of $2,500 or less are not surveyed. Data available on request from the United States Department of Agriculture . \"Today, fewer than 12 percent of American farms can be listed among U.S. agriculture's largest agribusinesses. Over 95 percent of all U.S. farms still operate with annual sales under $250,000. The remaining 3 percent of U.S. farms have more than $250,000 annual sales, but average less than $1 million in sales.\" In 2013, there were 604,529 farms in the United States, a decline from about 6,000,000 mid-1800's and a 40% decline since 1900 (though total output reached a record $116.6 billion in 2014). In 2014, agriculture accounted for 4.8% of GDP and 2.4% of employment (11,621 people  employed) although crop farming provided only 2% of GDP. In 1900, agriculture accounted for 29.6% of GDP. Crop (field) farming was the fastest-growing segment of agriculture, 35.9% (up 0.9% from 2013). In 2016, American agriculture accounted for 3.4% of the GDP ($233 billion out of a GDP of $19.4 trillion), and employed 2.5 million people ($82 billion out of a total GDP of $18.35 trillion). This was down from 20% of the GDP in 1880. Crop farming was down to 2.7% of GDP ($170.9 billion out of a GDP of $42.52 trillion). Over 90% of all farms use 10% of the labor. Farmers complain of a labor shortage, especially in the harvest; but farmers often have trouble finding a labor force willing and able to do farm work. Farming is very seasonal, especially with commodity crops, requiring long work hours at busy times and often poor wages and no benefits. 10% of the population are farmers (but they produce 91% of the agricultural output). 85% of the rural population is non-farm, and 13% of the total US population is rural (81% and 56%, respectively in 1900). 4", "On June 4, 2019, the House passed the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 ( H.R. 6 ) on a vote of 237 to 187. Title I of the bill, the Dream Act of 2019, would establish a process for certain unauthorized immigrants who entered the United States as children (known as unauthorized childhood arrivals) to obtain lawful permanent immigration status.  This vote on H.R. 6 was one of several House and Senate floor votes since 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the only successful one\u00e2\u0080\u0094on legislation to grant some type of immigration relief to unauthorized childhood arrivals. As commonly used, the term \"unauthorized childhood arrivals\" encompasses both individuals who entered the United States unlawfully and individuals who entered lawfully but then lost legal status, by, for example, overstaying an authorized temporary period of stay. There is no single set of requirements that defines an unauthorized childhood arrival. Individual bills include their own criteria. This report considers House and Senate measures on unauthorized childhood arrivals that have seen legislative action since 2001. It also discusses the related Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative and DACA-related data. The material is presented chronologically to trace the development of legislative proposals on unauthorized childhood arrivals and highlight the interplay between legislative action on these measures and developments related to the DACA initiative. Legislation on unauthorized childhood arrivals dates to 2001.1 That year, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act (S. 1291) was introduced in the 107th Congress to provide a pathway to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status for eligible individuals who arrived as children in the United States.2 Many policymakers viewed this subset of the unauthorized population more sympathetically than unauthorized immigrants on the whole because unauthorized childhood arrivals had arrived in the United States as children and were thus not generally seen as being responsible for their unlawful status. Among the other criteria to adjust status under these provisions, the individual must have been \"inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States,\"3which generally precludes individuals who arrived unlawfully.  In addition, there is no single set of criteria that defines an unauthorized childhood arrival, as demonstrated by the diverse provisions found in the bills. Individual bills include their own unique criteria that may or may not align with what is currently referred to as the \"Dreamer population.\" 1 A measure similar to the DREAM Act was approved by the Senate in June 2013 but was considered by the House of Representatives but did not reach the floor for a vote. 2 \"Dream Act\" in this report refers both to the 2001 bill and other measures bearing the 2001 bill's  name. For example, references to \"the Dream Act\" in subsequent text can refer to specific versions of measures sharing the \"Dream Act\" name or the group of measures in general. 3 Sec. 11A (a)(1), DREAM Act, S. 1 971 (1 1 2th Cong.)

As the bill's name implies, its genesis lay in the desire to provide various benefits (such as in-state tuition and federal student aid eligibility) to a population of unauthorized immigrants commonly referred to as \"Dreamers\" or \"Dreamers\" who were unable at that time to access such benefits. 4 See, e.g., S. 1 157 ( 2 013 ), H.R. 924 ( 2 019 ), H.Rept. 1 16-4 15 (Part I.C), p. 323 ( 2 019 ); see also, Mark Noferi, \"Dreamers: The Controversy of Birthright Citizenship and the DREAM Act ,", "In the span of a half century, the process of purchasing a good or service has evolved from visiting a storefront to standing in line at a drive-through or sitting in front of a computer.

The treaty is a bilateral agreement that calls for each side to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons to 1,550 from 1,557 and to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and heavy bombers. The treaty also limits each side's nuclear testing, and provides for the exchange of data and annual meetings between the U.S. and Russian presidents and national security advisors to address any issues related to the treaty and nuclear weapons in general. The treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011. Implementation of the treaty began in 2003 and is expected to conclude in 2018. This 10-year time period\u2014or 1200 days\u2014provides ample time for both sides to reduce their forces to comply with the treaty's limits. New START is a modest but important treaty for U.S. national security. The limits imposed by the treaty are well within the overall capability of each side; the treaty imposes no restrictions on the stockpiles of short-, medium-, or intermediate-range forces. Thus, the treaty's limits are not so stringent that their violation would risk war, nor are they so minimal that they would constrain each side from responding to threats by other nations. The treaty also reduces the number of launchers with nuclear capability and it provides for increased transparency by both sides regarding their deployments. New START is thus a minimalist treaty that allows for predictability and continued confidence, as well as some assurance that strategic weapons will be reduced and placed under restraint. Nevertheless, the Treaty could constrain the strategic offensive weapons options of each side, while also being costly in some U.S. weapons accounting. Moreover, the treaty itself will not prevent the United States from taking further measures to reduce the size of both sides' nuclear stockpiles. The continued pursuit of the modernization of both sides' stockpiles may reduce New START's effects.\nThe Senate and House Armed Services Committees, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces conducted a joint hearing with their counterparts from subcommittees with oversight over U. S. nuclear weapons programs. In opening statements, Chairman John McCain (R-AZ), Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-RI), HASC Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-TX), and SASC Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-RI) all emphasized U.S. national security concerns and goals, including the need for credible nuclear deterrence. They also stressed the importance of transparency and reciprocity in on-going negotiations with Russia. These concerns and priorities are broadly shared by members of Congress and the public. Nonetheless, there are important differences between the views of some House and Senate members and the Administration's views and priorities.\nThere are a number of outstanding issues on these topics, not limited to: a treaty extension, a ban on low-yield, sub-launched nuclear weapons, and the development of new weapons delivery vehicles. These topics will figure prominently in bilateral talks between the United States and Russia, and in bipartisan legislation in the 116th Congress, such as H.R. 585. Nevertheless, even if the current treaty expires in 2021, U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals will still be among the largest in the world, and the potential for conflict will remain. This will result in substantial risks that nuclear conflicts could occur. The United States and Russia should ensure that their arsenals are not so large that one side could realistically count on using nuclear weapons, even in a non-nuclear conflict. In addition, both sides should work to improve their transparency and, where appropriate, accountability. The United States and Russia also must work to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons use among non-nuclear weapon states. These steps should be made possible by reducing their stockpiles of deployed nuclear warheads to the bare minimum possible and reducing the nuclear threat as much as possible.\nThus, the need for predictability and continued confidence provided by New START is not necessarily at odds with the need for increased assurances that nuclear weapons are being put on the path toward elimination. These two needs can, and should, be met simultaneously through the New START treaty and other measures. In fact, there are many opportunities for the Trump", "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) confers on the public a right to access federal agency information. Before FOIA's enactment, the Administrative Procedure Act had required agencies to make certain government information available to the public. But the exceptions to disclosure in the APA\u2019s public information section had become, in the estimation of FOIA\u2019s drafters, \u201cthe major statutory excuse for withholding Government records from public view.\u201d The exceptions were broad, authorizing agencies, for example, to withhold information if doing so was \u201cin the public interest\u201d or\u2014for \u201cmatters of official record\u201d\u2014when information was \u201cheld confidential for good cause found.\u201d In addition, the APA\u2019s public information section lacked a provision authorizing a person to seek judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision to withhold information. To rectify the APA\u2019s perceived failure to provide the public with adequate access to government information, Congress enacted FOIA in 1966 as an amendment to the APA. In FOIA, Congress sought to establish a system of disclosure by which agencies must disclose a large swath of federal agency information and records to private individuals, researchers, journalists, and other parties. FOIA also authorizes, but does not require, agencies to withhold information or records that are otherwise subject to release or availability under the statute. As one court has remarked, FOIA is \u201cthe legislative embodiment of Justice Brandeis\u2019s famous adage\u201d that \u201csunlight is . . . the best of disinfectants.\u201d FOIA\u2019s nine exemptions cover specific categories of information that agencies should withhold from the public. A sixth exemption addresses the national security and protecting intelligence sources and methods. In addition to these nine exemptions, FOIA contains three records exclusions. If records protected by an exclusion are subject to a FOIA request, an agency may \u201ctreat the records as not [subject to] agency records and produce [them] in response to a FOIA request.\u201d This report provides an overview of FOIA, first, by describing key terms that dictate the scope of agencies\u2019 disclosure obligations under FOIA.

It is the largest of the eight health-related agencies that make up the Public Health Service (PHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). NIH activities cover a wide range of basic, clinical, and translational research, focusing on particular diseases or areas of the body, or more fundamentally on biological and behavioral processes. Most of these activities involve financial assistance (e.g., grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other funding mechanisms) to a wide range of recipients\u00e2\u0080\u0094universities and other institutions, individual investigators, and small businesses. The remainder focuses on research and public health information (e.g., through publishing, dissemination, and public health surveillance), or on training programs for developing the health workforce. About 88% of the NIH budget is funded by annual discretionary appropriations, as described above. The rest is budgetary authority that is primarily mandatory (i.e., is generated through an authorized funding mechanism with an annual appropriation, separate from the annual appropriation for discretionary and authority items) or revolving. To the extent that NIH receives appropriated funding outside the annual Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act (for instance, through multiyear appropriations or a specified amount of discretionary funding), the discussion here of NIH funding would still apply, adjusted for the amount and period of the appropriated funding. The discretionary appropriations that support NIH constitute about 50% of the congressional LHHS and Interior/Environment Appropriations Subcommittees' allocations for NIH, and about 20% of PHS and all LHHS appropriations. In addition to its discretionary budget authority, NIH has received more than $70 billion in mandatory funding since FY1986, with the funding generated through appropriations to other agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and other HHS agencies. As shown in Figure 1, the appropriations since FY1986 to the account for NIH have remained relatively flat, when adjusted for inflation. For FY1995 through FY2019, the appropriations ranged from $26 billion to approximately $32 billion, in current dollars (i.e., adjusted for changes in prices). Between these years, the annual budget authority\u00e2\u0080\u0094for NIH as a whole or for programs within NIH\u00e2\u0080\u0094had changed only modestly. Since FY1986, the level of congressional appropriations supporting the NIH has been subject to much public debate, particularly over the effects on the quantity and quality of peer-reviewed health research and whether the funding level is adequate for the health research needs of the United States. Funding through the NIH Innovation Account (which focuses on the Cures Act's three mission areas; see \"Overview\") has provided a relatively small share of the appropriations to NIH, but has increased significantly over time. As seen in Figure 3, NIH appropriations in FY2019 totaled more than $34 billion in current dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0094the highest level to date. (The NIH OD reported that about two-thirds of this FY2019 sum supported direct health research\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for purposes of comparing and tracking the NIH funding, this distinction of direct versus indirect is largely academic; it is generally immaterial whether the budget or costs of a unit are labeled direct or indirect.) This increase was associated mostly with increases in the budget authority for the NIH Innovation Account, particularly with three initiatives funded by the Cures Act (see also 637b(a) of the Cures Act\u00c21 )\u00e2\u0080\u0094BRAIN, LungMAP, and regenerative medicine (see Table 2). However, in the same period, NIH funding (in current dollars) decreased by one-half of 1% for all other research (i.e., the NIH discretionary budget). Other research at NIH (e.g., on cancer, heart disease, type 1 diabetes) continues to receive the vast majority of NIH funding, but the Cures Act initiatives are likely to grow in prominence in future years (e.g., BRAIN). Figure 4 shows", "The legislative history of the PHHSBEC law is as follows: On February 18, 2020, President Trump sent to Congress, pursuant to the Impoundment Act, a message indicating his intent to withhold certain fiscal year (FY) 2020 discretionary appropriations from four Departments and independent agencies: the Departments of Defense (DOD), Education (ED), and Homeland Security (DHS), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  On February 21, 2020, House Democrats introduced H.J.Res. 83, a resolution disapproving the Trump Administration's withholding of funding designated for the HHS/PHS and NSF. That legislation also would have disapproved the withholding of funding designated for the Departments of Transportation (DOT) and State/USAID (State/USAID).\nOn February 24, 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signed a letter on behalf of House Democrats to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating their intent to disapprove the withholding of funding through the Joint Resolution and to initiate expedited floor action on House Bill 34, the Coronavirus Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act.  That bill provided additional discretionary authority and budgetary resources to fund response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn February 27, 2020, the House passed HR 34, the Coronavirus Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act by voice vote.  On March 3, 2020, the Senate passed HR 34 by voice vote.  Later that same day, President Trump signed the Act into law (H.R. 2113).", "Immigration policy aims to maximize the benefits that legal immigration provides to the United States while minimizing the social and economic disruptions caused by migration patterns. While U.S. national interests clearly benefit from enabling access to the nation s labor market by highly qualified and skilled individuals, efforts to attract foreign-born workers through employmentbased immigration face serious limitations. The United States currently has a population of almost 1 million lawfully present foreign workers and accompanying family members who have been approved for, but have not yet received, a green card or lawful permanent resident (LPR) status.1 This queue of prospective immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u0094the employment-based backlog \u00e2\u0080\u0094is dominated by Indian nationals.2 It has been growing for decades and is projected to double in less than 10 years.3 The employment-based immigrant backlog exists because the annual number of foreign workers whom U.S. employers hire and then sponsor to enter the employment-based immigration pipeline has regularly exceeded the annual statutory allocation of green cards.4 The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that governs U.S. immigration policy limits the total annual number of employment-based green cards to 140,000 individuals.5 This worldwide limit is split among five employment-based categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first three of which each receive 40,040 green cards, and the other two receive 9,940 each.6 (See Appendix A for more detailed category information.)7 Apart from these numerical limits, the INA also imposes a 7% per-country ceiling that applies to each category.8 The 7% ceiling is not an allocation to individual countries but an upper limit established to prevent the monopolization of employment-based green cards by a small number of countries.9 This is particularly the case for nationals from India, China, and the Philippines\u00e2\u0080\u0094three countries that send large numbers of foreign workers to the United States.10 However, for these prospective immigrants, many of whom already reside in the United States, the backlog can impose significant hardships. Prospective employment-based immigrants who lack LPR status cannot switch jobs, potentially subjecting them to exploitative work conditions.11 In effect, a large portion of those backlogged is reportedly migrating to countries other than the United States for education, employment, or both.12 In recent years, some Members of Congress have proposed solutions to address the employment-backlog, ranging from changing the existing system's numerical limits to restructuring the entire employment-based immigration system.13 The latter approach is widely viewed as legislatively and politically formidable. On the other hand, an effort to shift the allocation of existing employmentbased green card quotas toward less backlogged countries is more promising and would address the source of the backlog, while ensuring that the United States continues to benefit from the contributions of the backlogged countries. However, with the Indian quota projected to exceed its limit in the very near future,14 this option is time sensitive.15 1 SUNGMIN KIM, 2013", "According to the WTO, the principle of unconditional MFN tariffs has been central to the global trading system since 1947. The US government imposes duties to discourage exports of dumped products to US domestic manufacturers.  SCORE: 2", "Text: On July 2, 1862, with the passage of the first Morrill Act (12 Stat. 503; 7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the United States began a then novel policy of providing federal support for post-secondary education, specifically for agriculture and the mechanical arts. The national system of land-grant colleges and universities that has developed since then is recognized for its breadth, reach, and excellence in teaching, research, and extension. Located in every state, Washington, D.C., and many insular areas , these institutions educate the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and citizens, and form the backbone of a national network of agricultural extension and experiment stations. Later federal legislation expanded the scope and reach of the 1862 Morrill Act. Beyond providing initial resources for establishment of the land-grant institutions, the federal government contributes funds annually through a variety of capacity and competitive grants administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Capacity grants, also known as formula funds, are allocated to states based on statutory formulas. Competitive grants are awarded to specific projects selected through peer-review processes. In many cases, the states and\nhttps://www.congress.gov/content/document/pdf/2018-04-03-CBO-Cost_Benefits_Land_Grant_Universities_Reform.pdf", "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Fiscal Year 2013 Report to Congress: Endangered and Threatened Species, http://www.fws.gov/endangered/20 13/Report_to_ Congres s2.pdf , at 4 (July 2013).", "Federal agriculture policy supports the production of agricultural commodities used directly or indirectly in the production of energy. The support is provided by the federal government through its existing agricultural policy. The government provides the support via the subsidized commodity price levels, through tax incentives, and through regulatory incentives.\nFederal farm programs provide farmers (especially corn and soybean growers) with a steady and reasonably stable price at which to sell their commodities. The programs provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with authority to intervene in the markets with a tool to address the impact of price volatility.\nWhile the impacts of this support and the costs associated with them are difficult to determine with precision, some estimates have been prepared. Support for renewable fuels is an explicit subsidy embedded in the farm bill. Other forms of energy are not explicitly subsidized, but the effects of the price support program, federal tax incentives for various forms of energy, and other farm program mechanisms are generally available to farmers and ranchers. The most recent study for federal energy development, energy research, and production incentives was produced in 2015 for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.3 More detail about those analyses is provided in Appendix A.\nThe largest program that supports ethanol and biodiesel is the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC). The program provided a producer tax credit of $0.45/gallon for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline through the end of 2011. A producer tax credit for biodiesel was also provided and expired at the end of 2013.\nMany other programs, primarily the federal crop insurance component of the federal crop insurance and federal farm commodity programs, provide financial incentives for farm production. These programs (in terms of expenses) are not intended to support development of particular products, but rather to provide a safety net for farmers. However, the programs are frequently employed to help make the business of producing products like ethanol more productive and competitive in the market.\nIn addition to the direct cash payments to farmers, federal farm policy influences the price paid to farmers for their crops. In part, this occurs because of the federal support system that guarantees a minimum price for most commodities. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 farm bill; P.L. 107-171), Title IX, is referred to as the \"2002 Energy Security Initiative\" because it provides support for increased production of the fuels ethanol and biodiesel.31 The 2008 farm bill (2008 farm bill; P.L. 110-246) continued programs to support new biofuels production, extending them through at least 2012. Those programs were reauthorized retroactively for FY2011 and FY2012 by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55). For FY2015, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) extended through 2016 the 2008 farm bill funding.\nPrior to 2013, farm policy also influenced the price farmers received for crops used in the production of gas and diesel fuels. The 2002 farm bill provided for three years of additional federal support for domestic farmers via the farm commodity programs and, thereby, for manufacturers of agriculture-based energy products.32 An amendment offered by Rep. Mike Simpson during floor consideration increased this support from three to five years.33 The final version, however, extended the subsidized commodity prices for only two years. The final provisions retained the original three-year program, with a one-year amendment to address some minor technical shortfalls in the legislation.  The 2008 farm bill and the 2014 farm bill continued this practice.\nFarm policy, therefore, plays a role in influencing the price of energy products through the effects of its agriculture support programs . However, that influence is very indirect through the production of raw materials and not through direct subsidies for particular energy products. Most of the support for this indirect provision comes in the form of farm", "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund the routine activities of most federal agencies. This process anticipates the enactment of 12 regular appropriations bills to fund these activities before the beginning of the fiscal year. When this process has not been completed before the start of the fiscal year, one or more continuing appropriations acts (commonly known as continuing resolutions or CRs) can be used to provide interim funding pending action on the regular appropriations. DOD has started the fiscal year under a CR for 13 of the past 18 years (FY2002-FY2019) and every year since FY2010 excluding FY2019. DOD has operated under a CR for an average of 119 days per year during the period FY2010-FY2019 compared to an average of 32 days per year during the period FY2002-FY2009 (see Figure 1). All told, since 2010, DOD has spent 1,186 days?morethan 39months?under a CR, compared to 259 days?less than 9months?during the 8 years preceding 2010.", "more detail. 12 TIMELINE:\n2011 - 2017 - As mobile phone use has steadily climbed in the United States, Google has captured a dominant share of the online search market and advertising business; it has likewise dominated the online mobile search market and mobile advertising business. Over the same period of time, Google has used its dominant position in search to advantage its position in online search advertising; Google has also harnessed its dominant position in search-based advertising to make strides in online search.\n2017 - The European Commission fined Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.73 billion) for abusing its position in mobile device search. The EC found that Google placed restrictions on its business partners, preventing them from selling their mobile devices loaded with any search provider other than Google.\n2017 - At trial in a separate United States antitrust lawsuit, the jury unanimously found Google guilty of monopolization and abuse of monopoly power. 2018 - The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied Google's motion for judgment on the pleadings  in the antitrust lawsuit.\n2019 - The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), under Acting Chairman Maureen K. Ohlhausen, voted to close its antitrust investigation into Google. In a statement released to the public, Ms. Ohlhausen noted that, while \"[t]he FTC [had] the authority and expertise to review the acquisition and conduct of firms that use platforms to engage in online advertising and ecommerce, [she believed] that conducting such a review would be a disservice to consumers and to competition.\"\nMs. Ohlhausen elaborated, \"In particular, such a review could condemn certain common-place business arrangements that actually benefit consumers, and could wrongly hold those businesses liable for the actions of their users or customers.\"\n2019 - The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted final approval to the settlement of a large class-action lawsuit against Google over the alleged recording and use of certain voice data generated by Google users. Under the settlement, Google must provide $7,000,000 to non-profit organizations dedicated to the protection and promotion of the public's privacy-related interests.\n2019 - The FTC opened an investigation into the use of bots and digital assistants. The investigation is purportedly motivated by concerns over the misuse of consumers' personal data collected through digital assistants.\n2019 - The United States Department of Justice began an antitrust investigation into four of the largest U.S. digital platforms, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. 2019 - The FTC opened an investigation into the effects of \"vertically integrated\" businesses on innovation. Vertical integration refers to business arrangements in which a firm controls multiple stages in the production of goods and services, often through acquisitions or through the establishment of its own subsidiary concerns. The FTC has previously focused on enforcing antitrust laws against \"horizontal\" business arrangements, in which firms operate in the same market but are separated in the supply chain.\n2019 - The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FTC announced their intent to divide oversight over the digital platforms identified in their antitrust investigations. The DOJ will lead the antitrust investigations into Apple and Amazon, while the FTC will lead the antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook. The DOJ and the FTC will coordinate on the investigation into Apple, the FTC and the DOJ will coordinate on the investigation into Amazon, and the FTC and the DOJ will coordinate on the investigation into Facebook. The DOJ will also lead the antitrust investigations into Google and Apple. In the face of some public concern, both agencies have sought to disenfranchise their public investigations by releasing many investigative documents from this period.\n2019 - The FTC and the DOJ released their final investigative documents outlining their findings against Google. Based on evidence that Google had abused its dominant market position by requiring manufacturers who used Google's business apps to first install Google apps on their smartphones\u00e2\u0080\u0094thus limiting the market for competing apps and services\u00e2\u0080\u0094the parties entered settlement agreements with Google.

Among other uses, PFAS have been used in fire-fighting foams and in the processing and manufacture of many commercial products (e.g., nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics). There is scientific evidence that PFAS can cause adverse health effects in humans following exposure over relatively short time periods to relatively large quantities of PFAS and they are highly resistant to environmental degradation (i.e., biodegradation).

The program is funded and managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  https://nationaldefensegroup.org/careers/ndsig/aboutndsig . PFAS are structurally varied compounds that contain elements in the fluorine group of the periodic table. They also vary by chain length and chemical structure. Among these chemicals is perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which were first used commercially in the 1940s and 50s, respectively.3 Together, PFOA and PFOS account for an estimated 57% of global manufacturing volume of PFAS, with the largest share (about 45%) coming from the production of PFOA, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; see also Appendix 1 of the 2016 EPA report, titled PFOA and PFOS.4 Some other fluorinated compounds (PFAS) that are used commercially or on military bases are (see e.g., EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chemical Summary Report on PFAS) 1. FTOH, which accounts for about 73% of remaining global manufacturing volume. 2. GenX, which accounts for 8% of global manufacturing volume.5 3. Perfluoroheptyanoic acid (PFHpA). 4. Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) which accounts for more than 20% of global manufacturing volume. 4 The PFAS issue is particularly relevant for the armed services because of the long-term use of various related compounds in fire-fighting foams on military installations. Many studies have detected PFOA and PFOS in the serum of human blood collected from populations exposed to PFAS emissions from manufacturing and disposal facilities.6 5 FTOH is manufactured solely in China. A majority of the GenX is manufactured in one chemical facility in North Carolina. 6 CRS report R42685, Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl Substances/Chemicals: Concerns about Their Effects on Human Health and the Environment, by Rebecca Tsai.

H.Res. 6 amended the procedures for the consideration of House rules. It also implemented the new rule on the Consensus Calendar under consideration of House measures and made related changes to the procedures for the Committee on Rules . The first of those changes is the House's new procedures governing the consideration of non-reported and reported legislative measures when fewer than 290 cosponsors for any single measure are maintained for a cumulative period of 25 legislative days. These 25 legislative days (when the House is in session) refer to days when the chambers are officially in session, based on the determination of the Speaker. H.Res. 6 also changed references to rules in the House Manual and precedents, such as by deleting references to rules \"on page [X]\" throughout the House Manual. This is the first House rules change to be implemented without a reference to a specific page or to the actual page number in House manuals. The House first used this procedural change at the beginning of the 111th Congress, when pages were added to the 109th (2005-2006) edition of the House Manual to reflect the 2007-2008 rules changes. H.Res. 6 amended clause 5(a)(4) of rule XII for consideration of bills under the terms of a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules . The new rule requires that 15 minutes be allowed for each Member who participated in the consideration of a measure under the provisions of the special rule for the presentation of an amendment related to the consideration of the measure. It also requires that 45 minutes be allowed for each Member who participated in the consideration of the measure if a motion is made to recommit the measure . A Member who participates in the consideration of a motion is a Member who voted on the motion. Amendments made to a bill are in order even if the motion to recommit is defeated. These new procedures were first used on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, but were not used throughout that week. They were used again in a recorded vote on March 14, 2019, for consideration of H.J.Res. 43, to disapprove a rule of the Department of Labor; H.J.Res. 46, to disapprove a rule of the Environmental Protection Agency; and S.J.Res. 7, an initial spending resolution for fiscal 2020. The vote was held under an open rule . The next use of the new rules was on Tuesday, March 19, 2019, when the House considered eight bills using the open rules procedures in 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM votes (with one recorded vote each in the morning and afternoon on March 19, 2019, in which consideration of the first five bills was rejected). Each of the initial five bills, which were reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , received only 20 minutes to be considered on the floor. The House is also operating with a Morning Hour session . The Morning Hour is a 30-minute session that is available daily for any Member to use to address any matter of personal import. While a majority of Members are present, the Member using the Morning Hour is free to speak as long as he or she wishes and may speak with other Members as long as he or she wishes. The Morning Hour has no set time or place. The Speaker may permit any interested Member to use the Morning Hour, if it is the first use of the period in a given Congress, at their", "The government's purchase card program has its origins in Executive Order (E.O.) 12352, issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. E.O. 12352 directed agencies to develop programs that simplified procedures and reduced the administrative costs of procurement, particularly with regard to \"small\" purchases ($25,000 or less). Several agencies subsequently participated in a pilot program that evaluated the use of a commercial credit card, called a purchase card, as an acquisition tool. At the time, even a routine order for widely available items, such as office supplies, typically required agency program staff to submit a written procurement request to a contracting officer, who reviewed it, obtained the necessary signatures, made the actual purchase, and processed the associated paperwork. To critics, this process was inefficient, especially for small purchases. Not only was it time-consuming for both program and procurement personnel, but it prevented program offices from quickly filling immediate needs. Under the pilot program, nonprocurement staff used purchase cards to conduct small-dollar transactions directly with local suppliers, thus bypassing procurement officers entirely. A report on the pilot program concluded that purchase cards could reduce administrative costs and improve delivery time, and in 1993, the National Performance Review (NPR) sparked a number of legislative and regulatory reforms that were intended to increase the use of purchase cards. Building on the NPR's recommendations, Congress passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA; P.L. 103-355 ) in 1994. FASA introduced several reforms that increased the use of purchase cards. At the same time, the Clinton Administration took steps to enhance the use of purchase cards. Citing the need to make agency procurement procedures \"more consistent with recommendations of the National Performance Review,\" President Clinton issued Executive Order 12931 on October 13, 1994.

From start to finish, the confirmation process can be a lengthy one, even for relatively noncontroversial nominees. Each nomination is typically referred to one or more committees, usually with subject matter jurisdiction over the position, for consideration. Committees may bear a significant workload in examining nominees\u00e2\u0080\u0094often including questionnaires, optional public hearings, and individual meetings with Senators\u00e2\u0080\u0094to determine whether to report a nomination to the full Senate. Once a committee has reported a nomination or been discharged from its further consideration, the Senate may take up a nomination for deliberation, though a cloture process may be required for final approval. As part of an effort to streamline the nominations process during the 112th Congress (2011-2012), a standing order of the Senate, S.Res. 116, created a new designation of certain nominations as \"privileged.\" These so-called privileged nominations are subject to special procedures that may save the time of committees in processing these appointments. In total, there are 285 positions to which nominations are privileged, the majority of which are part-time appointments to oversight boards and advisory commissions, but they also include full-time chief financial officers and certain assistant secretaries to cabinet-level agencies. A full list of privileged nominations, organized by their committees of jurisdiction, can be found in Appendix . This report first examines, in detail, the special procedures under which privileged nominations are processed, as well as the action by which a Senator may have a privileged nomination referred to its committee of jurisdiction. Pursuant to Section 1(d) of S.Res. 116 , a privileged nomination goes directly to the \"Privileged Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar . There, the nominee and position to which he or she was nominated is to be recorded in a column entitled \"Privileged Nominations.\" A \"Yes\" is marked under this column to denote this transaction. Although under the terms of S.Res. 116 , privileged nominations technically are not referred to their committees of jurisdiction, these committees are still responsible for obtaining certain background information from nominees before they can be considered by the full Senate. Section 1(b) of S.Res. 116 directs that the \"appropriate biographical and financial questionnaires\" be collected from privileged nominees. This broad requirement gives certain committees some discretion in determining what information is required from nominees. Once a nominee has submitted a completed questionnaire, the chair of the nominating committee is required to notify the Executive Clerk\u00e2\u0080\u0094in writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094that this has been received. This notification completes the step of Section 3(e) of S.Res. 116 concerning privileged nominations. Under Section 3(f) of S.Res. 116 , a privileged nomination may not be considered by the full Senate until five business days after notification of nomination by the nominating committee is received by the General Counsel of the clerk of the Senate or the date on which the committee of jurisdiction has scheduled a public hearing to conduct a hearing and receive testimony concerning the nomination, whichever is sooner. Furthermore, privileged nominations are not referred to their committees of jurisdiction without a Senate consent to a privileged designation of the nomination. Once a privileged nomination is scheduled for action, the Senate may take up a nomination for deliberation, in which case the privileged designation is removed. For privileged nominations considered under special procedures, privileged designations may end at any time before reporting to the Senate calendar, as demonstrated by examples of privileges revoked that are discussed below. To proceed with Senate confirmation, a privileged nomination must first be reported to the \"Privileged Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar for a period of 7 to 10 business days. Unlike a typical nomination to which referral notification is received, the Office of the Executive Clerk does not confirm receipt of a privileged request to refer. After the period of review for action on a privileged nomination, the Senate is empowered by clause 6 of rule XXI to discharge the committee of jurisdiction from its consideration. Once discharge is requested, the committee must immediately discontinue its consideration of the nomination or a clot", "This report focuses on selected ground electronic warfare (EW) systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) FY2020 budget requests funding for a number of ground EW systems associated with the Army and the Marine Corps. Generally, ground EW capabilities seek to use the electromagnetic spectrum to achieve one of three battlefield effects. First, ground EW systems can be used to defeat Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). This was the focus of the U.S. military's ground EW programs for the past decade and a half. A second role for ground EW can be to defeat Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). A third role, largely a legacy from the Cold War, can be to jam enemy communications and radars. An overall issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify DOD's proposals for ground EW programs. These programs also pose a number of potential oversight issues for Congress. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect future U.S. military capabilities and funding requirements. Potential issues for Congress include balancing EW programs between counter-improvised explosive device missions and great power competition, potentially standardizing how different services approach EW funding, and the role new technologies may play in EW operations. Electronic warfare (EW), sometimes also referred to as electronic support measures (ESM), involves using radio communication, radar, or other electronic signals to deceive or attack an adversary. EW involves multiple types of operations. These can include using a jammer to create a \"noise field\" that interferes with an enemy's communications. Or, an operator can aim a powerful directional jammer at a single enemy target in an attempt to degrade or destroy that target. Aircraft and ground platforms often use Electronic Attack (EA) systems such as EC-130 Commando Solo and Joint Counter-Electronics High Power Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP). These systems emit powerful radio waves at high frequencies to overload and confuse a target's electronics, or interfere with them. Many types of radio masts and antennas can be used for EW, including the Army's Mobile Low-Power Antenna/Ground Jammers (MLGJ) (see Figure 1 ), and Mobile Counter-IED Electronic Warfare (MC-IED EW). Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) can be thought of as an offensive type of EW. For example, the Army uses ECM packages to locate and track targets, as well as the EC-130 and CHAMP systems. These systems emit false signals to trick an adversary's tracking systems into \"seeing\" jamming signals and treating them as enemy targets.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Legislative proposals have been introduced since the 105th Congress to create a national electricity portfolio standard that would require electric utilities to procure a certain share of the electricity they sell from specified sources. Twenty-nine states, three U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia are currently implementing mandatory portfolio standards, and an additional eight states and one territory have voluntary versions.  Various existing and proposed portfolio standards use a range of terms for similar concepts. A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) typically means a requirement to procure electricity from renewable sources. A clean energy standard (CES) typically means a variant of an RPS that includes some nonrenewable sources, such as nuclear or selected fossil fuels, in the requirement. Some lawmakers and stakeholders use these terms interchangeably, and some use the term CES or \"clean energy\" to refer only to renewable sources. This report uses the more generic term \"portfolio standard\" to avoid confusion between RPS and CES. At both the federal and state level, lawmakers express multiple goals for portfolio standards. These include greenhouse gas reduction, technology innovation and job creation. Policy design choices, as discussed in this report, can influence the extent to which portfolio standards achieve those or other goals. Other policies could potentially achieve the same goals as portfolio standards. For example, tax incentives or funds for research, development, and deployment of technologies could promote the use of certain energy sources by reducing their costs. This report does not compare portfolio standards with other policy options, nor does it fully examine the costs and benefits of establishing a national portfolio standard compared to business-as-usual trends in the electric power sector. This report also analyses potential effects of portfolio standard design choices, with an emphasis on economic effects, environmental effects and potential interactions with state energy policies.  A number of government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, academic researchers, and private sector entities analyzed potential effects of a national portfolio standard in 2011 and 2012 because of congressional interest at that time. Since 2012, the U.S. energy information Administration (EIA) reports that total electricity generation was 4,047,766 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2012 and 4,207,353 GWh in 2018. This increase was driven significantly by a decrease in coal-fired generation from 44% in 2012 to 27% as of June 2019. Natural gas generation increased from 26% in 2012 to 35% in 2018 and renewable sources also increased from 12% in 2012 to 18% in 2018. Many expect these trends to continue. For example, EIA's projection of current laws, regulations, and market trends  show coal contributing 17% of total generation in 2050, natural gas contributing 39% and renewables contributing 24%.", "Summarization is a critical reading ability. Most academic articles, including your own work, can be summarized effectively in one or two paragraphs. Summarizing is the process of identifying the central point or the important aspects of a particular piece of writing. In order to summarize effectively, you need a clear understanding of the source text. You need to be attentive when you read so that you can understand the content, logic, and organization of the writing. You must read closely and carefully, so as to grasp a sense of the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaning and intent. The key to writing an effective summary is to identify and emphasize the main ideas. To do this, you must find the topics discussed in the source and present the topics of the source. Identify the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main points and the evidence used to support them. To be effective, a summary must be clear, accurate, and relevant. You must avoid personal opinions and interpretations. You also need to provide transitions to highlight the similarities or differences presented in the text you are summarizing. It is critical that the reader understand how the topic you are discussing fits into the larger context provided by the source text. Finally, it is important to present the ideas in a logical manner based on the organization of the text you are summarizing. In sum, to summarize you must: select the important ideas and ignore the unsupportive ideas; interpret accurately while ignoring any opinions and conclusions; express your ideas in accurate, concise, and clearly focused sentences; use transitions clearly and accurately; be clear and concise, be logically structured, and include relevant sources.", "Executive Order 13767 declared that \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the policy of the executive branch to \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under authority of the 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72808 the Department of\nMCCONNELL (IN DRAFT), 85th CONGRESS 1ST SESSION S. 15\nUnited States \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 U.S. Codes and Statutes \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USCC Congress.gov\nUnited States \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 U.S. Statutes at Large \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USCC Congress.gov", "TEXT: As the technological needs of an increasingly mobile society increase, the choices in how and when we use energy are growing. An increase in the power requirements for smaller and smaller devices has resulted in new technologies improving the density of energy storage in these devices. With these improvements has also come a wider array of applications for power storage on the electric grid and in electric vehicles (EVs). Energy storage is being increasingly investigated for its potential to provide significant benefits to the interstate transmission grid, and perhaps to local distribution systems and thus to retail electric customers. Interest in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy sector to mitigate climate change risks has increased the focus on renewable sources of electricity. While energy storage is seen as an enabling technology with the potential to reduce the intermittency and variability of wind and solar resources, energy storage resources would have to be charged by low or zero emission or renewable sources of electricity to ensure a reduction of greenhouse gases. This report will describe technologies for storing electric power, with an emphasis on battery systems, focusing on the readiness of the technologies for various storage applications for electric power services to the electric grid. Congress has held hearings in the 116 th session on a number of topics\u00e2\u0080\u0094including climate change mitigation, electric power system resilience, incorporation of more renewable energy into the grid\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which have considered the opportunities for increasing energy storage. As of September 2019, more than 40 bills have been introduced in the 116 th session addressing various aspects energy storage technologies and research. Given the many uses for energy storage\u00e2\u0080\u0094both current and projected\u00e2\u0080\u0094this report will discuss some of the main drivers for energy storage. This report will also discuss the challenges for energy storage and potential options for Congress to further explore, if it chooses to advance the technologies to meet societal or other goals. Electricity, as it is currently produced, is largely a commodity resource that is interchangeable with electricity from any other source. Since opportunities for the large scale storage of electricity are few, and electricity is transmitted almost instantaneously, keeping power generation in balance with demand is an important function of system managers. Some regions of the United States have their maximum demand for electricity in the summer months (driven by air-conditioning loads), and some have a maximum demand for electricity in winter months (to meet residential and building heating purposes). Figure 1 is illustrative of the daily cycle of demand for electricity (i.e., the load), and how \"peaking generation\" (generation normally operated only during the hours of highest daily, weekly, or seasonal loads) and \"intermediate load generation\" (normally operated on a daily cycle to serve load) are utilized to meet the daily load needs. The thicker gray line in the figure shows a smoother system response after damping of the fluctuations (shown by the undulating yellow line) with intermediate load generation. In the figure, electricity generated from peaking sources to meet the demand peak on the right side of the figure must be curtailed at the end of the peak period and released during the trough period (daily demand minimum) to be used efficiently. Additionally, there is a greater need to supply intermediate load generation when the demand curve changes. As Figure 2 illustrates, the demand curve is generally upward-sloping over the summer, and generally upward-sloping over the winter. Figure 3 presents a monthly variation of the demand peak. As electric consumption patterns and electric power generation resources change, new generation projects may have to be built, and some existing generation projects may have to be retired. Projections forecast a peak daily electric load on the interstate system of nearly 300 GW by 2040. The Department of Energy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Energy Innovation Hub projects that a \u00e2\u0080\u009c100% renewable electricity grid\u00e2\u0080\u009d (i.e., using intermittent renewable energy and some storage resources) is achievable without reliably predictable carbon-free interstate electricity resources in the United States. Additionally, electricity generated at noninterstate sources (i.e., from distributed sources), which would not have access to the interstate transmission grid, could meet 18% of forecasted load through use of energy storage. This would entail the implementation of approximately 72 GW of electric power storage resources by 2040\u00e2\u0080\u0094a rate of nearly 7 GW per year.", "U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecast U.S. coal production to decline through 2050, with the sharpest reduction to occur during the mid-2020s. Consequently, the coal industry's decline has contributed to economic distress in coal-dependent communities, including increased unemployment and poverty rates. In response, the Obama Administration launched the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Plus Plan, which addressed the coal sector's decline through funding for (1) economic stabilization, (2) social welfare efforts, and (3) environmental efforts. The economic elements were organized within the POWER Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative to provide economic development funding and technical assistance to address economic distress caused by the effects of energy transition - principally in coal communities around the United States. The POWER Initiative was launched in 2015 as a multi-agency approach to energy transition. As proposed, the POWER Initiative involves the participation of the Department of Labor, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Small Business Administration, the Economic Development Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the Department of the Interior. The 2016 President's Budget requested approximately $56 million in POWER Initiative grant funds. This report considers the background of the POWER Initiative and the broader effort of which it was a precursor. The POWER Initiative is supported by Congress as reflected by consistent annual appropriations. The POWER Initiative may be of interest to Congress as an economic development program that actively facilitates energy transition and ameliorates the negative effects of that transition. The POWER Initiative was launched in 2015 in the context of an Obama Administration broader \"POWER Plus Plan\" to address the decline of America's coal industry sector. The POWER Plus Plan was organized as three pillars: a. economic stabilization and workforce development - focused on job training and employment opportunities; b. social welfare and diversified development - focused on health care, mental well-being, and cultural preservation, in addition to economic diversification; c. environmental cleanup and reclamation - focused on addressing the negative implications of an extractive approach to the Earth's mineral resources. The POWER Plus Plan, in conjunction with complementary Presidential and Executive Branch initiatives, was proposed as a broader federal approach to the decline of the nation's coal production. The POWER Plus Plan was expected to launch a significant interagency effort to address the challenges associated with coal sector decline. The multi-partisan POWER Plus Plan was, in fact, proposed as part of legislation, the POWER+ Plan Act of 2015 (S. 875 and H.R. 3986), introduced in the 114th congressional session. The proposed POWER+ Plan Act of 2015 reflected the scope of the Obama Administration's proposed POWER+ Plan policy, which was supported in federal fiscal year (FY) 2016 and later. It was included in President Obama's FY2017 Budget Request. In the Senate, S. 875 was introduced by Senator Joe Manchin III (D-WV) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) on April 28, 2015, and referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs. In the House, H.R. 3986 was introduced on November 4, 2015, by Representative Marc A. Veasey (D-TX) and referred to the Committee on Natural Resources. It was, initially, co-sponsored by Representatives Gene Green (D-TX), John Yarmuth (D-KY), Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Terri A. Sewell (D-AL), Katherine Clark (D-MA), Rick Larsen (D-WA), and Dina Titus (D-NV). S. 875 and H.R. 3986 would have authorized $2 billion in funding over a 10-year period for efforts to transition to clean", "", "As the 2018 AMS stated, the Army seeks to become \"dominant across all areas of warfighting and build the force able to fight and win against adversarys in the future.\" The Army intends to execute its modernization and transformation programs to achieve \"full lethality\" across the ground combatant forces and establish \"full dominance\" over its adversaries by \"2035,\" as the 2018 AMS stated. To achieve full lethality, the Army intends to deploy the world's best combat systems by fielding 19,000 new combat vehicles, by \"2035.\" The Army has also begun to build and deploy new, technologically advanced, lethal ground combatant forces aimed at conducting multi-domain warfighting by, for instance. integrating air and ground offensive and defensive systems into a unified network. The Army's 2019 AMS describes the Army's new operational concept called Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), which is focused on conducting operations across multiple domains - land, air, sea, cyber, outer-space, and the electromagnetic spectrum. The 2019 AMS also seeks to re-invent the Army through changes in doctrine, force structure, mission sets, and force management. These elements are designed to facilitate the Army\u2019s ability to conduct MDO. As the 2018 AMS stated, this plan will be completed in three phases. Phase One: Maintain lethality and \"fight and win, across all domains\"; Phase Two: \"Dominate across the domains\" and Phase Three: \"Transform the force to lethality in a competition.\" For this report, the oversight challenges will focus on two modernization plans: The \"Beyond Mid-Tier\" combat vehicle, meant to succeed the M1 Abrams tank, and the Next Generation Combat Vehicle planned to replace the Stryker combat vehicle. These two programs would appear to be the first in a line of upgrades to the Army\u2019s combat vehicle force structure meant to transition the Army as it undergoes a series of modernization and transformation actions over the next decade. Both of these initiatives involve planned investments in large numbers of new combat vehicles that would seem to be part of the Army's plan to transition to the concept MDO. It is unknown at this time whether the Army will ultimately pursue the two programs described in this report, but it is possible that they could influence the Army's decision-making and inform its ultimate development of these two critical capabilities as components of modernized combat force.", "O ver the last several years, the public and lawmakers in the United States have been alarmed over the increasing number of drug overdose deaths , most of which have involved opioids. Congress has responded to the issue through legislative activity , oversight, and funding, while the Administration has sought to reduce the supply and demand of illicit drugs through enforcement, prevention, and treatment. This FAQ report answers questions about the opioid epidemic and federal efforts to control the supply of opioids. It does not provide a comprehensive overview of opioid abuse and the criminal justice response. Instead, it answers common questions that have arisen due to rising drug overdose deaths and the availability of illicit opioids in the United States. This section answers questions on the nature of the opioid epidemic in the United States. The answers provide background on the types (prescription versus non-prescription) and number of opioids that are abused, the associated harm to the abusers of these substances, and the extent of the abuse.

Recurrent themes have focused on the automation design and certification process, on the oversight of pilot recertification requirements, and on the role of pilot training with respect to automated systems. In 2000, the Clinton Administration ordered all pilots flying commercial aircraft to receive a minimum of 50 hours to include instruction in automated systems. Also, the FAA is in the final stages of publishing new certification tests for pilots with respect to these automated control systems. However, there appears to be no formal safety requirements with respect to the automation of flight control systems and to training for pilots who are not using these systems. As automated controls have become more prevalent in commercial airliners, the industry has implemented lessons learned from accidents from past years to strengthen design criteria and certification standards for automated systems. Also, many countries outside the U.S. have developed programs to evaluate and improve the overall global aviation safety system. The U.S. government is in the process of strengthening and standardizing the pilot training programs for aviation safety in the U.S. This new emphasis on pilot training may have an initial burden on the industry with more training on automated flight controls. One issue in this process is that more sophisticated, high-tech automated systems may have a greater potential for accident, yet may require less certification with respect to pilot training and automation design. An improved understanding of the differences in the automated systems designs in light aircraft, commercial aircraft, and business jets is needed.\nSource: Committee on Aviation Safety, Board on Transportation Sciences, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences and, the National Research Council, In The Pursuit of Safety: Accidents, Organizations and Complexity: A Report for the National Transportation Safety Board (Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 2006).\nan unprecedented series of aviation safety conferences in collaboration with the European Union and other international partners. A focus of ongoing policy debates is the role of aircraft-specific pilot training in enhancing aircraft safety. The general concept of air carrier safety audits\u2014a form of unannounced inspection of an air carrier's operation\u2014has been implemented in both the United States and the European Union. The U.S. aviation safety audit process, known as Operations Specifications, is currently undergoing major reforms following problems noted in the GAO audit report cited above. These audit processes are intended to provide a comprehensive and systematic oversight function for all phases of an air carrier's operation. The audit process covers each operator's level of compliance with federal regulation. However, the Federal Register only contains the results of audits performed in the United States. Similar programs, such as the EU's Safety Assessment of Foreign Operators, do not disclose the details of their audit process and outcomes.\nAircraft-specific pilot training may also be limited in its effectiveness by the current legal environment in which pilot training, particularly for aircraft with increased automation, is not mandated or even regulated on the federal level, but instead on a carrier-specific level. Some contend that this has resulted in industry practices that are deemed undesirable from a safety perspective, including the creation of cockpit resources managers to serve as backups for the primary pilot or to serve as aircrew in lieu of multiple training-qualified pilots. The GAO report referenced above questioned the extent to which a single pilot is qualified to safely operate a large aircraft, arguing that cockpit design factors should not force single pilots into positions in which they are unable to be effective in an emergency situation. Although the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting rulemaking to address single-pilot cockpit and flight deck issues, the current requirements are the minimum qualifications necessary to serve as a first officer in the United States. No single-pilot aircraft is permitted to have an operating crew of fewer than three, but the FAA does not require any cockpit resource manager training (see http://www.faa.gov/go/notice).\nThe overall success of this process is limited if the policies do not directly address the causal factors of the accident. In a 2009 report, the ICAO recommended the development of international aviation safety standards that are based on ICAO member air carriers' adherence to a formal safety management program that adheres to international standards such as ICAO Annexes 6, 8, and 11.", "In 1883, following the assassination of President James A. Garfield by disgruntled job seeker Charles Guiteau, the Pendleton Act was signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur to ensure that \"government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\" The Pendleton Act ended the spoils system to ensure that qualified individuals were hired into federal service and to prevent the President from being \"hounded by job seekers.\" With the advent of the merit system, federal employees found themselves serving longer in government while also being attracted to private-sector jobs related to their federal employment. The movement of employees between the private sector and government is often referred to as the revolving door . Generally, the revolving door is described as the movement of individuals between the public and private sector, and vice versa. Individuals may move because they posses policy and procedural knowledge and have relationships with former colleagues that are valuable to current and prospective employment in the private sector. Some observers see the revolving door as potentially valuable to both private-sector firms and the government; other observers believe that employees leaving government to join the industries they were regulating, or leaving the private sector to join a relevant government agency, could provide an unfair representational advantage and create the potential for conflicts of interest. While Congress has passed laws regulating the revolving door phenomenon in the executive branch, there has to date been little data available about the underlying phenomenon. This report provides data on the movement into and out of government by executive branch personnel in President George W. Bush's and President Obama's Administrations. Using a dataset of executive branch Cabinet department officials compiled by graduate students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University in partnership with CRS, this report provides empirical data on the executive branch phenomenon as it relates to registered lobbyists. This analysis is followed by a discussion of select issues for potential congressional consideration.\nThe Pendleton Act made no explicit mention of lobbyists leaving government service to become lobbyists. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the lobbying prohibition was part of the original legislative history, and was incorporated into the Act.2 The first statutory reference to registered lobbyists in government service occurred with the formation of the Presidential Commission on Ethics in Government in 1977. The Presidential Commission recommended to Congress that \"no registered lobbyist would appear on the public payroll, nor would registered specialists in lobbying be detailed off the public payroll to work as employees of private firms.\"3 Under the Ethics in Government Act enacted in 1978, the prohibition against government officials working as lobbyists was extended to cover congressionally appointed officials and congressional staff. Also under EIGA, it was unlawful for any specialist in the practice of lobbying to be detailed under authority of the statute.4 Congress has since amended the Ethics in Government Act several times, expanding the revolving door restrictions to additional offices and government personnel.\nProhibition on Employment with Particular Entities. Section 207(c) of the act requires government employees to wait five years after leaving government service before seeking employment with certain entities, and also prohibits certain entities from employing lobbyists within that five-year period. Under the five-year prohibition, former government employees cannot lobby on behalf of any \"department, agency, or subdivision thereof of which such individuals were employees,\" unless they had completed a special one-day orientation program. In addition, employment may not take place if the former government employee was working in any \"particular matter\" (as explained below) or a related matter, involving a specific party for whom the lobbyist had specific responsibility while in government service.5  A lobbyist may not be employed by a private entity to lobby on behalf of an executive agency of general jurisdiction on any matter within the jurisdiction or control of the agency. The definition of \"executive agency of general jurisdiction\" includes the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Justice, as well as the United States Postal Service, whose functions are described in Title 39 of the United States Code. The lobbyist could engage in the lobbying activity if the individual served in senior management in the executive agency or other personnel who served in senior management, and who is subject to certain limitations.6  In addition, a former government", "This report discusses the use of tax policy to aid communities affected by natural disasters, including the 2019 major disasters for which Congress provided relief in Division Q of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94), as well as natural disasters occurring more recently. Under current law, natural disasters, like most other events, are considered to be nondiscretionary and unforeseeable for tax policy purposes and are therefore addressed with targeted tax relief. Congress can provide disaster tax relief by passing temporary or permanent legislation. Temporary legislation is intended to give federal taxpayers in disaster zones relief through provisions such as filing- and payment-due dates. Permanent tax relief may take the form of a provision excluding, for tax purposes, payments for damages, lost wages, and other compensation for damages. Provisions to mitigate the impact of disasters on farms or businesses can take the form of tax breaks, such as cash expensing. Tax-expensing breaks are the most likely targeted relief for an existing temporary provision in the 2017 tax law ( P.L. 115-97 ).

This population includes children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and those aged 65+. Medicaid is authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (SSA) and is financed by the federal government and the states. Federal Medicaid spending is an entitlement, with total expenditures dependent on state policy decisions and enrollees' use of services. Participation in Medicaid is voluntary, though all states, the District of Columbia, and the territories choose to participate. States design and administer their Medicaid programs based on broad federal guidelines.  The federal government requires states to cover certain mandatory populations and services but allows states to cover other optional populations and services. In addition, several waiver and demonstration authorities in statute allow states to operate their Medicaid programs outside of certain federal rules. Due to this flexibility, factors such as eligibility, covered benefits, and provider payment rates vary substantially by state.  At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for administering Medicaid. This report focuses on Medicaid eligibility for adults aged 65+ and individuals with disabilities. Specifically, this report examines the statutory provisions that provide Medicaid eligibility for individuals who are considered to be aged, blind, or disabled. Medicaid provides LTSS coverage (e.g., extended nursing facility, care, and other home and community-based services) that is generally not covered by Medicare or major health insurance plans offered in the private market.  As the largest single payer of LTSS in the United States, Medicaid plays a key role in providing LTSS. In FY2016, total Medicaid LTSS spending was approximately $101 billion, with $61 billion attributed to older adults and $40 billion attributed to individuals with disabilities. Although the elderly and individuals with disabilities accounted for 82% of both older adults and individuals with disabilities enrollment that year, they accounted for only 48% of Medicaid LTSS spending for both populations. The next section of this report identifies specific federal criteria for Medicaid eligibility. The report then describes specific waiver programs that states may operate in lieu of federally mandated eligibility requirements.\nYou are an expert at summarization.

The first U.S. trade action occurred on March 8, 2018, when President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports (with some flexibility on the application of tariffs by country) using presidential powers granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 authorizes the President to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the Department of Commerce that the targeted import products threaten national security. The targeted exporters, China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey, responded by levying retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products, and other goods. India proposed retaliatory tariffs but did not implement them until June 2019. A second action occurred in July 2018 when the Trump Administration used a Section 301 investigation to impose tariffs of 25% on $34 billion of selected imports from China, citing concerns over China's policies on intellectual property, technology, and innovation. In August 2018, the Administration levied a second round of Section 301 tariffs, also of 25%, on an additional $16 billion of imports from China. In May 2019, the Administration further raised the Section 301 tariffs effective August 27, 2019 on $200 billion of imports from China. On August 23, 2019, China further retaliated by levying two additional sets of tariffs: 5% or 10% tariffs on U.S. imports, including 695 different U.S. agricultural tariff lines effective September 1, 2019; and another 5% or 10% tariffs on U.S. imports including 184 different U.S. agricultural tariff lines effective December 15, 2019. During 2018, China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey jointly levied retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,100 products. In response to U.S. action, India implemented the retaliatory tariffs identified in 2018, with some changes, effective June 16, 2019. On May 17, 2019, the Trump Administration reached an agreement with Turkey to increase U.S. imports of U.S. agricultural products and exempt these additional products from the September 1, 2019, list of targeted U.S. goods. On May 19, 2019, the Administration announced plans to further exempt additional U.S. agricultural products from the December 15, 2019, targeted list of U.S. goods. These changes increased the value of U.S. goods excluded from the original September 2019 and December 2019 retaliatory tariff lists. U.S. imports include shipments of agricultural products that were exported from the United States, but may return to the United States, and shipments of agricultural products that were exported from foreign countries and imported into the United States. To avoid confusion, this report uses the U.S. Census Bureau definition of imports, which is the sum of both the foreign exports entering the United States plus the foreign exports that were exported from the United States but, in the case of perishable food, have been returned to the United States to be sold here plus the foreign goods that were exported from the United States but were sold overseas. In order to distinguish between imports of U.S. products originating from other countries and imports of U.S. products originating here, the report will refer to the trade figures for imports that contain U.S. products as \"foreign\" or \"U.S.-source\" imports.

However, the type and, to a certain extent, the number of debt holdings vary with economic and demographic characteristics such as age, income, and geographic location.\nThe increase in household debt has been a dominant trend in the SCF data since the first survey conducted in 1983.  The number of households with at least one outstanding installment loan increased from 40 million (64%) in 1983 to 59 million (73%) in 2016 and the median outstanding debt amount increased from $4,200 to $12,450 during the same period (Figure 1).  The average median debt increased from $10,109 to $13,478.\nThe share of seniors aged 74 and older with any installment debt increased in every decade since 1983 but their aggregate debt level decreased from an average of $29,401 to an average of $16,953 over the sample period (Figure 2).\nDebt was concentrated among those living in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs); 18% of households with debt in MSAs are considered severely burdened by the amount and the type of debt that they have, compared with 10% of those in non-core urban areas (Figure 3). However, non-core urban areas have the largest proportion of households with debt\u00e2\u0080\u00948 million households (94%) compared with 40 million households in the MSA areas (80%).\nAs the median age of the population continues to increase, the population of older people with debt is expected to rise, and these older people have experienced greater increases in debt relative to other age groups. In addition, 70% of the total aggregate debt held by households headed by those aged 65 and older is held by households headed by the oldest \u00c2\u00bd of the elderly. These factors suggest that debt burdens among the elderly could increase as the population ages; hence, there may be a concern that more retirees may not have enough resources to fund their retirement.\nThe share of retirees borrowing by taking out home equity loans relative to other borrowing has increased 13 points (from 15% in 2001 to 28% in 2011), a trend that is projected to continue (Figure 4). There could be a financial motive for this recent increase in home equity borrowing since rising interest rates have made a large part of fixed income more risky and expensive.\nBurdened by debt, these older people may also not be positioned to fund their retirement in full. Most Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 debt levels are much lower than their net worth.  Only 4% of those aged 60 and older had net liabilities at the median level of assets (in 2013), and the majority of the total net worth is in the form of home equity (Figure 5).\n\u00c2\u00ac\u00c2\u00ac2  Increased debt burdens among the elderly have implications for retirement, as the ability to save\u00e2\u0080\u0094and eventually retire\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be constrained by the increasing obligation to repay higher levels of debt in older age.  Debt obligations on a fixed income may be especially difficult to manage compared to a more flexible income that can adjust to repaying those obligations as income and expenses converge.  Increased borrowing by the elderly, especially in 401(k) and retirement accounts, might make it difficult to build sufficient wealth for retirement.\n\u00c2\u00ac\u00c2\u00ac4  4.  Housing characteristics, such as home equity, may be increasingly important for meeting retirement commitments.  While a high level of debt limits the future savings and retirement investment, the proportion of these households headed by the oldest people who have home equity has been more stable than debt liabilities.  According to the US Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans headed by individuals aged 65 and older that own their homes dropped from 65% in 1983 to 61% in 2009.  Nevertheless, the home ownership rate increased by 0.9% of total households in 2016, but the proportion of those owned by the elderly headed by the oldest \u00c2\u00bd of the elderly population\u00e2\u0080\u0094 16% in 2001 to 19% in 2016\u00e2\u0080\u0094", "U.S. government funding for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021 is constrained by a process known as sequestration, as provided for in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act; P.L. 99-177), as amended by the BCA. Sequestration provides for across-the-board spending cuts\u2014called \"sequestration cuts\"\u2014across federal programs on both sides of the discretionary/mandatory spending divide.

Before HAVA, federal law made it clear that states are chiefly responsible for conducting elections. Some Members of Congress argued that the new requirements of HAVA contradicted that traditional balance of authority. HAVA, however, maintained the basic structure of federal laws, and federal courts have upheld the validity of HAVA's requirements. Members in the 112 th Congress introduced legislation, for example, to eliminate or cut federal funding or to provide states with additional authority to opt out of HAVA requirement. The 113 th Congress did not act on any of those measures, which stalled in committee, and HAVA's funding for states' improvements to their election systems was not affected. (2) whether, and how, the EAC should have regulatory authority to enforce the federal election administration requirements. HAVA, like the laws it amended, did not direct the EAC to have any regulatory authority. The EAC's founding legislation, however, granted it limited regulatory power over federal writing instruments. The EAC has been active in providing information to states about meeting HAVA's mandates, including guidance on some requirements, but it has no explicit regulatory mandate over federal election administration. In contrast, the EAC has received regulatory oversight and funding from states and localities to monitor their compliance with HAVA. TEXT: CONCLUSION: HAVA established the Election Assistance Commission as an independent agency of the federal government, charged with helping states administer federal elections. Its purpose in part is to fund election-related grants to states and localities in support of improvements to their election systems. It also helps states and localities provide election-related information to federal agencies and oversees and enforces state compliance with federal election administration requirements. Congress has enacted legislation related to HAVA in each Congress since its passage, primarily expanding the EAC's role as an information and technology clearinghouse for states and localities and making various amendments to its mandates about improving the administration of federal elections. The 112 th Congress introduced legislation to rescind or reduce HAVA's grant funding to states, and the 115 th Congress introduced legislation to limit the EAC's regulatory authority. To date, all of those measures have stalled in committee. TEXT: The Help America Vote Act of 2002 required states to provide public information about how to register to vote, how to request and return the absentee ballot, and the dates by which ballots must be returned to be counted. States must also provide publicly available information about where and how to vote, including instructions on how to use voting-equipment technology and how to cast ballots in person or by mail. Voter registration information must also be available from statewide voter-look up resources as part of other publicly available voter information. HAVA mandates federal grants to states to help them meet and maintain these standards. HAVA also established requirements related to registration and vote by mail, voter identification, and polling place accessibility, as well as requirements addressing standards for voting technology and election-management requirements. Each state or territory must also send voter-look up data to the EAC, and states must also create and operate a toll-free telephone and TTY-accessible number to provide information to voters and respond to their questions. The EAC was established to help states meet these voting-related responsibilities. To meet those responsibilities, for example, EAC grants help states provide services for voting in accessible polling places, help states develop online voter registration systems, inform voters about polling-place accessibility requirements, and conduct election-related research. For some provisions, states and localities are required to consult with EAC staff for assistance or approval. For others, the EAC does not have jurisdiction or regulatory power at all but provides technical expertise and guidance to states and localities.\nFull Text EaC Reauthorization: Issues and Options, CRS Report R45599 HAVA established the EAC as a federal independent regulatory commission with rulemaking and enforcement responsibilities, and specified that the EAC can charge states for its services.

The initial legislation proposing a domestic \"Rare Earths and Critical Materials Procurement, Promotion, and Protection Act\" was introduced in 2009. It was reintroduced in 2010 and 2011. The initial bill from 2009 called for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to create a list of rare earth minerals deemed potentially critical to the national security, and also called for the development of a list of rare earth mining and processing companies. The initial bill also outlined several proposals for the development of a domestic supply chain, including the use of \"mandatory sourcing,\"  meaning the use of U.S.-controlled and/or U.S.-owned rare earth refining companies and separation facilities.\nThis bill also called upon the U.S. Government to develop a program that would establish a \"stockpile\" consisting of strategic reserves of key minerals and metals\u00e2\u0080\u0094and especially a stockpile of heavy rare earth oxides\u00e2\u0080\u0094that could be used for defense-related manufacturing and production.\nEssentially, this bill stated that the U.S. Government should \"proactively seek to expand a domestic marketplace for the rare earth industry to the greatest extent possible while developing domestic mineral reserves to ensure reliable access to rare and other minerals which play a vital role in manufacturing critical components necessary for the national defense stockpile and essential civilian manufacturing needs.\"\nIn 2017, the USGS released its second \"Report to Congress on the Ability of Mines to Supply Critical Materials.\" This report found that \"a supply chain shortage of [rare earth elements(REEs)] is unlikely over the next 20 years if the current level of production remains, or even expands through the increase or start-up of existing mines.\" REEs are a subset of critical minerals and are important to various end uses such as national defense, renewable energy technology, and a wide range of electronic devices. In 2018, The White House released its National Strategy for Supply Chain Resilience. This executive order set forth policy goals and guidance for \"prospering in an uncertaint\"economies and sustaining a resilient supply chain,\" recognizing that disruptions to critical mineral supply chains could have significant, long-term impacts on the economy, public health, and/or national security of the United States.\nThis document is a critical study of rare earth mining in North America and will continue its analysis of the current market state as well as the policy efforts outlined above and in subsequent documents and briefs.", "Russian military doctrine envisions two possible conditions for a nuclear exchange\u00e2\u0080\u0094a major conventional attack that Moscow believes is imminent or an unprovoked strategic nuclear first-strike. It describes the Russian response in the two situations as \"escalate to de-escalate\" and \"escalate to win.\" The doctrine, unclassified versions of which have been published, is the product of more than a decade of internal review and external consultation within the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the defense industries.\n(Page 194) 80 percent of all Russian nuclear warheads and bombers and up to 25 percent of its deployed ICBMs is not an insignificant improvement. Even with the limitations on the number of its deployed warheads, Russia remains in a position to inflict significant damage on the United States, should it choose to initiate a nuclear exchange.\nMembers of Congress may want to assess whether a major shift in Russia's doctrine toward preparing for a preemptive nuclear war and deploying more missiles to increase the number of \"targets exposed\" to a first-strike by the United States have impaired strategic stability. U.S.-Russian nuclear cooperation on arms control has its origins in the 1980s, when U.S.-Soviet summits produced several agreements intended to regulate and reduce nuclear arsenals. Although the Soviet Union did not adhere to many of the limits imposed by the START agreements, it did begin discussions about reducing offensive forces in parallel with its negotiations over START. By the early 1990s, the United States and Soviet Union were on the verge of agreeing to complete the withdrawal of their strategic nuclear forces, and U.S.-Russian talks were being led jointly by the two states' military delegations. Several proposals for arms control were circulated throughout the 1990s, but most proved unworkable. U.S.-Russian dialogue on arms control, in the intervening years focused on ensuring that Russian dismantlement of its nuclear forces took place within schedule and that all nuclear weapons materials were securely accounted for and stored.\nIn 2008, the Barack Obama Administration began a fresh assessment of options for arms control and nuclear relations with Russia. In late 2008, the incoming Obama Administration publicly announced its intention to conclude a treaty or other legally binding follow-on agreement to the 2002 Moscow Treaty to reduce strategic nuclear arms in accordance with START's goal. After years of stalled talks with the Obama Administration, Russia and the United States concluded the New START treaty in 2010. This unprecedented, legally-binding agreement reduced the number of U.S. and Russian missiles that were deployed on land, at sea, and under nuclear bombers to 1,550, which is the lowest figure since the signing of the original SALT I deal in the 1970s. New START also imposed limits on the production of missile systems and requires the two states to exchange data about their strategic forces on a quarterly basis.\nNew START was concluded in December 2010 and the treaty will remain in force for ten years unless the two sides mutually agree to extend its duration. The United States and Russia have not yet discussed whether New START should be extended, let alone whether it should be replaced with a new agreement. In recent years, there has been a public debate over a possible successor to New START and numerous arms control proposals have surfaced. Most of the proposals are premised on the belief that Washington and Moscow have significant incentives to negotiate a follow-on agreement to New START, as U.S. security interests were served by New START in ways that other arms control treaties would not, such as the INF Treaty.\nSome analysts argue that Russia's nuclear strategic doctrine remains focused on deterring an aggressor from using nuclear weapons, but that it has also increasingly emphasized the concept of using nuclear weapons first. At least one official Russian military document that sets forth this concept suggests that first- use, in fact, may be part of Russian military doctrine. One can infer from this text that Russia may indeed plan to be the first to use nuclear weapons, if it can be done without creating the impression that it has initiated a nuclear strike.\nRussian military doctrine also states that Russia can strike enemy nuclear forces with other weapons without using nuclear warheads. In recent years, Russia has continued to modernize its arsenal of nonn", "Text box 14 should include a summary about how the President has used veto threats, and vetoes in general, to promote legislation he would like to be signed into law.", "Public transportation is a central component of almost every region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land use, development, and economic development planning. Public transportation services connect communities and support residential, social, and cultural infrastructure by providing personal travel opportunities and enabling labor markets. Most public transportation trips begin or end with a rail or bus station or both. The rail or bus stations located throughout the region are hubs of economic activity, generating more than $1.2 billion in annual sales statewide and serving as an anchor for neighborhood revitalization, redevelopment, and tourism. Moreover, public transportation is a key tool in the fight to combat climate change. By cutting down on carbon produced by vehicles on the road and connecting people to services, economic activity, employment opportunities, and tourism, public transportation can help reduce carbon emissions, thereby reducing global climate impacts. The federal government has a critical responsibility to help fund public transportation.\n33323435965,44,0.\n5% 1% 95% 3% 95% 1% 5% 1% 55% 1% Federal Funds % of Total Funds Funds Cut Total State Funds % of Total Funds Figure 1. Summary of Sources of Funds to Pay for Public Transportation, FY2018-FY2020. FTA apportioned federal public transportation funds to New York State on the basis of federal, state, and local public transportation capital investments, new urbanized area (UZA) boundaries, and population. However, funding is only authorized for public transportation, including capital investments, projects that are planned, constructed, and placed in operation within the UZA. State and local contributions must match FTA expenditures. New York State was allocated 53% of all federal funds authorized by Congress in FY2018 for public transportation. This included 20% for non-urbanized portions of the state and 33% for the UZA boundaries. In New York State, there are currently 571 fixed-route public transportation agencies providing bus or rail transportation, as well as paratransit services. Within the UZA, there are 36 separate metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). There were approximately 65 MPOs and 22 planning and development districts that produced the 2017-2040 regional transportation plans. The FTA is the federal entity that oversees public transportation funds and programs. In the past, the FTA's programs and funds were administered by several individual federal programs, but these programs and funds were consolidated under the \"FTA Program\" through the passage of the ISTEA and FMTA, both administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT). The FTA is not a \"stand-alone\" agency. There are no stand-alone public transportation agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094all are under a single regional or statewide management, such as the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The Federal Transit Act governs the distribution of FTA's funding for all types of fixed-route public transportation systems, including bus and rail. The funding may be used for operating expenses or capital investments, as well as for supporting services such as the purchase of new buses or rail cars and the construction and expansion of public transportation related facilities such as bus depots or parking garages (U.S. GAO, 7-23-18). In addition, FTA administers the National Infrastructure Investment (smart) Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 $17.6 million for the expansion of the Capital MetroRail in Austin, Texas \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 $18 million for the modernization of MARTA in the City of Atlanta, Georgia \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 $17.6 million to construct the Gold Line light rail system expansion in Los Angeles, California \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 $9.9 million to support planning and design of the Albuquerque Rapid Transit Project in the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico The FTA administers a number of transportation planning grants and funds totaling $400 million per year. The CIG funds are allocated by formula. The funding apportionments are based on several factors including: (1) the size of the state's transit systems, (2) ridership, and (3) total state-federal matching funds. An additional $400 million for projects under the CIG program were included in the FAA", "Paid family leave (PFL) refers to partially or fully compensated time away from work for specific and generally significant family caregiving needs, such as the arrival of a new child or serious illness of a close family member. Because federal law guarantees workers unpaid time away from work in such situations, PFL is intended to provide a partial or full stipend to workers to enable them to take PFL leave and continue working, rather than needing to take lower paid or non-paying leave.\nThe Federal Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers who encounter specific family caregiving needs, such as the arrival of a new child or serious illness of a close family member. Workers can take FMLA leave to bond with a new child, care for a family member with a serious health condition, take medical leave when they are dealing with a serious medical condition, make arrangements to place a child for adoption or foster care, take qualifying exigency leave to address any needs related to the active duty service of a covered military member, or take military caregiver leave to care for covered veterans with a serious injury or illness. Under the FMLA, workers are eligible for up to 12 weeks of leave if they have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months prior to taking leave and work at a worksite where 50 or more employees are employed between 20 and 40 weeks of the year. Workers taking leave under FMLA or to care for an immediate family member are also eligible for unpaid leave to address their own serious medical conditions. The Family and Medical Leave Act is the only federal law that guarantees access to family leave from the job without threat of loss of employment or loss of pay.\nStates provide workers access to 11 different types of paid family leave through 10 laws, 7 forms of leave insurance programs, or both. These programs can use the funding mechanisms of wage or salary assessments paid only by workers, payroll taxes, both, or dedicated funding provided by the State or local agency responsible for funding and management of the leave program. Seven states provide a short period of family leave coverage of up to six weeks (6-7 in California); three states have family leave programs funded through state-sponsored workers compensation funds (NJ, 8, RI); two states provide paid family leave that is not funded by payroll taxes or worker contributions (RI, 15) and one state\u2019s program is solely funded by worker contributions as a part of their worker compensation benefits (NYS, 51).\nAll federal proposals seek to provide access to paid time away from work to those who face one or more of the specified family caregiving needs under the proposed law. These include caring for a new child, attending to the serious medical needs of a close family member, and addressing their own qualifying serious medical needs. The proposals vary in the number of weeks of paid family leave supported, the source of funding for the leave program, and eligibility for the paid leave.\nState-specific paid family leave programs can be categorized in two general ways\u2014\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d family leave in the sense meant in this report and payroll replacement programs that offer little or no guaranteed time away from work for family caregiving needs.\nIn the case of programs that were created or expanded to accommodate a variety of family caregiving needs (NJ, CA, DCA, WA, OR, WA, RI, NM), these states consider their programs to be true or partial paid family leave programs in the sense described in this report. This is the case even when the legislation does not specifically refer to the program as paid family leave or only provides for a limited number of days of PFL, such as New York.\nFamily Leave Act (NJ, 6), Paid Family and Medical Leave (CA, 6-7), the D.C. Universal Paid Leave Amendment Act of 2016 (DCA, 6-7), and the Washington State Paid Family Medical Leave (WA, 6).\nWhile these laws and programs provide significant increases in workers\u2019 access to PFL, the amount of actual time away from work is still generally lower than the 12-week FMLA. For example, as of July 29, 2018, only five states\u2019 programs guaranteed payments for the full 12 weeks of leave.14 In the other five states, the workers were generally allowed to use additional unpaid leave to take up to 12", "ANNOTATION:  This is an annotated bibliography assignment on summary writing.

As do large corporations, small businesses rely on loans to purchase inventory, to cover cash flow shortages that may arise from unexpected expenses or periods of inadequate income, or to expand operations. The Federal Reserve has reported that lending to small businesses declined during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. During the recession, many firms scaled down operations in anticipation of fewer sales, and lenders also tightened lending standards. A decade after the recession, evidence on whether lending to small business has increased is arguably inconclusive. Some small firms may be able to access the credit they need; however, others may still face credit constraints, and still others may be discouraged from applying for credit. Furthermore, drawing direct conclusions about small business access to credit can be difficult because available data are limited and fragmented. Congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in small business loans (SBLs), viewing small businesses as a medium for stimulating the economy and creating jobs. Congress' interest in small business credit access generally focuses on (1) whether small businesses can secure credit from private lenders and (2) whether small businesses can obtain such credit at fair and competitive rates. In other words, policy makers are interested in whether market failures exist that impede credit allocation by private lenders. Obtaining conclusive evidence on SBL market performance is difficult for several reasons. First, there is no consensus definition of a small business across government and industry. Moreover, as the Federal Reserve stated, \"fully comprehensive data that directly measure the financing activities of small businesses do not exist.\" Drawing conclusions about the availability and costs of SBLs is difficult without standardized benchmark prices that can be used to compare the relative prices of other SBLs. To address SBL market failures, Congress passed legislation to facilitate lending to small businesses that can demonstrate the inability to obtain credit at reasonable terms and conditions from private-sector lenders. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128) encouraged banks to address persistent unmet small business credit demands in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) required the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) to collect data from small business lenders to identify the", "Thornberry, TX 76875-7417\nMs. Julie A.

According to TASS, the president recalled the role of the Red Army in the victory in the Patriotic War of 1941-1945 and highlighted the modern military potential. The text also says that in 2011 the Supreme Soviet of Russia passed a decree and declared December 22 a public holiday and an official holiday - the Day of the Russian Armed Forces. The holiday is on Saturday, when in 2019 it will be celebrated. However, on December 22, 2018 a day of mourning is announced in Russia due to the crash of a Tu-154 aircraft en route to Syria in the Black Sea.  TENGRIAN - The U.S. will withdraw hundreds of troops from Central Asia over the next two years. About 500 troops from Afghanistan could be transferred to other regional states, where they will participate in joint training and exercises, and will hold negotiations on the status of American troops. This is possible thanks to the 2016 Enhanced Partnership with Central Asian States Act [19659003] In addition to Central Asia, 800 to 1,000 troops, depending on the successes of negotiations with the Kyrgyz government, could also be transferred to Kyrgyzstan, where the United States currently has a contingent of 973 troops. In October of this year, U.S. military Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to discuss the development of new partnerships, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and the fight against Islamic State in Syria. He met with President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev in Astana. In Tashkent, he discussed how the Pentagon could \"better assist\" cooperation between the security forces of both of these states. At a press conference, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, head of U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia, said: \"The U.S. military has begun this process with Afghanistan and Pakistan,\" indicating plans to move the number of troops. to South Korea, the site of the Combined Nations Forces Command, which operates joint U.S.", "Consumer access to the financial system in the United States is a complex matter. It is possible that a number of groups of consumers are inadequately \u00e2\u0080\u009cbanked\u00e2\u0080\u009d and do not have ready access to mainstream financial institutions or financial services. Some recent initiatives of federal and state governments have recognized the complexity of the process and aim to help address potential barriers to accessing financial services. These barriers are known and identified differently by policy analysts, regulators, market researchers, and academics, but they usually include the following areas: 1) difficulty accessing a bank account product; 2) poor or absent credit rating due to factors out of the consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control; and 3) poor access to consumer credit products. This report builds on past research on the issue of financial inclusion and takes stock of what is known about whether consumers are able to access banking services and nonbank financial transaction products. Data to measure access to credit in the alternative financial services (AFS) market are also provided to help analyze access to financial system and the cost associated with these products. The report is organized as follows. First, we discuss the CFPB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial well-being research, highlighting the financial products that are significantly linked to a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of financial well-being. This will set the stage for the discussion on whether financial system is adequately providing important financial access points and products that contribute to consumer financial well-being. Second, we present available data on the number and characteristics of consumers who cannot obtain credit from mainstream sources. This data will be used to estimate the impact on credit access of the inability to enter at least one of the three key markets. Third, we document some of the market-based and regulatory responses to this issue and assess the effectiveness of these responses. Lastly, we discuss the potential risks of overcompensating for underaccess to credit products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 namely excessive growth of high-cost credit products and consumer overindebtedness. TEXT END\nFinancial System, 15% to 20% of the U.S. population  The U.S. population includes some groups who may struggle to obtain credit or financial services because of factors outside their control. These consumers face many barriers to acquiring credit, in particular, and financial products, as well as related financial services. According to researchers, barriers to consumer financial access include low credit ratings (e.g., for factors such as a lack of credit history or credit inquiries within a short time period), the potential that consumers may be charged fees to access needed financial services, and potentially poor product quality. This report is the result of an assessment of these three barriers to financial access\u00e2\u0080\u0094credit access, access to needed financial services, and access to financial products of good quality. We use existing data, where available, on the number of consumers who fall outside these barriers, and we assess the effects of the barriers by measuring the size of the market of consumers who may potentially benefit from more complete access to mainstream financial services and products. 3.1  The CFPB Research  The CFPB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on financial well-being research provides a framework for assessing the impact of barriers to financial inclusion in part because this research is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of objective and subjective measures of the financial health of U.S. households. For example, according to the most recent CFPB survey on financial well-being in 2015, the financial security of U.S. households improved during the financial crisis, but it has not fully recovered. A large portion of U.S. households still live \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaycheck to paycheck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to CFPB research, in 2015 one in four U.S. adults reported experiencing a substantial, or highly adverse, economic shock in the prior year. The CFPB research reports, for example, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe average consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet reveals a precarious relationship between income and expenses:\u00e2\u0080\u009d consumers can cover their expenses on just one month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income, and more dramatically, consumers can cover their expenses on just one day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income. These results indicate a lack of resilience and a high level of vulnerability on the balance sheets of U.S. consumers that might translate into financial vulnerability for a number of households in the United States. Accordingly, we can better understand the concept of financial well-being by analyzing the", "The rapid growth of digital technologies in recentyearshas created new opportunities for U.S. consumers andbusinesses but also new challenges in internationaltrade.For example,consumers today access e-commerce, social medica, telemedicine,and other offerings notimagined thirty years ago.

As digital trade issues, there is more  the rise of cybersecurity incidents. Thesenewbarriers to digital trade also create new challenges forbusinesses.Businesses across sectors rely on digital innovations to reach more users and generate revenue abroad.Digital trade barriers limit U.S. companies' ability to reach export markets electronically. Barriers on marketplaces abroad, such as import restrictions or excessive foreign licensing requirements or regulations, may hinder or even prevent cross-border data transfers to support digital trade transactions.  The rules governing international data flow and the treatment of intellectual property (IP) rights are still being negotiated in free-trade agreements (FTAs) (e.g., the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), or the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield).  Moreover, digital trade is increasingly subject to tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and IPR incentives. For example, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) found the French government discriminated against and taxed foreign digital companies to subsidize French companies. The European Union has also raised barriers for the provision of digital services in the region.  In the U.S. context, some have argued that the  Department of Commerce's recent actions against foreign products through tariff increases, including those on ICT goods, are part of a larger national industrial policy approach to increase economic growth in the ICT sector. While the President may not be able to reduce digital barriers through USMCA or other FTAs, his Trade Policy Office could address foreign IPR barriers for digital trade through WTO negotiations.Congresses have oversight over U.S.  trade negotiations. Congress  has received USTR's authority to participate in digital trade negotiations with other countries through FTAs in USMCA and recent USMCA implementing legislation (USMCA Implementation Act) and may be further involved to review the new U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement<sup class=\"citation\" title=\"Citation\" id=\"cite_note-12\">^</sup>. Congress can also oversee digital trade policy outcomes as foreign governments implement these provisions.

The code also specifies how to deliver the Oath of Allegiance to the flag and appropriate decorum while watching the National Anthem performance. Most of the flag code contains no explicit punishments, and existing case law would suggest that such provisions is indicative and advisory only. Initiated efforts by states to punish either verbal flag disparagement or improper displaying (\"flag-misuse\" laws) have been invalidated on First Amendment free speech precepts which apply at a state level through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Federal law and some state laws also prohibit advertising images of the US flag or displaying the flag on merchandizing; such laws could also run counter to the First Amendment right of free speech. The flag code provides details on the visualization and the displays of the United States flag. The flag is to contain 13 horizontal lines stripped red and white; the union field should contain one star for each state. Flags should be flown from sunrise to sunset, unless an all weather flag is being used. There are instructions on how to proceed when a flag is being carried in a procession, when it is being flown over a roof, through a building corridor or lobby. Finally, the President can modify the flag's dress code. The US Supreme Court has frequently invalidated the application of flag improper usage or desecration laws on First Amendment free speech premises. In a Street v. New York, the court scrutinized the statute upholding the trial record for evidence of that the government's intents were to sanction the incitement of illegal activities and punishing only \"fighting words\". Further, the Court denied the argument stating that the code was to be narrowly defined to punish solely threatening or vulgar speech. However, other laws passed by the state which regulate only the visualization or the display of the flag have been invalidated on the First Amendment free speech premises which also exist for the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Course Clause. Federal law and some state laws also sanction the advertising images of the flag or the displays of the flag on merchandising; such laws can also run counter to the First Amendment right of free speech. The flag code describes the flag protocol for a private citizen. The flag should be raised briskly (without any slowdowns) and then lowered slowly (without haste). People standing and watching the ceremony should face the colors with proper posture. The official pledge to the flag is to be delivered with proper posture, as well. When flying a flag at half-mast, it should first be raised to the summit of the staff and then slowly lowered to the bottom. The same rules apply to placing a black band over the nation's colors. The President will determine which flag is to be used and the display of the country's colours on national, historic or state holidays.", "The U.S. Constitution imposes a duty upon the Senate to try federal officers (as well as federal judges) impeached by the House. As of this writing, the Senate has not imposed limits on the number and qualifications of Senators who may participate in trials to consider evidence and conduct the trial of an impeached federal officer brought by the House. In 1986 the Senate adopted a rule to require a roll call vote on the chief judge's selection of one or more alternates, but in most impeachment proceedings the chief judge has the constitutional statutory obligation to choose an alternate before any witnesses are called. To ensure the Senate's proper consideration of evidence from impeachment proceedings, the rules of both houses of Congress have been amended to require evidence produced in either House to be printed in order to allow all Senators (and House Members) to have the testimony of both witnesses and producers for study and reflection. Both houses have also considered the need for witnesses to be prepared to make their presentations as impeachment trials move along, for the time and expenses involved often may deter witnesses who otherwise would participate. For impeachment proceedings, the House and Senate both have established special investigating or evidence-gathering committees (often of equal numbers of Members from both parties) and established rules to protect confidentiality as appropriate. While the Senate may, in its discretion, choose how to conduct impeachment proceedings, certain basic rules regarding participation and decision-making have been followed with regard to Senate trials of impeached federal officer. Of the 27 federal officer impeachment trials since 1868, no witnesses were called to testify in eleven of 9\nSenate impeachment proceedings: An overview and summary of past precedents: 1789-present 7 them. 2 The Committee of the Judiciary reported three Articles of Impeachment against U.S. District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous: one Article on his failure to take his oath of office and two Articles on his neglect of duty and corruption. 3 The first Article relates to his neglect of duty, while the second Article contains corruption allegations of \"receiving\" payments to which he was not entitled, and \"giving\" unlawful payments to which he had no authority to give. 4 The Senate resolved all objections to the first and second Articles on March 11, 2010. 5 On March 12, 2010, the Senate voted that the third Article \"has been tried and adjudged to be sustained.\" 6 On March 12, 2010, the Senate resolved all objections to the third and fourth Articles. 7 On December 8, 2011, the Senate voted that Judge Porteous had been found guilty of the charges contained in all four Articles. 8 The Senate then voted to remove Judge Porteous and vacate the office he held. 9 Impeachment trials usually occur at times of partisan intensity between the parties holding congressional power. Consequently, the impeachment process in the House of Representatives usually follows more closely the partisan nature of the House of Representatives than does the subsequent Senate trial over the impeachment allegations. The chief clerk (the clerk of the House) certifies the Articles of Impeachment as well as the accompanying evidence and, upon request in writing by a Senator, makes available in his office the relevant records of the impeachment proceedings in the House. 10 Generally, the impeachment trial in the Senate begins with a reception of the Articles of Impeachment (an official ceremony where the Articles are received and announced to the Senate), followed by debate on what rules to follow during the trial. 11 If the Senate agrees, it may adopt special rules or guidelines for the impeachment trial. 12 However, the default rules for impeachment trials in the Senate are the same as for those who sit as jurors (12 U.S.C. Sec. 863). 13 The Senate trial committee (the senators elected to conduct the proceeding) also has the power to regulate its membership by selecting two or more alternates from among its members to act as alternate members of the committee as may be required. 14 The clerk administers oaths of office or secrecy to the members and staff of the Senate trial committee. 15 The Senate trial committee or a subcommittee thereof may conduct hearings, either at the Senate trial committee offices or on the Senate floor, and issue subpoenas to", "Federal investments in conservation are estimated to benefit farmers' and ranchers' water-quality and water-management concerns. To do this, Congress established federal-agency programs to promote conservation of soil, water, and related natural resources. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, P.L. 116-94 provides $151M for farm-bill conservation programs, a 34% increase from FY2019 levels. Congress provided funding for conservation of noncritical water sources to ensure water reliability for areas like the West Texas and Central Great Plains region. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized USDA conservation-program activities for FY2020 through FY2023. Increasing funding across all USDA conservation programs, especially at NRCS, is important to the success of these programs and helping agriculture meet the demand for increased productivity, nutrition, and health with limited natural resources and ecosystem services.\nDescription FY2020 USDA Agricultural Appropriations: Agriculture and Energy Programs: Summary\nReference TEXT: T he Agriculture appropriations bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094formally called the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u00e2\u0080\u0094funds all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service. For FY2020, the House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 3164 on June 6, 2019 (including H.Rept. 116-107 ). Funding for USDA was included in a five-bill minibus appropriations bill ( H.R. 3055 ) that passed the House on June 25, 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2522 on September 19, 2019 (including S.Rept. 116-110 ). The full Senate did not act on this bill by October 1, 2019, so FY2020 began without a full-year appropriation. To avoid a lapse in funding, Congress and the President approved two consecutive continuing resolutions to fund federal agencies at the FY2019 level ( P.L. 116-59 and P.L. 116-69 , respectively). On December 20, 2019, Congress passed and the President signed the FY2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 116-94 ), which includes agriculture and related agencies under Division B. This report provides a brief overview of the FY2020 appropriation for agriculture and Rural Development and related agencies, followed by a closer look at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). USDA administers a number of agricultural conservation programs that assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. To fund these programs, Congress created the Conservation Operations account in USDA's budget. The largest appropriated conservation program is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which provides farmers and ranchers financial assistance to temporarily idle environmentally-sensitive land, restore and maintain soil and water health. CRP began in 1985 and has had several notable expansions. The most recent expansion was a permanent CRP with a 5-year term authorized under the 2014 farm bill. The Conservation title within the Agricultural Act of 2014 is the primary authority for the program. USDA administers all discretionary funding to farmers and ranchers through the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which is housed within the Office of the Secretary. The FY2020 appropriation includes more than $151M for FY2020 funding for farm-bill conservation programs, a 34% increase from FY2019 levels. Congress provided funding for conservation of noncritical water sources to ensure water reliability for areas like the West Texas and Central Great Plains region. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized USDA conservation-program activities for FY2020 through FY2023. Increasing funding across all USDA conservation programs, especially at FSA, is important to the success of these programs and helping agriculture meet the demand for increased productivity, nutrition, and health with", "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and tribes to help them finance a wide range of benefits and services that address economic disadvantage among children. The report discusses the main issues in the current debate on TANF. It begins by describing the main issues that Congress considered in the debates leading to the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA; P.L. 104-193 ) of 1996, which established the TANF program. The report next provides an overview of the TANF block grant and how it is distributed to states. The report then discusses use of TANF funds to finance assistance for families, as well as to prevent child maltreatment. The report then discusses how TANF is administered, the requirements to promote two-parent families, and how states are held accountable for making progress. Finally, the report discusses the declining caseload and implications on child poverty, along with additional issues. Together, these issues raise questions about the purposes and operations of the TANF program, and about alternative means by which the federal government might be able to assist families with children at or below the poverty level in times of financial hardship. Tables and figures are not shown. The report is authored by Jacqueline Koss-Chioino, Laura Baughman, and Jennifer Stultz.", "In overseeing and authorizing the federal financial assistance programs and grants that account for approximately $750 billion of total federal spending annually (including an estimated $570 billion in federal grants to state and local governments) and for setting federal policy regarding these programs and grants, there is agreement that Congress as a whole, rather than any individual House or Senate committee, is the sole entity charged with authorizing federal grants-in-aid programs 2018-11-05", "Mozambique, in southeastern Africa, faces political, economic, and security headwinds, some arguably related to the continuous domination of the state by the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) political party. FRELIMO, a former armed liberation movement that fought for self-determination and freedom from Portuguese colonial rule, has held a parliamentary majority since achieving independence in 1975. Prior to a resurgence of political tensions and violence in 2013 between FRELIMO and RENAMO, a former armed rebel movement that is now the main opposition party, Mozambique was widely viewed as having made a durable transition to peace after its postindependence civil war (1977-1992). It also made a transition, beginning in the late 1980s, from politically and economically centralized, one-party, socialist rule, to a multiparty democratic system underpinned by a largely market-based economy. The development of large offshore natural gas reserves discovered in the country's north in 2010 is expected to lead to gas exports in the early to mid-2020s and, together with rising exports of coal, to spur rapid economic growth and reverse a slump that began in 2016. This downturn was preceded by nearly two decades of post-civil war economic expansion underpinned, in part, by inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) tied to large industrial projects. Corruption and elite use of political influence to accumulate private wealth also have grown over the post-civil war period (see below), with worrisome implications for the economy and stability. The post-2015 economic decline followed disclosures that the government had failed to report to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over $2 billion in state-guaranteed debt, which violated the terms of Mozambique's cooperation with the IMF. Along with broader indicators of corruption, the debt affair also prompted some observers to question whether the state has the political will and capacity to administer effectively\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in the public interest\u00e2\u0080\u0094a large projected windfall of earnings from the energy sector.

The company issues these securities to raise capital, with the securities backed by the assets of the company. They are also known as notes, because they pay regular fixed coupon payments to the bondholders, with the face value being paid back at maturity. Debentures are divided between secured and unsecured debentures. Mostly, the debenture is secured by a particular property and it is known as mortgage debenture . Unsecured debenture is known as convertible debentures . Debentures is also used to describe a form of security known as a bond in the USA. The difference is that the holder of a debenture does not have the security of a charge over property, but has a debt which can be enforced by civil proceedings. Unsecured debentures may be subordinated to other loans, for example to a bank overdraft, such that the holder of the unsecured debt would lose out in the event of the company's bankruptcy. Many countries have some kind of statutory debenture or legal debenture which allows a debenture to be issued or registered in a reliable way. In England and Wales, under the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989, any debenture issued under the terms of the company's articles of association without the need to be registered at Companies House in London is treated as having statutory authority. This means that the debenture should either be registered at the high court or given statutory notice to the company's creditors, as provided in the Companies Act 1985 and 1989. In the United States, the term debenture and indenture are used to describe two different but similar legal documents. An indenture is a form of security issued by a company in order to raise funds for the company, and is usually secured by property owned by the company. A debenture is a form of security issued by a company in order to raise funds for the company, but unlike an indenture, is unsecured and has no guarantee. When issuing stock, a corporation will issue a number of shares to be sold at a fixed price. When issuing debentures by debentures can be in the form of an indenture of debenture of stock, also known as a debenture of trust indentures, a form of financial security. Because its shares are backed by a mortgage, a corporation can be assured that it has a steady income to pay off its investors. This type of security is normally issued in a corporate bond which can be sold and traded on the bond market. It is similar in nature to the bond. This debenture stock is basically a secured loan. This is very different from preference shares where the dividends to be paid are fixed and does not increase with inflation. It also implies that once these dividends are paid, the remaining amount is not available. While preference shares are not guaranteed, they are senior in nature thus they receive dividends before ordinary shares. A debenture is an unsecured loan, which is subordinate to all creditors with registered fixed charge over the bankrupt company's assets and have no preference upon winding up over unregistered and ordinary creditors. These debentures do not have any security but only the security is provided by the general credit of the company issuing the debenture. Debentures are a very useful means of raising capital both for the owners of the business and for the lenders to it. There are many ways in which the money can be raised and it depends on what the business owner wants or needs. As the owner of the business is looking for the money, he can choose to put up the assets of the business or sell some of the assets by taking the money. However, there is a higher risk to the owner as if the business fails then the owner will have no assets with which to pay his lender. A debenture is a way of raising money for a business owner or company by offering a return to a creditor. The creditor purchases the debenture from the owner or company for a sum of money. The creditor gets the return of the promised amount of money (with interest) every month or year. The company or business owner agrees to pay the money back at some point in time.", "Adm. Frank Culpeper pointed out that in the Cold War, the US developed the Pershing II and the BGM-109 ground-launched cruise missiles for Europe. Those Soviet-satellite countries were told, \u201cIf you don\u2019t put in a Pershing missile in, we\u2019ll put in a nuclear cruise missile. And the first one is going to be armed with a nuclear weapon.\u201d The Pershing were deterrent weapons. The NATO countries decided that what we were doing was a better deal for them.\nUS HYPERSONIC WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT\nManned Airship\nThe first step in developing hypersonic weapons will require research into air vehicles that support a hypersonic (Mach 5, 7 or above) cruise-phase. Innovations such as the ability to provide on-board electric power generation, a high-temperature thermal management system, and structural integrity at hypersonic speeds (Mach 7 and above) will also need to be addressed. The goal of a manned airship system would be to increase speed and enable longer and more direct routes between points at sea level. A manned airship with its larger payload could be a game changer for the 21st-century.\nThe HSAM program was directed by Congress in 2017 to develop a hypersonic glide system to achieve hypersonic speeds (5,000 miles per hour or faster) against targets within a few thousand miles. While not weaponized, the HSAM program's glide vehicle can be guided by the USAF's Long Range Track. HSAM program has been under way since FY201\nHGVs are guided by a ground-based, mobile launch system to a high altitude, where they would begin a glide to a target. A HGV could take advantage of aerodynamic and other conditions found at approximately 60,000 to 140,000 feet (18 to 42.6 miles) above sea level. An adversary armed with HGVs could achieve rapid re-gaining of surprise that would degrade early warning and other pre-decisional or pre-conflict systems. Given that they are in a high-altitude, high-speed regime, HGVs are not considered suitable for deployment against targets on the ground, such as portions of a country or an airfield, as would be the case with cruise missiles. In early 2016, the Chief of Naval Operations approved the initiation of a feasibility study for developing HGV.\nHypersonic Flight Demonstrator Program (HFDP)\nThe Air Force\u2019s Hypersonic Flight Demonstrator (HFDP) program is intended to demonstrate aerodynamically generated lift for sustained flight of a hypersonic body in air. HFDP is currently developing a vehicle capable of hypersonic speeds (approximately Mach 20 or approximately 15,000 miles per hour) that will be launched from an F-15 aircraft over the Pacific Ocean. The F-15 will release the hypersonic test vehicle as high as 50,000 feet, and the vehicle will continue its flight after the initial launch. The F-15 pilot will use its existing radar and electronic support measures to track the hypersonic vehicle as it flies to Mach 14 (approximately 10,000 miles per hour). With the vehicle's aerodynamic control surfaces engaged, the F-15 pilot will safely descend the HFDP vehicle to lower altitudes, and at 45,000 feet to 50,000 feet, aerodynamically sustained flight will commence.\nThe HFDP will be released from an F-15 aircraft and will have an open-loop system using an onboard computer that provides only altitude control for the vehicle. HFDP flight will occur over water, with no capability to recover the vehicle. The F-15 will launch the hypersonic test vehicle from approximately 50,000 to 55,000 feet and at speeds ranging between approximately Mach 5 and Mach 10.\nThe Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV) program currently is conducting analyses and experiments to determine aerodynamic, heat transfer, and material properties in support of the Air Force's vision for an HGV that could attain speeds of Mach 20 (or 15,000 miles per hour). The HCV would use aerodynamic control surfaces to maneu", "Both legislators and regulators have expressed concern about the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs prescribed for \"off-label uses\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094purposes other than those for which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved their sale. Two recent incidents illustrate the bases for those concerns. The first involves a drug already on the market. Safety experts raised concerns about ketamine, a drug available as an injectable anesthetic. They noted that physicians have created outpatient clinics to administer intravenous ketamine in an off-label use to treat depression and migraines. FDA has not reviewed clinical data that could support the clinics' promotional claims of safety and effectiveness. In August 2018, a second incident occurred in a Texas courtroom. Astra Zeneca settled a case concerning its alleged promotion of Seroquel for uses other than those for which it had sought and obtained FDA approval for sale in the United States. The core of the complaint by the state of Texas was that the company promoted the drug's use in children, although the FDA-approved labeling of the drug was for adult use. It was one of a number of settlements since 2000 resulting in payments to drug companies for the promotion of off-label uses. To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To obtain that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations. FDA regulates the drug and the manufacturer. Each state regulates clinicians and pharmacies. A licensed physician may\u00e2\u0080\u0094except in highly restricted circumstances \u00e2\u0080\u0094prescribe the approved drug without limitation. A 2016 Canadian study examined 43 FDA-approved cancer drugs and compared their 99 labeled uses with the acceptable uses published by a national compendium Medicare relies on to make coverage decisions. Of the 45 approved uses, 29 were accepted, or 64%, as acceptable off\u00e2\u0080\u0090label uses. A 2018 study examined how drug labeling was being changed to allow these off-label uses. The authors found that the most recent drug labeling changes, or revisions, were for uses previously found to be unsafe or ineffective. The results from both studies illustrate why Congress has expressed concern about pharmaceutical advertising of off\u00e2\u0080\u0090label uses. To market a prescription drug under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (P.L. 75\u00e2\u0080\u0090410; 21 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 301 et seq.), a manufacturer needs the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval. It does that by applying for a new drug application (NDA). If approved, the NDA allows the drug to be prescribed to patients by licensed physicians and pharmacists in the United States. Congress has defined an NDA as \"a request for a type of premarket approval.\" That approval requires that a new drug's active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, and indications for use be \"safe and effective for use by any individuals.\"6 In FY2017, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research evaluated and approved 38 NDAs, 70 \"Abbreviated New Drug Applications,\" and 20 supplements to current NDAs or Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA).7 The latter two approvals concerned manufacturing changes to existing drugs, while NDAs involved new drug applications, including some that may later be used for other than the FDA-approved indications. The Prescription Drug User-Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA; P.L. 102\u00e2\u0080\u0090571) requires fees from manufacturers to fund FDA's activities that precede and follow NDA approval.8 PDUFA sets a goal that a product be approved or denied within a 12-month review period. FDA has not always met that goal; sometimes the period has stretched to three years. The application is supported by evidence for safety and effectiveness. In 2016, FDA stated that applications should include sufficient evidence \"on the quality and quantity of [the drug's] active ingredients [and their route of administration], the dosage form, and the indications for use.\"9 If approved, the manufacturer may sell the drug", "RATING SYSTEMS In the NFIP's current rating structure, flood hazard is represented by a combination of the risk from flooding (i.e., the average annual loss) and the flood risk zone for the flooding. Premiums are grouped in three sectors: (1) Standard Rate, (2) Preferred Rate, and (3) Graduated Rate. A property is categorized into a sector by its risk and location within a community.  In the Standard Rate sector, premiums are calculated using a formula that calculates the expected annual claims losses from flood events that have a 40% probability of occurring. The formula has two components: (1) an NFIP-community flood risk score that provides a relative indication of the likelihood of flooding and is used to determine the sector in which the policy has been categorized; and (2) an NFIP-structure flood risk score that is used to determine the level of risk for which a particular structure has been categorized. This latter component has three elements: Base Flood Elevation (BFE), flood vulnerability, and flood protection measures. Based on these components, premiums are calculated for each property group. Structures in the Preferred Rate sector have a lower probability of flooding, and thus pay lower premiums. Premiums for structures in these groups are determined using a simpler formula that does not use a separate flood risk score for structures.  Graduated Rates apply a sliding scale of premiums that increase exponentially with the value of the insured property. Premiums for structures in the Preferred and Graduated Rate sectors are subject to several factors that FEMA adjusts periodically: a policy processing fee, an expenses surcharge, and annual fee changes that are usually calculated as a percentage of the insured value. Premium calculation differs among the three rating sectors. In the Standard Rate sector, calculated losses represent the NFIP's actuarial calculation of the average annual losses for structures within the policy sector. A set of tables assigns a premium for each sector that is then modified according to the characteristics and hazards of the property. This is one of the sources of underinsurance, because some structures, although insured, are not rated for full value. For example, a policy written for a lower value home has the same premium rate as a policy written for a home valued at much higher than the stated value of the insured home. The policy would only be for the lower stated value and not the actual value of the home. The lower rates in the Preferred Rate sector reflect a simplified rating structure, which assigns premiums without using flood risk values to individual properties. In the Graduated Rate rating category, premiums are calculated by increasing exponentially in terms of insured values and increasing annually.  The Graduated Rate structure was used in the NFIP's early decades, before the introduction of the Standard Rate and Preferred Rate programs. FEMA introduced the Graduated Rate category in 1990 as part of its attempt to manage a severe financial deficit in the NFIP. At the time, this category had the highest premiums associated with the NFIP program. Currently, over 99% of the residential structures insured through the NFIP are in the Standard Rate and Preferred Rate sectors.", "The energy in sunlight can be converted into electricity in either of two ways: by using solar photovoltaic cells or by concentrating solar energy to produce heat for electricity generation.", "The unemployment compensation (\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160U-U) program is considered one of the major \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160social insurance \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160programs, in addition to \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160social security program \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160(\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160SSI\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160) and \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160supplemental security income \u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160(\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160SSI-SSI\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u0152\u00c2\u0160).

Congress directs USACE's civil works activities through authorization legislation, annual and supplemental appropriations, and oversight activities. This report summarizes USACE's annual discretionary appropriations for civil works activities, which typically are funded through Title I of annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. First, the report introduces USACE and its funding. Second, it summarizes the appropriations process through discussions of three major milestones: President's budget request, congressional appropriations process, and annual USACE work plan. Third, the report provides a brief discussion of trends and policy questions related to USACE annual appropriations. A military Chief of Engineers commands USACE's civil and military operations. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASACW) provides civilian oversight of USACE. The agency's responsibilities are organized into eight geographically based divisions, which are further divided into 38 districts. As part of USACE's civil works activities, Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for the agency to perform the following: water resource projects for maintaining navigable channels and harbors, reducing risk of flood and storm damage, and restoring aquatic ecosystems, among other purposes; environmental infrastructure assistance; regulation of activities affecting certain waters and wetlands activities; and remediation of sites involved in the development of U.S. nuclear weapons from the 1940s through the 1960s, administered under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). From FY2010 to FY2020, Congress provided USACE with appropriations ranging from $4.72 billion in FY2013 to $7.65 billion in FY2020. Unlike federal funding for highways and municipal water infrastructure, the majority of federal funds provided to USACE are not distributed by formula to states or through competitive grant programs. Instead, Congress generally funds USACE civil works through Title I of annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. In addition to funding the agency's water resources activities, Congress provides USACE with supplemental appropriations in some years, typically in response to floods. Most of these supplemental funds are directed to repairing damage to existing USACE facilities. For some project types (e.g., Levees), non-federal sponsors share the repair costs, depending on the extent of the Federal cost share (also see CRS Report RL33001, Flood Control: Levees and Other Structures , by Nicole T. Carter). For more information on supplemental funds for USACE and associated congressional direction, see CRS Report RL33575, Supplemental Appropriations for Army Corps Flood Response and Recovery .

Some of these provisions affect only high-income families and some only low-income families, but they are the tax code\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental structural features. They lead to varying tax burdens on families depending on whether the family is headed by a married couple or a single individual, whether children are in the family, and the number of children if so. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97, popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA) changed many of these fundamental provisions, although those changes are scheduled to sunset after 2025. This report examines those temporary changes and how they affect families and couples. The first section discusses the structural changes made in the TCJA, and the following sections discuss equity issues and the marriage penalty. Taxes are determined by first subtracting deductions (either the standard deduction or the sum of itemized deductions) and personal exemptions (for the taxpayer, their spouse [if married filing jointly], and each dependent) from income to arrive at taxable income. Then the marginal rate structure is applied to this measure of taxable income. All amounts in this discussion are for 2018, the year the tax changes were first implemented. Some amounts will change in the future as they are indexed for inflation. Under prior law, taxpayers could claim a personal exemption for themselves and each family member. Additionally, a child credit was allowed for each child under the age of 17. The child credit was (and remains) partially refundable. The refundable portion of the credit was limited to 15% of earned income in excess of $3,000. The tax law included \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarriage penalties\u00e2\u0080\u009d designed to increase the tax liability of couples. Taxpayers were often better off filing two married-filing-separately returns rather than a joint return. The law removed these penalizations. In 2018, taxpayers are married-filing-jointly who would pay the higher tax by taking the other exemption. If the parents are married but otherwise have two separate returns, the child tax credit is for the family with the most children in the tax year or, in the event of a tie, for the family with the higher adjusted gross income. The child tax credit was increased from $1,000 to $2,000 per qualifying child (the first $1,400 is refundable), and the credit was phased out at higher income levels. The credit was indexed each year to inflation after 2018. However, the law temporarily increased limits on tax benefits for children by allowing taxpayers to claim a partial credit for their children even if the parents cannot claim the child credit, by removing the $75,000 limit on the refundablity of this credit, and by temporarily raising the income level at which the benefits for children phase out. The increase was set to expire after 2019. The law suspended the itemized deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) for taxes paid and accrued during tax years 2018 through 2025. If individuals choose to forego the standard deduction and elect to itemize their deductions, the allowance for these SALT payments is not fully deductible. There is a $10,000 cap on the amount of SALT payments that are deductible as itemized deductions. Taxpayers who have large, complicated tax issues may want to itemize their deductions because of limitations on, and phase-outs of, the standard deduction. Furthermore, a married couple filing separately and one or both spouses claiming the standard deduction can use the deductions for each spouse when determining who is entitled to the deduction if the spouses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 filing statuses are the same. Under the TCJA, these provisions expire after 2025. The tax law included a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarriage penalty\u00e2\u0080\u009d designed to increase the tax liability of couples. Couples could typically deduct one standard deduction and one 25% tax bracket, not two of each.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes&#8212;and in some cases requires&#8212;the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals (aliens) arrested for immigration violations that render them removable from the United States. The immigration detention regime serves two primary purposes. First, detention may ensure an apprehended alien&#8217;s presence at his or her removal hearing and, if the alien is ultimately ordered removed, makes it easier for removal to be quickly effectuated. Second, in some cases detention may serve the additional purpose of alleviating any threat posed by the alien to the safety of the community while the removal process is under way. The INA&#8217;s detention framework is multifaceted, with different rules turning on whether the alien is seeking initial admission into the United States or was lawfully admitted into the country; whether the alien has committed certain criminal offenses or other conduct rendering him or her a security risk; and whether the alien is being held pending removal proceedings or has been issued a final order of removal. In many cases detention is discretionary, and DHS may release an alien placed in formal removal proceedings on bond, on his or her own recognizance, or under an order of supervision pending the outcome of those proceedings. In other cases, however, judicially imposed statutory and regulatory restrictions limit detention authority even when the detention is discretionary. The report examines how some of these legal developments may inform Congress in light of the various proposals to modify the immigration detention framework, and their competing visions for U.S. immigration policy. INTRODUCTION: As of fiscal year 2017, DHS detained an average of over 38,000 non-U.S. nationals each day. In that year, the agency detained about 393,418 non-U.S. nationals for an average of over 43 days per detainee in 2017, up from 217,823 non-U.S. nationals detained in 2016 for an average of under 44 days.1 The 2017 count was the 22nd most in any year going back to 2001, and it is approximately three times the average daily detentions from 2012 through 2016.1 (See Figure 1 for a time series showing daily detentions since 2001.) The number of non-U.S. nationals detained by DHS fluctuates somewhat from year to year, however, with the most detentions in 2009 (481,232) and the least in 2010 (305,003).1 More comprehensive data from ICE&#8217;s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) reveal total fiscal year (FY) apprehensions, including those who are not detained.2 The most recent ICE data show that in FY2017, a total of 419,0081 non-U.S. nationals were apprehended.3 While an increasing number were apprehended with a criminal conviction, most without one were apprehended because they were in the United States unlawfully. Many were apprehended while unlawfully seeking entry into the country. (See Chart 1.) As of December 2017, there were 650,525 foreign-born noncitizens in state or federal prison, a 142% increase from 272,813 in 1998.3 There were 1,712,175 convicted non-U.S. nationals on federal and state supervision, a 149% increase from 687,443 in 1996.3  The immigration detention system has grown significantly over the last decade, a period in which the number of people in the federal criminal justice system has increased more slowly than has the overall foreign-born population of the country, and the proportion of that foreign-born population in the federal and state criminal justice systems has decreased.3 The growth in the immigration detention regime relative to the criminal justice system is largely due to a large increase in the number of non-U.S. nationals placed in detention by the federal government over a very short", "REPORTED BY: GARY TUZARA, RPTE, RPR, CRC GREENWICH OFFICE, 203-869-0208 (w), 203-698-7849 (c), gtujara@riversideca.com INSTRUCTED BY: NATHAN BERRY, 203-847-2460 (w), 203-453-4878 (h), nberry@riversideca.com WWW.

Under the constitutional separation of powers system, Congress enacts statutes that often delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies. Using that delegated authority, agencies issue regulations to implement those statutes and set the details of public policy. To structure the ways in which agencies issue regulations pursuant to their delegated authority, Congress has created a statutory scheme of procedural controls. The most significant of these controls is the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946, which generally requires agencies to issue what are known as \"rulemaking instruments.\" A rule is defined under the APA as \"an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\" A proposed rule is issued when a general statement of policy is anticipated, and an agency is required to publish the rule in the Federal Register. A final rule is published when the agency has reached a decision on a specific policy. Between the issuance of a proposed rule and a final rule, an agency may choose to issue what is known as a \"notice of proposed rulemaking\" (NPRM). An NPRM is essentially the same as a proposed rule except that the purpose of an NPRM is to solicit comments and public participation, rather than to announce a decision to the public. If an agency wants a decision made upon an NPRM, it must move to the final rule stage. This report will briefly discuss the origin of the APA's petition mechanism and the effectiveness of the regulatory control it provides. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PETITIONING AND RULEMAKING CONSTRUCTS The APA is perhaps the most comprehensive statement of regulatory law in the country, and most likely in the world. Its regulatory control scheme is arguably the most detailed of any comparable regulatory legislation, with a vast majority of its provisions specifically focused upon agency conduct and procedures. Of course, the APA also provides for a judicially-enforceable, procedural framework, upon which a court may rely when finding an agency action unlawful or unconstitutional. The APA requires each agency to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on a significant portion of the agency's regulations, including its rules, through notice and comment procedures. That is, in most cases, an agency must provide an adequate notice of its proposed regulations, including details of the proposed action and a summary of the basis and purpose of the proposal, and must", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Caregiver Support Program was born from a new challenge facing veterans\nFinding the appropriate words for summaries and paraphrases is critical\nAsking for more information is a way to begin your summary\nSome vocabulary terms need their definitions clarified during summarization\nA summary must be precise and concise and give the most important words for meaning\nA summarization is not an opinion but rather a report of an author's central focus\nBegin by defining the author's main idea\nSummarize the article in a few sentences, in your own words but using key words from the author to avoid plagiarism\nA summary requires a concise and precise understanding of an author's main idea\nSummarizing is a way to improve your overall understanding of a text\nSummarizing requires careful and deliberate reading of an author's main idea\nA good summary is clear, precise, concise, and complete\nWrite using 1-3 sentences to accomplish what the original author wants you to emphasize\nA paraphrase is a summary in prose with only the central idea reported\nAvoid paraphrase of a single sentence or even a paragraph\nFollow academic convention, providing in-text documentation as you paraphrase and summarize original authors, if possible", "The report provides an update on current important trade issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094including non-tariff barriers, market access, trade policy, trade negotiations, retaliation, and litigation\u00e2\u0080\u0094affecting U.S. agricultural and food product sectors in both domestic and export markets.", "CRS Report: Federal Preemption CRS Report: Federal Preemption By: Mark J. Rozell In this report, CRS summarizes the current state of federal preemption law as interpreted by the Supreme Court in light of the Court's jurisprudence on 13 different case areas: (1) express preemption, (2) compelling state interest, (3) concurrent state and federal authority, (4) complete preemption, (5) conflict preemption, (6) field preemption, (7) impossibility preemption, (8) obstacle preemption, (9) implied preemption based on congressional intent, (10) state laws regulating conduct outside the scope of federal power, (11) implied preemption based on the presence of a safety valve, (12) implied field preemption based on the need for national uniformity, and (13) preemption involving the Commerce Clause. The report examines Supreme Court case law related to each of these categories and includes citations to landmark and recent Supreme Court cases in addition to concise summaries of the case law. Next, the report discusses the role of implied preemption in judicial enforcement of federal statutes, and finally, the report offers the perspective of some prominent scholars, members of Congress, and others who have discussed the role of preemption. The report concludes by explaining that preemption is used to prevent state law from impelling federal policy. TEXT: T he Constitution's Supremacy Clause provides that \"the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" This language is the foundation for the doctrine of federal preemption, according to which federal law supersedes conflicting state law. Federal preemption of state law is ubiquitous in modern commerce due to the pervasive overlap between state and federal law as the federal government has promulgated thousands of regulations. Indeed, federal preemption is \"almost certainly the most frequently utilized doctrine in constitutional law\" and the issue continues to fascinate legal scholars. The Supreme Court's preemption jurisprudence has been influenced by the view that states are not partners in federalism, but \"competitors\" in the process. As a result, preemption has become \"the most common judicially declared limitation on state power\" in the modern era. In spite of (or perhaps because of) its pervasive use, congressional and executive officials have debated at length the merits of preemption as a constitutional doctrine.

Rozell, Professor of Public Administration and Policy, and Executive Director, Schar School of Policy and Government, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA.

For FY2019, the Administration\u2019s budget request included $708.1 billion to fund programs under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. H.R. 5515, as amended, as passed by the House on May 24, 2018, would have authorized the same amount as the President\u2019s request; it would have required DOD to request approximately $60 billion for a fund designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) operations. S. 2987, as passed by the Senate on June 18, 2018, would have authorized $707.9 billion, including $639.4 billion for the base budget and $68.5 billion in OCO funding for DOD. H.R. 5515 passed the House of Representatives on May 24, 2018 (Roll No. 230), by a vote of 351-66, while the Senate passed S. 2987 (Record Vote No. 128) on June 18, 2018 by a voice vote. A conference committee of the two Houses of Congress then reported a revised conference report for this bill (Congressional Record, Vol. , July 25, 2018, H.Rept. 115-874) by a vote of 32-1. The final version of H.R. 5515, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 23, 2018 (Roll No. 343), would authorize $716 billion, including $640 billion for the base budget. Table 1 and Table 2 below provide an overview of FY2019 NDAAA actions. Table 1: Summary of House and Senate FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 7", "The detection of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in some public water supplies has generated public concern and increased congressional attention to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) efforts to address these substances. Over the past decade, EPA has been evaluating several PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to determine whether national drinking water regulations may be warranted. EPA has not issued SDWA regulations for any PFAS but has taken various actions to address PFAS contamination. Using SDWA authorities, in 2016, EPA issued non-enforceable health advisories for two PFAS\u00e2\u0080\u0094 perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094in drinking water. The 116th Congress has held hearings on PFAS and passed legislation to address PFAS contamination issues through various authorities and departments and agencies. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 (P.L. 116-92) includes several PFAS provisions involving the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies. Of the EPA provisions related to drinking water, Title LXXIII, Subtitle A, directs EPA to require public water systems to conduct additional monitoring for PFAS and establish final or interim drinking water regulations for some or all PFAS, require monitoring for more of these substances, or authorize grants to assist communities in treating PFAS in drinking water. Similar to H.R. 535, multiple SDWA bills would require EPA to finalize drinking water regulations for certain or all PFAS.1 H.R. 535 would require EPA to regulate PFOA and PFOS by June 24, 2025. Other provisions in bills have various timelines for EPA to address PFAS by establishing drinking water regulations. A further discussion of many bills is beyond the scope of this report. Many PFAS use reports to Congress are available, including those in CRS's 112, 120, 236, 307, and 393 .", "The United States is currently experiencing the longest economic expansion in its history. Although short-term forecasts are predicting continued economic expansion, some economists have expressed uncertainty over how long the expansion will continue. History has shown that economic expansions inevitably give way to economic slowdowns. If the next slowdown is significant, the economy could enter a recession, which is typically characterized by falling output and rising unemployment. Predicting when the economy may transition from expansion to recession, however, is notoriously difficult, as the ebb and flow of the economy is determined by many different factors, including a number that lie outside the country's borders. Countercyclical fiscal policy may help to stabilize the economy when it enters a recession. Countercyclical fiscal policy refers to short-term tax and spending adjustments to stimulate consumer and business demand in an effort to counteract economic contraction and return the economy to its potential. Effective fiscal stimulus does not always require contemporaneous legislative action by Congress. There are certain \"automatic stabilizers\" that work without congressional action to lower taxes and increase spending as the economy weakens. As a result, an economic slowdown or recession does not necessarily warrant a policy response. However, Congress has a range of options it could consider when designing a stimulus package should a recession occur and automatic stabilizers are not sufficient to counteract it. This report identifies and summarizes options Congress could consider when deciding how to respond to a recession. The analysis begins by reviewing the features effective countercyclical fiscal policies are commonly thought to have, and then distinguishes between countercyclical and growth-oriented policies. Next, the report summarizes and evaluates potential fiscal policy options that Congress could consider. The options presented are drawn from those policies considered during the Great Recession for which estimates of their potential economic impact exist. The report concludes with a brief discussion about enacting fiscal stimulus in the context of the country's long-run budget outlook. Effective fiscal policy in response to recessions of average duration and severity is usually considered to have three general features: it is timely, targeted, and temporary. Fiscal policy timeliness is made inherently difficult by three well-known lags: the lag in recognizing a recession, the lag in negotiating and implementing a policy response, and the lag between policy implementation and when the economy is affected. On the revenue side, it appears that the largest multipliers are associated with tax reductions that are targeted at lower-income households and those with less access to liquid assets. This finding is the result of research that indicates businesses are slow to respond to investment tax incentives, that business tax rate reductions primarily benefit existing capital rather than new investment, and that hiring and output are especially important for growth when the overall economy is weak. On the spending side, it appears that larger multipliers are associated with spending aimed toward the less wealthy and those who are likely to experience short-term income declines. In addition, analysis of a recent business tax cut suggests large multipliers are associated with capital- and innovation-intensive businesses. This finding suggests that tax reductions may be particularly effective when aimed at small businesses. Furthermore, research indicates that the multipliers are stronger when businesses expect the tax cut to be temporary, raising their incentives to invest in the near term, but lessening their concerns about crowding out private investment more generally. In addition to tax and spending cuts, other fiscal policy tools could also have large multipliers. These tools include: (i) tax reductions that would allow businesses to accelerate the timing of their tax payments; (ii) measures to increase the liquidity, elasticity, and efficiency of the credit market, such as temporary loan guarantees for lending to consumers and businesses or special lending facilities for small businesses, and (iii) the \"bully pulpit\" approach, which aims to increase the confidence of businesses and consumers.\n17. 2019-11-21 17 I N G R E N D N E X U S 2019 1 0 2 PAGE NUMBERS INDEX | A F T E R A R T IC L E T L E T A L E N U N D E R O N E V E R E A N A S S E R T E D N A F N E I R H O L .

Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans consolidate their loans to allow them to access lower interest rates. The bill would also require that the interest rates for these loans only be increased after July 2020. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), implementing a new program to allow borrowers to consolidate their loans would cost the Department of Education about $150 million over the 2020-2024 period, assuming appropriations from Congress are enacted. S. 3362 would delay implementation of a program established in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA of 2018; P.L. 115-123) that allows borrowers with FFEL Program loans and Direct Loan Program loans to use part of their loans to consolidate them with federal student loans issued in the Direct Loan Program. A borrower can qualify for the lower interest rate for these consolidated loans if he has made 120 or more consecutive payments on the loans. Implementing such consolidated loans would cost $155 million from FY2019 to FY2023 according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nWhile the BBA 2018 established that the first loans could be consolidated with Direct Loan Program loans 90 days after the enactment of the bill, the bill could be delayed for some number of days after July 1 of each year. On March 6, 2019, the Department of Treasury published the final regulation on the program, and the Department of Education finalized additional requirements for the program on July 1, 2019 (CBO 2020. 110th Congress, 2nd Session.

Conversely, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has adopted a contrasting policy, saying that CDC would not be able to respond to mailed FOIA requests and that requests should be placed electronically. These examples of differing policies, among others examples not mentioned, when combined with agencies' adoption of additional telework flexibilities , raise questions about how agencies will be responding to FOIA requests in the near future. This report provides an overview of the FOIA request process and actual and potential FOIA request processing changes within federal government agencies as a result of COVID-19. FOIA does not require requests for agency information to be submitted in a particular format, only that the request reasonably describes the records sought and complies with agency regulations. Most agencies accept requests via mail, email, web form, or fax. The statute also requires the affirmative disclosure of certain categories of agency information, such as \"substantive rules of general applicability,\" \"rules of procedure,\" and, since 2016, records requested three or more times. While the text of FOIA does not specifically dictate the method in which the public must request information from an agency, FOIA does prescribe how an agency is to respond to the request. Generally, an agency is to respond to a correctly routed, simple request within 20 days with a determination of the scope of the documents the agency will produce and any exemptions it will apply to withhold records or information. Complex or incorrectly routed requests may be subject to additional days of processing, per the statute (5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7552(a)(6)(E)). Requesters may administratively appeal an agency's adverse decision. Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways: (1) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; and (2) processes for locating information responsive to a FOIA request may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave. Agencies may also designate classes of records in the future that may be subject to automatic public release. This report reviews changes to the response time for certain agency requests and the time it will take agencies to respond to requests.\nThis report provides background information and legislative and regulatory analyses for H.R. 1269, the \"Federally Funded Research Freedom Act of 2019.\"\nWidespread access to government information has been viewed as a cornerstone of American democracy. From the beginnings of the Republic, Congress and the executive branch have passed legislation, including the first Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), to promote open government. This report provides a brief description of the legislative and administrative means used by the executive branch to control access to government information.\nAmid concerns of executive branch secrecy and an increasing public demand for the release of government information, on July 4, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Public Law 89-487, 80 Stat. 251, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. The act provided the foundation for public rights to governmental information, and ushered in a new age of transparency in the federal government. FOIA has been implemented through two subsequent pieces of legislation and countless Freedom of Information Regulations (FOIR). The 1974 FOIA Amendments, in particular, codified Congress's intent and gave a greater degree of transparency in access to information held by the government.\nThis report provides information on legislation passed by the 119th Congress pertaining to Government Information.\nIn a government made up only of elected officers, each acting as delegates for specific, defined constituencies, the freedom of information concept is especially important. The Framers fully understood that a system of citizen legislators will inevitably be subject to pressures to legislate more in the interests of their electoral constituencies than for the good of the nation as a whole. To prevent the formation of unaccountable and unconstitutional coalitions of special interests within such a framework, they instituted a free and unfettered press as an ombud for the rights of citizenship and their constitutionally protected liberties. This was to be the only check that the press", "The mission of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to help us all live healthier lives.

A total of 51 FFG-7 class ships were procured in the 1970s and 1980s. 14", "The House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are to be taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber.\nMost bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows non-privileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are generally based on how widely supported the measures are, how long Members wish to debate them, and whether they want to propose floor amendments. These decisions are not necessarily related to the subject matter of the measure.", "Robocalls are the top complaint to the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ), according to a report from Senator Edward J. Markey ( Dem-MA ). In March 2018, the FCC released its second white paper on  \"Robocalls.\" A report by YouMail, a company that tracks robocalls, estimated that consumers in the U.S. made 31 billion robocalls in 2015, a 50 % increase from 2014 . By the end of 2018, consumers in the U.S. had received 39.8 billion robocalls from January through December; that figure represents a 57  percent increase from the 25.4 billion robocalls received in 2017 . During the month of April 2019, mobile telephone subscribers in the U.S. received 4.9 million robocalls per day, according to YouMail. Senator Markey also noted that robocalls \"continue to climb, with an estimated 1 .5 billion unwanted phone calls made last year, per a report from The Wall Street Journal .\" In addition.", "The remnants of the Vietnam War ( 1963 1975 ) and other regional conflicts have left mainland Southeast Asia as a region heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance, or UXO. More than 45 years after the United States ceased its extensive bombing of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, hundreds of civilians are still injured or killed each year by UXO from those bombings missions or by landmines laid in conflicts between Cambodia and Vietnam ( 1975-1978 ), China and Vietnam ( 1979-1990 ), and during the Cambodian civil war ( 1978- 1991 ). While comprehensive surveys are incomplete, it is estimated that more than 20% of the land in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are contaminated by UXO. Over more than 25 years, Congress has appropriated more than $ 400 million to assist Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam in clearing their land of UXO. More than 77% of the assistance has been provided via programs funded by the Department of State. In addition, the United States has provided treatment to those individuals maimed by UXO through U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) programs and the Leahy War Victims Fund. Despite ongoing efforts by the three countries, the United States, and other international donors, it reportedly could take 100 years or more, at the current pace, to clear Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam of UXO. During that time period, more people will likely be killed or injured by UXO. In 2016, President Obama pledged $ 90 million over a three-year period for UXO decontamination programs in Laos\u00e2\u0080\u0094an amount nearly equal to the total of UXO assistance to that nation over the previous 20 years. The act also provides $ 13.5 million for global health and rehabilitation programs under the Leahy War Victims Fund. Moving forward, the 116 th Congress will have an opportunity to consider what additional efforts, if any, the U.S. government should undertake to address the war legacy issue of UXO in mainland Southeast Asia in terms of the decontamination of the region and the provision of medical support or assistance to UXO victims. While the war legacies issues of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam have been largely overlooked by the U.S. government and the American public at large, the U.S. interest in Vietnam and the Mekong region have long centered in part on the deleterious humanitarian and strategic effects of the war, both of which still persist. Accordingly, the United States has devoted a substantial degree of effort and resources to UXO decontamination in all three nations, although that effort and its results have not been uniformly successful. The U.S. interest in those efforts is evidenced by the 2016 provision of $ 90 million in UXO decontamination a sum roughly matched by the $ 90 million that the United States reportedly spent in all of its previous UXO assistance to Laos. For those who would argue that any assistance at all to Laos and/or Vietnam should be rejected because of U.S. conduct during the Vietnam War, this argument is undercut by the fact that UXO decontamination is conducted independently of any formal relations between a nation and the United States. In addition, no matter what arguments are made concerning the appropriateness of providing UXO assistance to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, it is a fact that UXO assistance is not available to UXO-victims in those nations as an alternative to treatment in the United States. Since the Department of State has reportedly spent $ 30 million annually on global rehabilitation in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, it is also undeniable that the American taxpayer has a self evident interest in the success of those programs to a degree that is unmatched by the support of those programs made by citizens of another country. Finally, this report has two major limitations: 1. It does not detail the UXO legacy challenges associated with U.S. relations with other nations which have experienced UXO exposure and resulting munition injury, but it is important to recognize that these nations exist, and the U.S. interest in those nations is evidenced by, among other things, the State Depart ment 's investment of more than $ 200 million", "After a major disaster and upon a gubernatorial or tribal chief executive request, affected individuals and households will generally be eligible to receive Individual Assistance (IA) in form of grants, loans, housing assistance, or other forms of assistance. Most grants are unconditional and do not have to be repaid. FEMA may also provide Crisis Counseling and Assistance and Training Program (CCP) services to a state/territory or tribal grantee. CCAP is an educational effort that assists disaster survivors, family members, and emergency personnel in understanding and managing their emotional distress, grief, loss, and trauma. I. Individual Grants Individual programs provide grant assistance to individuals with disaster-caused losses not covered by insurance. Funds may be used to help individuals meet disaster-related needs in the following categories: * Housing - Affected individuals may be eligible for financial assistance in the form of temporary rental payments, essential home repairs, or replacement housing for residences that are uninhabitable. * Home Repairs or Replacement of Disaster-damaged Clothing or Personal Property - Grant assistance may be available to eligible individuals to help meet the cost of disaster-related uninsured losses of personal property and necessary expenses related to repair or replacement of essential items due to the disaster. * Other Disaster-caused Miscellaneous Needs - Affected individuals may be eligible for a grant to help with necessary expenses and serious needs, such as disaster-related uninsured expenses or losses. II. Other Assistance for Recovery In addition to individuals, FEMA also has the authority to help communities, public bodies, and certain private, nonprofit organizations with their disaster-related needs. A Public Body is defined by FEMA as states, cities, counties, tribes, and villages and school districts. FEMA has the authority to help Public Bodies with debris removal, removing and replacing damaged public facilities, and funding for repairing, reconstructing, and replacing damaged public facilities. The IA programs also include HAZMAT Assistance which helps communities mitigate any potential risks associated with the HAZMAT that results from disasters. The final assistance FEMA can provide through the IA grant process is called Public Assistance. Through this program, FEMA provides assistance to help individuals and communities with emergency work and subsequent repair or repair and recovery work, as well as replacements or restorations of damaged facilities, as a result of a declared disaster or emergency. Although state, tribal, and local governments are eligible, other public and private, nonprofit organizations can also apply for PA Grants. Other public and private, non-profit organizations also have the chance to apply for Disaster Case Management programs, which provide a single point of contact within a community that help disaster survivors navigate the recovery process. Furthermore, FEMA can assist victims of disasters, especially low income victims, through the use of the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (DSNAP) and Disaster Rental Assistance (DRA) programs. The DSNAP program provides food and nutrition assistance to low-income disaster survivors affected by a disaster. The DRA program provides supplemental assistance to disaster survivors temporarily displaced by disaster or recovering in other temporary housing arrangements for rent, utilities, and/or homeowners' insurance premiums. III. Individual Assistance (IA) Factors 1. An emergency declaration or major disaster declaration issued by the President, as authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a75121 et seq.), that triggers the Individual Assistance (IA) program as determined by FEMA. 2. The type of disaster declaration(s) issued by the President (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7515 et seq.) for the disaster(s) (i.e., disasters not covered by CAL FIRE's Standard Agricultural Insurance Policy [SAIP]). Disaster declarations include emergency, major disaster, or major disaster emergency declarations. 3. Following an \"emergency or major disaster declaration\" and upon a Governor's request, individual needs for disaster assistance due to the event in the affected county (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a75121 et seq.). 4.

In FY2019, it was authorized appropriations of $25.1 billion, not including emergency appropriations. The 116th Congress considered reauthorization.\nMajor issues for this reauthorization included flexibility from federal standards, a requirement for states and schools to implement educational accountability systems, and a focus on teacher preparation programs. At its December 9, 2015, hearing, Congress reviewed the priorities, implementation of the ESEA, and new federal research reports. At its April 12, 2016, hearing, Congress reviewed various ESEA reauthorization bills that included Title II language. At its July 13, 2016, hearing, Congress reviewed pending bills that included ESEA reauthorization language.\nOn December 1, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ). The act reauthorizes the ESEA, establishing the new Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. ESSA builds on previous ESEA frameworks and includes changes to current practices related to accountability requirements. It also includes provisions concerning funding formula requirements, Title I funding streams, and teacher preparation programs.\nThe U.S. Department of Education (ED) implemented the new requirements of the ESEA through regulations, guidance, and technical assistance. ED regulations included timelines of compliance for states to complete various tasks related to the new requirements of the act.\nDuring this 115th Congress, several bills were introduced to reauthorize the ESEA, including the Success Act (H.R. 3973), which would have reauthorized the ESEA by providing for accountability and transparency mechanisms, funding priorities, and state-based educational initiatives.\nThe new law requires that states submit ESSA plans to the Secretary by March 15, 2018. After review of the plans, states will begin implementation of ESSA by the start of the 2018-2019 school year on July 1, 2018.\nOn January 12, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the $1.3 trillion fiscal year (FY) 2018 omnibus funding bill, which combined the six remaining un-funded FY2018 appropriations measures. It was also known as the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 195/Public Law 115-141 [2018]).", "This report provides the following information on the FY2020 Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations bill considered as Division A of H.R. 1158 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020: (1) Title I overview, contents of division A, and conference report; (2) Title II overview, funding tables, and explanatory statement; (3) Title III overview, funding table, and explanatory statements; (4) Title IV overview, funding table, and explanatory statements; (5) Title V overview, funding table, and explanatory statements; (6) Title VI overview; (7) Title VII overview, funding table, and explanatory statements; (8) Title VIII overview and funding tables and explanatory statements; (9) Title IX overview; (10) Title X overview, funding tables, explanatory statements, and Joint Audit.

For instance, it provides that: Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts and to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\nIt has long been recognized that Congress could authorize a deficit in order to finance a deficit. The current process does not, in general, consider budgetary outcomes beyond the 10-year budget window. Some have charged that without a long-term focus and incentives, members of Congress may not make the needed tough decisions, which could threaten the sustainability of the U.S. budget. Further, under the current system, annual spending and revenues sometimes do not balance. The budget deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenues. Because the process generally allows for a deficit, some argue that Congress must consider ways to address the deficit and to address it soon, to avoid the ever-increasing national debt. For example, some recommend that members of Congress should enact legislation that: o limits the accumulation of debt; or otherwise limits, constrains or changes the budget process.", "", "Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) establishes requirements and prohibitions to identify, prevent, and reduce unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates, and preempt state, local, and tribal laws, in legislation and regulatory programs. In 1995 Congress enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) to address a view widely held by state and local government officials that the United States was entering an era of \"coercive\" rather than \"voluntary\" federalism: a time in which the federal government would increasingly use authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution to compel state and local governments to adhere to federal policy. Some argue that UMRA's requirements to study and estimate the costs and benefits of federal mandates, and to adopt a point of order in both the House and Senate to decline consideration of legislation containing mandates exceeding the threshold dollar amount, have had \"little visible impact on the total number of federal mandates imposed on the states or on policy debates on federal mandates.\" According to the GAO, \"Congress has enacted only three mandates above the threshold since UMRA was enacted, and only one that exceeded the $50 million threshold in 2007. In contrast, [GAO] noted that from 1992 to 1995, the three years before enactment of UMRA, Congress enacted some 30 mandates above the $50 million threshold with 11 of those over $100 million.\" On the other hand, UMRA's supporters claim to have counted 12 statutory provisions affecting state and local governments as unfunded mandates, or some 40 provisions if mandates in appropriations acts are included. Thus they assert that UMRA's requirements to study and disclose the cost and benefits of federal mandates before their enactment and the threshold cost rule to consider their costs significantly have reduced, although not totally eliminated, their proliferation. Proponents state that the UMRA rule-making and enforcement structures are working to ensure that Congress becomes increasingly aware of the costs of unfunded mandates and is, in the words of one former committee staff director, \"paying more attention, making more reasonable decisions,\" and thus \"doing a little better job of it in terms of evaluating the costs of those mandates.\" One study concluded that while the act has succeeded in highlighting the issue and causing members of Congress to consider whether a federal program needs to be enacted\u2014a cost-benefit test which was absent when they considered the programs in the past\u2014it does not appear to have had any effect on their ultimate decisions. The success of UMRA's provisions remains a subject of intense congressional debate. Some proponents claim that the act has forced some programs that cost federal revenue into the budget process, resulting in their demise. Others state that these successes are few, and have been outweighed by large-scale programs that have been created and continue. Thus, even proponents of UMRA generally agree that the costs imposed on the economy through federal mandates have far exceeded both Congress's estimates and UMRA's $50 million threshold level. The debate on UMRA is expected to continue for some time into the future. The act has had a lasting impact on the debate on whether federal mandates are a legitimate, fair, and cost-effective means of national public policy since its passage. UMRA is the product of a broad movement for federalism reform and is the only federal statute to date that provides some mechanism to reduce or manage the federal government's use of intergovernmental mandates.\nThe history of this article's development has been the subject of numerous investigations by both houses' committee staff and GAO investigators. As GAO has noted, \"The history of the act has been a litany of congressional attempts to change the process or outcome of its enactment over its 20-year history.\"128 The House attempted to remove UMRA's unfunded mandate point of order, and the Senate attempted to strike UMRA from the bill. During the Senate debate, \"some members called mandate legislation 'cumbersome' when enacted in piecemeal fashion, as the Senate was doing. 'Both the House and Senate have produced separate versions of [unfunded mandate reform] legislation for years, some members said, and the prospect that the two chambers might do so again seemed 'distressing' to one senator.\"", "Critical infrastructure (CI) refers to the machinery, facilities, and information that enable vital functions of governance, public 1 1 17 M1802430-04103 8/5/14 3:41 PM 8 0 5 14 3:41 PM 8 3 5 14 T R - 1 5 3 BUCHANAN 1 0 023447986 8/5/14 9:27 PM 1 0 5 14 1 1 9 7 0 23 4 7 9 8 6 2 2 1 5 3 1 0 0 T R A T A N S - 1 2 N O M O N 1 A R M O R A FE", "On October 7, 2019, after six months of formal negotiations, the United States and Japan signed two agreements intended to liberalize bilateral trade. One, the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA), provides for limited tariff reductions and quota expansions to improve market access; the other, the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement (DTA), includes commitments pertaining to digital aspects of international commerce. These agreements constitute what President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe envision as \u201cstage one\u201d of a broader trade liberalization negotiation, which the two leaders first announced in September 2018. The two sides have stated their intent to begin second stage negotiations on a more comprehensive deal after these agreements enter into force. Japan\u2019s Parliament, the Diet, had to ratify the pact, and did so on December 5, 2019, paving the way for entry into force on January 1, 2020. The two Japan deals raise a number of issues for Congress, including their limited coverage and the staged nature of the agreements, as compared to past U.S. FTA negotiations. Given the narrow scope of the agreements, their commercial and strategic impact is likely to be determined by whether a more comprehensive bilateral agreement can be achieved. Many Members of Congress and other stakeholders support the agreements, but are concerned about the potential for stalling on the second stage negotiations, in particular during an election year in the United States.\nOn October 7, 2019, after six months of formal negotiations, the United States and Japan signed two agreements intended to liberalize bilateral trade: the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement (DTA, a.k.a. Digital Trade Deal). In a joint press conference following the agreement signing ceremony, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and Prime Minister Abe announced that the second stage of bilateral negotiations would focus on issues \"that were not covered in the U.S.-Japan Agreement, including services, investments, and intellectual property rights.\"5 Some U.S. observers have also raised questions about the potential for the Administration to renegotiate some terms of the USJTA before Senate ratification, citing a provision in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA- 2015, P.L. 114-26; hereinafter referred to as \u201cTPA- 2015\") that allowed the President to reopen or modify an agreement once it was subject to congressional oversight.6\nThe two Japan deals raise a number of issues for Congress, including their limited coverage and the staged approach, as compared to past U.S. FTA negotiations. Given the narrow scope of the agreements, their commercial and strategic impact is likely to be determined by whether a more comprehensive bilateral agreement can be achieved. Many Members of Congress and other stakeholders support the agreements, but are concerned about the potential for stalling on the second stage negotiations, in particular during an election year in the United States. To provide Congress with the resources to monitor and evaluate the implementation and impact of the USJTA and the DTA, TPA- 2015 requires that the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) publish a report on the agreement, with recommendations for modifying, supplementing, or terminating the agreement. TPA-2015 also directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a study on the USJTA and DTA and authorizes the United States Trade Representative to submit a report to Congress to inform congressional oversight responsibilities.\nThis report provides information on the agreement and addresses the following questions:\nWhat are the expected impacts of the USJTA and DTA on the U.S. and Japanese economies? This report does not make a formal economic assessment of the USJTA and DTA, but provides an overview of the agreement, its key provisions, and a select group of economic studies on the expected trade and investment impacts of the agreements.\nWhat are the commercial and strategic impacts of the agreements? The Trump Administration and the Administration of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have emphasized the importance of the USJTA and DTA for both U.S. objectives and for the U.S.-Japan alliance. This report", "In 2018, approximately 38.1 million people, or 11.8% of the population, had incomes below the official definition of poverty in the United States. The poverty rate (the percentage that were in poverty) fell from 12.3% in 2017, while the number of persons in poverty declined from 39.6 million. In this report, the numbers and percentages of those in poverty are based on the Census Bureau's estimates. While this official measure is often regarded as a statistical yardstick rather than a complete picture of what people and families need to live, it does provide an objective gauge of income below which families cannot make ends meet, as well as an overall measure of trends in living standards of American families. The official poverty line is not based on food and nutrition needs alone; it also reflects other basic needs, especially when it comes to family size. The Census Bureau calculates another measure of income, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which seeks to give a clearer view of the resources available to families and individuals in poverty and also to supplement the shortcomings of the official measure. While the SPM, unlike the official poverty measure, does recognize some economic advantages available to the poor, it excludes a number of positive income and wealth transfers paid to the population on the basis of need. Despite its limitations, the SPM serves as a complement to the official measure in describing the real resources available to families and individuals. The Census Bureau released the SPM in September 2018 (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2010/compendium/p60-231.pdf). The data on the supplemental measure contained in this report is only a sneak-peak of the larger database that will be available in the December 2018 release of the Census Bureau's \"2017 Poverty and Health Care Coverage\" report. CONTINUOUS DATA: This report draws from the Current Population Surveys (CPS), taken in March 2018 and 2017, and from the American Community Survey (ACS), taken from January 2013 through September 2018. All tables in this report use CPS or ACS data, with the exception of Figures 4 and 8, which draw data from the annual poverty reports for 2017 and 2016, respectively, published by the Census Bureau. Because of sampling, the figures reported may differ by one or two individuals when compared to the Census Bureau's national statistics due to rounding.\nTEXT REFERENCE: \"The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of approximately 60,000 households across the United States. In partnership with state programs, the CPS serves to measure the number of people in poverty from month to month, to gauge the impact of policy changes (such as increased unemployment assistance) on the number of people in poverty from month to month, and to serve as sample for the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC), in which respondents are interviewed by the U.S. Census Bureau to determine their demographic characteristics, attainment of educational milestones, health insurance coverage, employment, and income.\"\nTEXT REFERENCE: \"'The current population estimates are based on the 2008\u201310 decennial census, state-level population estimates, administrative records, and coverage improvement from the 2010 to 2018 Current Population Survey (CPS) (currently, the only source of annual state population estimates). As estimates undercount the population in remote areas (especially in Alaska and Montana), state-to-state differences in total population are likely to be greatest for such areas. In addition, in cases where states did not report to the Census, estimates for unincorporated areas are based on the characteristics of counties having similar census data, such as urbanization/ruralization, industry composition, etc.' The Census Bureau also has an interactive tool where you can see estimates based on the 2010 decennial census, called \"American FactFinder\" (https://www.census.gov/data/data-access-and-dissemination/american-factfinder.html) .\nEVALUATION: In 2016, the National Academy of Sciences released \"Poverty and Measurement: Why Poverty Lines Differ,\" which examines the official poverty measure and supplemental pover", "2 in June 2003.\nOn October 26, 2010, Congress authorized a new, expanded VCF, created under the ATSSA and the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act Reauthorization Act of 2009 (ATSSSARA). The special master of the VCF was directed to reopen it for claims by people who suffered physical harm or died in the 9/11 aftermath, such as the immediate aftermath of 9/11 or the debris removal and decontamination effort at the World Trade Center Site. All claims had to be filed and processed within three years of the law's enactment.\nThe original VFC reopened and began the review new claims during the week of October 18, 2010. On September 8, 2011, Congress reauthorized the VCF for five more years to provide compensation for the new groups of claimants. The deadline for filing claims for injury or death on or after 9/11/01 was October 21, 2015. The deadline for filing claims for economic loss and reopened claims was May 20, 2016.\nAt that time, the VCF had processed approximately 6,700 claims, and had made total awards of $3.72 billion to a total of 1,460 claimants (as of September 20, 2016). The VCF closed its reopened claims window on October 1, 2016 (which marks the 15th anniversary of the enactment of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act). The deadline for filing claims for injuries or death on or after 9/11/01 was October 1, 2020. Claimants will be allowed to file and update claims until that date. For certain claimants, a later deadline to file claims or update their claims may apply. The VCF also received claims under the original VCF, and it had made awards totaling $7.03 billion to 5,560 claimants. 3 See Appendix for VCF program statistics.\nOn July 22, 2019, the VCF fully reopened its reopened claims window to receive new claims for any injury or death that occurred on or after 9/11/01, for both claimants who were previously eligible and for a new class of claimants (emergency or cleanup workers). The VCF is currently processing claims for a new group of claimants who responded to the 9/11 disaster in New York and New Jersey, or worked in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in New York or Washington, DC.\nThe VCF is now available to accept claims from responders and cleanup workers regardless of the type of injury suffered, the amount of loss reported, or the amount of compensation received from other sources. As with other claims in the program, a claimant must establish the fact of injury or death by a preponderance of the evidence and that the claimant or the representative of the claimant's estate has received monetary compensation that was less than $7.358 billion. The VCF may authorize and pay awards larger than $250,000 in individual claims if the recipient is deemed to have a catastrophic injury. In addition, the VCF does not have an aggregate cap on payouts or an overall benefit limit, and will continue to provide compensation to all accepted claims that fall within stated jurisdictional limits (see \"Eligibility\" section below).\nThe VCF reopened at noon on July 22, 2019, in observance of the 18 th anniversary of the implementation of the Airtraffic Safety and System Reauthorization Act. VCF reopened claims will be processed in the order in which VCF  receives  them unless other factors come into consideration for processing. In  the past, the VCF process has included a two-phase review: (1) a presumptive illness or death determination followed by (2) a presumptive injury determination for those meeting the criteria for economic loss payments under the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The VCF reviews presumptive illness determinations to ensure consistency within the claims processing. Claims where all aspects are in accordance with the Act (e.g. injury determination, economic loss awards) can", "Congress established the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS) in 1968 through the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA). The WSRA established a policy of preserving designated free-flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. It also complemented the then-current national policy of constructing dams and other structures that altered flow along many rivers. Designated rivers usually are referred to as wild and scenic rivers (WSRs). The WSRA established three classes of WSRs, reflecting the characteristics of a river at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of development that may be allowed afterward. Wild rivers are free from impoundments (dams, diversions, and so forth) and generally inaccessible except by trail. Scenic rivers are free from impoundments and in generally undeveloped areas but are accessible in places by road, with some shoreline development, and may have been subject to some impoundment or diversion in the past. Recreational rivers are readily accessible by road, with some shoreline development, and may have been subject to some impoundment or diversion in the past. At the passage of the WSRA in 1968, Congress initially designated 789 miles in eight rivers as part of the NWSRS and began to expand the system in 1972; since then, every Congress has added rivers. Altogether, the system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The NWSRS is administered by the Department of the Interior, which can add wild and scenic river segments to the system through congressional and/or agency action. Rivers may come into the NWSRS either by congressional designation or administrative action. Congress may designate rivers as part of a large public land and water preservation package or, less often, through stand-alone legislation. Rivers designated by Congress or the Secretary of the Interior require the designation of \"relevant protection components,\" such as recreational uses, compatible natural resource activities, or protection, enhancement, and utilization of historical, cultural, or archeological resources. Congress and/or the Secretary of the Interior may designate rivers already subject to wild and scenic rivers act protection as additions to the NWSRS, and may add to or delete from the system based on a study of river protection needs (see \" Agency Role After Designation ,\" below). The act does not protect non-wsrs under its own terms, but the protections may result from their geographic adjacency to a designated WSR. The act does not protect individual private properties, but it does permit local municipalities to protect private property interests and natural resources. In 1988, Congress passed the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Amendments to expand the system, increase public awareness, and enhance river management opportunities. The 1988 act established the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary of the Interior regarding operations of the NWSRS. The act further revised the original categories of designation: wild and/or scenic rivers, recreational rivers, and scenic rivers. Rivers and lake units in the NWSRS are described in the act as \"lands and waters of the national park system.\" In 2009, a congressional study (a document prepared to inform congressional committees and the House and Senate floors about a specific issue or issues) assessed the act's efficacy in providing free-flowing streams, protecting important ecological, historical, and recreational values, and promoting economic vitality.\n2014 WILD AND SCENIC RIVER SYSTEm (WILD AND SCENIC RIVERs IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL MANAGEMENT INTEREST AS REPORTED BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE)\nWild and scenic rivers in Missouri\nWild and Scenic Rivers: A Clash of Visions\nWild and Scenic Rivers - Colorado", "National Internet Regimes, and the Digital Economy In the early years of the internet, the \"First Amendment-like rights of the digital world,\" as noted by Richard Posner, were largely untouched and widely regarded as sacrosanct.6 This changed in the early-to-mid 1990s, when state and federal governments began regulating the internet in the United States. These actions were not taken lightly: from the late 1960s through the 1970s, many public-interest groups expressed concerns that regulation was incompatible with what they viewed as a revolutionary, decentralized and open network governed under the First Amendment.7 Regulatory and standard-setting activities at the federal level, particularly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice and, to a limited extent, the International  Trade Commission (ITC), culminated in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The act \tintroduced significant changes to U.S. policies governing the telecommunications sector and established a market structure within which new firms and technologies could emerge and compete.8 Additionally, federal tax policy has been critical to the rapid growth and success of the internet.9 This has led many to describe the internet as the \"most prolifically tax-subsidized business in the world.\"10 This tax-subsidy structure may have served to protect and promote the rise of American internet companies. Over 15 years later, U.S. policy has adapted to the rise and growth of the digital economy, although these adaptations are not uniform across policy issues and, therefore, the U.S. internet regulatory ecosystem remains fragmented across various agencies, including those within the FCC (the agency originally created for communication issues). In the absence of comprehensive and coherent U.S. laws and regulations, the courts have played an increasing role in the regulation of internet issues.11 The United States is not alone in creating domestic internet policy. Since the internet's advent, most other countries have introduced some form of internet regulation.12 There seems to be a consensus that the U.S. style is not suitable for every other country. For example, many countries that did not develop a free press may not be comfortable with a completely unregulated media environment, a concern of many when discussing the growth of social media. Others have suggested the U.S. government has not been responsive to certain concerns, and the U.S. regulatory system may not be effective for other countries due to certain challenges, such as limited resources and capacity.13 The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has noted that domestic regulatory gaps, coupled with the lack of international binding agreements, \"could potentially create new barriers to the flow of data.\"14\t 6\tRichard A.

Figure 1 shows worldwide uranium production from 1964 through September 2017 (the available global uranium production data extends to August 2017). In 2016, global production levels and extraction rates decreased between 3% and 10%, primarily in Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia, while production in the United States remained relatively unchanged. Canada, Kazakhstan, and Australia increased their production shares by 4%, 5%, and 9% respectively since 2007, while the U.S. share decreased from 78% in 2007 to 14% in 2016.3 Figure 1.\nTotal US Uranium Reserves: 23 million pounds* (10.4 million kilograms or U3O8) ** In 2017, the United States produced 2 million pounds of uranium ore, accounting for 10% of world production. The decline in U.S. uranium production stems from the cessation of major U.S. uranium production sites, such as Rio Algoso, Texas, which produced about 900,000 pounds of uranium (~400.9 kilograms of U3O8 ) per year from 1956 to 1990. Also, the United States mined less uranium, about 1.5 million pounds of uranium (~699 kilograms of U3O8) per year4 between 1980 and 2006. In 2015, five million pounds of uranium (30 million pounds of uranium oxide, or UO2) were mined in the United States, accounting for 8% of global supply.2 That share has continued to decline in the latest production data reported in Energy Information Administration, \"Monthly Energy Review (MER),\" 2017. Figure 1 shows worldwide uranium production from 1964 through September 2017 (the available global uranium production data extends to August 2017). In 2016, global production levels and extraction rates decreased between 3% and 10%, primarily in Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia, while production in the United States remained relatively unchanged. Canada, Kazakhstan, and Australia increased their production shares by 4%, 5%, and 9% respectively since 2007, while the U.S. share decreased from 78% in 2007 to 14% in 2016.3 Figure 1.\nA 2014 study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology analyzed the impact of the U.S. uranium market closure on the total energy mix in the United States, concluding the market closure would have no impact.5 In a scenario comparison, the study found that, compared to a baseline scenario, the closure of the U.S. uranium market lowered total U.S. nuclear generation to 173 billion kilowatt hours (bkWh) in 2018 and 164 bkWh by 2027\u2014a reduction of ~5%.6 As the demand for U.S. nuclear electricity decreased, the market closures are unlikely to affect investment in nuclear technology research and development for nonmilitary application. In a separate study, M. P. Reardon of M.I.T. assessed the impact of U.S. uranium price changes on the global uranium market using a partial equilibrium model to analyze changes in nuclear fuel cost and uranium ore production.7 Reardon found no indications the nuclear fuel cost trend would be affected by a market closure of the United States and that the fuel cost trend would remain the same, even without a domestic uranium market.

This provision was amended in 2018 by the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA, \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 9001 et seq. of P.L. 115-253) and further amended in 2019 by the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA, \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0903 of P.L. 116-94 ).

Although a portion of the outstanding balance had been designated as loans, the United States has so far not followed through on its plan to convert the PA's debt to congressionally appropriated foreign assistance into a long-term fixed-rate loan in five phases. The PA said that it would not be able to repay its debt, and the Obama Administration expressed concern that providing further aid to the PA would simply increase the amount of money the PA would owe the United States in the future: \"U.S. foreign assistance to the PA has had the unintended effect of contributing to Palestinian economic stagnation and to the consolidation of power by an already weak leadership in Ramallah.\" During the Obama and Trump Administrations, however, Congress appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in bilateral assistance for the Palestinians, providing additional funds during FY2014 and FY2015 for certain Palestinian projects despite administration opposition. The Obama and Trump administrations proposed reducing bilateral assistance to the Palestinians, but each also vetoed legislation that would have cut such assistance.  In January 2018, a new administration and new Congress took office, bringing a new willingness to consider legislation that would reduce or end such aid.\n\n## United States aid to the Palestinians\n\nAID TO THE PALESTINIANS\n\nAuthorizing and Appropriating FY2015 Aid to the Palestinians\n\nIn 2015, Congress again considered the possibility of using foreign aid to the Palestinians as leverage to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. For example, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) introduced an amendment to the FY2015 DoD appropriations bill (by way of the FY2015 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill) to prohibit the use of funds made available for 2015 (FY2015) until the Administration provided Congress a report on the use and effectiveness of all funds allocated for Palestinian programs in FY2014. Congress approved the bill, including the Rogers amendment, in January 2015. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS) subsequently introduced an amendment to the FY2015 DoD appropriations bill (by way of the FY2015 Defense-Wide appropriations bill) requiring the President to certify that none of the $215 million requested for 2015 for the World Bank's \"Global Trust Fund\" would be allocated to the Palestinians.\n\nSENATE APPROPRIATIONS: Congress approved an amendment to the FY2015 DoD appropriations bill (by way of the FY2015 Defense-Wide appropriations bill) prohibiting the World Bank from sending Palestinian-controlled portions of it to the Palestinians.  On November 4, the House of Representatives passed the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.J.Res. 124), which would fund the federal government through December 11, 20", "This report discusses issues related to providing employment services targeted at NCPs (non-custodial parents) within the context of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program is a Federal/state partnership that operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 60 tribal nations, as well as the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The program seeks to promote parental responsibility and ensure children receive support from both parents, particularly through the transfer of income from an NCP to a Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. In FY2018, the CSE program provided services on behalf of 14.7 million children, or about one-fifth of all children. One estimate indicates that about two-thirds of CSE families had income below 200% of poverty. The CSE program collected 66% of the current support that was due in FY2018, continuing the program's record of slow but steady improvement in recent years. However, $ 11.5 billion in current support that was due went uncollected, becoming arrears (payments past due). Some observers have concluded that some NCPs have a currently limited ability to pay that restricts how much support is collected. They also argue that some NCPs would benefit from employment services being offered in the context of the CSE program. Proponents of CSE employment programs assert that they respond to the concern that NCPs need help securing employment, but might be less likely than other populations to access employment services through the Workforce Development system or through benefits programs. Opponents point out that some NCPs who do not have the capacity to adequately parent and are not interested in supporting their children are not helped by CSE employment services. Some of those same opponents also point out that while it may be less expensive to provide these services, CSE employment programs also have lower costs associated with benefits received by custodial parents and children from the support payments that result from these programs (e.g., more resources available). To ensure that CSE employment services are effective, they must be designed with regard to NCP eligibility and recruitment. Unemployed, or underemployed, low-income NCPs that are struggling to meet their obligations to the CSE are the population that should qualify for services that are targeted mainly at assisting them in finding sufficient, stable, and remunerative employment. Programs may also serve additional types of NCPs in order to facilitate recruitment or to expand their reach. The CSE employment programs targeted at NCPs could also be designed to prioritize certain cases, like those in which no-good cause or low employment could be found, by imposing time-bound restrictions on eligibility. In addition, any restrictions may be removed if certain conditions that affect employability, such as chronic unemployment or substance abuse, no longer exist. The CSE employment programs may be designed as programs that target mainly NCPs that are not interested in parenting their children. In these cases, case closure could occur if benefits are received by the custodial parent through the support payments that result from these programs (e.g., more resources available to meet the family\u0092s needs on a regular basis).", "https://nss.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2017/12/11/NSS-Policy-Report.pdf", "GHANA\nSUMMAR PROCEDURES\n1. STEP II: REVIEW AND DELETE THE TERMS WITH HIGH FREQUENCY\nThis is to determine whether the selected terms appeared in the original text. There is also the possibility that the terms in the question will form a synonym group. The frequency count will eliminate some synonyms. All the terms which occur frequently and in high frequency will be deleted from further consideration in the summary procedure. W\n2. STEP III: CALCULATE THE FREQUENCY COUNT\nThe frequency count can also be measured using the word count. This can also be used to delete the infrequent terms which are not often used in the text. Some infrequent terms may, however, be useful and essential for the final summary.\nThis step deals with all synonyms which appear in the text and which may have been deleted. If the synonym still exists in Step I, it will not be deleted. It is always good to retain the synonymous or the parallel term, especially if it is necessary to produce a suitable summary. These terms are, therefore, checked and may be included in the summary text but not included in the frequency count. This procedure is described in this paper using the word count to calculate the frequency count but it can easily be done using the word document or the word processor.\n4. STEP IV: SELECT A SYNONYM THAT APPEARS MOST OFTEN\nThis is done in the case where the term synonymous with the target term is used. Here, we are concerned with all the words that the target term could be used in place of. In the case of the search words, as we have discovered, the terms are noun phrases and nouns, which are easily detected by the word count function in the word processor or word document. At this stage the target term cannot be easily eliminated. Instead, it may well be that the target term itself that is eliminated under normal paragraphing. The paragraphs are used, in the first instance, to provide a suitable framework for the synonyms to be selected. It is the synonyms within this framework that will receive more prominence than other synonyms because they have a better chance of appearing in the paragraphs and these are the ones that should be preserved under synonymisation. For example, in the second paragraph, the following selection of synonymous terms may be found:\nApart from the target term itself, there are two more terms, which are in the synonym group of the target term.\nSynonyms are, therefore, only the words and phrases that are not the target term but that have the same meaning or are synonyms of the target term. Once the synonyms are identified, they can be retained, or selected and used to provide a text for the summary.\nApart from these words, there are other phrases and words whose meaning are not synonymous with the target term. In this section they will be eliminated from consideration, which is termed disinvestment.\nThe terms that have been eliminated are called disinvested terms/words. These are disinvestments from the original term, i.e. they are taken out because of their disinvestment. These, therefore, do not form part of the synonym group, but may be similar to the disinvested term.\nThe terms that are outside the synonym group will include all the terms that are not disinvested and the target term itself. It will also include all the terms that have not been eliminated, i.e. the retained terms.\nThe group of terms retained should be arranged to form a summary. These are called investments. They may be put into separate paragraphs as described below:\nThe retained words will go into different paragraphs, depending on their length/number of words. The investments are those words that are used to make up a summary, e.g. the following terms are examples of investments in the first paragraph:\nThe above selection was made with reference to the second paragraph. In the third paragraph the same exercise will result in the following synonyms, which are outside the synonym group of the target term:\nThe target tern itself will appear in the summary as it is also in the synonym group. It should, therefore, be left on the surface as it was the intention of the summary to make it appear in the overall text. The terms marked * above, after synonymisation, can be selected as synonyms for the target term. These include:\nThe investment groups are then arranged in an appropriate order. A suitable ordering is needed before the final paragraph is made up.\nThe target term itself needs to be left on the surface because other information can be added here, if", "Maintaining and expanding domestic capacity, U.S.-based industrial modernization, and U.S. supply chain investment could be critical to mitigating risks to American economic and health security.

Prize-linked sweepstakes are essentially lotteries and other contests in which consumers register and must purchase something or make some form of payment to participate in a sweepstakes. Most commercial radio and television stations are licensed to operate public airwaves on the condition that they operate \"in the public interest, convenience, and necessity,\" as provided by Section 307 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Section 310(d) of the Act provides that in determining whether a broadcast station is in compliance with the public interest standard, the FCC shall take into account \"the levels of signal strength, service, and population and community served...whether [the station is] a direct or a local service... [t]he nature and frequency of [its] service to the public,\" and \"such other factors as are reasonable,\" when rendering a decision following an application for a permit for a new broadcast station or for a change in a broadcast station's facilities or service area. The \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" test balances the need for a broadcast station to be successful and competitive in the market place with the need to provide programming consistent with the objectives of the public airwaves. The FCC has held that lotteries and other contests are not \"in the public interest, convenience, and necessity,\" but are \"inconsistent with the character and purpose of radio broadcast service.\" 13 Under Section 4 of the Communications Act, the FCC is authorized to regulate any radio communications, including lotteries and contests. In 1973, the FCC issued an Order, codified at Section 73.7604 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which prohibits television and radio stations licensed under the Communications Act, including broadcast station owners, from using their facilities, or radio or television coverage areas to publicize, advertise, or solicit entries for a lottery or contest (other than a bona fide sweepstakes where no consideration is required). The Commission also issued a Declaratory Ruling, declaring (pursuant to Section 208(a) of the Communications Act) that the use of television and radio to publicize, advertise, or solicit entries for a lottery or contest would constitute an action in \"bad faith\" that would, under Section 301 of the Act, subject a broadcaster to fines (up to $15,000 per day) and/or suspension of its license. The Congress considered the SALOTR bill ( H.R. 3106) in the 111th and 112th Congresses, but was not passed. In the 112th Congress, the SALOTR bill was the subject of two hearings before the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. During the two hearings, some witnesses and representatives from the broadcasting and communications industries expressed opposition to a federal ban on prize-linked sweepstakes and contests carried on television and radio, arguing that broad restrictions on contests and sweepstakes would be a burden on consumers, interfere with stations' rights under the First Amendment, and inhibit the growth of local and independent media. Some witnesses and some representatives from the broadcasting and communications industries contended that there is no such thing as a prize-linked sweepstakes and that such contests could be banned under existing provisions in the Communications Act. The Senate Commerce Committee has not held a hearing on the SALOTR bill. Scope of hearing and background information. Federal law makes little mention of prize-linked contests and sweepstakes, although lawmakers in at least one state have made such contests illegal. Under the Communications Act, the FCC bars television and radio stations from using their airwaves to advertise or publicize any \"lottery or contest in which the prize consists of any money or other thing of value, other than a prize of minimal monetary value.\" For the most part over the last 70 years, the FCC and federal courts have interpreted this prohibition to mean that commercial broadcast stations may not advertise or publicize any lottery or contest in which the prize exceeds $5,000. This prohibition is part of longstanding policy to prevent", "T he economic effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led Congress to consider general fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts. Additional stimulus proposals are under consideration. This report looks at tax cuts proposed or enacted during the Great Recession, current enacted provisions, and potential ones, and their potential effectiveness. Several tax cuts were discussed during consideration of fiscal stimulus in response to the Great Recession, and the specific proposal (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, P.L. 111-5 ) adopted in 2009 included individual tax cuts directed at lower- and middle-income individuals and also included business tax cuts. An earlier fiscal stimulus (P.L. 110-185 ) adopted in 2008 included rebates and accelerated depreciation (bonus depreciation) for businesses. Some of these types of provisions were included in stimulus tax cut legislation in 2001-2003 and some of the debate centered on the effectiveness of alternatives. Among the tax cuts discussed in 2001 were tax rebates targeted toward lower-income individuals, a speed-up of tax rate reductions for higher-income Individuals, a temporary sales tax holiday, a temporary payroll tax holiday, a temporary investment stimulus, corporate tax cuts (primarily repealing the alternative minimum tax), and dividend reductions. The 2001 tax cut included a rebate, and the final version of the 2002 tax cut bill included a temporary investment stimulus. President Bush proposed accelerated rate cuts and dividend relief in his stimulus package for 2003. Provisions such as rebates were made by Democratic leaders. Although the economy recovered from the recession, issues of fiscal stimulus arose again in the 109 th Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The tax stimulus enacted in response included rebates for both lower- and middle-income individuals and temporary bonus depreciation for businesses. The business provisions included a bonus depreciation extension and a carryback of net operating losses. The legislation also extended the Alternative Minimum Tax, which tends to go to higher-income individuals. Many, but not all, of the expiring temporary tax cuts that were adopted in 2012 were extended permanently. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ), which extended expiring temporary tax cuts, enacted rate reductions and included a two-percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax. In December of 2019, the Further Additional Compensation for the Continuing Costs of Coverage of Essential Employees Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-93 ) enacted temporary tax refunds to employers for the coverage of essential workforce employees under health coverage. The Coronavirus Tax Cut and Small Business Relief Act of 2020 ( H.R. 5216 ) adopted on February 20, 2020, includes provisions to reduce businesses, individuals, and partners for qualified purchases made, as determined in regulations, during January 2020 but before the end of 2021, at the election of the person. Among provisions of the Coronavirus Tax Cut and Small Business Relief Act is a provision that sets the corporate income tax rate at 21% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019. Other provisions in the bill include the creation of a temporary general business credit for employing individuals furloughed, or self-employed persons who were unable, for reasons beyond their control, to perform their personal services, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Also included is a requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury allow, beginning with the calendar year 2021 income tax filing deadline, taxpayers to file an amended individual income tax return for any net operating loss carryovers of self-employed taxpayers arising in a taxable year before, during, or after any period for which the filing of personal income tax returns for self-employed persons is delayed pursuant to emergency legislation enacted in response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States; and for other purposes. SUMMARY", "This report provides an overview of economic and fiscal conditions in the US Virgin Islands. It discusses the impact of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and congressional actions affecting the US Virgin Islands. This report opens with a brief historical perspective of the origin of the Virgin Islands and covers the islands' history through the present day. Congressional interest in the Virgin Islands has included legislative actions addressing the islands' economic challenges. This report concludes with a short discussion on recent disaster relief legislation in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and includes a brief overview of USDA's food assistance program within the U.S. territories. TEXT REMOVED INTRODUCTION The U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) are situated approximately 40 miles east of the Puerto Rican mainland and 90 miles southeast of the Dominican Republic. They include the principal islands of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, along with over 50 smaller islands and over 20 sand bars, cays, and islets.1 The three principal islands are mountainous and their highest peaks extend well over 1,100 feet above sea level.2 St. Croix (30x10 miles) is the largest of the three islands; it contains two-thirds of the total land in the USVI. Its northwestern tip lies about three miles south of Point Udall, the easternmost point of the United States.3 The largest town, Christiansted, is situated on the south shore, and is home to about two-thirds of the U.S. Virgin Islands population. St. Thomas (19x5 miles) is the most densely populated of the three islands. The largest town is Charlotte Amalie (pop. about 21,000), which has served as a major commercial port. The majority of trade in the USVI is conducted through St. Thomas.4 St. John is the smallest of the USVI (about 28 square miles), and is the only USVI island without an airport.5 The largest town on St. John (pop. about 3,600) is Cruz Bay.6 The USVI enjoy a tropical climate and average maximum summer temperatures are about 88 degrees Fahrenheit; average winter temperatures range from the mid-60s to about 77 degrees Fahrenheit. The U.S. Virgin Islands lie within the U.S. Customs territory but are not within the U.S. borders and do not share a land border or maritime border with the United States. The USVI consists of a mix of local residents, mainland Americans, and nationalities from around the world, primarily from the Caribbean, South America, and the former Soviet bloc countries. In addition to the U.S. citizenship of most residents, it is estimated that more than 1 million residents of Puerto Rico hold Virgin Islands residency.7 As of July 1, 2018, the total population was roughly 104,000.8 The U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) became a territory of the United States (US) as a result of the 1917 Treaty of the Danish West Indies;9 prior to the Danish agreement with the U.S., the islands were governed by Denmark from 1867 until 1917. On March 31, 1917, the U.S., after a 30-year possession of Puerto Rico, purchased the Danish West Indies for $25 million. The purchase reflected wartime geopolitical considerations and the strategic importance of the islands to the United States in the protection of trade routes to the Caribbean, South America, and Central America.10 The three principal islands of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas were sold to the United States, while 20 smaller islands were sold to the Netherlands.11 The U.S. purchased the Virgin Islands along with American Samoa, Guam, and Wake Island; those islands comprised the U.S. Insular Territories that are today's U.S. territories.12 The purchase of the Virgin Islands was ratified by the U.S. Senate on February 16, 1918,13 and was signed into law by then-president Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917, after approval from the Danish parliament, and is known as the Jones Act.14 The U.S. Virgin Islands has had a special status with the U.S. under the Revised Organic Act of", "E ach term, the Supreme Court typically hears arguments in one or more cases concerning the rights and status of Indian tribes and their members. Prominent issues addressed by the Sup reme Court in recent terms have included (1) tribes&apos; civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, (2) the scope of tribal sovereign immunity, and (3) termination of Indian parents&apos; rights in adoption cases. The October 2018 term likewise featured several Indian law issues: the Court heard arguments in three significant cases, each of which implicated the complex relationships among tribal, state, and federal laws. In Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den , the Court upheld a Washington Supreme Court decision permitting a tribe to import fuel without paying state fuel taxes. The right to travel on public highways guaranteed by an 1855 treaty (1855 Yakama Treaty) between the United States and the Yakama tribe likewise protected a Yakama member&apos;s fuel transportation into the state. Similarly, in Murphy v. Carpenter , the Court reviewed a case brought against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in which the plaintiff alleged that the United States negligently placed a member of the Blackfeet Nation off reservation in a home with a sex offender who later abused the child. In United States v. Bryant , the Court considered the criminal prosecution of a member of the Pueblo of Laguna. In all three cases, the Supreme Court focused its consideration on the scope of legislative authority over Indians. This report discusses each of those instances in turn, focusing on treaty interpretations, relevant legislation, and the limits on congressional power. On March 19, 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed a 2017 Washington Supreme Court decision defending a right-to-travel provision in an 1855 treaty (1855 Yakama Treaty) between the United States and the Yakama tribe from a state attempt to impose a motor fuels tax on  the Yakama member&apos;s fuel. The Supreme Court agreed, though in such a way that the limits of the right-to-travel provision in the 1855 Yakama Treaty may still not be perfectly clear. According to the Court in Mescalero , Indians \"going beyond reservation boundaries\" had typically \"not been subject to nondiscriminatory regulation\" by non-Indian states' laws. However, in 2004 the Court upheld the constitutionality of a New York State law concerning gambling on Indian reservations. In that case, State of New York v. Mills , the Court stated that \"[t]he issue here is not the power of New York to regulate or prohibit gambling within the state,\" but rather whether non-Indians on noncontiguous reservation lands may be \"subject to the full brunt of [state] measures to control and eradicate the scourge of gambling.\" Thus began a series of cases in which the Court attempted to clarify the rights of \"non-Indians going beyond reservation boundaries\" in states&apos; attempts to regulate activities in their jurisdictions. In South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. (Wayfair) , a 2018 decision addressing state-imposed taxes on non-Indians involved in activities on Indian reservations, the Court decided that a state could not tax non-Indian sales to non-Indian customers on Indian reservations unless there was sufficient sales tax collection infrastructure on those reservations (collectively referred to as \"tribal lands\"). However, the Court did not overturn the 1992 decision in Quill v. North Dakota, which decided that States lacked the right to collect sales taxes from retailers without a brick-and-mortar storefront absent their own collection infrastructure. States currently may also impose taxes on Internet sales, even where neither those non-Indian retailers nor their customers reside on tribal lands. In the 2018 cases Murphy v . Carpenter , as referenced above, and Bryant , the Supreme Court reviewed whether the United States could prosecute an off-reservation sex offender and a non-Indian accused of killing a fellow Pueblo member on reservation land, respectively. In both cases, the Court focused on the limits on Congress&apos;s authority to regulate Indian tribes. Although both the sex offender and the murderer were on reservation", "The U.S. government's Visa Waiver Program (VWP) (1) allows a limited number of participating foreign countries to issue visas to visa waiver countries without first getting approval for the visa from the State Department, (2) includes a biographical and biometric database of travelers entering and exiting the countries, (3) requires foreign nationals to apply for a permit to enter the United States through an online form system called ESTA, (4) does not apply to other foreign visitors seeking visas for employment, study, investment, or adoption or for immigrants who want to come to the United States.\nThis report was composed using data and information from other CRS reports, the U.S. government, and various media sources.

USDA released its first forecast of 2019 cash receipts and average prices paid on March 13, 2019 and the 2019/20 crop year on March 27, 2019. The second forecasts are scheduled for release in June 2019 with forecasts for the 2020 crop year projected in August 2019. A third release is tentatively scheduled for release in November 2019. Projected forecasts are based on anticipated 2019 crop outcomes and 2020/21 crop planted acre intentions, which are released monthly as part of USDA\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s monthly Crop Production reports. The projections and other supporting analyses will be available on the USDA-ERS web site at http://www.ers.usda.gov/farm-economy/. USDA-ERS will release supporting analyses and additional revisions in its 2020 Crop Year Outlook report in August 2019.", "Significant recent coastal and riverine flood events, as well as concerns about changing hydrologic conditions, have prompted interest in using a suite of approaches to reduce flood risk and improve flood resilience , which is the ability to adapt to, withstand, and rapidly recover from floods. Traditional options to reduce flood risk include constructing levees and dams. Some stakeholders and Members of Congress support protecting, restoring, and enhancing natural features and processes to reduce flood and storm damages. Examples include floodplains that can store excess water and coastal wetlands that may attenuate storm surge. Congress has directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) the primary federal agency constructing projects to reduce flood risks to \"evaluate the use of natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) when conducting its flood risk reduction activities along the nation's rivers and coasts. As part of a USACE authority, Congress defined a nature-based feature as \"a feature that is created by human design, engineering, and construction to provide risk reduction by acting in concert with natural processes over time.\" It re defined a natural feature as a feature \"created through the action of physical, geological, biological, and chemical processes over time.\" Although NNBFS may provide flood risk reduction and resilience benefits in some circumstances, they may be unable to replicate the risk reduction provided by traditional structural and nonstructural measures for some communities.", "This report provides context for Congress about the U.S. teen birth rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094or the number of births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19 each year\u00e2\u0080\u0094and its changes since the 1950s. Over this period, the teen birth rate has generally been in decline. This decline has been most significant in recent years, with the rate reaching a record low in 2018. Multiple factors have likely contributed to the decrease, though the influence of any single factor is not fully known. Reduced teen sexual activity, particularly among younger adolescents, could be one explanation. Increases in use of contraceptives, including highly effective and multiple methods, among sexually active teens could be another. Other factors, such as broader social and economic trends, may also be at play. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress continues to be interested in the issue of teen birth because of its high social and economic costs for both individual families and society more generally. Further, disparities persist in teen birth rates among racial and ethnic subgroups and across states. This report accompanies CRS Report R45183, Teen Pregnancy: Federal Prevention Programs, which discusses Congress' current approach of supporting programs that seek to prevent pregnancy among teens. Data on births are distinct from data on pregnancies. The teen birth rate refers to the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19. The teen pregnancy rate includes the number of pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19, which encompasses live births, abortions, and fetal losses. The CDC and the Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates. These rates are usually published a year or two after birth data because of the time required to incorporate data from the various data sources.\nThis report focuses on the teen birth rate. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the United States. About 180,000 of these births (4.7%) were to teens aged 15 to 19. Figure 1 indicates that the birth rate was higher in each year for the older teens compared to the younger teens.\nThe 2018 teen birth rate of 17.4 was a historical low since CDC began collecting and reporting birth data in the 1940s. The CDC began tracking subgroup data for teens in 1960, when the teen birth rate was highest for both teens aged 15 to 17 (43.9 per 1,000) and teens aged 18 to 19 (166.7 per 1,000). The overall rate over time declined from 96.3 in 1991 to the record low of 17.4 in 2018. Multiple factors have likely contributed to the decrease, though the influence of any single factor is not fully known. Reduced teen sexual activity, particularly among younger adolescents, could be one explanation. Increases in use of contraceptives, including highly effective and multiple methods, among sexually active teens could be another. Other factors, such as broader social and economic trends, may also be at play.\nEconomic Security The teen birth rate has declined since the 1950s. This decline has been most significant in recent years, with the rate reaching a record low in 2018. Multiple factors have likely contributed to the decrease, though the influence of any single factor is not fully known. The primary reason for these declines is teens' reduced exposure to the risk factors of teen pregnancy, including delayed onset of sexual activity, reduced frequency of sexual activity (with fewer sexual partners), and increased contraceptive use and adoption. Other reasons for the decline are thought to include improved educational attainment, increases in unintended pregnancy, and socioeconomic factors. Among the largest factors is a decline in sexual activity among teens and young adults.\nEven the decline in teen pregnancies is not without certain limitations, as it is influenced, in part, by the declining number of teens. This drop is the result of both a decline of teens and their age of first birth. For example, there are fewer women giving birth because", "The House pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule is generally intended to discourage or prevent Congress from taking certain legislative action that would increase the deficit. It prohibits the consideration of direct spending (or mandatory spending) and revenue legislation that is projected to increase the deficit over either a 6-year or an 11-year period. In effect, the rule requires legislation that includes provisions projected to increase direct spending and/or reduce revenues to also include offsetting provisions over the two specified periods. The House PAYGO rule was first established at the beginning of the 110th Congress and modified in the 111th Congress. It was replaced by the cut-as-you-go (CUTGO) rule, which applied only to direct spending legislation, at the beginning of the 112th Congress. The PAYGO rule was reinstated, with modifications, replacing the CUTGO rule, at the beginning of the 116th Congress. This report explains the House PAYGO rule\u2019s features, describes its legislative history, and discusses how it compares to statutory PAYGO requirements. It updates the previous version (dated November 30, 2010), largely with information about the CUTGO rule and the PAYGO rule, as adopted in the 116th Congress. The full text of the House PAYGO rule is provided in the Appendix. The House PAYGO rule adopted for the 116th Congress prohibits the consideration of legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Direct spending has two distinguishing features. First, it is provided or controlled through the annual appropriations process. Direct spending is not counted for purposes of determining whether legislation increases the deficit under the House PAYGO rule. The House PAYGO rule applies to most discretionary spending, which generally is provided or controlled through the annual appropriations process and is outside the jurisdictions of budget committees. Second, it is not subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements. Instead, discretionary spending is subject to statutory cost limits set in annual appropriations acts and to the budgetary scorekeeping of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). CBO compares projected budgetary levels under current law to levels specified in appropriations acts. Direct spending is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget; discretionary spending is within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee and certain other committees, including the Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Foreign Affairs. When the Senate is considering an appropriations act, the bill must be reported and considered pursuant to a special order of business; this order generally limits Senate floor consideration to not more than two hours of debate, which may be limited to two hours of floor consideration by majority and minority floor managers or managers on different sides of the issue. When the Senate is considering an appropriations measure, a motion to recommit to the committee of jurisdiction is not in order. Revenues are the funds that are collected from the public primarily as a result of the federal government\u2019s exercise of its sovereign taxing power. Revenues are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House. The House PAYGO rule generally prohibits consideration of new direct spending legislation unless it also provides an amount of mandatory spending cuts under the PAYGO rule that is equal to the cost of the new legislation, with certain limited exceptions. It specifies that, as a general rule, any measure that would increase direct spending must be \u201cpaid for\u201d through an accompanying measure that increases deficits equally or more than the amount of spending increases. In addition, any budgetary savings generated by measures in the same Act increasing revenue levels or decreasing tax expenditures are to be first applied to offsetting spending in that Act and then to deficit reduction. In this regard, the PAYGO rule establishes procedures for resolving claims of surplus offsets, which can only be used to pay for direct spending under the PA YGO rules, that arise in the consideration of measures in the same Act. The rule provides that, in the House, any measure reported under the PA YGO rule shall be subject to a motion offered and may be considered as if the motion read: \u201cThat the House decline to concur 2 in the Senate amendment to H.R. [number of bill], by a recorded vote of 2/3 yeas and nays,\u201d with the result of consideration a yes or no vote on the merits of", "Iran is a country of nearly 80 million people, located in the heart of the Persian Gulf region. The United States was an ally of the late Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (the Shah), who ruled from 1941 until his ouster in February 1979. The Shah assumed the throne when Britain and Russia forced his father, Reza Shah Pahlavi (Reza Shah), from power because of his perceived alignment with Germany in World War II. Reza Shah had assumed power in 1921 when, as an officer in Iran's only military force, the Cossack Brigade (reflecting Russian influence in Iran in the early 20th century), he launched a coup against the government of the Qajar Dynasty, which had ruled since 1794. Qajar rule was characterized by several internal struggles, military threats from both the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire, and conquest by the Russian Empire in 1828. The Qajar dynasty was the last native dynasty to rule Persia (Iran), although the Russian Empire established control of much of western Iran, present-day Azerbaijan, as a result of the 1801 Treaty of Gulistan-Treaty of Turkmenchay between the Qajar Dynasty and Russia until 1920. The Qajar dynasty was overthrown after the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906 in the wake of protests against declining living standards, arbitrary rule in an agrarian society, and the effects of the large concessions granted to foreigners. In 1909, Iranian nationalists and reformers established a Majles (parliament) in Tehran to replace the powerless Iranian senate. By the early 1920s, however, there were growing tensions between parliament and the Qajar dynasty. In 1921, Reza Shah was proclaimed Shah of Iran. Reza Shah's rise to power followed the British military intervention in Iraq (Britain had controlled Iraq since 1917), which was aimed in part at keeping out the Bolshevik Russians, as the Bolsheviks sought to spread political and economic influence in the Muslim world. The British had invested heavily in Iranian railways and industry, and were intent on protecting their interests and those of their Indian mercantile elites. After Reza Shah gained control of the oil reserves through a treaty with the British, he attempted to modernize Iran by encouraging the growth of large-scale farms and factories. His modernization measures were aimed particularly at the industrialization of oil production and related infrastructure. In the early 1900s, there were growing pangs of nationalism among the Iranian middle class, although this nationalism was tempered by traditional cultural and economic factors. For example, in the early 20th century, Iranian nationalists and reformers did not reject the concept of an Iranian aristocracy, which in part drew on the country's ancient history. Additionally, Iran had a lack of natural resources to sustain industrial capitalism, particularly after its 1908 confrontation with imperial Russia had deprived it of its northern oil fields. Iran's political elite therefore relied on imports of manufactured goods from European countries and access to raw materials exported by European powers, which created a class of Iranian industrialists whose interests were tied to the fortunes of the European powers. The Iranian nationalist movement was also influenced by Iranians studying in Russia, France and Europe. During the Allied occupation after World War I Iran became the second country to recognize the Soviet Union (after Finland) and the first to recognize the Soviet Union's western frontiers.", "ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB GROWTH During a typical expansion, which typically ranges from two to six years in length\u00e2\u0080\u0094since World War II, 14 out of 22 expansions have lasted longer than five-and-a-half years\u00e2\u0080\u0094economic growth has averaged 3.5% and job growth has averaged 2% (see Figure 1). Economic growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094measured as the percent change every quarter in the inflation-adjusted GDP\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a widely monitored and debated key indicator of the economy. Real GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in the United States during a given period. A general rule of thumb is that if real GDP is growing at or above 3%, then employment growth is likely to be positive. If it is below 3%, employment growth is likely to be negative or, at best, flat, since employers are wary of taking on more staff in a weak growth period. In the past 40 years, GDP has expanded 89 times. Over 70% of those 89 periods ended with either a positive or a small (under 1%) contraction in GDP. Only 15% of those expansions saw GDP growth under 2%. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2019, the United States experienced an expansion of 109 consecutive quarters. Economic growth during those 109 quarters was 2.3% on average. Although job growth\u00e2\u0080\u0094measured as the percent change every month in private nonfarm payroll employment\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a less-watched metric than GDP, its connection to growth is similarly strong.

In addition, other policy concerns such as physical and cybersecurity measures for voting equipment, federal funding for state and local campaigning and voting, and the accuracy of ballot information have received attention at various times. With the evolution of online campaigning and voting, which has increased foreign interference in U.S. elections, new challenges have emerged. Policy issues related to election security fall within these broad categories: 1.  protecting the cybersecurity of systems related to voting, which includes state and territorial governments' responsibilities for administering elections; 2.  assisting state, territorial, and local campaign activities and elections administration, such as with funding, information, or equipment; and 3.  preserving the integrity of election information and supporting the general public understanding of how elections work. This report provides congressional readers with an overview that includes a historical perspective on election security challenges that have arisen during recent elections, as well as potential future questions for congressional consideration. The appendix (available on Congress.gov) provides a table comparing selected existing and new legislation in the House and the Senate.\nThe security of elections in the United States, including in this year's midterm elections, is one of the central concerns of voters following the 2016 presidential election. In the 2018 midterm elections, 47.5 million people voted in state and congressional midterm elections, according to recent data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\nIn the fall of 2016, several U.S. national security officials said that the Russian government sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election by conducting a campaign of Internet-based propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. Some of these efforts appeared to try to undermine the legitimacy of the election. To varying degrees, both the current and the previous Administrations have asserted that this type of influence campaign could happen in the future or recur. This could include conducting false or misleading advertisements as part of so-called \"Russian trolls\" efforts, or through disinformation campaigns that seek to influence or confuse voters; and more than 250 individuals and entities, including alleged trolls of Russian origin, have been indicted by U.S. federal officials for committing crimes related to interference in the 2016 election.\nThese and other concerns have made securing elections a policy and funding topic in the 116th Congress. The 116th Congress is considering election security as a potential component of funding for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which provides funding for state and local election security. Congress's activity has spanned a range of issues that are part of broad discussions about campaigns and elections. Those issues can include supporting campaigns or administering elections, as well as protecting the integrity of elections, ballots, and voter perceptions about campaigns.\nIn addition to congressional activity, the executive branch has taken some steps. For example, Congress has appropriated over $4 billion to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), for their assistance to state and local governments in protecting election systems. The executive branch has also implemented several cybersecurity standards that regulate the voting equipment that state and local governments used in the November 2018 election and that governments purchase with federal funds. In 2019, the State Elections Commissioners Association will hold a task force on election cybersecurity. Finally, the White House will continue to hold Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Summits for state and local election officials to discuss threats to their computer systems and networks. Several states also have considered legislation to adopt additional cybersecurity standards and improve cybersecurity for election-related equipment.\nFor decades, election security has involved ensuring that voting was not disrupted and votes were cast and counted appropriately. In addition, other policy concerns such as physical and cybersecurity measures for voting equipment, federal funding for state and local campaigning and voting, and the accuracy of ballot information have received attention at various times. With the evolution of online campaigning and voting, which has increased foreign interference in U.S. elections, new challenges have emerged.

In 2017, about 55% of the U.S. population had private group coverage (e.g., a health plan offered by an employer) and 13.5% had private individual coverage (e.g., a health plan offered through a health insurance exchange). In general, health plans sold in the private health insurance market must comply with state and federal health insurance requirements. The federal requirements relate to how coverage is offered and issued, the benefits it must cover, and how it is priced, among other issues. An example of a federal health insurance requirement is the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions. Although federal health insurance requirements generally apply to health plans sold in the private health insurance market, not all private health coverage arrangements comply with such requirements. This includes exempted health coverage arrangements and noncompliant health coverage arrangements, as termed for purposes of this report. This report identifies and describes arrangements within these two categories. The report is intended to help congressional policymakers better understand the scope of these health coverage arrangements that are available to individuals in the United States\u2019 private health insurance markets and to provide information about the limitations of the application of federal health insurance requirements. The private health insurance market has different segments. Understanding these different segments is relevant to the application of state and federal health insurance requirements. The individual health insurance market segment is where individuals and families buying insurance on their own (i.e., not through a plan sponsor) may purchase health plans. In the group health insurance market, a plan sponsor, typically an employer, offers coverage to a group (e.g., the employer\u2019s employees). The group market is divided into small- and large-group market segments. It is also categorized according to how the plan is insured. Group plans that are purchased by employers and other plan sponsors from state-licensed health insurance issuers and are offered to employees or other groups are referred to as fully insured plans. Employers or other plan sponsors that offer self-insured plans set aside funds to pay for health benefits directly, and they bear the risk of covering medical expenses generated by the individuals covered under the self-insured plan. Federal requirements can, but do not necessarily, apply uniformly to health plans offered in the individual, small-group, and large-group markets. Federal health insurance requirements are codified in three statutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Part 7 of the Employee Retirement Insurance Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and Chapter 100 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In general, federal standards establish a minimum level of requirements ( federal floor ) and states may impose additional requirements on issuers and the health plans they offer, provided the state requirements neither conflict with federal law nor prevent the implementation of federal health insurance requirements.\nThe federal health insurance requirements referred to here as the statutory requirements are not the only state and federal requirements that apply to health plans.  They are instead those referenced in the previous section. State and federal laws apply in other areas, such as fraud and abuse and wellness program compliance, in addition to the statutory requirements. Included with this report are certain state laws that, in some instances, modify the statutory health insurance requirements.\nCertain health insurance laws may be applicable in the group health insurance and self-insured small-group markets. Employers that sponsor self-insured group health plans may receive health insurance coverage, which, on its own, qualifies as minimum essential coverage. Because this coverage is not issued by a state-licensed issuer, the insurance requirements do not apply. Other laws, such as antifraud and antitrust laws, may be applicable. The state insurance commissioner or attorney general is responsible for implementing and enforcing the state insurance regulations.\nThe following is a partial list of state laws and regulations that can be found on the NAIC\u2019s website: http://bit.ly/1J3KjOg.\n*Some laws are in the process of being enacted.\n2.1 Federal Law Enacted Pursuant to the ACA To increase the number of Americans with health insurance coverage starting in 2014, as provided for in the ACA.\n2.2 Implementation of Some ACA Provisions by CMS and HHS To implement changes to the Medicare and Medica", "US-Iran Relations | CRS\nAfter several years of protracted negotiations, a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or \"Iran nuclear deal,\" was reached July 14, 2015, among the P5+1 and Iran. The JCPOA's \"Implementation Day\" (January 16, 2016), began the removal of nuclear-related U.N. and international sanctions, in exchange for Iran restricting certain aspects of its nuclear program and agreeing to U.N. inspections.\nSince the JCPOA implementation, the Trump Administration has taken several new steps. It announced that Iran was complying with the JCPOA, and on August 2, 2017, the President issued a new Presidential Memorandum that imposed new sanctions on the IRGC and affiliated entities and individuals and on a variety of other Iran-related activities. On October 13, 2017, the Administration waived most of the U.S. sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program that were to have been reimposed under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA, P.L. 114-17)\u2014i.e., waived sanctions related to the Iranian nuclear program\u2014 but warned that it would withdraw from the JCPOA if it determines that Iran is in violation of the JCPOA or is not fully cooperating. The Administration on November 13 announced that it will no longer accept waivers to continue to allow Iran limited imports of U.S.-origin aircraft and spare parts, a step affecting only Iran. On November 15, the Administration announced that it is imposing new sanctions under INARA based on Iran's ballistic missile tests. President Trump's announcement stated that if the sanctions fail to check malign Iranian behavior, the United States will respond with further pressure.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani on December 1, 2017, threatened to withdraw Iran from the JCPOA. On December 7, 2016, President Barack Obama, responding to questions, said that he did not believe that Iran is currently complying with the JCPOA, despite certifications required under INARA. President Obama said that U.S. intelligence \"knows\" Iran is not complying, and that he is convinced by the analysis in the Nuclear Intelligence Estimate, a classified National Intelligence Estimate produced by U.S. intelligence agencies that the United States complied with its side of the agreement.\n1979-1980 Iran Hostage Crisis\nThe U.S.-Iran relationship began to decline in 1976, as Iran's oil and natural gas industry came under government control. The Shah was viewed by conservatives in the executive branch as a source of instability in the region, as he seemed to be intent on developing a nuclear weapons program, despite his protests to the contrary. In summer and fall 1978, as Iran experienced revolution, the issue of the U.S.-Iran relationship, but particularly the U.S. commitment to provide military assistance, was frequently discussed within the executive branch.\nOn November 4, 1979, student militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 53 embassy staff members hostage. The United States broke diplomatic relations on April 7, 1980, and imposed, in April 1980, the first embargo against Iran, which was still in effect in August 1988.\nThe Reagan Administration, which took office in January 1981, viewed the Islamic revolution in Iran with dismay, as Reagan considered the Shah a reliable partner of the United States and continued to provide military assistance. The Reagan Administration also hoped that the Revolution in Iran would usher in a period of moderation.\nE.O. 12170 revoked all previous U.S. claims against Iran but did not revoke U.S. statutes authorizing the President to impose sanctions.\nU.N. Security Council Resolution 498 declared Iran to be in \"flagrant\" noncompliance with international law, but without mentioning specific provisions.\n1989-1990 Iran-Iraq War\nIn August 1988, the Reagan Administration provided some military equipment to Iraq in the hope of discouraging attacks against civilian aircraft over the Persian Gulf carrying supplies", "Aquaculture operations within the United States federal waters of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are limited to a few aquaculture experimental facilities. Most coastal state governments regulate these activities. Other production-related activities, including the harvest, processing, grading, and distribution of seafood products, occur mostly in state waters, where fishing and aquaculture activities generally are more prevalent. To encourage expansion of the commercial aquaculture industry in federal waters, advocates call for appropriate federal oversight and support to establish an industry-driven regulatory regime, which would likely have to be implemented through legislation. Opponents counter that offshore aquaculture could cause environmental harm and have negative impacts on other coastal activities, such as fishing. To increase the likelihood of industry expansion beyond what has been achieved to date, advocates contend, federal regulatory agencies must provide improved information and assistance in developing an efficient regulatory and support systems for offshore aquaculture. The 116thCongress may consider establishing offshore aquaculture as a viable food-producing endeavor and a source of employment, or Congress may take no action to encourage or prohibit its development in federal waters. A potential concern to the Congressional Research Service from a global food security standpoint, however, is an increasing demand for seafood from an exploding world population. On the other hand, some observers suggest that further offshore aquaculture development may not be possible because of the inherent environmental challenges. Offshore aquaculture is most prevalent in parts of Asia, where many facilities are located offshore. One reason for this is that open ocean waters tend to be less turbulent and more predictable for the operation of culture facilities compared to nearshore waters that are subject to more frequent severe storms and flooding. One of the primary barriers to establishing offshore aquaculture in U.S. federal waters is the uncertainty concerning regulatory jurisdiction. UCS, Marine Aquaculture in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone: Proposals to Expand Offshore Farming, U.S. Congress, House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Provisions of H.R. 4172, the Marine Aquaculture and Marine Spatial Planning Act, as Reported. The main objective of this report is to give the reader a sense of the size and scope of global aquaculture production. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, total global aquaculture production in 2016 was 109,500,000 metric tons (mt), a 35% increase from the previous record-breaking 2010 figure. Nearly three-fourths of that production was from Asia (86,500,000 mt), followed by the Americas (13,700,000 mt). Africa accounted for 9,000,000 mt and Europe for 1,600,000 mt. Total aquaculture production is projected to slightly exceed the 2010 figure over the next 10 years, with an estimated 120,800,000 mt to be produced in 2026. Over the 1997-2026 periods, estimated seafood production (i.e., capture fishing only, no aquaculture) would increase from 89,400,000 mt to 103,800,000 mt. In that sense, aquaculture production appears to have grown faster, but in total is still a minor fraction of the current seafood industry (0.181). A significant reason for the limited development of offshore aquaculture in federal waters may be the lack of a comprehensive regulatory regime. For example, there are no federal leases for ocean sites that are used for aquaculture operations; there are conflicting opinions on whether environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, or site-specific environmental assessments or site-specific environmental impact statements should be conducted; and there are no requirements regarding the size or other characteristics of marine aquaculture facilities. Thus, as of April 2018, the only federal offshore aquaculture facilities that have been in the ESI, have been experimental, were authorized pursuant to the 1996 OCSLA, and were terminated by the end of 2017. The most recent federal offshore aquaculture activity involves two small experiments off the coast of Charleston, SC,", "Text from U.S. House of Reps. - THOMAS\nhttp://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d115:H413:\n(a) Short Title.-This Act may be cited as the \"Excellence in\nTeaching, Learning, and School Leadership Act\".\nSec. 2.\tFEDERAL FUNCTIONS.\n(2)\tProviding technical assistance to State educational\nAgency in the awarding of grants, the implementation of State\nstandards under the provisions of this Act, and the professional\ndevelopment of teachers.\nSec. 3.\tSTATE APPLICATIONS.\n(3)\tA statement describing how the State educational\nAgency will distribute funds under the State applicatory\nprocess, which may include providing such funds to local school\ndistricts, intermediate educational districts, consortia\nconsisting of or jointly applied for by local school districts\nor intermediate educational districts, State departments of or\nregional offices of education, or other public and private non-\nprofit entities, which funds may be used to provide\nprofessional development services to teachers and local school\nSec. 4.\tLOCAL APPLICATIONS.\n(6)\tA description of the specific activities to be included\nin the proposed project, the relationship of each activity\nto the applicable components of the approved State plan, and\nthe time period for the completion of such activities.\nSec. 5.

It did so, in part, because the Framers gave Congress primary control in establishing the procedures for impeachment and trial in addition to investigating allegations of wrongdoing. Throughout early American history, a \"majority of the whole number\" of the House served as the \"grand jury\" to approve or disapprove articles for impeachment. After a successful vote to impeach, the House could refer allegations to the Senate, where they would sit as a court. During this time, the Senate developed its own rules and procedures for handling the trial, a process that tended to last several months. Some of the rules for Senate impeachment trials grew out of an extensive historical record of impeachment and conviction proceedings that spanned from 1376 until 1806. The Senate, however, could change its rules at any time. The Senate would not necessarily follow the precedents developed by the House in determining whether to impeach or convict. In fact, the Framers had no intention for the Senate's constitutionally established adjudicatory role to be a mere rubber stamp. For some time, the procedure that the House and Senate developed appeared to work. It produced few impeachments, but it provided the needed flexibility and discretion for Congress to respond to changing times and conditions. Nevertheless, from the start, the Framers worried that the impeachment process would be inconsistent because it was structured primarily as parliamentary, or \"judicial,\" procedure, but that it would be too slow and cumbersome because it was designed principally as a partisan political process. The Framers, for better or for worse, had a pragmatic approach to impeachments, believing that they would be an occasional but necessary part of American democracy. Consequently, the Constitution imposed few limitations on who could be impeached. Neither the House nor the Senate has a duty to impeach. In fact, the Constitution provides that members of Congress and federal officers and employees \u00e2\u0080\u0094including the President  \u00e2\u0080\u0094may be impeached and convicted only for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" \"Official misbehavior\" and abuse of power are actions for which impeachment proceedings may be pursued. For more than half of the nation's history, the Congress and the President (or executive agencies) have shared responsibility for the administration of the impeachment and removal process. After the start of American governance, no federal officer or employee held a higher position than the President or Vice President. Thus, the Framers gave the House final authority to impeach and the Senate final power to remove federal officials. This structure provided checks and balances to the legislative and executive powers. As the federal government's scope of responsibilities expanded over time, the role of the Senate in impeachment proceedings was questioned as the body had neither legal skills to judge charges nor administrative experience to manage proceedings. The Senate's decision to adjudicate certain charges (including ones having to do with abuse of power) without trial on the merits and without applying standards governing judicial or administrative review or fair procedure was considered to be arbitrary and capricious. In 1957, President Taft complained that \"neither [Senate] rules, nor custom, nor the nature of the offense, nor the fact that the President was a defendant in the trial, nor the fact that some of the charges were unjustified, called for a court or military type trial.\" The Senate was free to develop a more flexible mechanism for reviewing, approving, and conducting an impeachment trial that did not necessarily mimic an ordinary criminal trial. The Constitution also did not specify the standard to be applied in an impeachment trial. The Senate initially, and unsuccessfully, considered using a \"probability\" standard, a standard also employed in other parts of the Constitution until overturned by decades of interpretive judgments. The framers, and many commentators afterwards, believed that the Senate should be afforded \"a margin of discretion in applying the Constitution as its members deem best\" in proceedings that potentially implicated the nation's most important interests. Thus, some commentators argue that the Constitution does 5  not limit what standards may be applied in impeachment trials, much less suggest that the standard is \"probability\" or a \"preponderance.\" In the end, the Senate decided to base the impeachment standard principally on its own rules and policies because the Constitution was", "The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture(AoA) was intended to reduce agricultural trade distortions by allowing free trade in such products as beef, pork, corn, and other commodities, and requiring member nations to bind reductions in trade-distorting farm supports. Under the AoA, the United States and other WTO members agreed to annual spending limits for 16 kinds of subsidies paid to farmers, and on agricultural outlays in general that could include ad hoc special payments or other government actions to compensate farmers for market revenue losses incurred during the transition to free trade. The U.S. government has generally met all WTO requirements for AoA implementation. As 2019 draws to a close, the U.S. government has spent only 85-88% of its annual agricultural spending limits. Accordingly, there is no expectation that the U.S. government will be considered in \"non-compliance\" with the AoA during calendar 2019, including any 2019 adjustments to the limits. The AMS calculation is based on U.S. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) submissions to the WTO's Committee on Agriculture. Since 2006, the U.S. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has submitted documents (each called an \"Information Document\") containing detailed information on government actions that directly benefit U.S. farmers. In contrast to WTO member countries that make extensive use of market-based \"decoupled\" programs, the U.S. government has historically relied heavily on market-distorting product-specific programs to subsidize the incomes of farmers. For example, according to a 2015 USTR submission to the WTO, U.S. government's \"domestic support measures\" totaled $ 14.7 billion for calendar year 2014, while foreign support measures totaled only $ 365 million. Thus, most of the \"trade distorting\" spending in the AMS calculation came under the categories of domestic support for U.S. producers and export subsidies. On December 14, 2015, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman announced a new agreement in principle on U.S. reform of its domestic support programs as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would reduce trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and subsidy reductions, establish a new special safeguard to address import surges, and address the impacts of biotechnology on the ag trade. On May 2, 2018, President Trump announced his intent to launch an investigation of \"all available means\" to prevent the \"unfair \"diagnosed\" of the national economy that is not related to tariffs or trade deficits. The U.S. tariff rates and trade deficits have steadily declined, and the overall U.S. economy is expanding. President Trump's action is seen as the continuation of his ongoing threats to raise tariffs and impose non-tariff barriers on imports of Chinese goods, including farm commodities. The new investigation would likely lead to actions that would increase the cost of imports of certain Chinese commodity shipments into the United States, thereby causing disruption in the U.S. agricultural markets. On May 4, 2018, President Trump made a series of announcements on what he characterized as \"America's response to the unfair trade abuses committed by China.\" At issue is whether China is abiding by international market norms or using other practices that disrupt international commodity markets. Most analysts believe that the main issue is China's large and growing agricultural subsidies, rather than unfair behavior in trade or currency policy. On September 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that the USDA will begin the process of determining whether to trigger the Market Facilitation Payment (MFP) program for farmers, due to trade damage and loss of exports during 2018. On July 24, 2018, USDA issued a document entitled \"Farm Exports to China,\" reporting exports during the last 14 years that were destined for the People's Republic of China. The document reports that from 2003 to 2", "The Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Act of 1954 established a fund to support fisheries development and research.\nThe S-K fund receives its funding through a tax on imported fish/seafood. Of this tax, 30% is credited against customs duties on imported fish and seafoods and the remaining 70% is deposited into the Promote and Develop American Fisheries Products and Research Pertaining to American Fisheries account and made available to NMFS to support fisheries development and research.\nCongress passed, and the president signed into law, H.R. 666, the Maratime Conservation and Preservation Act of 2018. The legislation provides for the protection and enhancement of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems in the United States and promotes research, education, and policy changes to improve ocean and coastal conservation. H.R. 666, in part, establishes a Federal Ocean Acidification Commission to improve policies for monitoring and mitigating the negative impacts from ocean acidification.\nThe S-K fund, also referred to as the Saltonstall-Kennedy Program, has been critical to the health and productivity of U.S. fisheries. Since the act's inception, NOAA has awarded more than 10,500 grants totaling over $500 million to support the commercial fishing industry from the P&D fund. NOAA's S-K program has funded more than 220 research projects to date, and NOAA continues to pursue opportunities for commercial fishing and aquaculture through the S-K program. The 1954 act was amended in 1972 and 1975 for purposes of expanding the scope of research grants to include fisheries marketing. The amendments also allow the S-K funds to be used for education. The amendments, effective on September 29, 1972, allow the use of the funds for \"educational research or planning grants insofar as such research or planning is relevant.\" In 1975, Congress amended the act to expand eligible use of the funds to grants for the \"development of domestic fisheries and improvement of fishing methods or facilities.\" This provision would allow S-K funds to be used for activities that \"benefit commercial fishing activities, including, but not limited to, harvesting, processing, fisheries management, training, marketing, port infrastructure development, and research projects in the marine sciences related to improved fishing methods or facilities.\"\nNOAA NMFS has implemented the S-K program through regulations that appear in 50 C.F.R. section 200.42, and pursuant to a final rule issued in 2004 for the S-K program. The final rule is a result of a notice of proposed rulemaking that was published in the Federal Register on March 9, 2004 and resulted from comments received during the proposal process as well as comments received in response to the final rule. Following the comment process, NMFS made several changes to the notice, including changes based upon public comments and additional clarifications.", "162 International Family Planning Perspectives that the population bomb of the 1960s and 1970s was not so much the ineluctable consequence of demographic trends as the \"population pressure bomb\"-that is, the overwhelming social pressures and shortages of basic commodities and services caused by rapid population growth. International advocates of family planning programs emphasize their capacity to break the cycle that leads to food insecurity. In some countries, improved family planning programs, though they may only indirectly reduce a country's fertility rate, improve the availability of food and other development resources for children in the family (particularly girls), which can lead ultimately to reductions in hunger, illiteracy, and disease. The evidence of the positive impact of family planning programs is strong. A 2007 World Bank study estimated that reducing barriers and increasing access to voluntary family planning services could provide about 40% of the emission reductions needed to meet international climate-change targets. Family planning programs are also critical to broader U.S. foreign policy goals in a range of diverse areas, such as reducing gender inequalities, improving women's status, improving gender equality to promote women's empowerment, and fostering the rule of law, among others.1 While they are considered a critical factor for women's empowerment, family planning programs can also lead to population increases if a country's total fertility rate (TFR) rises, as shown in countries like Tanzania, Vietnam, Colombia, and Kenya. Family planning programs may also have unanticipated negative impacts as they can contribute to population declines and alter the sex ratio of a region or state through selective abortion -the practice of using prenatal genetic testing to identify and selectively abort female fetuses for the purposes of population control in China. A lack of access to modern contraceptives can also result in the use of more hazardous options, as was the case in 2002 when a tainted sterilization program was carried out in China resulting in the deaths of nine women.(see Table 1).", "This report outlines the Trump Administration's FY2020 funding plans for border barrier funds via reprogrammed or redirected military construction funds. From February 15 to March 26, 2019, the Administration initiated a number of budgetary actions that included redirecting unobligated Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) funds and military construction and repair appropriations available for repurposing under the annual defense authorization bill. The reprogrammed funds were intended to finance at least 60 new miles of b order security factsheet project along the southern border, which it did not estimate as complete by September 30, 2020 \u2013 the end of FY2020. By the time H.J.Res. 77 was introduced on March 12, 2019, the Administration's border barrier proclamation and budget release had come under criticism for violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act and the separation of power principle of checks and balances. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the same day, announced the issuance of waivers exempting the construction of border barrier projects from their own environmental reviews. In March 2019, Congress advanced legislation to prohibit the Administration's use of unobligated military construction, working capital, and army civil works funds for the declared emergency at the southern border to construct additional barrier infrastructure. Under House-Senate conference for H.J.Res. 46, the Border Security Funding Act, the Administration's March 25, 2019 reprogramming action was reversed, and a statutory authority was created to direct the Administration to use its own FY2019 military construction appropriations to pay for border barrier projects. Additionally, H.R. 2500 (P.L. 116-74; as Division K, Titles I-IV) in the Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act, 2020 authorized DOD to use military construction funds to build specified border barriers. On September 24, 2019, the President issued a veto message to congressional Leadership on a bill passed on September 22, 2019 to terminate the national declaration of emergency at the southern border. According to the President's message, the declaration itself did not involve a national emergency or any new budgetary funding for border barrier projects. Pending additional Congressional action, Congress will not act to disapprove H.J.Res.54 veto the President's veto message with passage of S.J.Res.56, the Disapproval and Overriding of Veto of Joint Resolution Disapproving of the Attempt to Proclaim a National Emergency without Congress's Approval. On March 26, 2019, Congress passed S.J.Res. 8, which would terminate the national emergency declared at the southern border, under a \"resolution of disapproval\" and \"overriding resolution\" established in 1973. Congress passed the joint resolution on March 14, 2019, for consideration upon the President's veto message, which was required as a consequence of Congress's action under the same 1973 provision.", "Domestic Violence Victim Care Providers: Military and VA Response for the DOD Health Care Program Research Summary Series\nDomestic Violence Victim Care Providers: Military and VA Response for the DOD Health Care Program\nMatt McCoy is a research associate with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness/DOD Behavioral Health Systems Office (OUSD/OUSD P&R/BHSO) and can be reached at (615) 653-3971 or matthew.coy@mail.mil.

Rather, the foundations of Senate procedure also include the body's standing orders, published precedents, rule-making statutes, constitutional mandates, committee rules, party conference rules, and informal practices. Various reference sources provide information about how and when these procedural authorities of the Senate govern specific parliamentary situations, and together, they establish the framework by which the Senate conducts its business. This report discusses the contents, format, and availability of reference sources that provide information about contemporary procedures in the Senate. The report covers official documents that set forth the Senate rules, precedents, or other sources of parliamentary authority, such as the Senate Manual, Riddick's Senate Procedure, and the rules adopted by Senate committees. The report also discusses publications on procedure from committees and other offices of the Senate, and rules of the Senate's party conferences. Prior to describing the individual parliamentary reference sources, this report reviews some principles of Senate parliamentary procedure that are applicable when using and evaluating information from these sources. The report then covers the Senate's official parliamentary reference sources. These are documents that set forth authoritative statements of Senate rules, procedures, and precedents. Senators and congressional staff often cite these official sources when raising a point of order.  An overview of the two primary websites through which many of the resources included in this report can be accessed is provided in the appendix.\" For more information on this, see CRS Report 98-916, Senate Filibuster Rule and Related Procedures. See, also, CRS Report 95-609, Senate Procedures and Practices in the 104th Congress, and CRS Report 98-298, Unanimous Consent Agreements in the Senate: Uses and Abuses. 2 Second, the Senate can enforce its rules. If a Senator is alleged to have violated a Senate rule, the Presiding Officer (usually this is the Vice President, in his capacity as the President of the Senate) is required to interpret and apply the rule as set forth in Senate practice, precedents, rules of practice, law, and other reliable guides. When the case arises while the Senate is in session, the Presiding Officer may decide that a Senator has committed a violation of the rule and declare a point of order. Senate rules also provide for a variety of parliamentary motions to take action on a Senate resolution, bill, or amendment as if a point of order has been raised and decided against it. These motions allow the Senate or one of its committees or subcommittees to override a ruling that a Senator has violated a Senate rule. These parliamentary motions are designed to permit the Senate to maintain the integrity of its rules and to regulate its own proceedings. Precedents that allow the Senate to take action despite the Vice President's ruling that a rule has been violated constitute a long-standing constitutional rule in the Senate. This procedural remedy has been used occasionally and it has long been recognized as an appropriate exception to the constitutional mandate that the Vice President be the sole arbiter of Senate procedure. For more information, see CRS Report 98-283, Enforcement of the Rules and the Principle of Senate Courtesy: Raising a Question of Order, CRS Report 97-51, Senatorial Courtesy and Executive-Referred Nominations, CRS Report 96-546, Presidential Appointments and Reappointments During a Recess or Adjournment of the Senate, CRS Report RL31811, Senate Procedure: A Handbook of the Rules of the Senate and Precedents.

The country confronts significant domestic challenges. Democratic institutions are fragile, current economic growth rates and social policies are insufficient to reduce widespread poverty, and the country continues to experience some of the highest violent crime rates in the world. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which provides many development loans to the region, reports that Honduras has the highest poverty rate and second-worst human development index in Central America, behind only Haiti. Although the IDB cites the Honduran government as one of six governments in the region whose economic and social performance \u201chas improved significantly compared to the previous decade,\u201d the report notes that \u201cthe trend observed in the region\u201d in recent years is that \u201cmacroeconomic stability, while significant, is still insufficient to generate a robust increase in growth and job creation.\u201d Honduras has become the route of choice for U.S.-bound migrants from Central America because of the existence of a robust northern network that aids and guides migrants across hundreds of miles of territory through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras en route to Mexico. The number of illegal immigrants apprehended and returned along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased by 25% during the last fiscal year, from the previous year\u2019s 396,579 in 2018 to 297,410 in 2019. The apprehension of unauthorized immigrants from Honduras fell most precipitously during the same period, from 161,729 in fiscal year 2018 (the highest in U.S. history) to 140,624 (see Figure 1). Honduras is a U.S. security and economic partner. According to a 2013 Organization of American States (OAS) report, the United States is Honduras\u2019 fourth largest trading partner and the country\u2019s largest export market. Honduras is among the world\u2019s top five coffee producers and the top Central American exporter of tropical fruits. It imports a disproportionate amount of manufactured goods from the United States. Honduras shares significant U.S. security partnerships with the country in the Northern Triangle (defined by the three countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras)\u2014collectively referred to as Central America under the 1990s Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)\u2014because of common membership in the Central American Integration System (Sistema de la Integraci\u00f3n Centrae Americana, SICA). The region shares borders with Mexico, which is not part of CAFTA, but is the source of much of its illegal immigrant populations. Honduras has become home to more than 50 known U.S. diplomatic presence or military installations, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The Honduran police force (Polic\u00eda Nacional de Honduras, PNH) and U.S.-trained units within it are the lead institutions of security in most of the country, but the number of U.S.-advised units remains in the single digits. Migration. Despite the recent drops in apprehensions, unauthorized immigration from Honduras is likely to remain high in the short and medium terms because of its role as a staging area for asylum seekers, as well as economic and political instability. The country suffers from one of the world\u2019s highest homicide rates. The murder rate in Honduras has fallen from its 2015 peak of 86.5 per 100,000 to 26.2 in 2019, according to the Economist\u2019s Intelligence Unit, but its rate has remained higher than neighboring El Salvador for the past decade and is one of the highest in the world. The 2019 per capita income was $7,689, up from $6,960 in 2018 according to the CIA\u2019s World Factbook . As a result, the flow from Honduras has historically been a mainstay of the U.S. apprehension figures for unauthorized immigrants. The number of unaccompanied minors from Honduras entering the United States from 2011 through 2015 has fallen from a high of nearly 61,000 in 2014 to", "The K-12 teacher workforce is relatively large\u00e2\u0080\u0094each year, nearly 4 million teachers are employed in U.S. elementary and secondary schools. Turnover in these schools is high relative to earlier periods\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 1 in 10 teachers left his or her job in 2018. This figure follows federal statistical trends that show a steady growth in teacher attrition since the 1980s. The problem of teacher turnover raises a number of recruitment and retention issues of interest to policymakers. The Higher Education Act (HEA) is the main federal law containing policies designed to address these issues. Title II of the HEA authorizes grant support for schools that prepare new teachers. Title IV of the HEA authorizes financial support to encourage people to stay in the teaching profession in the form of loan forgiveness and other benefits. The HEA was last comprehensively amended in 2008 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA, P.L. 110-315). Although the authorities have expired, the associated programs continue to receive appropriations. Congressional consideration of potentially reauthorizing the HEA is ongoing, with the introduction of numerous bills to amend the current law. This report describes (1) the history of federal policy in this area, (2) current policies in this area, and (3) related issues that may arise as Congress considers reauthorizing the HEA. Teacher recruitment and retention have been the focus of federal policy since the HEA was first enacted in 1965. This section briefly describes the history of federal policy in this area. The HEA was originally enacted under P.L. 90-35 by the Omnibus Education Act of 1964 ( P.L. 88-240 ) and signed into law on November 8, 1965. Title V authorized the Teacher Corps program and authorized a number of teacher training programs. These programs were initially funded for FY1969. The Program for the Training of Teachers of the Handicapped program authorized and funded special projects for teachers of the handicapped. The Title VII, Part A program was first funded for FY1973 and directed funding toward elementary and secondary education (ESE) programs and services (e.g., counseling and guidance, language instruction, academic enrichment). Title VIII authorized the National Teacher Corps and National Teacher Academy programs. Title X authorized the Drug Education and Promotion program. This program was first funded for FY1974 and directed school-based drug education and prevention, and research on drug abuse and use. Title X was reauthorized under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-570 ) and signed into law on October 28, 1986. Title XII authorized the Adult Education Program and was first funded for FY1975. Title X also authorized a special projects in education program. Title XIII authorized the Education for the Handicapped program and its predecessor (the Comprehensive Program for the Handicapped), and was last funded for FY1975. Title XI authorized special projects in science education. These programs were repealed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act under Title VI, Part A of the Education Amendments of 1978 ( P.L. 95-561 ) and signed into law on November 1, 1978. It was first funded for FY1978. In 1976, the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship program was authorized under Title III, Part G of the Comprehensive Child Development Act ( P.L. 93-318 ). The program provided financial aid (i.e., annual scholarships of $5,000) over 4 consecutive years to highly qualified, full time K-12 teachers. The program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formula-plus block-grant funding made an average of 2,500 awards annually. Initially funded for FY1978, Title G was last funded for FY1990.

Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are the two principal federal agencies that own and operate water resources facilities. Reclamation is the country's largest wholesaler of water and the country's second-largest producer of hydropower (behind USACE). In addition to water supplies, Reclamation facilities provide flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits in many parts of the West. Congress has authorized more than 180 individual R eclamation projects . The goal of these projects was generally to \"reclaim\" arid western lands for irrigated agriculture and other types of development. Reclamation projects are unique in a number of ways. Among other things, these projects operate according to a beneficiary pays principle in which project beneficiaries must reimburse the government for their allocated share of project costs (some costs are considered federal in their nature, therefore no reimbursement is required). Most Reclamation projects also must obtain state water rights and operate in accordance with state law. Reclamation has evolved over time, and it remains an agency in transition. Its earliest projects were single-purpose irrigation projects; later projects were more complex and served multiple authorized purposes. The primary purpose of most of these projects is not reclaiming land for agricultural purposes. How to balance these priorities with the upkeep of existing Reclamation projects, and whether to facilitate new project development (and, if so, how), has been of interest to Congress. This report provides background on the Bureau of Reclamation, including its history and evolution as a federal agency. The legislative history of the Bureau of Reclamation dates to the mid-19 th century enactments of the Homestead Act (1862) and the Desert Land Act (1877). In the Homestead Act, Congress allowed settlers in western states and territories to receive up to 160 acres of land free if they lived on the land for five years and made improvements to it. In an effort to further encourage settlement, Congress passed the Carey Act of 1894, which put official responsibility for overseeing irrigation projects on the states and territories. However, many of these efforts failed due to lack of funds, inadequate engineering skill, or other factors. Thus, supporters of irrigated agriculture in the West turned to the federal government for financing and technical support. In the Reclamation Act, Congress for the first time approved federal efforts to irrigate arid land. The government began construction of facilities to support water storage and diversion; this, in turn, created a need for large-scale electric power development in the West. For decades, Reclamation and the U.S. Bureau of Power (BOP, one of the predecessors of the DOI) jointly planned and constructed power facilities to meet this growing need. These facilities continue to serve multiple purposes today, including flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. Because Congress intended Reclamation to serve multiple authorized purposes, this report generally refers to the facilities as multiple-purpose (as opposed to a singular focus on irrigation). For more detailed information on Reclamation, particularly on its history, see CRS Report RS22641, Water for the West: Issues and Challenges in the Central and Upper Colorado River Basins (September 23, 2013); CRS Report R43663, The Central Arizona Project: Background and Key Issues (August 11, 2014); CRS Report R43631, Western Water and Power: Background and Issues (October 16, 2014).\n\nThe Reclamation is also referred to as the Bureau of reclamation. Whenever you're reading about Reclamation, you should assume that they are basically the same thing.  If you see just Bureau of reclamation or BOR (Bureau of reclamation) then you can assume that it's also the same as Reclamation or Reclamation Service.\n\n## History\n\n### Early history\n\nIn 1902, Congress enacted the Newlands Reclamation Act.  This legislation was designed to reclaim the lands of the arid West.  Before this act was passed, it had been", "The SBA's WOSB Federal Contracting Program is one of several contracting\nprograms Congress has approved to help assure small businesses, including WOSBs, have a fair\nopportunity to compete for and perform on government contracts. Since 1994, the WOSB Federal\nContracting Program has been providing WOSBs with greater opportunities in federal contracting\nby establishing a WOSB Program Registry. However, the SBA has not required agencies to include\ninformation about the products and services generally available in the commercial market (e.g.,\noffice supplies) that an agency may acquire under a commercial contract.\nAs of June 2010, there have been at least 101 contract awards to WOSBs (67 awards were made\nto 34 certified WOSBs) under the WOSB Federal Contracting Program, but only two WOSB\ncontract awards were made by the Department of Transportation. Thus, as of  June 2010, WOSBs\nhad not been awarded at least 48 of the 101 awards potentially available to them.\nThe SBA has not provided agencies with clear, detailed guidance about the requirement to make\navailable to WOSBs any type of commercial contract regardless of the dollar value of the\ncontract. For example, the SBA did not:\n--  update its guide to agency contracting officials on how to implement WOSB contracting\npreferences;\n--  provide agency contracting offices and contracting officers with specific guidance on\nhow an agency's requirements for the commercial market could be defined in the\nprocurement solicitation; and\n--  instruct agency contracting offices and contracting officers to consider the potential of\nawarding a WOSB subcontracting award to fulfill the contracting officer's\nrequirements for a commercial market contract.\nConsequently, we recommended that the Administrator of the SBA provide specific, detailed\nguidance to agencies and contracting officers about how the acquisition of products and\nservices generally available in the commercial market could be done through the WOSB\nFederal Contracting Program. SBA agreed with our second recommendation but did not agree\nwith our other two recommendations. However, SBA has implemented our first and third\nrecommendations and disagreed with our fourth recommendation to add procedures to follow up\nwith and support WOSB contractors as they perform their contracts.\nDOT officials indicated that the department will take appropriate steps to comply with our\nrecommendation and implement a plan to provide the SBA with additional data on WOSB usage.\nAdditionally,  to help provide additional data on WOSB usage and to\nimprove WOSB contracting, the SBA has agreed to continue collecting this data in future years.\nThrough its data collection efforts, the SBA will provide us information to help us assess the\nprogress made to improve contracting with WOSBs and provide information to assist the\nlegislative branch in making decisions about the potential need for making changes to the\nWOSB Federal Contracting Program.\nFinancial Relationships and Sources of Information:\nOur files contain the names of individuals who provided information for this report. However, as a\nmatter of policy, we do not publically release the names of those individuals in the final report.\nIf you have any questions about this report or would like additional information on another\nsubject of OIG interest, please contact me or Steve Vladeck, Assistant Inspector General for\nCareer Information: The Office of Inspector General offers excellent career development\nopportunities.

According to the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), nearly 43 million borrowers owe money on federal student loans as of the second quarter of 2019, and the total amount of outstanding federal student loan debt now exceeds $1.4 trillion\u00e2\u0080\u0094a figure that has nearly tripled since 2007. In recent years, a significant number of these borrowers have experienced difficulty repaying their student loans. Moreover, borrowers who lack financial experience may need guidance to navigate the student loan repayment process, which some borrowers have found hard to understand or confusing. Student loan servicers\u00e2\u0080\u0094with whom the federal government has contracted to assist with the administration of its large student loan portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u0094are a key source of guidance and assistance for borrowers struggling to understand and repay their federal student loans. Many maintain that at least some of these federal student loan servicers have engaged in various forms of undesirable conduct, such as steering borrowers away from beneficial repayment options or providing inaccurate or incomplete information. Representatives from the servicing industry have denied these allegations. These allegations of servicer misconduct have drawn the attention of both federal and state policymakers. At least two state legislatures have enacted new laws to regulate servicers of federal student loans. One state court has also agreed with some borrowers to enforce state laws against student loan servicers that violate state statutory or common law. Some federal policymakers and courts have concluded that federal law preempts the states from creating or enforcing state servicing laws of their own. This report analyzes the regulation of federal student loan servicers and related legal issues. After providing necessary background information, the report describes federal law governing student loan servicers. The report then addresses issues related to federal student loan servicing laws preempting state servicing laws of their own. The report concludes by identifying relevant legal issues for Congress. 6 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 195v, 195w(b), 195v(e)(3) (ECASLA). For additional background, see CRS Report R45836, The Education Department's Oversight of Federal Student Loans in Light of the Recent Pending Merger of SLM Corporation and Sallie Mae, Inc, by Robert Moffatt. The terms of most loans made under federal student loan programs are set forth in statute or in the regulations that interpret those statutes. With respect to the main (nondirect) federal student loan programs, loans issued pursuant to \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 428(b) and 455 of the HEA (as amended by ESSA) generally must be (subject to exception) for college attendance and must carry the interest rate (and special benefits, such as deferral or cancellation of repayment) determined by ED. In general, the loans available include the Federal Perkins Loan, Direct Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, and Federal Consolidation Loan. See Department of Education, Federal Student Aid's Fiscal Year 2019 Budget, Table 97. With regard to the FFEL and direct loan programs, Congress in ECASLA provided that the FFEL Program would be closed to new loan volume as of July 1, 2010, and discontinued by June 30, 2010, except for loans to borrowers who had received a grant notice on or before March 23, 2010 but had not received a loan under such notice by August 1, 2009. See 20 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1088-31(b) (as amended by ESSA). The Direct Loan Program was the successor to this program. See 20 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1087e(a), 1095e(a), 1088-31(b) (as amended by ESSA). Additionally, ECASLA closed the FFEL program to issuance of new student loans after July 1, 2010, but established a \"bridge program\" that permitted borrowers who are receiving disbursements of federal student loans under certain FFEL programs as of July 1, 2010, to receive FF", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the third largest agency in the federal government in terms of personnel. The appropriations bill that funds it\u2014providing $70 billion in FY2020\u2014is the seventh largest of the 12 annual funding measures developed by the appropriations committees, and is the only appropriations bill that funds a single agency in its entirety and nothing else. This report provides an overview of the FY2021 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security. The report provides a component-level overview of the appropriations sought in the FY2021 budget request, putting the requested appropriations in the context of the FY2020 requested and enacted level of appropriations, and noting some of the larger changes in this proposal from those baselines. The budget for DHS includes a variety of discretionary and mandatory budget authority. Aside from standard discretionary spending, some of the discretionary spending in the bill is offset by collections of fees, reducing the net effect of discretionary budget authority on the general fund of the Treasury. However, some mandatory spending items still require an appropriation because they are supported solely by fee collections, do not have dedicated sources of funding, or do not meet the 1% of the Budget test under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. It is possible for congressional appropriators to reduce mandatory funding, with the result often being a reduction in appropriated discretionary spending. Figure 2 compares the structure of the FY2021 budget request to its enacted FY2020 equivalent, as well as the FY2020 request. Significant differences include 1) an $800 million reduction in U.S. Coast Guard Acquisitions, Construction (O&AM-ACQ) funding; 2) a $300 million increase in USCG Operating Expenses (O&AM-OPS) funding; 3) a $300 million increase in the DHS Science and Technology budget; 4) a $300 million increase in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) funding; 5) a $660 million increase in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP's) funding; 6) an $800 million reduction in U.S. Secret Service's (USSS) Operating Expenses funding; 7) a $1.5 billion reduction in U.S. Secret Service's (USSS) funding; 8) a $300 million increase in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Budget Processing funding for the development of FY2021 budget justifications; 9) $550 million in additional funding for border wall construction, and $7.1 billion less in funding for the other sources of border barrier construction (together, border wall construction is $7.6 billion greater than the request from enacted levels); 10) a $500 million increase in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief program; 11) a $200 million decrease in the Federal Protective Service's (FPS) CBP-FPS funding; 12) a $500 million increase in funding for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its E-Verify program compared to FY2020 levels; and, 13) a $50 million increase in funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETCs) fund for training and exercise programs operated by the FLETCs. The disaster relief increases described above are in response to Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Florence, and wildfires in California. Overall, FY2021 total DHS requested discretionary budget authority declines by $13.3 billion compared to FY2020 enacted levels, and increases by $10.9 billion compared to FY2020 requested levels, with one component (CBP-FPS) decreasing, and all others increasing. The FY2021 budget request also increases total discretionary budget authority compared to FY2020 enacted levels by $3.2 billion, and compared to FY2020 requested levels by $", "The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is a 1961 water-sharing treaty between the United States and Canada that established the amount of water each side receives from the Columbia River System. The CRT authorizes development of a system of dams and reservoirs in Canada, which store the excess water and release it when needed by both sides. The treaty is set to expire in 2024. The U.S. Government has recommended that it be renewed with modified stipulations. This report discusses congressional activities related to the CRT.", "Since the end of the Second World War, successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have supported a close U.S. partnership with Europe. Often termed the transatlantic relationship, this partnership encompasses the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), of which the United States is a founding member, and extensive political and economic ties with the European Union (EU) and most countries in Western and Central Europe. The United States has been instrumental in building and leading the transatlantic relationship, viewing it as a key pillar of U.S. national security and economic policy. The United States spearheaded the formation of NATO in 1949 to foster transatlantic security and collective defense in Europe. Since the early5 1 Figure 1.

Moreover, NATO and EU officials perceive that some Administration actions and pronouncements appear to threaten the transatlantic relationship. They cite President Trump's seeming unwillingness to express strong support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the European Union (EU) or other multilateral or international institutions. Europeans also note that President Trump appears reluctant to consult closely with U.S. allies on foreign policy and national security issues. The United States and Europe have cooperated in establishing and sustaining an open, rules-based international trading system, which has facilitated global economic growth and prosperity. Many Members of Congress have a keen interest in monitoring the Administration's trade policies toward the European Union (EU) and other U.S. trading partners because the trade issues at core are intertwined with their core constitutional responsibilities as they determine U.S. trade policy. European and American businesses and farmers have benefited from the current system and generally support further opening of global markets. Conversely, some analysts warn that protectionist U.S. trade policies could lead to a less stable global trading system and economic stagnation. Other global competitors such as China, Russia, and India have voiced similar warnings and support for global multilateral trading rules. Many trade policy experts view current U.S. trade negotiations with respect to both the European Union (EU) and China as potentially signaling and reinforcing the United States' reliance on protectionist policies and the further unraveling of the WTO rules-based international trading system. Several Members of Congress oppose current negotiations with the EU and seek Congressional oversight and approval of any final agreements. The Administration has argued that trade negotiations with the EU need not follow the longstanding procedures contained in United States trade law because the EU is not a formal trade negotiating partner. Many believe that the EU should be treated as an official negotiation partner, with its member states recognized as its formal negotiating partners. 1.5 billion people. The most advanced economy in the world, the EU's combined nominal gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014based on purchasing power parity (PPP)\u2014is more than $18.6 trillion and exceeds that of the United States and Japan combined. The EU also is the world's second-largest donor of official development assistance (ODA), spending approximately $70 billion in 2016, of which 20% was for climate change, resource efficiency, and green economy projects.14 European officials and analysts generally view the United States as a friend and major security ally, even though some in Europe feel that the Trump Administration does not sufficiently reaffirm this point or recognize the United States' debt to the EU as a security guarantor. By contrast, Russia, Iran, and North Korea appear to pose a growing menace to European security, although EU officials generally oppose the Trump Administration's stated desire for the United States to withdraw from the JCPOA with Iran and to cease adherence to the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation.152 Congress and European officials also remain concerned about the United States' close defense cooperation with Turkey, a NATO member with one of the largest NAT", "21 authorized for siting in the Reserve. Of these works, 18 (90%) are located in Area I, and 1 (5%). The remaining 16 works\u2014including two that are inactive\u2014have been authorized for placement in Area II. Under the CWA, three areas of the District of Columbia and its environs are specifically exempt from future memorial placement: (1) the United States Capitol Grounds; (2) the Washington Monument Grounds; and (3) the Residential and institutional area defined in the District of Columbia Zoning Commission's regulation, \"Comprehensive Zoning Regulations of the District of Columbia. \" A fourth exemption, the Arlington National Cemetery, has been recognized by federal judges in three separate cases. As required by law, the works listed in this report are categorized in three categories: (1) works with lapsed authorizations, i.e., those that are no longer authorized for placement in the District of Columbia or one of its environs; (2) in-progress works, i.e., those works where the sponsors have acquired sufficient funds to proceed with the memorial, but the projects have not been enshrined or are not under construction; and (3) in-limbo works, i.e., those where sufficient private funds have yet to be acquired to begin construction. (For more on these categories, see appendix.) 13 Works Authorized since 1986 That Remain Inactive and Without a Legislative Mandate The CWA is silent regarding lapsed authorizations. As a result, commemorative works authorized since 1986 and pending authorizations from prior to 1986 have been subjected to a legislative review initiated on December 1 , 2013. 24 This process\u2014overseen by the House Administration Committee (HAC) 25 has resulted in the re-authorization of works within a three-year period. In addition, works eligible for re-authorization are being re-authorized, either indefinitely or for a period of 10 years, for a period of time and to the end of the 115th Congress (January 3 , 2019). The authorizing acts include: (1) the provision permitting the re-authorization of works in the following classes of memorials: (a) individuals who perished in the performance of military, public safety, or humanitarian service; (b) the contributions and sacrifices of veterans, military, and other personnel who were held as prisoners of war or missing in action; (c) recipients of the Medal of Honor or the Congressional Medal of Honor; (d) deceased national leaders; and (e) individuals, groups, or entities recognized by the President; and (2) the reauthorization of the 1986 commemorative works that were authorized within the first act of the 115th Congress (H.R.355) to remove the CWA of lapse. 22 23 24 25 A federal statute which authorizes a memorial to be erected or to be maintained, if privately funded, in, or on any public area in the District of Columbia by the federal government. 22 See this CRS report for more. 23 See a 2-page memo on HAC's actions since the December 12, 2013 announcement. 24 Section 907 amends the CWA to include the provision relating to the re-authorization of the currently authorized works. Among other provisions, section 907 includes a reauthorization provision for the four classes of memorials noted above, and allows for the reauthorization of works that were authorized before the CWA was established in 1986. Reauthorizations approved for the current Congress (and the CWA) are shown in Table 1. 23 The authorizing acts also include extensions of works authorized after January 1 , 2019, but the provisions in those acts also authorize reauthorization without time limits. 26 11 The re-authorization of those works that HAC re-authorized is shown in Table 2. Those works eligible for reauthorization and already reauthorized (some indefinitely) are shown in Table 3. 12 Works In the \"In-Progress\" Category This report lists as \"in-progress\" any works for which a design has been completed at some point since Congressional approval, but for which the actual construction has yet to", "S ince the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA's) creation in 1953, the SBA Disaster Loan Program has provided low-interest disaster loans to businesses to help them repair, rebuild, and recover from federally declared disasters. SBA business disaster loans fall into two categories: (1) Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), and (2) business physical disaster loans. EIDLs provide up to $2 million for working capital to help small businesses meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster not occurred. Loan amounts for EIDLs are based on actual economic injury and financial needs, regardless of whether the business suffered any property damage. Business physical disaster loans provide up to $2 million to businesses of all sizes for repair or replacement of damaged physical property, including machinery, equipment, fixtures, inventory, and leasehold improvements that are not covered by insurance. In addition to repairing and replacing damaged physical property, a portion of the loans can also be applied toward mitigation measures, including grading or contouring land, installing sewer backflow valves, relocating or elevating utilities or mechanical equipment, and building safe rooms or similar structures designed to protect occupants from natural disasters. The limits on post-disaster mitigation loans are the lesser of either the measure's estimated cost or 20% of the verifiable loss. Mitigation also reduces post-disaster claim payments. For example, from FY2014 to FY2018 $9.7 billion was spent on post-disaster reconstruction and $10.5 billion on post-disaster insurance claims (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1.

These include informing Congress, providing expert advice on complex or controversial issues, and generating policy recommendations. To aid Congress, commissions are generally authorized to hold hearings, conduct research, analyze data, and/or make field visits as they carry out their duties. Most complete their work by delivering their findings, recommendations, or advice in the form of a written report to Congress. For example, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission) was charged \"to examine and report upon the facts and causes relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the issues that arose in their aftermath, including (1) any institutional failures or individual misconduct on the part of the U.S. government, whether before, on, or after September 11, 2001, (2) the adequacy of the communication within the government on terrorist threats between federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and the private sector, (3) the adequacy of Federal laws, policies, and capabilities for detecting, preventing, and responding to terrorist attacks within the United States\" and (4) recommendations to correct \"any deficiencies in the prevention of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from terrorist attacks within the United States\". The Commission ultimately submitted a final report to Congress and the President containing its findings and conclusions, along with 48 policy recommendations. Commissions also may be established to help commemorate an individual, group, or event. Commissions generally require funding to help meet their statutory goals. When designing a commission, therefore, policymakers may wish to consider both how the commission will be funded, as well as how much funding the commission will be authorized to receive. How commissions are funded and the amounts that they receive vary considerably. Several factors can contribute to overall commission costs. These factors might include hiring staff, contracting with outside consultants, and engaging administrative support, among others. Additionally, most commissions reimburse the travel expenditures of commissioners and staff, and some compensate their members. The duration of a commission can also significantly affect its cost; past congressional commissions have been designed to last anywhere from several months to several years. This definition differentiates a congressional commission from a presidential commission, an executive branch commission, or other bodies with \"commission\" in their names, while including most entities that fulfill the role commonly associated with commissions: studying policy problems or organizing commemorative activities, and reporting findings to Congress. This approach identifies 153 congressional commissions established by statute between 1989 and 2018. For each congressional commission identified, CRS analyzed the commission's statute to assess whether the law authorized the appropriation of funds. This analysis captured only the funding method provided in the commission's original legislation. Any subsequent changes to how a commission is funded--including whether such changes were by the authorizing statute or by subsequent legislation--are not reflected in this report. This report is organized as follows: This section presents the summary of congressional commissions, including funding and duration information. Section 2 describes the 153 commissions identified in this report, including their funding, duration, date of authorization, and whether they operated in fiscal year 2019. Section 3 presents a summary of federal funds appropriated specifically for the operations and activities of 190 commissions identified in this report, including expenditures by fiscal year. Finally, Section 4 discusses issues for Congress when considering whether to establish congressional commissions. These issues include (1) what purposes a commission might serve, (2) how commissions are funded and by whom, and (3) whether and on which commissions should compensate members or staff. 17  Tables and figures follow. Appendixes I, II, III, IV, and V contain tables showing each commission's public law number, enabling legislation reference, date of enactment, and funding information. Appendixes II, III, IV, and V list in tabular format the congressional commissions identified in this report. Appendixes VI, VII, VIII, and IX contain figures showing total funding for each commission identified in this report. Each appendix is organized by authorizing date.\n4 CRS-2 Table 1. Summary (Page 1 of 7) 70 commissions funded, 40 commissions funded in", "The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), part of the Department of the Interior (DOI), operates the multipurpose federal Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of the world's largest water storage and conveyance systems. The CVP runs approximately 400 miles in California, from Redding to Bakersfield ( Figure 1 ). It supplies water to hundreds of thousands of acres of irrigated agriculture throughout the state, including some of the most valuable cropland in the country. It also provides water to selected state and federal wildlife refuges, as well as to some municipal and industrial (M&I) water users. This report provides information on hydrologic conditions in California and their impact on state and federal water management, with a focus on deliveries related to the federal CVP. It also summarizes selected issues for Congress related to the CVP. The drought of 2012-2016, widely considered to be among California's most severe droughts in recent history, resulted in major reductions to CVP contractor allocations and economic and environmental impacts throughout the state. These impacts were of interest to Congress, which oversees federal operation of the CVP. Although the drought ended with the wet winter of 2017, many of the water supply controversies associated with the CVP predated those water shortages and remain unresolved. Absent major changes to existing hydrologic, legislative, and regulatory baselines, most agree that at least some water users are likely to face ongoing constraints to their water supplies. Due to the limited water supplies available, proposed changes to the current operations and allocation system are controversial. In addition to operational provisions, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation [WIIN] Act authorized funding for construction of new federal and nonfederal water storage projects. Several state and federal proposals are also currently under consideration and have generated considerable controversy and debate for their potential to significantly alter CVP operations. In mid-2018, the State of California proposed revisions to its Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan. These changes would require that more flows from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers reach the California Bay-Delta for water quality and fish and wildlife enhancement (and would thus further restrict water supplies for other users). The Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992 required that the CVP's contractor supply and exchange program (Contractors Excess Water) be implemented by October 1994. This provision, however, was never implemented following a lawsuit over environmental concerns regarding the transfer of surface water. The National Water Exchange (NWX) Program offers contractors another avenue to transfer water via groundwater banking operations. This program may provide a way for water suppliers in areas with drought conditions to obtain additional supplies from outside of their own service areas. Although there have been some recent increases in the quantity of water transferred via the CVP's Contractors Excess Water and the groundwater banking operations via the NWX Program, these remain minor in comparison to the amounts transferred during drought years and the volumes that were intended to be allowed under current federal operations and allocation requirements. The legislation authored or sponsored by California Members of Congress provides some insight into the nature of the concerns raised at the federal level. Proposals to address potential shortages include increased storage, groundwater banking operations, and additional conveyance capacity; other measures such as desalination and conservation have sometimes been proposed for specific areas or users.\n  Figure 1.

TEXT: O ne of the basic rationales underlying the grant of patent rights is that such rights provide an incentive for inventors to innovate. Part of the bargain, however, is that those rights will expire after a defined time period. This principle appears in the U.S. Constitution, which empowers Congress \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" Congress has also enacted this principle into law: a patent on a new invention will generally expire twenty years after the corresponding patent application was filed. Intellectual property (IP) rights, including patent rights, are generally considered to play an essential role in encouraging the research and development (R&D) necessary to create new pharmaceutical products. Because these periods of exclusivity can allow the patent holder, such as a drug manufacturer, to charge higher-than-competitive prices, the patent holder has an incentive to prolong the period of exclusivity, such as by filing for additional patents to cover a product. In the pharmaceutical context, critics argue that some brand-name drug and biological product manufacturers (the brands) use patenting strategies to \"game[ ] the patent system\" to maximize profits and forestall competition from generic drug or biosimilar manufacturers (the generics). Others reject this charge, contending that these patenting practices are a legitimate use of the patent system and are necessary to incentivize the billions of dollars in R&D that lead to new, life-saving drugs. This report discusses four pharmaceutical patenting practices commentators have criticized: \"Evergreening\" : Commentators allege that some pharmaceutical companies obtain new patents to cover a product as older patents expire to extend the period of exclusivity without significant benefits for consumers. Critics characterize such \"evergreening\" patents of dubious efficacy as anticompetitive because they may delay the entry of cheaper generics into the market, thereby allowing the brand to maintain its exclusivity period on a patent that otherwise may have been invalidated, to the benefit of the settling companies but at the expense of consumers. This report explains these allegedly anticompetitive patenting practices and reviews a number", "This report summarizes the health care provisions in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 (FFCRA), as amended and enacted into law. The health provisions of the FFCRA amend, extend, or create certain Medicare, Medicaid, and public health laws. Increasing access to care is the main theme of this section of the law, which authorizes a range of health care assistance programs funded through the use of mandatory funds. Affected programs include telemedicine, post-baccalaureate loan repayment, and loan repayment for physicians practicing in underserved areas, as well as a range of federal and state-funded primary and preventive health care and related wellness benefits programs (e.g., smoking cessation, obesity, diabetes, and infant mortality programs). In addition to increasing access to health care, the law also provides incentives to promote and encourage individuals to engage in healthy behaviors. The FFCRA encompasses four primary aspects of health care programs and services. First, the law provides a one-time, $600 per adult and $300 per child Medicare payment to physicians and other eligible professionals and practitioners providing care and management to patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage or the Medicare prescription drug (Rx) program (Part D). Second, the FFCRA extends the current enhanced federal matching rate for expenditures by states, territories, and the District of Columbia to address this pandemic under the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF). Third, the FFCRA requires HHS to establish a $10 billion Coronavirus Vaccine Preparedness Fund, which would be available to offset losses at health care facilities, hospitals, post-acute care providers, and other entities as a result of declines in patient volume and payment, which may be associated with vaccination and testing activity. Finally, the FFCRA amends and expands some federal vaccine loan repayment programs. SENATE CONSIDERATION:The Senate passed H.R. 6201 under a unanimous consent agreement on March 16, 2020, as amended. As amended, the Senate version of H.R. 6201 contained four amendments, three to which were agreed to as a package with respect to the health care provisions. The Senate agreed to offer the first amendment to the text of H.R. 6201 on March 16, 2020. The FFCRA passed the Senate by voice vote on March 17, 2020, with the same set of amendments, which were agreed to as a package and which added a provision to increase the authorized funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On March 17, 2020, the Senate agreed to the text of H.R. 6201 as amended, and the measure was placed directly on the calendar of the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives passed H.R. as amended under a unanimous consent agreement on March 17, 2020. Because of a drafting conflict between provisions in H.R. 6201 and provisions in H.R. 1158, H.R. 6201 was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. On March 18, 2020, the House passed H.R. 6201 under a unanimous consent election. The House agreed to adopt H.Res. 903 on March 19, 2020, which makes in order H.R. 6201. The House read the measure, and requested a summary of the bill. The bill was read under a closed Rule in the House on March 20, 2020, with the measure being adopted the next day by voice vote.

TABLE 1. Packaged Foods Disclosure Compliance Date Packaged foods in a retail store A food manufacturer sells packages of its packaged food directly to an end consumer. As defined in the 2016 Act, this occurs when the manufacturer sells packages in a retail store that was not the manufacturer s Internet seller or other means.1 The compliance date for disclosure with respect to this packaged food to be sold in the retail store is JANUARY 1, 2020, as explained below. In January 2020, manufacturer (not the retail store seller):1 Publishes a disclosure statement of the prescribed form with respect to bioengineered food information or2 Publishes a QR code that links the consumer to a website that provides such information. In addition to the prescribed disclosure statement for package labelling, the manufacturer may provide information about GEs in foods on the package (e.g., on the information panel). Such in-pack information would not be prescribed by law, but the manufacturer could voluntarily provide it. Packaged foods in an Internet seller or other means. This occurs when the manufacturer uses an Internet seller (i.e., the manufacturer, an affiliate of the manufacturer, or a person that has contracted to sell the food to the consumer)2 to directly sell packages of its product directly to the consumer. As defined in the 2016 Act, this occurs when the manufacturer sells packages in a retail store that was not the manufacturer s Internet seller, or other means. An Internet seller would typically be an online store that uses an ecommerce website to sell its product. Other examples of an Internet seller could include an online grocery delivery service or a brick-and-mortar retailer that uses its own ecommerce website to sell its product. A retail store could include Amazon.com Inc. stores that are not its Internet seller. 1 In the alternative, a manufacturer may voluntarily sell products in a food retailer s store (i.e. the retail grocery store is not providing the product itself). If the manufacturer chooses to do so, then the disclosure compliance date is January 1, 2020, as described below. 2 The definitions of these terms are provided in the Section II. C. Regulatory Text. 4 This report follows the general rule-making guidelines established by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). These guidelines require a reviewing agency to prepare an agency statement of purpose and basis when promulgating a rule. This report is based on publicly available information, such as the National Food and Agriculture Law Review (the Review ). The Review examined public submissions to USDA, summarizes comments made by interested parties to the 2016 Act, and tracks public comments made throughout the rulemaking process. The Review provided an overview of public comments related to major aspects of the rulemaking process, and is referenced throughout this report. Additional sources used to prepare this report include relevant Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports and a fact sheet from USDA. The 2016 Act provides compliance dates for disclosure options and compliance dates for manufacturer disclosure of GE food information in accordance with the Standard. The Act uses the following disclosure compliance dates: January 1, 2020 for label disclosure of bioengineered food information and November 1, 2021 for in-pack disclosure of GE information. 5 TABLE 2. 2016 Act Compliance Dates for Packaged Foods in a Food Retail Store6 Compliance Date Disclosure Options Mandatory (as prescribed by Federal law) Non-Mandatory (as defined by the federal government) Internet seller or 1 January 2020 Manufacturer website QR codes (i.e., link to a website) or 2 January 2020 In-pack disclosures (e.g., on the information panel) Retail store seller (i.e., the food itself is provided in a store) 1 January 2020 Manufacturer website statements Manufacturer voluntarily selling in a food retail store (i.e., a retail store that is not an Internet seller) 2 January 2020 Manufacturer website statements 1 The term Internet seller means a person who the Secretary finds (1", "Congress and to OMB for cost-benefit analysis with respect to some rules. As a result of Executive Order 13563, promulgated by President Obama in 2011, federal agencies must adopt regulations that: (1) maximize net benefits in accordance with an assessment of costs and benefits that is complete and transparent and (2) use the best available science and evidence to develop such regulations. Moreover, Section 801 of the OSH Act requires OSHA to consult with appropriate federal and state agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, when promulgating an occupational safety or health standard. Other federal laws may also impact the rulemaking process, because federal agencies must consider agency policies and statutes when promulgating a standard. Section 8(g) of OSHA's implementing regulations provides guidance regarding required standards under the OSH Act. In addition to the OSH Act, OSHA's regulatory system requires the agency to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine what actions should be taken to prevent a safety or health problem, and what is the best course of action for OSHA to take. In order to accomplish this objective, OSHA has a number of discretionary tools, including the ability to issue abatement notices, cite violations, negotiate settlements, and issue variances and individual protection. OSHA publishes its rules in the Federal Register, typically in the form of proposed standards or direct final standards. OSHA may promulgate regulations as direct final rules when the requirement for a public notice and comment period has the potential to delay the implementation of the rule. A rule may be promulgated as a direct final rule with a 60-day public comment period under Section 553(b)(3) of the APA. This is the most general notice requirement for all administrative rules, which does not apply to interim rules. A direct final rule requires a 30-day public comment period, and the agency does not publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register. An agency must publish a direct final rule and a companion notice of proposed rulemaking, unless the agency foregoes both, in which case comment may be provided to the agency only during the specified 30 days. A rulemaking record is created by the agency and is maintained at the Regulatory Information Service Center in Washington, D.C., for 20 years. The rule cannot be published as a final rule if OSHA either does not receive significant comments on the rule or addresses the comments in a public notice issued before or with the final rule. Also, if OSHA anticipates there being significant comments, it may first publish the rule as a direct final rule combined with a notice of proposed rulemaking, which gives the public an additional 60 days to respond to the rule proposal. Any comment must be made on or before the specified comment period with the accompanying rule. Under this authority, OSHA may first publish a direct final rule, but then change its action and publish the subsequent rule in response to the first direct final rule if there are comments received that are contrary to the original rule.", "This report describes actions taken to provide FY2021 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS). The 12 regular appropriations bills fund the operations of the federal government, providing the expenditure authority for agencies to carry out their work. The Senate committee of jurisdiction over regular appropriations bills has requested a report describing each of the bills. In accordance with requests from other congressional committees, the report includes a summary table depicting the status of each bill, as well as the 12 regular appropriations bills enacted for FY2020 and those bills reported by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, but not enacted, for FY2020.\nIn support of its mandate to oversee agency compliance with appropriations bills, the committee of jurisdiction typically monitors the administration of agency funds through both hearings and regular reports on the status of the bills. Throughout the year, committees of jurisdiction will report on progress on each of the CJS bills.\nThere are 6 divisions within the Commerce Department and 3 agencies within Justice:\n(1) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): NOAA's mission is \"to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's needs.\" NOAA pursues its mission through six line offices--the National Ocean Service, National Environmental Satellite and Space Information, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, National Weather Service, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and National Marine Fisheries Service--as well as five system-integration offices. (2) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): NASA's mission is \"to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research.\" NASA researches and supports science education activities, pursues aeronautical innovation, and works to advance new space technologies. (3) National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA): NTIA is an agency of the Commerce Department that advises the President on telecommunications and information policies issues and manages the nation's use of radio spectrum. (3) Department of Justice (DOJ): In addition to the Department itself, the DOJ has three large components--the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshal Service (USMS), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) --and one smaller one, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys and the U.S. Trustee System. The FBI is the principal investigative agency in the federal judicial system. It was created in 1908 following the assassination of President William McKinley. Among the FBI's many functions is investigations of violations of the Criminal Code, foreign counterintelligence, and internal security matters. The USMS maintains federal court system by providing security and transport for judicial officers, procuring witnesses, and ensuring safe and secure transfer of federal prisoners. The DEA is the lead agency for combatting drug trafficking and related crimes. The agency has two major missions: enforcing the Controlled Substances Act and working with international partners to limit drug exports. The fourth component of the Justice Department is the Office of Justice Programs. This office provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to prevent, control, and reduce violence, domestic violence, and crimes against children.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a component of the MHS\u00e2\u0080\u0094administers the TRICARE program, which offers health care services to approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries, composed of military personnel, retirees, and their families. Beneficiaries may receive health care services in DOD-operated hospitals and clinics\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as military treatment facilities (MTFs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094or through participating civilian health care providers. DOD operates 723 MTFs in the United States and in overseas locations. Each MTF provides a range of clinical services depending on its size, mission, and level of capabilities. Only active duty servicemembers are entitled to care in any MTF. Dependents and retirees may receive care on a space-available basis that takes into account patient capacity, beneficiary category (e.g., servicemember, family member, retiree), and enrollment status. When care is not available at an MTF, beneficiaries may receive care from a civilian health care provider who participates in TRICARE. The three main health plan options offered to eligible beneficiaries included here are TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) and related questions. A more complete discussion of the statutory authorities that guide the administration of the TRICARE program can be found in CRS Report R44996, Tricare: Background on Health Care Benefits for Military Retirees, Dependents, and Former Spouses by Barbara Salazar Torreon.\nFederal law requires DOD to annually reimburse employers who provide TRICARE-covered dental services to federal employees, dependents, and survivors (also known as the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP). It directs the Secretary of Defense to make premium amounts publicly available 28 days prior to the last day of December each year ( i.e. , 10 months prior to the benefit year  ). Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is required to publish TRICARE premiums by specific plan, based on geographic location where the care is received, in a timely manner ( i.e ., prior to the open season, whenever possible)  . Premiums are posted on the TRICARE website  which allows users to calculate the out-of-pocket costs based on specific care needs. In addition, the TRICARE website features information about eligibility requirements and program benefits, as well as other program resources.\nThe following section provides answers to common questions about DOD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to make TRICARE plans available to qualified retirees and spouses, focusing on TRS and TRR specifically, though other TRICARE plans also provide options for coverage.\nThis section is divided into the following sections: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 TRICARE Reserve Select; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 TRICARE Retired Reserve; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 TRICARE-Covered Areas; \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Enrollment Status, Beneficiary Category, and Cost-Sharing Requirements; and \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Spouse Eligibility.\nTRICARE Reserve Select is a premium-based health program for qualified beneficiaries who are members of the Ready Reserve. This plan allows participants to choose among different levels of coverage, depending on the amount of pre-tax income withheld from payroll deductions to contribute toward the program. The TRICARE policy on these levels and how to choose a level of coverage is set out in DODIG-2014-110 .\nOn 1 January of each year, retirees must be age 60 or older to be enrolled in TRICARE Retired Reserve, unless 4.5 of the 9.5 years of combined qualifying service are active-duty service. When a retiree is enrolled in TRICARE Retired Reserve, and both spouses are eligible for TRICARE, retiree must enroll the spouse in TRICARE Retired Reserve or, in case of an annuitant, the spouse must enroll in TRICARE Retired Reserve for Life  . In 2018, retirement-oriented seminars were presented to Ready Reserve Officers on eligibility criteria", "This act consists of three titles with five subtitles. Title I addresses health care preparedness plans, establishes a public health emergency fund, and permits the Secretary to temporarily restrict or prohibit interstate travel. Title II addresses supplemental appropriations, emergency supplies for medical countermeasures, and health care workforce enhancements. Title III addresses COVID-19 vaccine development, distribution, and funding. The act also addresses additional public health, labor, and telehealth provisions. TITLE I: PREPAREDNESS PLANS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY The CARES Act requires the HHS Secretary to amend several Federal health preparedness plans. Specifically, by no later than 45 days after the date of enactment, the HHS Secretary, in conjunction with the heads of other federal agencies involved, shall review the National Response Plan to incorporate COVID-19, and revise the Federal Medical Response Plan for Bioterrorism and Mass Casualties to include the public health and medical response to COVID-19. The HHS Secretary must also review and revise the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Program Response to a Mass Casualty Incident involving COVID-19 to make sure it is adequate. The CARES Act also requires certain administrative actions to be taken to ensure that public health and medical response to COVID-19 is timely. Specifically, the heads of HHS, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), along with the National Security Advisor, and in consultation with the National Security Council, are to take certain actions relating to, inter alia, information sharing. The heads of HHS, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and FEMA shall issue any necessary determinations regarding the continuation of certain authorities. The heads of other agencies are to issue certain determinations regarding additional authorities, including the following: the Federal Acquisition Regulation's moratorium on non-essential contracting activities; the continuing availability of appropriations and authorities to address the pandemic; and certain federal contracting, grants, and cooperative agreements. The President may restrict or prohibit travel to, from, and within the United States via Interstate Commerce Commission authorities. The CARES Act also authorizes certain funding provisions. Specifically, the HHS Secretary shall provide additional supplemental funding to grantees for programs to address the risk of COVID-19. The HHS Secretary may award grants to support efforts to address the risk. The President may use certain public funds administered by the HUD Secretary to ensure the affordability of housing for infected individuals and their families (which could come at the expense of others), and may rehabilitate public housing infrastructure. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS), part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), may make available additional appropriations to rural public water systems for the purpose of providing safe public water.\nThe HHS Secretary may use certain appropriations to support state and local COVID-19 monitoring and testing initiatives, and provide funding to support enhanced training in health care facilities. Certain appropriations may also be used to carry out programs and activities to treat and relieve psychological or mental health effects of COVID-19, or address the risk associated with COVID-19. With respect to certain funding, state and tribal governments may use funding to develop health care workforce initiatives. TITLE II: EMPOWERING U.S. CORONAVIRUS VIGILANCE AND INNOVATION A. Emergency Funds B. Medical Countermeasures C. HHS Workforce D. Vaccine Development E. Vaccine Distribution, Innovation, and Awareness F. Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness and Response G. Ebola H. Health Centres I. Public Health Awareness J. Global and Domestic Emerging Infectious Disease Surveillance The CARES Act provides $1.1 billion in emergency funds. To do this, the HHS Secretary may reallocate unobligated and unexpended balances of appropriations made previously in FY2020 and prior periods for public health and medical preparedness programs to support COVID-19 preparedness and response activities. In addition, appropriations that have previously been provided to any Department or Agency of the United States for any account for any activity for FY2020 and prior periods may be used to support COVID-19 preparedness and response activities. The CARES Act prohibits funds from being exp", "The FY2020 DHS appropriations bill (H.R. 3931) was signed into law as Division D of P.L. 116-93 on December 20, 2019. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3931 were passed by their respective Appropriations Committees with recommendations. Both versions contain similar provisions, which are discussed in this report. The Senate version of H.R. 3931 is the FY2020 version of S. 2582, which was enacted earlier into law. Both versions of H.R. 3931 are referred to herein in this report as \"P.L.\" (Public Law), followed by the law's number (H.R. 3931, also known as P.L. 116-93) or chapter (S. 2582). (5%) of the available base discretionary defense cap, as outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25). The act includes increases in base defense spending for the Armed Forces from FY2018 and increases appropriations for overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in FY2020 when used for defense activities not yet designated for use in FY2020. For FY2020, DHS received the same amount of appropriations authorized in the FY2019 level, adjusted for inflation as required in annual appropriations acts. This law contained no budget authority for FY2020 that was not previously appropriated. The FY2020 discretionary spending cap for defense is slightly higher than the enacted level for FY2019 in P.L. 115-141 (P.L. 115-179, P.L. 115-52, and P.L. 116-6) (the act) primarily due to a higher OCO cap for defense under the act (see Section 4 below).", "This report focuses on six temporary individual tax expenditures scheduled to expire at the end of 2020--the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, the mortgage insurance premium deduction, the above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses, the credit for health insurance costs, the increase in the adjusted gross income floor for the medical expense deduction, and the exclusion for income from certain state and local tax rebates. CBO projects that these provisions would reduce federal revenues by a total of $31.7 billion for the period 2020-2024. An estimated $28.2 billion would be for the provision pertaining to higher education expenses. Two provisions--the credit for insurance costs and the increase in the adjusted gross income (AGI) floor for the medical expense deduction-have been included in tax extenders legislation in recent years. The other provisions have not been included in tax extenders legislation within the past six years. These extensions were provided under Division Q -- the SECURE Act of 2019, as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94), which was signed into law on December 20, 2019. In addition to the extension of these provisions, this act provided an above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses for taxable years 2018 through 2020. However, an estate tax deduction for family-owned farms and businesses enacted in the Taking Care of Our Own Act (P.L. 115-97) expires at the end of this year (2019), and was not extended in the tax extenders legislation. Tax extenders legislation previously extended the tax exclusion and above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, the credit for health insurance costs, and some tax-preferred retirement savings accounts; so, three of the six individual tax expenditures in this report will expire at the end of 2020 (the above-the-line tuition expense deductions and the credit for insurance costs are set to expire on January 1, 2021). The other three provisions could be extended in tax extenders legislation in 2020. Tax extenders legislation typically relies on a provision, known as a \"sunset provision,\" which temporarily extends a provision for several years, such as five or six years--as was the case for the tax exclusion provision, for example. If action is taken, however, these six individual tax expenditures could continue through 2021 for the tax exclusion provision, 2025 for the two provisions related to health insurance, and 2022 for the remaining three provisions.\nTEXT: In the past, Congress has regularly acted to extend expired or expiring temporary tax provisions. Collectively, these temporary tax provisions are often referred to as 'tax extenders.' There are 33 tax extenders scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. This report summarizes six extenders related to individual income tax provisions: (1) the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, (2) mortgage insurance premium deduction, (3) above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, (4) credit for health insurance costs, (5) adjusted gross income (AGI) floor for the medical expenses deduction, and (6) state and local taxes. These provisions were extended for two years through 2020 as Division Q of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ).\nTEXT: This report summarizes six individual income tax extenders: (1) tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, (2) mortgage insurance premium deduction, (3) above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, (4) credit for health insurance costs, (5) AGI floor for the medical expenses deduction, and (6) state and local taxes, which were extended under Division Q of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 , \u00a7 5004(a) ). These provisions were enacted in the Conference Agreement at Divison Q of", "Previous page has been omitted due to spacing issues and will continue with page after the 3rd from the end.\nand Health Care Financing Administration [(HCFA)].\" As explained further below, HRSA/HCFA issued the guidance leading to coverage of contraceptive services in 2011. In implementing \"comprehensive guidelines\" as required by this ACA provision, HRSA/HCFA noted that \"some preventive services are not consistently rated by the [U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)] to be of benefit for particular populations, such as women with certain medical conditions,\" and so, according to the federal agency, \"health insurance issuers must cover appropriate items and services in these instances.\"\nThe federal government cited a specific service it considered appropriate, namely \"contraceptive services,\" but it did not define this term in the regulations or otherwise explain how an insurer would comply with the mandate. As a result, insurers and employers sought to understand the scope of the requirement. They determined, for example, that coverage of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontraceptive services\u00e2\u0080\u009d did not extend to sterilization procedures.\nIn light of the agencies' regulatory guidance, many insurers covered contraception as a preventive service without relying on the agencies' HRSA/HCFA guidelines. Those insurers did not have to rely on the guidelines because they could determine\u00e2\u0080\"and several courts, most recently in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores ,  Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0094have required them to do so\u00e2\u0080\"that they could \"exclude contraceptive services and products based upon moral objections.\" After the Supreme Court decided Hobby Lobby in June 2014, however, the ACA's coverage requirement as applied to insurers was in flux. The court upheld the contraceptive coverage requirement as applied to employer-based health plans, but it also found that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (FRFRA) allowed objecting individuals or institutions to be exempt from the requirement. Under FRFRA, objecting individuals or institutions could avail themselves of a safe harbor allowing for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca religious organization ... [to] assert their [religious] objections over contraceptives and obtain an accommodation from [HHS] or [the Department of the Treasury].\" If this accommodation mechanism was improper, the federal government was obligated to provide \"the appropriate contraceptive methods ... through [] a mechanism separate from the [employer's] health coverage.\"\nHowever, according to the HHS report, \"[m]any objecting nonprofit organizations have either used their house of worship's health insurance policy (if available) to provide coverage for contraceptives for their employees or dropped coverage completely.\" Others have, in fact, also dropped health insurance coverage for all employees as an alternative to providing contraception coverage. In the latter situation, it is presumed that most, if not all, of the affected employees would not have been eligible for subsidized coverage through the Exchange anyway.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094to avoid ACA penalties and potentially be in compliance with Hobby Lobby , many nonprofits dropped coverage.\nIn other words, when the government granted employers, religious organizations, and individuals exemptions from the mandate, it necessarily disallowed an employer's or employee's insurance coverage as an alternative. The next part addresses how HHS implemented Hobby Lobby so that religious organizations and individuals could obtain contraception without employer insurance.\nTo date, most of the legal challenges to the federal mandate and its agency accommodations have focused on the mandate in its capacity as \"a rule with respect to health insurance issuers.\" This was how HHS sought to implement FRFRA in response to the court opinions. HHS took this approach because it sought to implement FRFRA in a manner that, in its view, did \"not change the services that nonprofit organizations and insurers must cover\" but rather provided an accommodation to cover the specific drugs or devices that objecting individuals or institutions wanted excluded. The government has repeatedly asserted that it \"in no way interfere[d] with the exercise of religion by a nonprofit organization.\"\n(a) \u00e2\u0080\u009c[I]t shall be an unfair employment practice for an employer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6[(1) \u00e2\u0080\u00a6] to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or to otherwise discriminate in any manner with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual's race, color, religion, sexual", "Cannabidiol (CBD) , a compound in the Cannabis sativa plant , has been promoted as a treatment for a range of conditions, including epileptic seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, inflammation, and sleeplessness . However, limited scientific evidence exists to substantiate or disprove the efficacy of CBD in treating these conditions. In the United States, CBD is being marketed in food and beverages, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS , [c] ommonly referred to as electronic cigarettes)\u00e2\u0080\u0094products that are primarily regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). CBD is also the active ingredient in Epidiolex , an FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug used to treat seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. CBD, on the other hand, is generally considered to be non-psychoactive and may be derived from either hemp or marijuana. As described below, this distinction is relevant for purposes of oversight by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), but generally not for FDA oversight. Marijuana and hemp have separate definitions in U.S. law and are subject to different federal oversight. Botanically, marijuana and hemp are from the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa , but from different varieties or cultivars. Marijuana is generally grown for use in the production of a wide range of products, including foods and beverages, personal care products, dietary supplements, fabrics, and textiles1 (see Figure 1). Until December 2018, hemp and its derivatives (including hemp-derived CBD) were also included in the CSA definition of marijuana and thus subject to the same restrictions as marijuana in that they were regulated as controlled substances and illegal to grow or possess in the United States. The 2018 farm bill2 removed hemp and its derivatives from this statutory classification, subjecting hemp-derived CBD to the same oversight as non-CBD hemp products (see text box). Under the FFDCA and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA ) , hemp products that do not contain CBD are not controlled substances; the only such substances are \"drugs, devices, and chemicals\" and \"new drugs\" as defined in Title I of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (P.L. 105-115). CBD products are considered to be pharmaceuticals regulated by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER , which is within the FDA's Office of New Drugs ). Furthermore, the FDA classifies substances based on their intended use\u00e2\u0080\u0094if a substance has been studied in humans or animals with positive results (e.g., if a product has been approved for marketing to treat diseases), the substance is categorized as a drug. Hemp-der", "The Hatch-Waxman Act allows pharmaceutical companies to seek approval for generic versions of certain biologic drugs.  It also includes a provision that protects pharmaceutical companies if their brand-name drugs have been on the market for more than 5 years and no generic copies have been or are available. (The FDA has indicated that this could be interpreted as a ban on the generic company's product even if the generic drug maker does not have market exclusivity to manufacture, market, and sell a generic version of the brand-name and 5-year-old drug. See here:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm534170.pdf).   The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act were  enacted in 1984 to improve the quality and expedite the introduction of generic drugs.  Hatch-Waxman's generic drug exclusivity provisions incentivized manufacturers to introduce generics as quickly as possible following the expiration of  manufacturers' patents on brand-name drugs.  Because these provisions have a significant impact on the market for pharmaceutical drugs, Congress has repeatedly addressed these provisions as recently as the 115th Congress.  Below is a summary of recently proposed legislation that pertains to the Hatch-Waxman Act, its provisions, and the current state of the pharmaceutical industry.  ===============================================================================", "As the term is currently...\nShow more", "Historic preservation is the practice of protecting and preserving sites, structures, objects, landscapes, and other cultural resources of historical significance. Various federal, state, and local government programs, as well as privately funded activities, support historic preservation in the United States. This report provides an overview of the federal role in historic preservation, including background and funding information for some of the major preservation programs authorized by Congress. In addition to establishing national policies governing historic preservation, Congress considers the federal government's role in financing many of these programs through the annual appropriations process. Some Members of Congress support proposals to eliminate the federal role in historic preservation; leaving such programs to be sustained by other levels of government or by private support. Other Members feel that federal support for historic preservation should be maintained or increased. The heavy toll that recent natural disasters like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken on historic resources has contributed to increased support for incorporating preservation needs in federal disaster relief planning and aid. This report includes an overview of federal funding for historic preservation activities from FY2016 to FY2020. It also outlines some potential issues for the 116th Congress related to historic preservation. The federal role in historic preservation was limited for much of the United States' early history, with no formal federal policy in place. The two most significant early efforts in historic preservation were carried out in the 1890s. First, Congress passed laws intended to protect ancient Puebloan sites in the American Southwest. Prior to these laws, there were no federal laws on the books dealing with preservation at all. Then, in 1906, Congress enacted the Antiquities Act,1 authorizing the executive branch to identify and protect cultural resources situated on federal lands. The Antiquities Act grants the President the power to proclaim national monuments to be \"preserved for public use, or, as appropriate, for public purposes.\" This law has proven to be very controversial among some Members of Congress and landowners, leading to many battles over the designation of federal land as monuments. Before the implementation of the Antiquities Act, Congress established a National Historical Sites Program, which authorized the President to designate certain properties of historical significance as \u201cnational monuments.\u201d (See the \"National Historic Landmarks Program\" section for more information on this program.) After its creation, the new Antiquities Act was utilized to designate a variety of National Monuments. Some of these, created using the Antiquities Act, were subsequently designated as NHLs by the Secretary of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first NHL proclaimed by the Secretary was Mount Olympus National Monument,2 which became Mount Olympus National Memorial on December 21, 1999.2 Since its passage in 1906, the Antiquities Act has been used to designate more than 2,000 national monuments, including over 150 national monuments established during the 21 st Century. Congress has periodically modified the Antiquities Act, such as in 1971 when it modified the Secretary's discretionary power to designate national monuments and required a public hearing and written notification before a national monument declaration.3 Additional changes to the Antiquities Act that were made in 1980 provide that the new proclaimed national monuments can no longer encompass more than \u00e2\u0080\u009cten consecutively numbered sections or one- square mile, whichever is smaller\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\" 4 To protect areas larger than the specified range of acreage limits, Congress often creates national parks, national conservation areas, or other federal lands designations. Examples of national monuments established in the first three decades of the 2 1 16 U.S.C. 431. See also: https://chc.house.gov/sites/chc.house.gov/files/IHAHB50261-12_0.pdf; 16 U.S.C. 432. 2 The National Monument designation was revoked in 1958 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower (P.L. 85-620). However, in 1996 Congress restored the National Monument status via PL. 104-321. 3 National Endowment for the Humanities, The White House and the World of Art, A Resource Guide, January 2017, https://www.neh.gov/files/pdf/resource-guide-white-house-world-art.pdf (hereinafter \"The White House", "I. INTRODUCTION IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is an unofficial copy of congressional testimony submitted for the record. A corrected version is maintained by the author and is available from \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyCongress\u00e2\u0080\u009d (https://my.congress.gov/). 82% of the total population, which are considered metro areas under the Office of Management and Budgets definitions (see footnote 1). Rural residents consist of an estimated 15.7% of the total population that reside in areas known as nonmetropolitan counties (46 states) or Census-designated Rural Areas (70% of nonmetropolitan counties in Alaska), and an estimated 3.4% of the total population concentrated in urban clusters with fewer than twenty thousand residents. Although the United States Census Bureau identifies nearly 14,000 census tracts as \"rural,\" only 2,400 of these geographically diverse areas have populations that exceed 20,000. As summarized in Figure 1, the Census Bureau also offers an Urban Influence Code, which it defines as a classification \"based on the relative contribution of urban residents to the county's population.\" The agency notes \"that a combination of factors in a county such as size, industrial composition, and urbanization is taken into consideration.\"1 \u00c2\u00b6\u00c2\u00b6 2-3. The Census Bureau identifies two categories of counties, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrontier\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cremote\u00e2\u0080\u009d areas, which includes non-metro areas with fewer than ten thousand residents.2 Frontier areas tend to encompass remote and rugged areas, which can include geographically vast states such as South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. However, urban concentrations dot frontier states, and many of those concentrations, like the \u00e2\u2026\u009d\"Frontier\u00e2\u0080\u009d communities in New York, North Carolina, and Texas, are less concentrated than urban clusters. Remote areas, on the other hand, encompass non-metro counties with under 10,000 residents, which is most often categorized by the Census Bureau as \u00e2\u0080\u009crural.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These definitions are relevant, first, because rural access to broadband telecommunications can be influenced by the demographics of rural communities with relatively high fixed costs, which may restrict private-sector investment in some cases, and second, because rural access to broadband can be influenced by some of the rural households, small businesses, healthcare providers, schools, and libraries in areas served by the National Broadband Map. This map, as maintained by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), tracks high-speed access to the internet defined by the current FCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rulemaking process. Increased demand for broadband access in the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094and specifically among rural Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0094is driven by an array of consumer activities, such as the use of mobile devices and apps, and increased use of advanced technologies that support healthcare and precision agriculture. \u00c2\u00b6 4. Federal program spending on rural or agricultural broadband access is authorized and appropriated under the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the USDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rural Development (RD) Division. The RD Division may also draw on funds from the Electric Loan Fund3 (ELF), formerly operated by the RUS, and the Rural Utilities Service4 (RUS) (now operated as Rural Telecommunications Loan and Grant in the Rural Utilities Service) programs. Between fiscal year (FY) 2002 and FY 2014, Congress authorized and appropriated $2.84 billion in funding to support 1413 projects, through multiple grant and loan programs, aimed at upgrading broadband, radio, and electrical infrastructure in rural communities with populations of twenty-five thousand or less.5 \u00c2\u00b6 5. The purpose of this report is to assist the House Committee on Energy and Commerce with an analysis of demand for broadband service in rural America, and the role of government programs to support the rollout of broadband infrastructure, on a state-by-state basis, particularly in states with populations of 25,000 or less. This report seeks to summarize recent federal efforts, through Congressional mandates or policy actions, to support broadband deployment by rural individuals and entities, with consideration to relevant Congressional proposals for the 114th Congress. This information will be used to provide a basis from which policy recommendations designed to spur broadband service in rural areas of the United States may be identified and analyzed", "The federal Pell Grant program does not currently support education at institutions that do not confer a degree.\nRecently, policymakers have grown interested in expanding Pell-eligible education at some institutions to include not only those with associate, bachelor's, and advanced degrees, but to also include institutions that offer certificate and non-degree programs.\nSome policymakers propose to provide access to Pell Grants for certificate programs that qualify based on a methodology that ensures the students are enrolled in a program, course, or module that is at least half academic in nature and the student will earn a certificate that meets specific educational requirements. The HEA also permits use of Pell Grant funds for an academic year (two academic semesters or three academic quarters), a Summer term, a session, or an academic term of less than a full academic year.  Some policymakers proposed expanding the use of Pell Grant eligibility to non-degree programs through the Administration's Higher Education Act: Renewal and Reform Act in FY2020, which is currently pending before the House Committee on Education and Labor before further action is taken.\nThe House Education and Labor Subcommittee ordered reported the College Affordability Act in October 2019, which contains provisions intended to expand enrollment in apprenticeships, on-the-job training opportunities, and Pell Grants for non-degree educational programs. This report examines trends in the use of Pell Grants, considers the current scope of eligible institutions and programs, and provides examples of institutions and programs that currently are and are not Pell-eligible. The report also compares these eligible institutions and programs with the kinds of institutions that students tend to choose to pursue certificates and non-degree programs and with the kinds of jobs graduates of those non-degree programs have and are most likely to have.\nIn addition, this report examines some concerns and implications of expanding eligibility to Pell-eligible institutions and programs generally; raises considerations about whether or to what extent there should be a separate system for non-degree Pell Grants; and discusses how the U.S. Department of Education (ED) may administer a separate non-degree program. Finally, this report offers options to expanding the use of Pell Grants.", "Summarizing is a skill that is of great importance as it ensures that the message is easily understood. While writing the summary it is important to think about the content and the main idea. This can be done by paraphrasing the content or even summarizing each paragraph. In order to improve this skill, it is important to keep on practicing as this skill develops over time.", "(continued) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Page 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The HEA provisions governing FSA's operations as a PBO are located in Title I, Part G, Section 1116 of the HEA, which authorized PBO status for FSA, as amended by the Improving Head Start Act (P.L. 110-134). This section stipulates that the FSA Administrator is personally accountable to Congress for the performance goals set by the Secretary of Education and for the performance goals determined by the FSA Administrator. According to the HEA, the PBO should not be restructured so as to result in the delegation of the powers and duties required to be delegated to the designee of the Secretary of Education under Title IV of the HEA. The HEA does not, however, describe the nature or scope of the FSA Administrator's responsibility to Congress for the performance of an agency with thousands of employees in hundreds of offices. The HEA requires that the FSA Administrator carry out programs authorized by Title IV, which include Federal Work-Study, financial aid eligibility and need analysis, grants, income-driven repayment plans, and consolidated student loans. Finally, the PBO section of the HEA specifies that the agency has some of the powers normally assigned to the heads of executive agencies, including authority to establish such positions and salaries as the FSA Administrator determines. The HEA also authorized the creation of the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA OIG) within the Department of Education (ED) to function as the FSA Administrator's outside watchdog. This section directed the FSA OIG to perform the functions described in the IG Act (P.L. 95-452) governing the appointment and responsibilities of the Inspector Generals of federal agencies. The FSA OIG is required to report to the Secretary of Education and is responsible for auditing and inspecting all functions and programs of or performed by FSA to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and mismanagement, including any activities through which FSA participates in the oversight or administration of any postsecondary educational program authorized or funded under Title IV of the HEA or another federal education program or assisted under the PBO provisions of the HEA.  In addition to being a PBO, FSA is an independent federal agency. In contrast, most federal agencies are part of the executive branch. That is, they are directly administered by an appointed or elected position and are accountable to the President of the United States. However, some agencies, such as government corporations, are partially privatized and have dual accountability to the government and to the private sector.", "Congress chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, also known collectively as the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to promote homeownership by providing liquidity to the secondary markets for single-family residential mortgages and multifamily (apartment and condominium) construction. Guaranteeing single-family residential mortgages is their core business activity, but it comes with risks. The GSEs retain the credit (default) risks from the mortgages they purchase from loan originators and subsequently issue mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), which are bond-like securities. Investors who purchase the MBSs are guaranteed to get their initial principal investment returned, but they assume the risk that borrowers may choose to repay their mortgages ahead of schedule, known as prepayment risk. The MBSs are considered more liquid (in comparison to the original mortgages with both attached risks) because they may be traded or sold for cash more quickly. If investors are willing to hold MBSs, then more private-sector funds become available for relatively less liquid mortgages\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. National mortgage rates tend to fall as the supply of funds in this market increases, making homeownership more affordable. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent federal government agency created by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA; P.L. 110-289 ), is the GSEs' primary supervisor. FHFA regulates the GSEs for prudential safety and soundness and ensure they meet their affordable housing mission goals. In September 2008, the GSEs experienced losses that exceeded their statutory minimum capital requirement levels due to the high rate of mortgage defaults. The GSEs subsequently agreed to be placed under conservatorship. Until the GSEs' financial safety and soundness can be restored, the FHFA has the powers of management, boards, and shareholders. The Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPAs) stipulate the conditions under which the U.S. Treasury will provide financial support to the GSEs while they are under conservatorship. The PSPAs require the GSEs to pay dividends to Treasury rather than private shareholders while they are under conservatorship. The PSPAs also require the GSEs to reduce the size of their lending portfolios to $250 billion. Since they entered conservatorship, congressional interest has continued. Draft proposals such as the Brat (H.R. 3609) and Watt (H.R. 3971) bills would affect the GSEs' role in the housing finance system. Members of both chambers have introduced housing finance reform legislation. During the 115 th Congress, the U.S. House considered H.R. 3700, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRestoring Taxpayer Protection and Confidence Act of 2017,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and H.R. 887, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHousing Opportunity Through Modernization Act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 3700 before the final adjournment of that Congress, but the U.S. Senate did not consider the bill for a vote. Also, the U.S. Senate has passed various measures to advance housing finance reform such as S. 167, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHousing Reform Act of 2013,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which aimed to create a secondary market mechanism that would facilitate loan origination, and S. 1217, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGSE Bailout Prevention Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would change the mission and role of the GSEs to facilitate loan originations. President Donald Trump also released a proposal to reorganize the GSEs. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would also create a successor corporation to assume the GSEs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial obligations; the proposal would also transfer to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) responsibility for oversight and management of the secondary mortgage market. Presidential leadership and congressional interest in housing finance reform are reflected in various discussion drafts. For example, the U.S. House passed two oversight bills related to the GSEs that have since been transmitted to the U.S. Senate", "This report describes selected health care-related provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2019.

The House of Representatives passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA; H.R. 2500 ) on July 12, 2019. The Senate passed its version of the NDAA ( S. 1790 ) on June 27, 2019. These bills contain numerous provisions that affect military personnel, retirees, and their family members. Provisions in one version may not be included in the other, may be treated differently, or may be identical to those in the other versions. Following passage of each chamber's bill, a conference committee typically convenes to resolve the differences between the respective chambers' versions of the bill. The House passed the FY2020 NDAA conference report on December 11, 2019, and the Senate passed the report on December 17, 2019. On December 20, 2019, President Donald J. Trump signed the bill into law ( P.L. 116-92 ). This report highlights selected personnel-related issues that may generate high levels of congressional and constituent interest. Related CRS products are identified in each section to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issues. Issues that were considered previously are designated with an asterisk in the relevant section titles of this report. Background: The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001, enacted in the year prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress substantially increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Congress began reversing those increases in light of the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in 2012, and budgetary constraints. Congress halted further reductions in Army and Marine Corps end-strength in FY2017, providing slight end-strength increases for both Services. End-strength for the Air Force generally declined from 2002 to 2012, but increased in 2013 and remained essentially stable through FY2018. End-strength for the Navy declined from 2002 to 2012, increased in 2013 and 2014, and remained essentially stable through FY2017. Table 1 provides authorized end-strengths for FY2013 through FY2019. Authorized end-strength for FY2020 (H.R. 2500 ) is shown in the first column of Table 2 , and for the FY2020 NDAA ( S. 1790 ) in the second column.

I'll also take a look at some of the market's reaction to the World Health Organization's (WHO) official designation of the coronavirus as a public health emergency. I hope this piece offers some context around these two noteworthy developments. The market's reaction to the second Chicago coronavirus death and the outbreak of the disease in Texas are relatively mixed, as of this writing. As of Wednesday February 12, the S&P 500 (SPX) was within 10 basis points (bps) of its October 31, 2019, top\u2014after falling nearly 3.7% on Monday of this week, the fourth-straight weekly decline for the SPX, the first time that's happened since 2000. By the close of the week, the SPX had ended with a loss of 3%\u2014the biggest drop for stocks since the early days of Donald Trump's presidency in 2017. While this reaction is dramatic\u2014it's certainly not out of the ordinary. Coronavirus-related headlines that cause traders to sell are often followed by headlines that cause traders to buy. This time around, I'd be particularly interested in a potential 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the post-October 2019 sell-off\u2014which is 3186 in the SPX. That's just 12 bps below this week's high. The 61.8% retracement for the Nasdaq 100 (NDX)\u2014around the 9540 area\u2014might also be worth watching. On the chart below, I've highlighted the NDX's previous reaction to coronavirus headlines\u2014and a possible Fibonacci retracement I'd be interested in monitoring. As we near a long weekend, I'd expect to hear more about the global impact of the coronavirus, as well as the efforts to control and halt the outbreak. I'd also expect more headlines about the economic impact of the global response, at least, in terms of market reactions. On February 4, the first coronavirus death outside of China and Hong Kong was reported in the Philippines. This is a particularly concerning development as Asia accounts for over 60% of the world's population. The U.S. death toll has risen to five as of Tuesday, after deaths were also reported in Illinois and California. But if you were to go by the global headlines\u2014instead of market reactions, it seems as though the only development that really matters is that the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In addition to the PHEIC, the WHO also announced a Global Research and Innovation Hub, and the launch of two research and development clusters: one in Winnipeg and a second in Germany. I've mentioned my personal thoughts on the WHO's designation of the coronavirus as a PHEIC in a previous note, but I've taken a closer look at the impact of the WHO declaration. Specifically, I've compared the performance of the SPX to the performance of the SPX on December 6, 2002\u2014the date of the last WHO-declared PHEIC (the SARS Pandemic). As you can see in the chart below, there was very little market reaction to the WHO declaring SARS a PHEIC\u2014which is very surprising as nearly three-quarters of a million people fell ill during the first wave of the SARS outbreak. I think it's particularly noteworthy that the SPX rose nearly 1% between November 28, 2002, and January 21, 2003, before falling more than 7.4%\u2014its first 10-day losing streak since September 2001\u2014in the week following the WHO's SARS declaration. Following the coronavirus declaration of a PHEIC on Wednesday, the SPX declined to its recent lows ahead of the close. That said, we got a bounce after the announcement, and the SPX is now trading 0.7% below its pre-close level. This response is not particularly uncommon. At this point, the market seems to be waiting on more specific news. We're", "This report discusses FY2020 appropriations. TEXT: In recent years there have been a number of efforts in Congress to restructure the federal government to, in part, promote greater efficiency and effectiveness in its management and delivery of federal services. One proposal that has gained growing support in recent years is legislation that would relocate key federal offices outside of Washington, DC, that are performing functions related to the outdoors and natural resources. The legislation is known as the Restoring Our American Mustangs Act (ROAM Act; S. 1455 / S. 303; H.R. 468), formerly known as the Common Ground on Youth Mental Health Act. Title III of the 112th Congress to the National Park Service (NPS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in fiscal year 2012. The relocation act was incorporated into the Public Law 113-76 in March 2014. The FY2014 bill was introduced to the House of Representatives in June 2013 by Rep. Paul Gosar (AZ-4). The FY2015 bill was introduced to the Senate in April 2013 by Senator Jon Tester (MT) and in July 2013 by Senator Barbara Boxer (CA). Similar legislation was introduced to the House during the 113th Congress by Rep. Matt Cartwright (PA-17). The 114th Congress\u2019 House companion bill was introduced by Rep. Tom McClintock (CA-4). The relocation act also gained considerable support during the 114th Congress through the 112th Congress under different bill versions. The relocation act was among the few bills that unanimously passed the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the 114th Congress under its Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a former NPS Director and supporter of the move. The legislation also received bipartisan support in two past committee markups and was reported together with other bills related to the Interior Department. The president, several senators (some of whom are co-sponsoring this legislation), governors, and stakeholders from the affected areas all support the NPS relocation. On September 22, 2014, the ROAM ACT was passed in the House, and voted to in the Senate. The ROAM Act is among a long list of the National Park Service\u2019s Centennial projecs. The ROAM Act establishes the National Park Service Youth Initiative Demonstration Areas in seven states: Ohio, Colorado, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arkansas, Utah, and Alaska. In 2013, Rep. Tom McClintock introduced the Yosemite National Park Land Exchange Act of 2013, H.R. 5086, which would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to exchange federal land for State of California-owned land in the area near Yosemite National Park. Senator Ron Wyden (OR) and Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) introduced similar legislation as S. 2301. The National Parks Second Century Commission Act, H.R. 6846, was introduced in the House in December 2018 by Rep. Bruce Westerman (AR-4), who is the vice chairman of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, with Rep. Niki Tsongas (MA-3), Rep. Ruben Gallego (AZ-7), and Rep. Don Beyer (VA-8). The National Parks Second Century Commission Act requires the Secretary to submit proposed legislation to establish a National Parks Second Century Commission. The President\u2019s FY2020 budget request for the National Park Service would provide nearly $3.439 billion in discretionary funding, more than 5% higher than the FY2019 level of $3.244 billion. The requested FY2020 funding would be $487 million below the $3.926 billion provided in FY2010, the last full year of the Obama Administration, but $83 million above the FY2018 level of $3.356 billion. The Trump Administration requested a 12.8% cut from FY2019 funding for the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), a total reduction of $1.586 billion. The Administration asked for a total of", "The FY2020 continuing appropriations legislative vehicle (H.R. 4378) for the Department of Health and Human Services (H.R. 4378, Division A) was signed into law on September 27, 2019 (P.L. 116-59), although the funding provided by the measure would be limited to federal agencies covered by one or more of the 12 regular annual appropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2020 that were not enacted prior to the new fiscal year beginning on October I,2019. These bills primarily provide funds for the conduct of all federal government activities (except those inappropriate to fund through annual appropriations acts, such as most Social Security Administration (SSA) administrative costs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food assistance programs) and are collectively referred to as \"discretionary appropriations\" or \"discretionary spending.\" By enacting H.R. 4378, Congress intended to avoid two adverse outcomes, both associated with potentially not providing sufficient budget authority to fund the \"projects and activities\" funded by those 12 regular annual appropriations bills and thus having to shut down the government. First, it would otherwise be likely that none of the approximately 70% of government discretionary budget authority provided (or directed to be provided) to federal agencies covered by the FY2020 regular annual appropriations bills not enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year would have become available by October 1, 2019. This would have meant that, in contrast to previous government shutdowns, the government shutdown would have included all appropriations-funded agencies, not just the agencies that perform activities which are inappropriate to fund through annual appropriations acts, such as SSA administrative costs. The second adverse outcome Congress intended to avoid was that none of the approximately 30% of discretionary budget authority not provided (or directed to be provided) to federal agencies covered by the 12 regular annual appropriations bills not enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year would have become available. Although the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) March 2019 baseline assumed that P.L. 115-244 would provide sufficient discretionary budget authority to cover government discretionary budget authority for all FY2020 activities covered by the 12 regular annual appropriations acts and to prevent a partial government shutdown as a result of H.R. 4378, the Congressional Appropriations Act, 2020 (H.R. 2112), and a later continuing resolution (H.J. Res. 79, \"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020\"). were enacted on December 20, 2019. This report briefly summarizes how the first funding under all of the regular annual appropriations acts was provided by the enactment of H.J. Res. 79 and the enactment of P.L. 116-59.\nThe FY2020 continuing appropriations legislative vehicle (H.R. 4378) for the Department of Health and Human Services...\nSummary: On September 18, 2019, H.R. 4378 was introduced in the House by the Chair of the Appropriations Committee to provide continuing appropriations through November 21, 2019 (Division A). The following day, H.R. 4378 was the first bill for Congress's consideration following the passage of the State/Foreign Operations appropriations act (Division K of the continuing resolution), with the President having signed the Act on September 27, 2019 (the \"Government Funding Bill\"). After H.R. 4378 was enacted on September 27, 2019, the enactment of further regular appropriations acts by October 1, 2019 that were also enacted under a CR, including Division J of the Government Funding Bill enacted on October 1, 2019 (Congress's first full day back at work), would have resulted in the Government Funding Bill expiring on October 27, 2019. Section 101 of H.R. 4378 (Division A)", "According to recent interviews compiled by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and made public (December 9, 2019) through the Washington Post , three overarching U.S. policies in Afghanistan\u2014protecting Afghan civilians, training and advising Afghan security services, and defeating insurgents through the combined efforts of Afghan and U.S. forces\u2014often were poorly planned, resourced, and executed. The GAO notes that while policymakers recognized that there was a correlation between protecting Afghan civilians and defeating insurgents, there was limited focus on \"directly and intentionally\" addressing that correlation during policy planning. The U.S.-led \"Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan\" (CSTC-A), charged with training and developing Afghan security forces, was generally unable to produce the trained Afghan security forces needed to implement U.S. policies in Afghanistan, the GAO found. This report summarizes the key findings, drawn from the Lessons Learned interviews, and analyzes the implications for U.S. policy. Policy Implications: As an integral part of its Lessons Learned effort, SIGAR identified the policies developed by the United States and its coalition partners in Afghanistan, the actions and inactions taken in their implementation, and their outcomes. With respect to \"protecting Afghan civilians,\" SIGAR notes that there is no clear indication in the documents that policymakers intended U.S. forces to be involved in protecting local Afghan civilians. This policy \"lacked an operational strategy\u2026 [that] would allow U.S. forces to conduct meaningful protective actions,\" SIGAR states. Additionally, there was no unified command structure for civilian protection nor was there a means to disseminate information and guidance to those on the ground. With respect to the \"training and advising\" policy in Afghanistan, it is well documented that there were no plans or structure to coordinate security forces or to develop a sustainable Afghan national force. SIGAR does reference \"high-level concerns about the lack of sustainment funding for the Afghan security forces\u2026,\" acknowledging that \"[a]s the United States and its allies transitioned Afghan military and police forces to local control, the United States, European Union, and others did not adequately prepare for the substantial shortfall between coalition military funding for Afghan security forces and the need for the Afghans to have internal sources of funding to sustain and operate the forces over the longer term.\" According to SIGAR, there was no unified civil-military coordination body or mechanism to advise, assist, or otherwise shape the conduct of the training and advising program. While U.S. commanders in the field may have seen the limitations of the CSTC-A's authority, it is unclear from the documents collected in these interviews that the training and advising program was re-evaluated on the basis of these assessments to ensure effective combat forces were developed. With respect to \"defeating insurgents,\" it is noted that the Afghanistan Papers reveal a limited assessment of the correlation between protection and defeat of insurgents. There was little focus on civilian protection in the formulation of policies to combat insurgents. While U.S. forces may have acted to protect Afghan civilians, such efforts were not directed and were not an essential part of the U.S. strategy to defeat insurgents. In a similar vein, the U.S. military presence was limited to special operations forces and train and advise teams; these forces were incapable without local Afghan support to \"storm and seize\" physical locations occupied by insurgents, who generally controlled rural areas of the country. With respect to efforts to build up the national security forces, which SIGAR claims was the fundamental strategy for defeating insurgents, there is no evidence in the documents available through the Afghanistan Papers that U.S. policymakers made it a priority to focus on building an internal national security force (as opposed to external security forces). In summary, the Afghanistan Papers illustrate that while U.S. policymakers recognized the links between protecting civilians and defeating insurgents (and understood that their efforts to do the latter were not likely to succeed without the former) in the years from 2009 through 2014, the policies that were instituted were not directed toward addressing the correlation between protecting civilians and defeating insurgents nor do they present evidence that there were any plans to focus on addressing this relationship. These findings have obvious implications for U.S. policy.

There are five main components to the BCA. First is the authorization for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to increase the debt limit in three tranches, two in 2011 and one in 2012. Second, the BCA included an authorization for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop legislation to reduce the deficit. Third, the BCA included the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ). The fourth and most recent component was included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 . Fifth, a separate process established through the BCA provides for reductions to discretionary spending caps, in conjunction with across-the-board reductions in mandatory spending. The process is not currently in effect. Two of the BCA's components have been amended, and all five have been modified through legislative action.", "TEXT: The civil service retirement system and the federal employees retirement system. These two pension systems have a long history. Pension programs are an important form of employment compensation--they are essential for recruiting and retaining a well-educated, high-quality workforce. In the public sector in which employment is not based on market forces, there is also the question of providing compensation in a manner that is not perceived to be arbitrary. These two programs are defined benefit plans, but they differ in many aspects. Both are administered by the Office of Personnel Management.\nFull text Pensions for civilian federal employees are provided through two programs, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS was authorized by the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920 (P.L. 66-215) and FERS was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-335 ). Under both CSRS and FERS, employees and their employing agencies make contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF), from which pension benefits are paid to retirees and their surviving dependents. Retirement and disability benefits under FERS are fully funded by employee and employer contributions and interest earned by the bonds in which the contributions are invested. The cost of the retirement and disability benefits earned by employees covered by CSRS, on the other hand, are not fully pre-funded. Prior to 1984, federal employees did not pay Social Security payroll taxes and did not earn Social Security benefits. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ) mandated Social Security coverage for civilian federal employees hired on or after January 1, 1984. This change was made in part because the Social Security system needed additional cash contributions to remain solvent. Congress directed the development of the FERS, with Social Security as the cornerstone. The FERS is composed of three elements: (1) Social Security, (2) the FERS basic retirement annuity, and (3) the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Most permanent federal employees initially hired on or after January 1, 1984, are enrolled in the FERS, as are employees who voluntarily switched from CSRS to FERS during \"open seasons\" held in 1987 and 1998. Retirement plans are classified as either defined benefit (DB) plans or defined contribution (DC) plans. In a DB plan, the employer promises to pay some defined share of each participant's income in retirement. A DB pension has the following features: a certain benefit is determined by a formula based on such factors as length of service, salary level, and age; the amount of pension benefit earned is independent of the level of contributions; and benefits are presumed to be vested after a specific length of employment. In a DC plan, retirement benefits are not specified or guaranteed at the time an employee is hired, but are based on employee contributions and interest earned on those contributions. A DC plan has the following features: the amount of pension benefit earned is dependent upon the level of contributions; the level of pension benefits is not clearly identified at the start of employment; and benefits are not vested until the employee reaches some prescribed length of service. An important difference between DB and DC plans is that in a DB plan, the employee bears no financial risk, but in a DC plan, the employee bears most of the financial risk for the amount of retirement benefits. In a DB plan, the employer is at risk for providing defined benefits, while in a DC plan, the employer has no financial responsibility for pension benefits. In summary: DB plans are less expensive for the government and provide a greater degree of financial security for participants. DC plans are less expensive for workers and provide less financial security. Since 1984, federal employees have been offered both DB and DC options and have been able to choose either for their own account. Since 1998, employees who did not previously participate in Social Security, have been allowed to transfer to Social Security coverage from the FERS. TEXT: FERRIER PHILIP K. MALUBA, PH.D. FEBRUARY 28, 2007 CRS-2 Summary: For federal retirees, CSRS is a DB pension plan that provides a non-reduced pension benefit and Social Security coverage in addition to non-Social", "As the fifth-largest country and the ninth-largest economy in the world, Brazil plays an important role in global governance (see Figure 1 for a map of Brazil). Over the past 20 years, Brazil has forged coalitions with other large, developing countries to push for changes to multilateral institutions and to ensure that global agreements on issues ranging from trade to climate change adequately protect their interests. Brazil also has taken on a greater role in promoting peace and stability, contributing to UN peacekeeping missions and mediating conflicts in South America and further afield. Although recent domestic challenges have led Brazil to turn inward and weakened its appeal globally, the country continues to exert considerable influence on international policy issues that affect the United States. U.S. policymakers have often viewed Brazil as a natural partner in regional and global affairs, given its status as a fellow multicultural democracy. Repeated efforts to forge a close partnership have left both the United States and Brazil with unmet expectations once again. The 116th Congress has expressed renewed interest in Brazil, recognizing Brazil's potential to affect U.S.-Brazilian relations as it carries out its oversight responsibilities and considers FY2021 appropriations and other legislative initiatives. Brazil declared independence from Portugal in 1822, initially establishing a constitutional monarchy and retaining a slave-based, plantation economy. Although the country abolished slavery in 1888 and became a republic in 1889, economic and political power remained concentrated in the hands of large rural landowners. The authoritarian government of Get\u00c3\u00balio Vargas (1930-1945) began the incorporation of the working classes but struggled with political and economic instability, which ultimately led the military to seize power. A 1964 military coup, encouraged and welcomed by the United States, ushered in two decades of authoritarian rule. Although repressive, the military government was not as brutal as the dictatorships established in several other South American nations. It nominally allowed the judiciary and congress to function during its tenure but did not tolerate political dissent or criticism of the government. Brazil restored civilian rule in 1985, and a national constituent assembly, elected in 1986, promulgated a new constitution in 1988. The constitution established a liberal democracy and expanded democratic rights. Subsequent elections for national and subnational offices returned the incumbent political leaders and their allies, and there were concerns that the system would not allow for meaningful political change. President Fernando Collor de Mello, elected in October 1989, faced impeachment proceedings in July 1992, on charges of financial impropriety, corruption, and failure to execute the duties of his office. As Collor was suspended and preparations were made for his trial in the Senate, Vice President Itamar Franco assumed the country's presidency on August 2, 1992, and the impeachment process was halted. Although impeachment proceedings were resumed in January 1994 under President Franco's successor, President C 20200325 29 of 104 12/2/2010 1:56 PM STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT IN BRAZIL 23  , the decision to go ahead with the process was considered a major setback for the growing but still fragile democratic system. After two additional impeachments resulted in the expulsion of Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Dilma Rousseff, as well as significant deterioration of the country's democratic institutions, Brazil held general elections on October 7, 2018. Former federal cabinet member Jair Bolsonaro became the 38 th president of Brazil, defeating Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad in the second round. Bolsonaro's anti-corruption and business-friendly platform was popular among voters seeking a change in leadership after corruption scandals engulfed almost all major political parties. Despite winning the most votes for any president in Brazilian history and a clear electoral mandate, Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric indicated he would govern with a more authoritarian mindset. For example, Bolsonaro had pledged that, if elected, his government would open up a wide swath of territory for the mining industry", "1. In FY2019, an estimated 20 million veterans were living  in the United States, of which 10+ million were enrolled in care through the Department of Veterans  Affairs. 2. Chapter 17 of Title 38, U.S.C., requires the VA to provide health care services to eligible veterans through the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) of the VA, which is one of the largest integrated health care systems in the United  States. VA care is not a health insurance program; it is primarily a direct provider of care.  Meeting veterans' demand for care has been challenging for the VA.  Some veteran patients who seek health care services from the VHA experience barriers to receiving in-person care; for example, by being unable to schedule VA medical appointments in a timely mann  er or having to travel long distances to reach health care facilities. In conjunction with the Veterans Choice  Program (VCP),2 the recently enacted VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated O  utside Network (VA MISSION) Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-182) and other measures that aim to expand veterans' access  to care, VA has attempted to address barriers to in-person care by using telehealth in VA health care facilities. 3. VA defines telehealth as \"the use of health informatics and telecommunications technologies to extend access to health care.  These technologies support long distance clinical health care, provider consultation and patient self-management.\"  In 2014, VA first defined telehealth as \"the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long distance clinical health care, provider consultation, and patient self-management, and to facilitate collaboration  within and outside of healthcare facilities.\"4 4. Although telehealth generally supplements in-person care, it does not replace VA in-person care. An app refers to a software program that runs on certain operating systems.", "Prepared by William McCandless, Specialist in Education Policy. INTRODUCTION BOP operates 122 prisons and an additional 29 Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs) (see Table 1). According to BOP data, as of March 2019, about 184,000 prisoners were in BOP facilities, 670 prisoners in state and local facilities, and 285 prisoners in RRCs. According to BOP data, as of March 2019, there are about 64,000 BOP employees, of which ~1,000 are at RRCs. There are approximately 1,700 USMS officers, 970 of which are stationed outside facilities. BOP is responsible for the custody and care of these prisoners. As such, BOP works with USMS to determine whether to file a request with the U.S. District Court to order a prisoner's detention. If granted, the prisoner is placed in the custody of USMS in a facility generally located in the district where he is scheduled to stand trial. The prisoner remains in USMS custody for the duration of his detention. BOP and USMS share responsibility for housing, food, and medical services for the prisoner, and for housing and services for his family members. USMS is responsible for transporting USMS prisoners in a facility in the same district to their court appearances. USMS is also responsible for transporting USMS prisoners in custody in an institution or facility outside the district to their court appearances. If a prisoner is not in one of BOP's facilities, he is still in BOP custody. In response to the threats of Hurricane Harvey in August of 2017, BOP contracted a private entity to house and care for about a third of the 20,000 offenders that were evacuated. The contractor was not authorized to house federal prisoners under sentence because the district courts in which most prisoners were residing did not have jurisdiction to move them out of the affected area. Once the storm passed, BOP returned prisoners to their respective facilities. It is unclear whether the federal courts had the authority at the time, or whether such court orders would have been permissible, to order federal prisoners placed in state or private sector facilities outside their home districts. In some emergencies, like the hurricanes impacting Puerto Rico and Florida in September-October 2017, BOP contracts with a private entity to house, feed, and provide security for prisoners (although, BOP notes that it is in the process of reestablishing the housing of prisoners in the Puerto Rico area). When BOP deems prisons to be at high risk to a natural or manmade disaster, it temporarily houses federal prisoners in private or state and local institutions. During the emergencies, BOP contracts with USMS to provide transport services to and from the prison, and it contracts with private agencies to provide medical services to the prisoners housed in non-BOP facilities. BOP has the discretion to move prisoners to another facility to ensure they remain secure. BOP may also move prisoners to an institution operated by a contract operator, or a non-BOP institution. Pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act, federal prisoners housed in a private or state or local facility are not subject to the statutory labor protections codified in U.S. Code Title 41. Federal employees are not subject to protection under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act. Prisoners are not part of the Executive Schedule civil service system or the General Schedule civil service system. The Attorney General is authorized to move the prisoners for security-related purposes (including natural disasters) and for good time credit purposes. In most instances, the Attorney General is required to consult with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management regarding any such change. There is also a statutory provision that permits the Attorney General to remove prisoners to a prison operated by a contract operator. BOP is currently authorized to remove a prisoner to a facility operated by a federal contract operator, and the contract operator is authorized to operate a prison facility. The director of BOP is also authorized to move prisoner to a facility in another federal correctional facility operated by a federal contract operator. This provision allows BOP to move prisoners across state lines. At the time of publishing this report, BOP has moved prisoners to private prisons and to state and local correctional facilities. Since 2001, BOP has operated a contracted prison that houses federal prisoners:", "Provides for a new grant program which would permit schools to apply for up to 80% of the cost of school renovations and repairs. Authorizes funds for school construction and infrastructure improvements.\nTitle V\u00e2\u0080\u0093A of the ESEA ( Title I\u00e2\u0080\u0093A ) authorizes competitive grants, commonly known as the Impact Aid Construction Grants Program, for certain school districts and Indian tribes. Under the ESEA, 20%, of state, local, and federal appropriations could be used for construction or renovations for certain rural schools. More recently, the IDEA authorizes funds to construct or modify special education facilities and facilities that are needed to meet the unique needs of students with disabilities. Additionally, Title III\u00e2\u0080\u0093A of the ESEA provides grants for school construction and renovation to certain small rural school districts with high poverty levels.\nThe most significant direct federal funding source for school construction and maintenance has been the Public School Facilities Initiative ( PSFI ), which began with the Economic Stimulus Act ( ESA, P.L.\n110-1 ); however, the PSFI is no longer funded as of FY2014.\nThe Public School Facilities Initiative was funded in two appropriations acts.\nAn additional $58,712,000 was appropriated for the Economic Stimulus Act (ESA, P.L.\n110-1). A total of $2,088,633,000 was provided for the PSFI by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). The PSFI expired on September 30, 2009.", "The Economic Growth Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n10% rate; this is the only change from prior law. An increase in income subject to the top 12% rate was provided by indexing the thresholds to inflation. Pursuant to the 2018 tax reform, an additional 12% rate was imposed on income between the thresholds and $418, 500 ($518, 000 for unmarried individuals). The standard deduction was increased by $12, 180 per filer, to $12, 000 for single taxpayers and $24, 000 for married-joint filers. Inflation indexing was reinstated to the standard deductions and income thresholds for all filers except for single filers over 65. Several individual income tax deductions were eliminated or made more limited, including those for mortgage interest, most of the itemized deductions, other miscellaneous expenses, and state and local taxes. The child tax credit was increased substantially, and the new \"family\" credit is available to all filers with children. Tax brackets were reduced to four levels, and were recalculated to account for the doubling of the exemption. Taxpayers claimed the \"personal exemption\" of $4, 150 per filer (a reduction from $4, 050). These changes reduced tax liabilities for middle-income and upper-middle income taxpayers. The corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. The deferral of corporate income taxes on foreign sources was reduced to 15.5% from their full 35% tax rate. The deferrals were made available to domestic corporations as well, and the deferred amount is 80% foreign and 20% domestic. As a result, over 75% of the new corporate tax revenues are attributable to foreign income. In response to the corporate tax changes, dividends paid to U. S. corporations by foreign subsidiaries are subject to a tax at the parent's tax rate, which can range from 21-37%. In addition, a 10% tax is imposed on certain net-interest income related to U. S. investments in foreign corporations (i.e., interest income is subject to a U. S. tax when foreign subsidiaries are paid interest from U. S. corporations).\n15% bracket; the additional 3% surtax was on incomes over $250,703. The standard deduction used in computing the liability was significantly reduced at all income levels. The tax rate was increased two marginal rates at selected income levels. Marginally taxed income at upper levels was subject to special treatment.\n20% rate; one taxpayer paid at a 10% or 12% rates. For married joint filers, the effective rates were lower, since the 16.5% rate was applicable for the 2007 surtax level of $148,800 for married taxpayers ($74,350 for single filers), with a 25% marginal rate on higher income. For both single and married-two income earner filers, a separate 25% marginal rate applied to income over $155, 867. For single filers, there was a 28 percent rate applied to a separate income tax bracket, and separate marginal rates above a rate of $78, 058 on married filers.\n5% rate; one tax payer paid at a 38.5% rate. A third tax payer, in the 1933 tax increase, paid at 15% rates on low incomes, 60.68% on middle incomes, and 77% on the highest incomes. For married and unmarried taxpayers, the lowest individual income amounts for 1933 were $3, 000 and $2, 500, respectively.\n535, and the high-income rate was 77%. For the last year of the war, 1945, there were seven rates, ranging from 1.7% to 31.17%. A 22.4% surtax (6% for 1922 and 1932) was imposed, and a 23.18% excess-profits tax rate was imposed. The progressive", "The Bureau of Land Manage", "The federal government is considering legislation that would allocate funding for public infrastructure to spur the economy. Congress considered three federal investments in infrastructure as part of its response to the recession of 2007-2009, one of which was the ARRA of 2009. To determine if the economic benefits of infrastructure spending from ARRA are greater than its costs to the federal government, CBO considers the long-term costs and benefits of a public investment. Some argue the benefits of such investments accrue over time while the costs occur all at once. But CBO recognizes that the costs of a public investment are not the same for all individuals. The federal government's marginal cost for providing additional infrastructure, or subsidizing an investment, is the opportunity cost of a tax reduction that could have been made instead. For different policy scenarios and investments, this marginal cost and the economic activity that it is meant to stimulate varies among individuals. CBO thus employs an approach to valuing infrastructure that recognizes differences in marginal costs to individuals across the range of the population and the range of investments. Such a valuing is the economic equivalent of asking how much an individual would be willing to pay to have a certain amount of the infrastructure funding allocated from an optimal mix of funding alternatives. Marginal tax rates provide the mechanism for determining the benefit of such funding because the expected benefit from such funding is the forgone tax revenue had the funding been allocated differently. Using the framework laid out in this report, CBO has found the expected benefits of $787 billion of infrastructure investment are approximately two-thirds of the cost of this investment in 2018, assuming a continuation of the current tax structure, and increases to a little over one-half of these costs in 2025 as the marginal tax rate falls. CBO has also analyzed several scenarios with alternative allocations of funding from infrastructure in order to determine the effect on the expected benefits. Under many scenarios considered, the expected benefits are no greater than for a single allocation of $787 billion of infrastructure investment. This result suggests that the economic benefit from infrastructure depends more on the mix of investments than the overall amount of investment. CBO is currently analyzing the allocations contained in the proposed infrastructure legislation in the 115th Congress to determine if this would result in greater expected benefits from the infrastructure investment than an allocation of $787 billion spread over the years 2009-2019. It is important to remember that public investments are often intended to have a positive net effect on the economy, or on average. But it is also possible that the federal government's marginal costs of providing infrastructure may exceed the total benefits of the spending. CBO has found evidence that the marginal cost of federal funding for ARRA exceeds the benefit from that funding among the 75% of American households with the lowest incomes; CBO has further found that the marginal cost of federal funding for ARRA exceeds the benefit from that funding among the 75% of American households with incomes between the 30th and 90th percentiles. This evidence suggests that the aggregate net benefit from ARRA among the households with the highest incomes is smaller than that from ARRA among households with incomes at or below the 30th percentile.\nMORGAN, J. 2008.

In total, agencies and programs under Title IX in the FSGG appropriations bill receive $903 million in FY2019 discretionary funding. The primary mandate for agencies under Title IX is the CFPB, which was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203, the Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010. The primary mandate for programs under Title IX is the FDIC, which carries out activities provided for in the FDICIA of 1991 (P.L. 102-242, the FDICIA), including the provision of federal deposit insurance to member institutions of the FDIC. In addition to the CFPB and FDIC, other programs under Title IX are managed by non-department entities. Funding for Title IX agencies and programs for FY2019 has been provided as part of Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) appropriations. Some programs under Title IX have been funded outside of the annual appropriations process. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), for instance, is funded by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550, the Housing Enterprises Act). The NCUA has also had its funding provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Funding for the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, which is funded through the National Credit Union Administration Fund, is provided as part of the FSGG appropriations bill, but the NCUA is funded through the credit union industry funding mechanism and is not technically considered part of the FSGG appropriations bill. The FSGG bill provides funding for agencies and programs under Title IX in the following program areas: CFPB, which has the full funding level of $264 million; FDIC, which has the full funding level of $84 million for depositor insurance and a cut in spending of $685,000 for resolution of failed institutions; the FHA, which has the full funding level of $129 billion for mortgage insurance and program management and a cut of $4.8 million for the General Fund; Fannie Mae, which has the full funding level of $135 million; Freddie Mac, which has the full funding level of $48 million; the NCUA, which has the full funding level of $157 million; and the FHFA, which has the full funding level of $129 million for the Federal National Insurance Trust Fund and a cut of $107,000 for the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).

The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-123 ) authorized $10 billion in Supplemental Loans for COVID-19 Response (SL) for the SBA to provide up to $9 million in business loans. The PPP and the SL programs required the PMAC to develop implementation guidance, which the PMAC has done by providing updates to the SBA's standard loan applications, and it also published guidance for the EIDL program in the Federal Register. The PMAC has indicated that it will review additional PBSAs to determine if they qualify for PPP loans or SL loans. The PMAC has stated that it anticipates that nearly 52,000 businesses across the United States will access COVID-19-related loans and grants.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( P.L. 116-136 ) provided an additional $20 million to small business loans (PPP) and authorized nearly $10 billion in grant assistance (SL). The COVID-19 Emergency Declaration Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2020 ( P.L. 116-160 ) authorized $4 billion in loans and grants for economic and agricultural impacts from COVID-19. The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) cost of these appropriations is $21 billion (including subsidy costs). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had estimated, before passage of these acts, that the PPP program would cost $199 million for its first three years, while the PMAC had estimated that its first-year PPP-related loan expenditures would be between $200 million and $220 million. The PMAC estimated an outlay (spending) authority of not more than $330 million to be disbursed through the first four weeks of March.  The PMAC reported that the SBA had approved more than $3.2 billion in Disaster Loans and nearly $62 million in EIDL Grants to cover losses related to COVID-19 by March 2, 2020, and that it had authorized more than $18 billion in loans and grants since February 9, 2020. Small employers in industries hardest hit by COVID-19 have had difficulties accessing credit and have expressed concerns about the potential cost of complying with the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act ( P.L. 116-227 ), which requires employers with more than 20 workers to adopt pandemic prevention practices. The PMAC has indicated it is reviewing PBSAs for small businesses to determine if they qualify for PPP loans or SL loans. The Federal Reserve indicated that COVID-19 might have depleted the net-worth of small and mid-sized companies as they pay off loans but face declining earnings in a slowing economy.", "Iran Sanctions Iran first signed the Geneva Convention, which outlines standards for the treatment of captured soldiers and the exchange of prisoners, in 1872. Iranian oil production began with the Abadan Refinery Complex in 1909. Prior to 1970, Iran's oil industry was primarily controlled by British companies under agreements that gave Iranian oil to other countries. In 1930 Iran made royalty rate increases and other terms less profitable for the British, and British interests began divesting of its Iranian assets. In 1951, Iran's National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was created, which allowed Iran to assume full control of its oil industry. As more exploration occurred, the country's reserves began to grow, peaking in the 1970s. In the fall of 1978, during the final days of the overthrown Shah, militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took members of the embassy staff hostage. The country became less stable following the Islamic Revolution (Jan 1979-Mar 1979) and took a turn toward extreme isolationism following the Iranian hostage crisis (Nov 1979-Jan 1981). Following the overthrow of the Shah, Iran experienced an eight-year war with Iraq before becoming one of the founding members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960. Since the Iranian Revolution, Iran has struggled with political unrest, ethnic tensions between its Sunni and Shia populations, and ongoing issues with its nuclear energy program. The United States government has maintained sanctions on Iran based on its nuclear energy program, which Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly declared Iran is not seeking nuclear capabilities. Iran's involvement in Lebanon with Hezbollah and Syria with Bashar al-Assad has raised further concerns as Iranian involvement has been seen as supporting the perpetuation of conflict. Sanctions on Iran have been in place since 1979, and as of 2018 are one of the most extensive sanctions programs in the world. The impact of sanctions on the average Iranian citizen is unclear. In the summer of 2015, Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal, a multinational non-binding agreement intended to prevent Iran from pursuing a nuclear device; it provides the basis for a lifting of key U.S. and multilateral economic and financial sanctions imposed on Iran's oil and other industries. Since the signing of the JCPOA, Iran has slowly increased production levels, but has not yet returned to pre-sanction levels of output. Despite these increases, in March 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump formally ended U.S. compliance with the JCPOA as set forth in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. As a result, all U.S. economic, commercial, financial, industrial, and technological sanctions related to Iran's energy sector (including restrictions on trade in services and investment, which previously were not subject to sanction) became effective again. Despite the efforts of the governments of Iran and France in January 2017 to begin a French energy corporation, Total, and China's Petrochina (part of Sinopec) to begin joint oil and gas developments in Phase 11 of Iran's South Pars natural gas field, in August 2018 Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, stated he could no longer allow foreign companies to control Iran's oil industry, asserting that \"Iranian oil, gas, and petrochemical industries have always been and will remain under complete national control.\" Rouhani described this move as a \"reciprocal action\" in response to the U.S.", "Consumer financial products referes to all financial products and services available to households, including credit, deposit, and payment products and services. The markets for these products are regulated under federal consumer financial protection law, administered by the newly formed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). To analyze the consumer financial market, this report examined regulations and rules in the CFPB and other regulatory agencies to study the consumer market from the consumer perspective. The results show that the cost of credit of consumer products is relatively expensive and the consumer financial market is relatively uncompetitive as seen from the consumer's perspective. The CFPB was established within the Federal Reserve which is under the Banking regulatory authority. In addition, since consumers can pay down debt or save, the cost of funds to households can be relatively low when the household is in financially stable condition. Therefore, the main issue in the marketing of consumer financial products stems from two factors. First, the price of credit is relatively high as seen from the consumer's perspective, since credit is typically expensive and households have little bargaining power in their credit markets. The second factor is that consumers tend to have limited information about the cost of credit and often have difficulty in understanding the terms in the CFPB regulations regarding the use of consumer credit. Therefore, the first issue that the market regulators must solve is to find ways to reduce the price of credit, and the second is to increase consumer understanding and awareness of the credit market. Both of these issues require market research and regulation which requires time and cost to implement in the market. If the CFPB is able to quickly reduce the uncertainty in the consumer credit market and reduce the price of credit to consumers, then CFPB regulation can be viewed as efficient and successful in the market. On the other hand, if the CFPB regulation causes a high cost for financial markets, and fails to effectively regulate the market or fails to effectively reduce the cost of credit for consumer credit, then CFPB regulation will be viewed as a market failure as the cost for consumers and the risk for financial markets increases.", "The task is simple, we are going to write an essay on current events concerning the federal court system.

As such, estimates of net illicit drug production depend on the most recent reliable source information. U.S. border officials seize or intercept drugs that move through different transportation paths along the supply chain on their way to the United States. The illicit supply chain for plant-based drugs includes a host of transportation paths that vary largely by the drug and its pathway to end-use consumers. Plant-based illicit drugs generally enter the United States through land ports of entry and are then routed through the formal distribution system for eventual consumption. In other cases, land-based methods of drug transportation may be used to deliver the drugs directly to end-use consumers in the United States. For example, the illicit supply chain for cocaine primarily consists of the Andean corridor followed by long-haul transportation via aircraft and water vessels, and may include a variety of other transportation methods that rely on the specific market and market actors. Drug smuggling into the United States is facilitated by the involvement of drug cartels and other criminal groups, but also increasingly includes networks made up of drug traffickers/mules, organized crime group members, transnational gangs, and/or other international actors. Drug smuggling can include the physical movement of drugs from one country to another but also involves other activities that fall under the umbrella of trafficking. These other activities include facilitating or attempting to facilitate the trafficking in any substance, substance included in one of the schedules of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, drug-manufacturing supplies/equipment, and paraphernalia. Border officials seize or intercept drugs moving through the various transit points to the United States by land, air, and sea including those drugs that are intended for eventual exportation from the United States to other destinations. In general, illicit drug seizure data help to illustrate the scope and nature of the illicit drug supply chain; however, they do not fully convey the scope and breadth of the illicit drug flow. Data limitations prevent the systematic and complete identification of smuggling patterns, the exact amount smuggled, and the specific 6", "The Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, nearly a decade after the end of the Kosovo War.

According to the U.S. State Department, areas of close bilateral co-operation with Poland include \"NATO capabilities, counterterrorism, nonproliferation, missile defense, human rights, economic growth and innovation, energy security, and regional co-operation in Central and Eastern Europe\". The Congressional Caucus on Poland is a bipartisan group of Members of Congress who seek to maintain and strengthen the U.S.-Poland relationship and engage in issues of mutual interest to both countries. Of the Central European and Baltic countries that have joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), Poland is by far the most populous, has the largest economy, and is the most significant military actor. In 1999, with strong backing from the United States, Poland was among the first group of post-communist countries to join NATO. In 2004, again with strong support from the United States, it was among a group of eight post-communist countries to join EU. Many analysts assert that Poland, more than many other European countries, continues to look to the United States for foreign policy leadership. Recently, developments related to Russia's resurgence and the attendant implications for U.S. policy and NATO are likely to have continuing relevance for Congress. The government of Poland is led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party. Law and Justice won the October 2015 election with 37.6% of the vote, giving the party 235 of the 460 seats in the Sejm (lower house of parliament). This was the first time since the end of communist rule in 1989 that a single party secured an absolute majority in parliament. Law and Justice gained momentum five months prior to the election with the party-backed Law and Justice candidate Andrzej Duda winning the presidential election. Despite holding no formal post in the government, many observers assert that Duda remains the most powerful politician in Poland who, as party chairman, exercises considerable influence behind the scenes. Jaros\u00c5\u0084aw Kaczy\u00c5\u0084ski co-founded Law and Justice with his twin brother in 2001. Jaros\u00c5\u0084aw Kaczy\u00c5\u0084ski was the president of Poland from 2005 to 2010, when he died in an airplane crash in Russia that also claimed 95 other lives, including many high-ranking Polish officials.", "of the UK. As such, the Good Friday Agreement provided a framework for the UK and nationalist political parties (mainly the Irish Republican Army-aligned Sinn Fein) to work together against the unionists (most prominently the Democratic Unionist Party) to pursue peace and reconciliation. To ensure that Northern Ireland's people would have consent on Northern Ireland's future status, the parties agreed to new elections to a power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly and the holding of a referendum on Northern Ireland's status, with the UK and Irish governments pledging to support the constitutional preference of the majority in Northern Ireland and Ireland as expressed in each stage of that process. In addition, the Good Friday Agreement provided for extensive, interlocking measures to enhance political participation; it also called for an international monitoring committee, the Independent Monitoring Commission, to assess the behavior of the two largest militant groups in Northern Ireland \u00e2\u0080\u0094the Irish Republican Army-aligned Sinn Fein/Irish Republican Army and the unionist-allied Ulster Defense Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters \u00e2\u0080\u0094in ensuring compliance with peace accords. With the creation of the IRA in 1922, the Northern Ireland conflict took the form of a paramilitary conflict between nationalists and unionists. The nationalists, also called republicans, maintained a commitment to an independent united Ireland created by force and believed that political force, or arms, was the most significant and effective means available to them to win an independent united Ireland. Unionist politicians and military leaders argued that the only option for Northern Ireland was to remain part of the United Kingdom. With the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland's nationalist political parties committed to exclusively nonviolent and peaceful means to work constructively for the achievement of their objectives. The IRA and the unionists' loyalists ceased their armed activity and have remained committed in a nonviolent manner to the peace process.\n1", "Motor vehicle electrification has emerged in the past decade as a potentially viable alternative to internal combustion engines. Although only a small proportion of the current motor vehicle fleet is electrified, interest in passenger vehicle electrification has accelerated in several major industrial countries, including the United States, parts of Europe, and China. Despite advances in technology, electric vehicles (EVs) continue to be significantly more expensive than similarly sized vehicles with internal combustion engines. For this reason, governments in many countries have adopted policies to support development and sales of electric vehicles. This report discusses federal and state government policies in the United States to support electrification of light vehicles and transit buses, as well as proposals to reduce or eliminate such support. More than 92 million light vehicles -&gt; passenger cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs -- were sold worldwide in 2018. The three largest markets were China (27 million vehicles sold), Europe (20 million), and the United States (17 million). Most of these vehicles are powered by internal combustion engines. The global market for electrified vehicles is small but growing: In 2018, more than 2 million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles were sold worldwide, a 64% increase over 2017. These account for about 2% of all passenger vehicle sales, both worldwide and in the United States. Demand for electric vehicles is expected to continue to grow, as some countries have called for a complete shift away from sales of new fossil-fuel vehicles by 2030. The market for urban transit buses is smaller than the passenger car and SUV markets, but electric vehicles make up a larger part of its footprint. China leads in this category, with 106,000 electric buses put in service in 2017, bringing the total to 170,000. In the European Union (EU) and the United States, two types of plug-in hybrid vehicles are now in use: plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) use an electric motor and an internal combustion engine for power, and they use electricity from an external source to recharge the batteries. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) use only batteries to power the motor and use electricity from an external source for recharging. In this report, electric vehicles refer to these two types of plug-in vehicles, unless otherwise noted. Electrification of vehicles has been limited by three factors: (1) the high cost of producing the lithium ion batteries (currently the preferred battery chemistry) that propel them; (2) their limited range; and (3) vehicle&gt; charging time and location. Not all automakers offer electric vehicles for sale: 42 different models were sold in 2018, with Tesla and Toyota recording the largest number of vehicle sales. Sales of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles in 2018 rose by over 80% from the previous year, bringing the total sales of plug-in vehicles since 2010 to just over 1 million.\n\n1447406\n\nComment\n\nTESLA has been making an impact in the eMobility area because it has succeeded in making battery technology affordable.

In addition to creating a reserve of crude oil stocks, the statute also created a program to purchase petroleum products during times of disruption, or when oil prices exceed certain thresholds.", "The windfall elimination provision (WEP) reduces Social Security benefits for retirees and disabled individuals who receive a pension based on noncovered earnings. Current law requires that pensions not be taken into account in calculating a beneficiary's Social Security benefit. This paper shows that eliminating the rule that the pension should not be taken into account in calculating a beneficiary's Social Security benefit would result in windfalls for some of these workers. However, the extent of these windfalls will depend on when individuals receive Social Security benefits and the total level of noncovered earnings. Also discussed is Social Security's current method for providing a benefit adjustment for noncovered earnings. Current law results in many workers receiving benefits that are too low or that produce high replacement rates that do not reflect the actual retirement benefit that they would receive if their entire careers were Social Security-covered.\nIn this section, I explain how to determine whether a worker benefited more as a result of noncovered earnings or as a result of the interaction of noncovered earnings with Social Security; in other words, I provide an explanation of the impact of the windfall elimination provision (WEP) on the Social Security benefit. To begin with, I show how Social Security adjusts a beneficiary's retirement or disability benefit in order to eliminate such a windfall. The WEP generally applies when a worker (1) had substantial earnings in noncovered employment, (2) receives a Social Security benefit, (3) has an employment record for any quarter of taxable earnings during those 35 taxable years when he or she was younger than 62, and (4) is entitled to a pension based on noncovered employment. The WEP then applies the appropriate proportion of Social Security-covered earnings to a specified calculation period (usually five years).\nMy earlier report used the 2001 Social Security benefits as a base in order to simplify the calculations for the following scenarios. However, the calculations for 2001 benefits provided an incorrect measure of a worker's actual benefit because it did not incorporate Social Security COLA adjustments. The data presented in the report use Social Security data from year 2006. It is possible to calculate the  benefit adjustment  for a worker receiving Social Security benefits  in , 2006. I begin with the 2006 benefits calculated in section 1.5 and proceed in steps (based on the 2006 data) to arrive at a 2001-benefit level. I first calculate the benefit adjustment for these workers under the current law WEP, then examine what would have been their Social Security benefit had their 2001 pension not been reduced for Social Security pension offsets. I then determine the benefit adjustment needed to return them to the level of benefit adjustment that they would have been entitled to  in 2001.\nUnder the current WEP formula Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 of pension; therefore, workers with a pension of $500 per month would receive a Social Security benefit of only $150 per month. However, it is impossible to actually determine a worker's benefit reduction until we know the timing of his or her employment and what level of earnings or service he or she will have during the 40 quarters leading up to age 62.\nGiven that information, it is also possible to estimate the benefit reduction for workers who were receiving Social Security benefits in 2006 under the current WEP formula. In contrast, it is not possible to determine what would have been a person's Social Security benefit level in 2001 had their pension not been reduced for pension offsets. I have, however, examined the 2006 data to determine the 2001-benefit level for these workers. Under this assumption, as we move back in time to earlier benefit levels, 2001-benefit levels are obtained by increasing the 2006 benefits based on the Social Security COLA adjustments and adjusting for payouts for a 27-year period.\nIn addition, the data for 2006 beneficiaries that we obtained from Social Security include the calculation of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) under the current law. It is necessary, in order to compare current Social Security benefit levels to 2001 benefit levels, to account for COLAs that might have been received between 2001 and 2006 by these workers. Therefore, I am required to adjust the current data series by adding COLAs from earnings during the 10-year", "While periodic, omnibus farm bills focus on agricultural and food policy, they' also contain provisions addressing rural community and economic development.

TEXT: The U.S. Constitution establishes a two-step process for the House and Senate to remove federal officials\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the President, Vice President, judges, and other civil officers\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \u00e2\u0080\u009cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under the Constitution, the House alone has the power to formally charge\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, impeach\u00e2\u0080\u0094a federal official. A House majority can accomplish this by adopting articles of impeachment, which are effectively written accusations (similar to an indictment in ordinary criminal proceedings). The Senate alone has the power to try an impeachment and render a verdict regarding whether the individual should be removed from office and possibly barred from holding future office. Two-thirds of Senators voting must agree to convict and remove an official from office. The procedures the House has developed for accomplishing this constitutional responsibility are described below. The House has used this process mostly to impeach federal judges, although the House has also impeached two Presidents and one Cabinet official. The summary of the rules and procedures the House might use to impeach a federal official presented here is drawn from published sources of congressional rules and precedents, as well as the public record of past impeachment proceedings. It relies as well upon in-depth research conducted by Betsy Palmer and Susan Navarro Smelcer, formerly of CRS, on the practice in both chambers with respect to the impeachment of federal judges. This report provides an overview of the procedures and should not be treated or cited as an authority on congressional proceedings. Regardless of what might instigate an impeachment investigation, there are normally three formal stages of congressional action: (1) an impeachment inquiry is authorized, and this is most often accomplished through the adoption of a simple resolution on the House floor; (2) the committee conducts its investigation; and (3) the full House considers the articles of impeachment. A Member can initiate an impeachment inquiry by drafting a simple resolution and placing it in the House hopper, the way all simple resolutions are submitted to the House. The resolution must be adopted by the House before it confers any impeachment power on any committee. It can be offered as privileged matter before 30 calendar days have elapsed from the convening of the Congress in which it was created. Only one such resolution can be considered in a Congress, and the Speaker must schedule it for consideration within two legislative days. (The majority and minority leaders do not need to give notice; if either leader calls up such a resolution on the floor, it is considered immediately.) If adopted, the resolution goes to the Committee on the Judiciary, and that committee must report it out for action within seven legislative days (rather than the usual four calendar days) or the Speaker may appoint a different committee. (The majority and minority leaders do not need to give notice; if either leader calls up such a resolution on the floor, it is considered immediately.) The adoption of the resolution by the House must be supported by a majority of the qualified Members voting (and such a majority must include a majority of the Members from the controlling political party), and no individual Member may cast more than two votes. Once adopted, an impeachment investigation cannot be taken up during any of the first 15 legislative days of the session in which it is begun and can only be conducted through the Committee on the Judiciary (this restriction does not apply to the privileged matter stage). The simple resolution authorizing the impeachment inquiry must be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary within five legislative days either before or after its adoption, although adoption on the floor immediately triggers the referral. If no committee of referral of impeachment is reported or ordered by the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry, an official or office is not subject to impeachment during that Congress. The Committee on the Judiciary may conduct its impeachment inquiry as it does other investigations. The committee adopts a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation on the House floor, by a majority of the qualified Members voting, before a vote to investigate is taken. (The majority and minority leaders do not need to give notice; if either leader gives notice of their intent to conduct such a resolution on the floor, it is considered immediately.) The resolution itself must be ordered immediately after, or during, discussion on the House floor. The rules for impeachment investigations are broad. The Judiciary Committee is authorized to issue subpo", "The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TI) (G) (R) Grant Program is a discretionary program providing grants to projects of national, regional, or metropolitan-area significance in various surface transportation modes on a competitive basis, with recipients selected by the federal Department of Transportation (DOT). It originated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ), where it was called \"national infrastructure investment\" (as it has been in subsequent appropriations acts). Beginning with the FY2018 round of grants, DOT renamed the program the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) program. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in this report are expressed in 2019 dollars to adjust for inflation over the life of the program, and all percentages are calculated on that basis. These figures therefore do not correspond to DOT data, which in general are not adjusted for inflation. During the early 2000s, transportation authorization and appropriations bills included growing numbers of earmarks directing discretionary grants to specific projects. In response to criticism of this practice, in his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama vowed to veto any legislation containing earmarks. In the 2012 surface transportation reauthorization law, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141), Congress reduced opportunities for earmarking by abolishing most of DOT's discretionary grant programs and providing virtually all federal surface transportation funding to recipients through formulas. The TI (R) (G) Grant Program, which has been funded in the annual DOT appropriations acts and was not included in MAP-21, became one of the few remaining discretionary transportation grant programs. The Obama Administration did not support continuing the TI (R) (G) Grant Program after FY2015, although Congress provided annual appropriations for new grants in FY2016 and FY2017. In FY2018, Congress changed the program's name to the BUILD Grant Program. The Trump Administration requested $1.55 billion for the BUILD program for FY2020, and Congress appropriated the amount in the FY2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-1). On June 25, 2019, the Administration announced the FY2020 apportionment (funding amount) of $1.83 billion. It indicated it would issue the BUILD program's notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) in summer 2019, at which time it would describe the criteria for selecting grant awards, likely including a focus on resilience against climate change and natural disasters. The Administration also indicated its priorities for awarding grants at that time. Table 1 provides summary information about the TI (R) (G) Grant Program. Table 2 provides information about the awards made in each year for which the program is funded. The table includes information about the applications, including the amounts requested and received. Table 3 provides information about those applications that were not granted. Table 4 provides information about the projects that are funded and not funded each year. Table 5 provides information about the projects that remain unfunded at the end of the annual grant award cycle. Table 6 provides information about how federal funds are allocated to the Department of Transportation's (DOT) various programs. Although DOT includes TI (R) (G) grants in its surface transportation program because they are competitively awarded, they are not included in DOT's public transportation formula program, which supports urban and rural public transit, because grants funded in FY2020 will be used for capital investments. Some projects in Table 1 in both FY2019 and earlier years were funded for up to five years to implement. A dash ( - ) signifies that the amount was not provided by the Government Accountability Office; an asterisk (*) means the data was not provided. This table, therefore, is missing some data about the program's history.

In many instances, the same hardware devices allow users to access media content. For example, a smartphone that integrates email, phone, digital camera, and video features, is also an electronic device for watching YouTube videos. Technological convergence describes a process when two or more independent technologies with separate capabilities have merged into a new converged technology without sacrificing capabilities from the original technologies.   7  The convergence of technologies is not a new concept. Historians of technology have described that the invention of the telephone, the electromagnet, the telegraph, and the lightbulb enabled a shift in human communication in 1876. These advancements, alongside advancements with the steam engine, eventually led to more streamlined means of production, distribution, and consumption.1 However, the rapid evolution of technology in recent decades has led to an increase of convergence-based technological innovations, resulting in ever-increasing network and mobile interconnectivity throughout the world.2                                                  1 Richard S.

This report was prepared in order to facilitate an understanding of some of the practical aspects of using the right of challenge. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tIt appears to the Committee that the right of challenge is rarely used except when Members have a high degree of conviction about the nature of the matter and the probable course of action which will be followed if the words complained of are allowed to stand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe fact that the challenged matter is rarely sustained by the Committee, and its rulings in this field are generally confined to a reiteration of the established practices in this body may be due in part to this attitude of reserve on the part of the members who complain. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tUnder the existing rules it would appear that the use of the terms \"unparliamentary language\" and \"disorderly\" interchangeable. However, the Committee believes that this is only partly so, for that such terms are often synonymous there is a tendency among parliamentarians to discourage the use of the latter expression. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe practice of most of the parliamentary bodies that govern similar situations is for the Chairman to use the common expression \"unparliamentary language.\" This terminology is used because it best describes the action of a member in violation of the established rules of debate and decorum. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe words or phrases considered \"unparliamentary,\" and therefore out of order, cover three broad categories they may be judged vulgar, indecent, or profane. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThis report should in no wise be considered a complete compendium of the \"unparliamentary language\" or as an official, authoritative expression but should be regarded in a more or less advisory nature. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe Chairman has not only the right of decision when a member is called to order but also the power to call another member to order when the words uttered by him are in violation of the rules. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tFor the protection of the person called to order it is advisable that the proper procedure be followed by referring to Rule 51.  The Chairman has the authority to enforce all the rules governing the proceedings of the House and to do so by reference to appropriate rules which the practice of the body sanctions, by making certain decisions on his own judgment, or by using a combination of the two. The rules which the House has created to regulate its own conduct comprise primarily the rules themselves and subordinate to these those customs and usages which are part of the common law of a particular parliament. The common law was born of necessity and experience and is often spoken of in terms such as \"having grown to be the custom\", \"being part of the unwritten law\". In point of fact, the procedures of every legislative body are different, for each one determines for itself the rules which govern the conduct of its members and those which govern the members vis-a-vis one another. In each instance the procedures may be considered a product of a combination of rules and customs, each of which has been tested by experience and each of which is used to regulate aspects of the parliamentary process. A certain amount of legislative flexibility is therefore always a part of the proceedings for most actions can be justified under one or more of the rules regardless of the form of action taken. Because the customs and usages comprise only the experience of any particular body, the actions or decisions taken by that body will always be justified as part of the general law of the body; therefore, a practice of the House established today cannot be made to appear in any previous session, nor can any judgment or decision rendered today be found in either of two previous sessions. In the exercise of his responsibilities as presiding officer of the House, the Chairman can take any course of action within the scope of the general law, and can base his decisions on the grounds that such action is a part of it. However, by reason of the flexibility and the breadth of discretion given the presiding officer, his decisions must of necessity be governed by certain guiding principles which must be held above the specific rule, in the same manner that the rules of evidence are above the specific statutes of a state, and the \"unwritten law\" or the common law is above both. One such basic premise upon which all parliamentary decisions must be made is that of judiciously applying the rules of parliamentary procedure to the matters at issue from time to time. When the application is judicious, it will be based on what is reasonable and what is not out of order.

This cloud model promotes availability and broad network access for applications and data while maximizing the utilization of resources and centralizing management responsibility for those resources. Although such benefits clearly exist for many applications and data, questions remain. Will this style of computing be widely adopted, or is it an aberration? Only time will be the ultimate judge. However, it is important to understand key issues and develop appropriate standards to enable the cloud model and its many benefits to be realized to the potential maximum.  Cloud computing is a new paradigm in which service providers offer services such as software, hardware and data; and users access those services over networks (Figure 1.1). The concept of cloud computing originated  years ago when large enterprises started sharing resources and providing services over the Internet.

Sixteen years later the deadliest outbreak of Ebola Virus was discovered in Western Africa. We must never forget. Nor to we want to forget our fellow citizens who fought daily against Ebola for two full years with few resources at our fingertips to protect them. We remember the countless number of our brothers and sisters that our  fellow citizens  of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea lost, and the numberless   Americans  who fought and died fighting Ebola in Africa on this 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks   of  9/11.  But on September 11, 2019, a health crisis has threatened thousands of Americans: the COVID-19 Pandemic. We owe it to every one of those impacted, every single person who is fighting for their life  on this 16th anniversary of 9/11 to fight this disease aggressively and completely from our shores. That is why I recently  reintroduced H.R. 6440, the Pandemic Rapid Response Act. This important legislation would support  the  establishment  of a Pandemic Ebola, Zika, and Coronavirus rapid response commission to study the impact of COVID-19 and recommend policy  actions  that  should  be  taken  to  prevent,  treat,  or   cure   this   severe   virus.   These  types   of   rapid   responses   are   critical   for   any   pandemic   that   can  potentially  cripple countries, devastate families, and shake  the  foundations  of our Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to provide much-needed guidance for the  United  States  Congress  to pursue avenues of aggressive funding and research to cure this virus. These are the most  productive   days   of   our   legislative   history,  and   we   must   rise   to   this   occasion.

While several Reclamation projects are funded through an individual authorizing statute, the majority of projects are funded as part of annual appropriations bills.  However, due to the ongoing and often controversial federal management of Reclamation-funded Rural Water Supply Projects (RWSP), Congress may reevaluate the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role and funding of these projects.\nTo date, Congress has authorized 84 rural water projects in Reclamation states, 76 through the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 (Title I of P.L. 109-451) and eight through 11 individual authorizing statutes. The Department of the Interior (DOI) or Reclamation have initiated all but two of the authorized projects. While DOI or Reclamation have completed feasibility studies on many of these projects, as of early 2020, only eight have undergone formal cost benefit analysis and been found to have sufficiently favorable cost benefit ratios to justify proceeding with  construction.\nRESOURCES -", "The 114th Congress considered 11 trade agreements in four major measures: \u2022 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (TPEA) (P.L. 114-27; June 29, 2015; H.R. 1295 \u2022 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-29; June 29, 2015; H.R. 1314 \u2022 Trade Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-26; May 20, 2015; S. 204 H.R. 4795 \u2022 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-189; October 7, 2014; H.R. 2518 \u2022 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-164; July 7, 2014; P.L. 113- 41) \u2022 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-107; April 16, 2014; P.L. 113-59) \u2022 US-Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (H.R. 3080; H.R. 3081; June 29, 2015; S. 1694 \u2022 Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-209; December 2, 2011; H.R. 3078) \u2022 Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-272; September 28, 2010; H.R. 4749) TABLE: Votes in House of Representatives on TPA Extension: Measure Vote Date/Time (EST) TPEA H.R. 1295 June 25, 2015/1:06:27 P.M. 218-208 102 195 174 224 218 189 228 179 203 TPEA H.R. 1314 June 25, 2015/1:14:04 P.M. 320-103 188 192 171 212 204 218 200 173 202 Trade Act of 2015 H.R. 4795 May 22, 2015/5:05:55 P.M. 387-50 102 195 174 224 218 189 228 179 202 Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2011 2 P.L. 112-61 June 18, 2011/11:14:16 P.M. 301-100 163 175 186 198 187 198 191 199 169 Reports: CRS In Focus IF10125; CRS Report R43449; CRS Report R42793; CRS Report RS22913; CRS Report R41418.", "In an effort to compete for ridership, Amtrak began experimenting with higher-speed intercity rail service with the Metroliner service in 1969, which ran on an existing stretch of high-speed track owned privately between New York City and Philadelphia. This led Congress to authorize Amtrak to buy its own high-speed track for this service and to allow it to operate without having to pay host railroads. After several more years of operating costs exceeding revenues despite operating only 50 percent of all rail passenger miles in the United States and the rail industry continuing to lose money overall (despite some profitable operations), Congress passed the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-518, 84 Stat.1322) to take the ownership and development of passenger rail service out of the private industry. The result was Amtrak, a government-subsidized, not-for-profit corporation operating the intercity railroads. Amtrak initially did not have the authority to issue bonds or raise capital. Amtrak's original mission had three facets: to improve the level of transportation service throughout the United States, especially in rural areas; to provide greater travel options to passengers; and to improve the financial condition and management of the railroad industry; this last goal has been referred to as the company's \"restructuring role.\" Amtrak was given an initial charter by Congress in 1970 to run for seven years, after which time the corporation would be dissolved. (Several extensions have since occurred, and by the late 1980s Congress was again addressing whether Amtrak should terminate or be extended into the foreseeable future.)\n\nThe Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4R Act) added provisions to the original 1971 law to expand Amtrak's role in intercity transportation and increase the company's financing options. However, concerns continued to mount over Amtrak's costs, and Congress set the \"Restructuring Charge,\" the cost of retiring rail companies' claims on the revenue, at $200 million per year. Since the charge was imposed by law, it could not be altered without a reauthorization of the law. A reauthorizing act in 1986 gave Amtrak until 1990 to pay the Restructuring Charge, but after this deadline had passed, Congress extended the deadline to 1997. Congress ultimately reauthorized Amtrak operations on a number of occasions, including three railroad acts since 2008 and the FAST Act of 2015, which authorized Amtrak operations through fiscal year 2017. In 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Amtrak agreed that Amtrak was exempt from the railroad grade crossing safety standards for federally funded improvements to the tracks it owns by virtue of its unique role providing intercity passenger rail service for all Americans, whether they ride Amtrak or the private railroads. Amtrak was also granted an exemption on a trial basis to install an ultrasonic signaling system along its Northeast Corridor. Amtrak received the authority to raise funds to match those contributed by the States on any route funded by Amtrak subsidies, and Amtrak was granted a tax credit allowing the private sector to invest in passenger rail improvements in exchange for an annual tax break. While Amtrak was permitted to run conventional trains as well as express ones, most of what was operated were slower regional trains. The Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-236, 87 Stat. 980) authorized Amtrak to purchase additional tracks that could be used to improve passenger service quality in addition to high-speed intercity passenger rail service; some of these tracks may be operated in a conventional mode. Amtrak began taking advantage of these opportunities with the establishment of the State Corridor program in 1999. These grants, authorized under several federal railroad acts, assist states to finance improved and additional service in their states. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-432) authorized up to $151 million for this program in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Amtrak operations are also supported in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century", "The National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program was designed to acquire a reliable and affordable U.S. access to space while maintaining U.S. access to space during times of crisis. The NSSL launched payloads and satellites for the United States (US) Air Force, US Navy, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and private sectors. The need for the program emerged from increasing costs and a limited number of suppliers for space launch vehicles. When the United States Air Force implemented its Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program in 1995, it sought a new approach for the procurement process for guaranteed, cost-effective access to space. The program faced two separate lawsuits challenging the Air Force\u2019s award of two contracts to the United Launch Alliance (ULA) (see Appendix) (Dawson, 2009). The lawsuits delayed EELV\u2019s launch of its first rocket until March 2004. EELV\u2019s original mission was to assure reliable access to space by providing a number of launch vehicle operators. EELV was supposed to provide better competition and assurances for reasonable satellite launch cost. EELV was renamed NSSL in 2019 as part of a congressional mandate. Throughout the development of NSSL, issues concerning the overall mission of NSSL and its various goals emerged. The original EELV program sought two contractors, but NSSL has four suppliers. The current contractors are United Launch Alliance (ULA), Lockheed Martin (LM), Space Exploration Technology Corporation (SpaceX), and Boeing (Porter, 2019). The goal of NSSL is to acquire the launch services at a reasonable cost, at a dependable rate, from a diverse supplier pool. The Air Force must carefully evaluate the cost effectiveness when awarding contracts. Additionally, NSSL requires a contractor to operate their equipment in such a manner to ensure national security access to space. NSSL must address the current vulnerability of Russia having the ability to cut off the reliability of the RD-180 engine used in both the Atlas V and the Russian Proton rocket.", "Congress maintains an ongoing interest in the pace of U.S. innovation and technological advancement due to its influence on the economy, national security, public health, and other national goals.

The global landscape for innovation is rapidly evolving\u00e2\u0080\u0094the pace of innovation has increased and the composition of R&D funding has changed (i.e., private R&D investments are larger than public R&D investments and the U.S. share of global R&D has declined). These changes have led some to call for new approaches and the expansion of existing mechanisms to help the United States maintain its leadership role in innovation and technology. One mechanism that has received some attention is the possibility of establishing additional agency-related entities that would facilitate the use of private donations in federally generated research projects. In addition, such entities might play a role in the commercialization of new technologies. The potential establishment of such entities in statute raises several questions: \u2022 What kinds of organizations has Congress established in the past to address similar needs in the federal government? \u2022 What are the strengths and weaknesses of these potential models? \u2022 What are the opportunities and risks of developing a new entity for federal R&D using one of these models? The varied organizational arrangements of the executive branch have resulted from more than two centuries of legislative and administrative action.

Trump Administration are debating enhancing and expanding barriers on the southwest border. The extent of these barriers, and how construction of these barriers will be funded, has become a central part of the interactions between Congress and the Trump Administration on border security and funding legislation for the broader federal government. The debate has revealed the lack of an authoritative compilation of data on the details of federal investment in border barriers. This is in part due to the evolving structure of the appropriations for agencies charged with protecting the border\u00e2\u0080\u0094account structures have shifted, initiatives have come and gone, and appropriations prior to FY2017 have typically not specified a precise level of funding for barriers versus other technology that secures the border. The Trump Administrations continued advocacy for funding for a \"border wall system\" has led to congressional interest in the historical context for border barrier funding. This report briefly contextualizes the history of U.S. enforcement of the U.S.-Mexico border, before turning to funding for border barriers within the contemporary period, accounting for changing appropriations structures. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was established in 1983 to consolidate the immigration and naturalization functions of the departments of Justice and State. The INS became part on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2002, after which U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) came under the DHS. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 authorized (by reference) an 11-mile-long fence along the southwest border. Section 102 of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act appropriated $1.2 billion for that same project, and it directed the construction to the primary border barrier. The DHS Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 110-161), and the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-28), funded construction of portions of fencing authorized by the 2006 act, but subsequent appropriations bills provided no additional funding. Between 2007 and 2017, Congress enacted several border security funds, which provided funding (approximately $3.4 billion) for other border fencing-related materials and deployments of barrier construction and materials. The fiscal year of enactment is indicated for each of these 28 legislative items. 2013: The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), continued a $3.0 million program for border security in South Texas. 2014: The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-64) continued a $3.0 million program for border security in South Texas. 2015: In the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-254), the amount of funds made available for the following accounts were increased: the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Salaries and Expenses, Facilities and Administrative Support account by $10,000,000 to fund additional U.S. Border Patrol agents; the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program account by $3,000,000 to reimburse certain states for the costs of incarcerating illegal alien criminals; and the Operation Stonegarden account by $1,000,000 for operation of the Border Patrol National Targeting Center\u00e2\u0080\u0094Central. All funds made available for the following accounts in Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) were reauthorized in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-254): the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Salaries and Expenses, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology account and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Automation Modernization account; the U.S. Border Patrol, Sal", "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied. It encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy, and eggs), as well as fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. In addition, U.S. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products, forest products, custom work, machine hire, and other farm-related activities. The intensity and economic importance of each of these activities, as well as their underlying market structure and production processes, vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States. Annual U.S. net farm income is the single most-watched indicator of farm sector well-being, as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes, input expenses, and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period (see box \"Measuring Farm Profitability\" for a definition of net farm income ). When national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt-to-asset ratio, the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well-being of the national farm economy. In the first of three official U.S. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2020 (see box \"ERS's Annual Farm Income Forecasts\" below), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS) projects that U.S. net farm income will rise 3.3% year-over-year in 2020 to $96.7 billion, up $3.1 billion from last year ( Figure 1 and Table A-1 ). The February forecast of $96.7 billion is 6.3% below the 10-year average of $115.0 billion. In contrast, net cash income (calculated on a cash-flow basis) is projected lower in 2020 ($85.6 billion) than it was in 2019 ($94.9 billion) ( Figure 2) and is 8.3% below the 10-year average of $93.2 billion. The divergence in year-to-year changes across net income measures is due to a series of major weather events that occurred in 2019 ( Figure 3 ). The U.S. had the eighth warmest national average temperature on record of 56.2\u00c2\u00b0 F in 2019, over 2.4\u00c2\u00b0 F warmer than the second warmest average of 53.8\u00c2\u00b0 F in 2011. 2019 is the warmest in the period of 1895-2018. The U.S. also had the sixth wettest national average precipitation of 36.35 inches in 2019. The national average of 39.41 inches was 2.24 inches more than the 10-year average of 37.17 inches. Rainfall has been above average across most of the lower 48 on a monthly basis all calendar year through January 2020. The January rainfall for CONUS has been near the average precipitation of 3.58 inches so far. The U.S. has been largely free from major weather events through 2019 but the beginning of 2020 has not been so kind. This January, the Midwest U.S. had the largest and most prolonged winter storm that began at the end of 2019. The Midwest and Mid-South U.S. had significant rainfall totals in December and the first week of January, causing flooding and the need to move livestock from fields and pastures to high ground and grain storage. The southern third of the U.S. had the wettest January since 1982 causing flooding, drowning, and freezing to death of over 30,000 animals. Livestock and their care represent a major piece of cash farm cost ( Table 1 ). Other high-cost, seasonal expenses (such as labor and management services) typically are included in cash income statements, as indicated by Table A-2, even though they may not be incurred on an annual basis. Thus, the inclusion of expenses such as depreciation expenses, custom hire,", "The 116 th Congress continues its interest in U.S. research and development (R&D) and in evaluating support for federal R&D activities. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to communications satellites, shale gas extraction, and defenses against disease. In recent years, federal budget caps have driven executive and legislative branch decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, among other things, increased the previously established FY2020 and FY2021 discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending. This act reduced some of the budgetary constraints affecting R&D decisions. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D. Its purposes includeaddressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funding supported by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies. Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process. Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities as it makes decisions about the level of federal spending for R&D and about the prioritization and allocation of available funds. This report begins with a discussion of the overall level of R&D in President Trump's FY2021 budget request, followed by analyses of R&D funding in the request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency R&D initiatives. Additional information and analysis will be included as the House and Senate act on the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FY2021 request.", "2/28/2020; 6 p.m.\nThis report is an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East and North Africa. Includes a brief historical review of foreign aid levels, a description of specific country programs, and analysis of current foreign aid issues. Also provides analysis of the Administration's FY2021 budget request for State Department and USAID Foreign Operations and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations in the Middle East and North Africa region.\nThe United States authorizes and appropriates foreign assistance and conducts oversight of executive agencies' management of aid programs. This report is intended to assist Congress in overseeing U.S. foreign assistance activities in the Middle East (that is, the nations of the Arab Levant, Israel, Iran, and Kurdistan region of northeastern Iraq), and in North Africa (the countries of western and northeastern Africa, which are considered part of the Middle East in this report).\nOfficially, the Middle East and North Africa have been grouped together within the State Department's regional bureaus: Near Eastern Affairs (NEA) handles the Middle East, with the exception of Iran, and Africa handles North Africa. Since 1958, both the Middle East and North Africa have been the focus of U.S. foreign policy efforts to reduce the region's vulnerability to the Soviet Union's influence. These efforts peaked, appropriately, in the Carter Administration (1977-1981), when President Jimmy Carter's National Security Staff launched a region-wide strategy to promote energy, population, and economic growth, and to secure access to oil. Since 1946, the MENA region has received the most U.S. foreign aid, in part reflecting significant support for U.S. partners in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq. This pattern has continued under the Trump Administration.\nU.S. bilateral assistance to the Middle East is focused on Egypt and Israel; to the broader Near East (that is, the MENA nations excluding Israel); and to Lebanon. It is distributed primarily through the Economic Support Fund (ESF), Iraq Security Fund (ISF) and other foreign military financing (FMF) accounts.\nU.S. bilateral assistance to the MENA region is focused on Lebanon; and is distributed primarily through the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE). Lebanon, the Middle East's only democracy, was once the region's economic powerhouse. Lebanon continues to face long-term challenges, including spillover of the wars in Syria, and in Iraq, and a widening regional divide between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims that threatens to further destabilize Lebanon.\nU.S. bilateral assistance to the Near East is focused on Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza. It is distributed primarily through the ESF and ISF accounts.\nU.S. bilateral assistance to the Middle East is concentrated in the State Department's regional bureau for the Near East, and regional USAID bureaus for the Middle East and for Syria.\nThis report will not include U.S. emergency disaster assistance, known as the Overseas Emergency Disaster Assistance (OEDA) account. In FY2020, disaster assistance for earthquakes that hit near Aleppo, Syria, totaled about $3.6 million, which was nearly matched by similar-sized contributions made by Germany, Japan, and the European Union, and others. These additional funds should not be viewed as indicators of regional instability, but rather of U.S. support for a variety of foreign countries, to include non-MENA states.\nAnother significant U.S. foreign aid program in this region involves contributions to multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA); the Lebanese armed forces; the International Atomic Energy Agency; the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; and the Arab League. Multilateral contributions often increase when there is a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions, as in the current conflict in Syria, or an active natural disaster affecting MENA nations. Funding for UNRWA, for example, has increased in recent years from $100 million in FY2016 to $150 million in FY2017 to more than $180 million in FY2018, which funded operations in the hostile Gaza Strip/West Bank.", "Congress directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a mandate that requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. Every year, obligated parties (including small refiners) demonstrate to EPA their compliance with the mandate. The EPA may grant small refiners an exemption from the RFS for compliance period, if they can prove compliance would subject them to disproportionate economic hardship. The statute gives EPA the authority to set cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel volume targets for each compliance year. Congress passed several other provisions authorizing EPA to issue biofuel credits. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized EPA to issue credits to producers of renewable fuel that exceed their blend volume mandates under RFS2. RINs are a tradable credit within this system. RINs may be attached to renewable fuel, blenderstock (a blend of renewable fuel and other conventional fuel) and conventional fuel or biomass-based diesel that is reformulated (with renewable fuel). RINs do not include credits created before or after RFS2. The biofuel industry may create credits that can later be used to comply with the statute (i.e., \"cash or carry\"). RINs can be stored and sold and traded through the market, similar to other tradable commodities such as stocks and interest rates.\nFigure 1. The Renewable Fuel Standard Volume Requirement Over the Years Since RFS2 (Source: U.S. Department of Energy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransportation Energy Data Book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2014).\nThis provision also requires EPA to implement a small refinery exemption (SRE) program that grants \"an exemption from the renewable fuel program requirements (for the compliance period)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6if EPA determines that the application was timely, and the application demonstrates that compliance with such requirements would severely limit the refinery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to operate.\"6 The RFS program, including its various credits and exemption processes, serves as the backdrop for the remainder of the report.\nThe RFS was first introduced in 2005 with the adoption of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT)7 and requires transportation fuel to contain advanced (or renewable) biofuel volumes. The advanced biofuel requirement begins at 4.0 billion gallons in 2008. (Figure 1). Congress defined renewable fuels as: \u00e2\u0080\u009cmixtures of renewable fuels suitable for distribution and use as fuels in vehicles, including, but not limited to, ethanol, biodiesel, and other renewable fuels including any fuel produced through the use of biosythesized hydrocarbons, as well as mixtures containing at least 80 percent renewable fuels (including biodiesel blends),\u00e2\u0080\u009d and advanced biofuels as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiofuels, other than biodiesel, derived from sources that do not involve food production.\u00e2\u0080\u009d8 The volume requirement applies to fuel blenders and importers. The RFS does not directly apply to small refiners (defined as refineries with throughput capacity less than 75,000 barrels per day). However, they may file for exemption from the statute. To qualify for an SRE, a refinery must demonstrate that compliance with the RFS would severely limit the refinery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to operate and the SRE must not result in a substantial increase in imports compared to the scenario without the SRE.\nEPA is directed to establish a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprocedural mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u009d to enable timely requests for exemptions \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor reasons other than disproportionate economic hardship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d9 The SRE provision is not codified in law. Rather, as with other provisions within the statute, Congress grants EPA rulemaking authority to determine the process by which the agency may grant SREs.\nBefore a small refinery may receive an SRE, it must first notify the EPA Administrator of its request for an SRE no later than July 1 of the compliance year. The request must state that 1) the refinery demonstrates compliance with the volume requirement of the statute would result in a disproportionate economic hardship; and 2) the SRE will not \u00e2", "The reclamation of abandoned surface mines is the largest and the most expensive environmental restoration program in the United States. Approximately $2.6 billion in Title IV fees have been  collected from the coal mining industry since 1978, and approximately $1.8 billion in Title IV grants have been transferred to 198 coal producing states and tribes. As of March 2019, mine operators had completed reclamation of approximately 497,000 acres and have 450,000 additional acres to complete. As of the end of FY2019, about $479 million is available to complete coal mine reclamation at orphan and legacy site and another $932 million to complete cleanup at hardrock mines,  coal refuse piles, and other coal related sites.  This report summarizes the federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation program that provides funding for the reclamation of abandoned surface mines, primarily on abandoned coal mines, and related coal reclamation issues of interest to Congress. It includes analysis and legislative proposals specific to Title IV of SMCRA. The report begins with an overview of SMCRA, a discussion of the Title IV, Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program, and the status of funding and reclamation. The report next reviews funding and reclamation issues under Title IV and a number of related legislative proposals. A list of outdated or abandoned abandoned mine lands is provided to members in the Appendix. The issue for Congress is whether Congress should reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Reclamation fee collection and the subsequent use of the collection proceeds.", "a) C ongressional employees are  in your congressman's office?\nthe same or very similar to other advertisements across sources.
