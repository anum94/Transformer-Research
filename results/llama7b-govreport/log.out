["The CPSC proposes a ban on baby walkers that could result in a reduction of injuries for this age group, although many walkers are built to CPSC standards. However, walkers that meet both CPSC and ASTM standards are on the market, so the proposed ban could mean an end to this type of infant product. Manufacturers who want to continue to manufacture, distribute or sell walkers will have to go to court to prove their products are not \"substantially the same\" as walkers covered in the proposal, a standard that is subject to interpretation.\nBaby walkers, like many other products, pose an injury hazard if used improperly. They have been the subject of legislative regulation, litigation, and marketing challenges. Baby walkers have also been the subject of a lengthy rulemaking process that has resulted, ultimately, in a proposed ban on their manufacture, distribution, or sale.\nAccording to CPSC estimates, about 18,000 children annually sought medical attention as a result of walker-related injuries. Although the CPSC proposed an initial rulemaking to ban baby walkers to the exclusion of their use at all times, and the CPSC's 50th anniversary ban on trampolines, in a public petition, \"A Proposal for a Mandatory Standard for Consumer Use Walkers\" (CPSC Docket No. 1322 (05)), the CPSC now proposes a ban on walkers for children under one year that weigh less than 20 pounds and are not fully capable of standing. The CPSC's action is intended to reduce this danger and the number of children who suffer injuries from these potentially dangerous products.\nThe CPSC began considering the issue of baby walkers in 1982, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) Bureau of Consumer Protection and the NHTSA. After reviewing related incidents, studies, and data, these three agencies published a joint report in 1984 about the potential dangers of baby walkers. The agencies concluded the greatest risk posed by baby walkers was to small children under 24 months of age since they are too young to develop the necessary abilities to use such products safely. They determined that such children should avoid the use of baby walkers. Following the publication of the joint study, the CPSC, in coordination with the FTC, established a product-safety-education campaign about the possible risks associated with baby walkers. This effort attempted to inform the public of the potential risks associated with children's use of these products. The joint study and public warning were largely successful according to the CPSC's own statistics of fatalities from child walker accidents. In 1987, for example, there were only eleven reported fatalities resulting from baby walker accidents, but by 1993 the number of reported fatalities had risen to forty-one, a figure that CPSC officials attributed to a lack of compliance and general insufficient efforts in this area.\nIn 1998, CPSC began the rulemaking process that would result in a proposed ban on these products. In July 1998, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers filed a petition requesting a ban on walkers based in the CPSC's mandatory 50th anniversary report and asserting that baby walkers were defective products that caused hundreds of serious injuries and deaths in children under three years of age annually.\nTo address this concern, the CPSC formed a Baby Walker Subcommittee and the Baby Walker Working Group, both of which reported back to the CPSC Chairman. Both groups discussed injuries resulting from the use of walkers (including adults who used walkers as improperly designed strollers) along with injuries in children under 24 months. The Working Group determined that the walkers should not be banned since no other products could meet the needs of the parents, a conclusion to this rulemaking which does not seem to have been shared by this Subcommittee.\nMore than 8,000 written comments have been submitted in response to the rulemaking. Many comments asserted that walkers serve as a \"stairway\" to independence for small children and are a safe alternative to strollers or carriers.\nThe American Infant Safe Sitter Certification Organization (AISSCO) submitted a public comment in which it discussed the use of walker-style carriers by parents or caregivers. The comment asserted that since many of AI", "Paper Journal? 12,500 Years?\nSeveral months ago I had the privilege of meeting and talking to\nHunter Davies, former editor of the  \"Guardian\" and author of books\nsuch as \"Being The Beatles\" and \"The Beatles' Diary\". He was\nlecturing on journalism at my university, where amongst other\nthings he said that a column and opinion page could not be true if\nit was not based on real experience with the subject as opposed to\nhis own views and opinions. This made me start to think about\nwhether what I do here is journalism. I was told by many during\nthe past  year that what I do is not journalism but that the\njournalists did not know what they were talking about since they\nhad not even listened to \"Roswell  Exposed\" and would not accept\nanything other than something that was in print. I was also told\nby many others that I did not know what journalism was - that\njournalists are supposed to write their opinions, that this was\nthe best way that one could develop one's writing - that even\nthough this has been proven untrue that this was the way it would\nalways be and that the readers would not know what I was talking\nabout and that they liked it this way and that they were against\nall forms of new media, that this was how it had always been done and\nthat I really did not understand this. This lead me to start to\nthink maybe what I do here is not \"journalism\" but maybe \"new\nmedia journalism\" and therefore this would mean that I could\nexpose the truth about things which people do not like and will\nnot accept and cannot understand since they do not follow this\nway of thinking, and they do not listen to the opinions of others\n(just the majority view), and that the media was there to show\nwhat other people thought but was not there to tell the truth,\nand also that the media was there to tell people what they\nsought for them to hear. This is what they wanted to hear and it\ndid not matter if it is the truth or if what you had to say was\nnot what they wanted you to say. This is why I now want to start\nan opinion paper, to tell people what they do not want to hear,\nand what is true.\nI had been doing this on my Blog but had started to think\nthis was self censored because people were not telling me the\ntruth or what they really thought, and because it was on my Blog\nand I was using the Internet then people thought that they could\ntell me this. I also wanted to do a column because I do not have\nthe time to write these long things which have no beginning or\nend and which never have a conclusion or point but which just\nwent on and on. This is why I now think it is time to leave my\nweb site alone and to start a paper journal and to ask the\nreaders of \"Project Beta\" to send me their opinions on various\nthings where my Blog is concerned, whether they are right or\nwrong, whether they are pro or anti, whether someone has taken\nsomeone else's photograph, whether something I have written is\ntrue or not, whether something is not important and will change\nor whether something is important and will not change, and\nwhether I will die or whether my web site will be deleted. This\nis the kind of thing for you to send off so that we can establish\nwhat is true and what is not and what people thought when the facts\nwere available and what they thought after someone gave them\ninformation, whether it was true and what I could now write.", "Thick plumes of black smoke were rising from a nearby airbase as the first of the bomber planes flew past the dormitories below. Everyone was rushing to get off campus as fast as they could. This was always the most dangerous stage of the evacuation drill. It was the only part when people seemed to panic and do weird and unpredictable things\u2014everyone was more vulnerable in crises\u2014and so the guards had to be on their toes to protect the children from any ruffians. There was no need for this sort of behavior now, though, now that they were safely in the evacuation carriages. Lots of the children were reading or playing chess or drawing the airbase in the dirt and others seemed to be getting the most out of the situation by sleeping. After half an hour or so of travel to safety, one of the guards announced quietly that the planes were not in fact enemy bombers but firefighters and people could return to their dorms. In the confusion and crowding the children had been oblivious to it all.", "The Board denied the request submitted by PNC Bank, N.A., to transfer an out-of-state property holding trust into a Massachusetts non-depository trust.

Read more in this week\u2019s Media Leadership Report.\nNews Media\u2019s Evolving Digital Advertising: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\nWelcome to this week\u2019s edition of the Media Leadership Report. Our topic this week: The social discovery gap.\nFacebook and some publishers have moved beyond relying on the sharing of posts and comments to generate additional audience. Now, publishers can harness the power of discovery via social referral and expand digital advertising on both owned and media partners. Social referral allows publishers to create audience segments who engage with their content via social referral and then turn these audiences into a product for marketing partners, who can then target them for advertising.\nHere\u2019s how The Chicago Tribune is taking advantage of social referral to grow audience and additional revenue. Here\u2019s how The Sun\u2019s News Media Works is using social discover to expand the reach of its advertisers\u2019 digital campaigns. And here\u2019s how The Washington Post is monetizing and expanding its audience with social referral.\nFor publishers, social discovery represents a shift in how they generate audience engagement \u2014 and this transition creates both new opportunities and challenges.\nHere\u2019s a look back at some of the topics we covered this week:\n1. When it comes to audience, it\u2019s no longer about one size fits all. And that\u2019s the best part about the evolution of the digital advertising ecosystem.\n2. The future of digital advertising may be in its ability to scale up to create large, addressable audiences for marketers. However, it\u2019s not the only opportunity in the digital advertising market.\n3. The more audience that a publisher can garner and develop a deeper understanding of, the more it can serve audiences meaningfully. That\u2019s why news publishers need to continue to refocus their newsroom efforts to develop products that will help them attract a new mobile-first generation of digital natives.\n4. Data \u2014 not just about audience \u2014 is key to enabling publishers to understand their audiences, their behaviors, and the opportunities to serve those audiences better.\n5. When it comes to advertising, the goal isn\u2019t just to serve audiences; it\u2019s also about understanding consumer behavior and leveraging that understanding to target, target, target.\n6. While the digital advertising ecosystem has created both economic and audience challenges for publishers, most publishers are committed to finding new business models that will enable them to thrive in an industry that is rapidly evolving.\nWhile some publications have closed or merged to cope with changes in the industry, others like The San Jose Mercury News continue to find innovative ways to engage audiences and drive revenue.\nThe Mercury News recently launched a new mobile product, called Snap Shot. This product, which replaces the newspaper\u2019s traditional print-based A1 section, offers a 21st-century approach to digital audience engagement. Instead of focusing mostly on the day\u2019s top stories, the Mercury News is now delivering a daily, hourly report on the news of the day. Here\u2019s how the product works.\nFrom 4 a.m. until 7 p.m., Snap Shot offers daily news and links to live-streaming video, audio, and local event information. Snap Shot replaces the print page in a similar way to what the iPad and its app-based delivery has done, but on a mobile device.\n\u201cSnap Shot is a digital experience that\u2019s similar to what we\u2019re trying to do with the print experience, which is breaking news, news summary, short articles all with a similar eye to the print news product,\u201d Scott Lewis, chief strategy officer for the Mercury News, told the Mobile Native News, explaining the product\u2019s development and launch.\nFor the publisher, this product allows it to keep the print-style A1 section while embracing a digital form \u2014 one that\u2019s more like the news and information people typically access when accessing mobile platforms.\n\u201cNews, especially the kind of \u2018A1 stuff,\u2019 is very familiar to readers, so we wanted to make sure that we didn\u2019t abandon that.\u201d\nAs you might imagine, a mobile product that features continuous news updates isn\u2019t something that traditional publishers were particularly used to delivering. How did the Mercury News team approach its product design? According to Scott Lewis, the development team focused on making the Mercury News product very user-friendly and accessible to readers, especially with the added value of social shareability features built right", "A man who has become a vegetarian is invited to a restaurant that will only serve the meat from his pet goat.", "A woman has been assaulted outside her house in St Albans.\nHertfordshire Constabulary is appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in Garston Gardens, St Albans, which occurred on Sunday the 9th of April between 00-5pm.

The growing trend is likely to continue into 2010, as more marketers make the transition from traditional websites to mobile sites \u2013 a move that could prove mutually beneficial both on a consumer level and on a revenue generating one: The growth for mobile automotive sites appears to have increased 50% over the past two years, a figure that's likely to surge over the next 12 months.\nMobile: New Year's Resolutions for Automotive Industry Marketers\nAUTHOR: Gavin Stirling\nBMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Jaguar, Range Rover, and Infiniti are just some of the more than 100 automakers that now have mobile sites, according to data from research firm Autovantify.\nThe growing trend is likely to continue into next year, as more marketers make the transition from traditional websites to mobile sites \u2013 a move that could prove mutually beneficial both on a consumer level and on a revenue generating one.\nWhile some companies have been making a strong showing of presence on mobile platforms for some time, it appears automotive companies are now accelerating their mobile strategies considerably; the growth for mobile automotive sites appears to have increased 50% over the past two years, a figure that's likely to surge over the next 12 months.\nAccording to Brian Reilly, president and CEO of Mobile Marketing Association (MMA), and vice president of Media Relations for Verizon, \u201cwe know that mobile will be a growing part of the way that people find information, not only about vehicles but about the market in general.\u201d\nWith consumers increasingly using mobile phones to research products, automotive brands are taking measures to capitalize on a platform that offers several advantages over traditional websites.\nFor instance, Reilly noted the \u201cportability of mobile devices\u201d is especially significant at the store level. \u201cWe know that people are looking at, for instance, a car they\u2019re interested in, and want to get more information, often on the spot, while they\u2019re actually looking at the car.\u201d\nAnother significant advantage, Reilly said, is that with a mobile site, brands \u201ccan put that content in the hands of consumers in a very personal way.\u201d\nSo, at what point will a mobile site become a must-have for automotive marketers?\n\u201cI think, in general, marketers are going to start demanding mobile sites\u2026[Because] they understand the value that can be delivered to their consumer base\u2026they realize they don\u2019t want to be left behind,\u201d Reilly said.\nWhile the advantages of a mobile site are evident, Reilly said that for most marketers \u2013 especially at the mid-market level \u2013 the decision to take the leap to mobile is more a question of affordability than anything else. \u201cIn reality, not all marketers can afford the mobile version of their website. So, when they\u2019re looking to start building that out \u2013 which is kind of what the next wave of mobile-web deployments is \u2013 they\u2019re going to be looking for, \u2018What are the lowest hanging fruit? Which pages can I put up, and which aren\u2019t as critical to do in a mobile version?'\u201d\nA mobile site, Reilly said, is not just a \u201cmobile version\u201d site; it\u2019s got to be built with mobile consumers in mind. Reilly noted this means that mobile sites have to be \u201cmore intuitive and much shorter version of the traditional desktop site (for example, when trying to search for a car model), because people don\u2019t want to type out a lot of information on a mobile device.\u201d\nAmidst this wave of mobile marketing advancements, there are still many brands that are lacking some of the key elements of a mobile-friendly website.\nFor example, some automotive marketers still feature links on their sites that redirect consumers back to a desktop version. This is a mistake, said John Caldwell, vice president of marketing for mobile advertising network Mojiva, as links to desktop versions are \u201cuseless on a mobile phone\u201d because they require more time than a mobile consumer would likely want to spend typing the correct desktop link.\nIn addition to the importance of including accurate and up-to-date maps on mobile sites, \u201cI also think it\u2019s important to do mobile-specific ads on mobile sites so that they can be really targeted\u201d (for example, on mobile sites, consumers can scroll through a car model, whereas in the", "This technical update provides information to local government officials concerning the changes adopted in the recently enacted law, Public Act 97-0526 (2011 ILCS 120/)\n(the Local Government Consolidation, Unfunded Mandates, Sunset\nDate, and Other Noncontroversial Items Act) that will take effect on\nAugust 2, 2011.

Even while online usage overall is up overall, people are sticking to their newspaper websites.\nNewspaper Web Sites Gain Ground on Rivals\nThe 120-page white paper,\n\"Revenue Opportunities on the Web: How Online Advertising Can Expand Your\nAdvertising Base,\" out of Borrell Associates, covers 752\nU.S. newspaper websites. Borrell, of\nPetersburg, VA, is a research firm that tracks and provides data about media\nThe study focused on advertising on the websites of newspaper chains and\nother leading newspaper websites.\nThe study reported, \"Audiences are up 21.5\npercent over the 12 months ending October 2005. The audiences have increased\nas much as 9.6 percent since last fall. The online\nmedia audience has increased as much as 25 percent over the same period.\nWhile some online competitors are growing at 25,\n30 (percentage) or more, leading newspaper sites\nhave a 21.5 percent. That's significantly beating the online\ncompetitors. The audiences seem to be sticking to these (leading newspaper\nsites). That's good news. And that's probably because of (leading\nnewspaper sites') brand recognition. If you know and trust a company, you\nwill visit its site again.\"\nIn the last year, the percentage of the internet\naudience that visited newspaper websites has increased by 6\npercentage points. And the percentage of Americans that visited news websites\nin the past month increased 6 percentage points, too, to 41 percent.\nStill, the study concluded that newspaper websites have only a 2\npercent share of the total U.S. population. Even so, that's up from 1 percent\nin 2001. Some 79 percent of the internet audience has visited newspaper\nwebsites in the past month and one or more times over the past 30 days.\nAnother encouraging sign is that newspaper websites are growing\nfaster than local media's online business in general. \"While local print media is\ngrowing at about (10 percent) per year, local online media are seeing (10\npercent) revenue growth. So that's a good sign.\"\nThe study found that 224 of the 752 sites\ninclude an online classified section and 394 include display ads. It also\nfound that 810 sites feature a news operation that is not embedded in the\nclassifieds. Some 36.2 percent of sites include only classifieds whereas 7.2 percent\nfocus only on news.\nAnother key finding is that some sites still\nhave to add display ads to their classified services. \"Classifieds only is\ngrowing. And it's growing (at a 35) percent compounded rate, far faster than\nnewspaper websites overall. So clearly there's a lot of room for growth there.\"\nIt's also important to note that there's more to the newspaper site experience than just classified sales, said Mike\nMancini, Borrell's President and Chief Operating Officer, in a statement\nreleased with the report. \"Our report looks at the complete (newspaper)\nsite experience, including not only newspapers' classified advertising efforts but their\nother advertising assets on their websites, such as display advertising,\nreal-time bidding (RTB), syndicated feeds, news stories and other content.\nTaken together, all these elements can create a one-stop source for\nadvertisers to buy and manage their advertising campaigns, creating a very\nrobust opportunity for media companies like newspapers.\"\nMonday's white paper, \"Revenue Opportunities\non the Web: How Online Advertising Can Expand Your Newspaper Advertising\nBase,\" is available by calling Borrell at 804-817-\n6803 and asking for report number 262-5588.", "The proposed amendment sets forth terms used in a series\nof regulations that implement the new state-based insurance\nPURPOSE:  The Commissioner proposes to amend an existing rule setting\nforth additional terms used in a series of regulations that\nimplement a new program that creates a state based insurance\nexchanges that provide affordable health insurance to\nqualified persons and to small employers.

The success of traditional print sales and marketing has grown to include social media strategies and the use of personalised print products such as printable stickers which can now be customised online.\nPrint marketing is an extremely effective technique in marketing and is constantly evolving with the needs of its consumers. Using print effectively for marketing purposes allows businesses to establish a connection with consumers and develop their brands. Here we take a look at how print marketing has successfully been implemented for various businesses and how print has been used to promote products and services as part of their digital marketing strategy.\nIt gives your brand a face\nOne way brands can succeed with print marketing is to make your brand more relatable to your intended audience. This can be done through printed marketing materials that are not only representative of the brand, but are also useful to the consumer. For businesses with brick and mortar stores and/or an in-store marketing component, displaying print as an advertisement on the counter is a perfect place to start. By printing business cards to give out, or a catalogue to leave in your store, this will make your business feel more substantial and legitimize your brand, allowing consumers to see and be aware of the products you have to offer.\nCustom business cards: A business card is perhaps the first impression a consumer will get of a brand. A business' brand identity should be reflected in their business card and they can take the opportunity to introduce products in a creative way.\nPrint advertising in a magazine: For example, an ad campaign for a clothing company could be done through a direct mail piece such as a flyer or postcard that features the design of the product. This would promote brand loyalty as people remember both the brand and the product in their mind.\nIt helps with awareness\nPrint marketing materials such as printed brochures can be used to spread word of mouth and raise awareness of your brand. It could also serve as an easy way to introduce a new product to the consumer, in an affordable way. The brochure can also include company or product information and be a handy resource to the consumer, whether they have it for personal use or hand it out to potential clients.\nPrinted brochures can be used to introduce products to the consumer and create a marketing material for customers, who can learn more about the product and the company.\nCustom brochures: With custom printed brochures, you can personalise your brochures to represent your brand and products. You can opt for custom cover stock, such as our printed linen or printed on our premium matte paper stock.\nIt gives personalised attention\nBy giving customers something personalised for them, such as a personalised promotional product, it gives them a greater sense of personal attention. A printed promotional pen with the company's logo as an example, will give personal attention to the consumer, raising awareness of the brand and promoting loyalty by allowing the consumer to associate their brand with the promotional gift.\nPersonalised printed pens: Businesses can give out personalised products such as business cards or printed pens or notepads to raise brand awareness. By printing a simple logo, the consumer will be able to remember the company and the products.\nFor example, printed pens are an effective promotional tool to provide your brand exposure at an affordable cost. You can choose from our custom ink pens or our premium luxury pens.\nIt helps to establish trust\nBuilding trust with consumers is crucial as the majority of purchasing decisions happen for the consumers to be comfortable with the brand. Businesses can build their brand identity through personalised printed stickers and promote loyalty by encouraging fans to share their experience.\nCustom printed stickers: Printing unique, personalised printable stickers with your customers can be used for various marketing purposes and to get customer recognition. For example, you can use custom printed stickers in conjunction with promotions and loyalty programs as they can strengthen engagement with your consumers.\nBy creating a connection with your consumers, you can spread word of mouth about your brand and build customer loyalty. This will ultimately allow your brand to grow, through establishing trust.\nPrinted promotional gifts: By giving out your promotional products such as custom printed sweatshirts, your customers will use the product. The logo will be more visible, allowing customers to remember your brand and associate your product with your company.\nBy customising or personalising your promotional gifts, you can help to make your customers feel special and ensure that they don't lose interest in your brand", "The Committee will discuss the FY 2002\nbudget request for NASA's programs within the Office of\nScience (R&D).

It's been known  since the early 1950's  that there\nare no flying saucers, but I'd thought I would look at things\nin connection with the question of  how big such a machine\nwould need to be and how large an engine would have to be\nto power it.\nThe  answer is:  A real flying saucer which can lift both its\nown weight in fuel and the weight of 50 passengers would have\nto be the size of three big U.S. Navy submarines  plus an\nadditional thirty feet.  Then,  to lift them all into the\nair,  it would need a gigantic liquid-propane-fed turbo-pump\nrocket engine roughly the size of the Saturn V rocket, the\nengine NASA's Apollo space capsules were powered by during  the\nApollo moon shots.\nI'd first started to think about this,  and the answer, at least to\nthe power  supply,  when I was a 14- 15 year old boy  who once  read\na couple of \"saucer stories\" by Fred Methyon. They were  called Flying\nSaucers are Real and Flying Saucers are People, and in them Mr.\nMethyon claimed to have traveled in a flying saucer and had many of\nthe most intriguing details of flying saucers explained.\nOne which stuck vividly in my  head was the claim that spacecraft\nof the real flying saucer variety would be able to  lift more than\ntheir own weight and lift a crew of twenty-  five or more people:\na flying  ship of that type and the size of a couple of\nbig American warships or submarines;  roughly four hundred\nthousand pounds in empty  weight;  powered by a liquid-fuel\nrocket which  could power the ship for ten days straight.\nThat much weight would not be heavy  on any modern  rocket-\npowered ship, especially  one whose  propulsion  system took\nliquid fuel, for no liquid-propane-fueled space shuttle\never in the history of the world has had a  launch weight of\nover two hundred and fifty thousand pounds,  and the\nAriane rocket used to put satellites into orbit has a weight\nof  less than eighty thousand pounds for its fuel load.\nThen,  I think it was about 1957 or 58,  I stumbled  across the\nsame claim from a rather different author, in an article in the\nSaturday Evening Post about a \"saucer\" (it was also called\nsaucerman's ship;  I'll  call it the \"SS\"  for simplicity,\nalthough of course the  two words are not actually  all that\nsimilar). In the article it said that the reason man could\nnever  build a machine to duplicate those flying saucers\nwas  that  they were  huge.  By which  the writer meant large\nenough to hold the crew of twenty-  five or more,  and he\ngave them some incredibly large number of thousands of\ntons as an example.  I was only partly impressed with  the\narticle,  but it  didn't make any  sense at all. After all,\nif the ship carried just one crewmember, it would take\nhim 20,000 miles at a clip.  By my  arithmetic,  if the SS\nwent at two thousand miles an hour -- the speed of a modern\npassenger airliner -- its range would be more than 300 miles\nIf   the   SS   could  go  at  twenty  thousand miles an\nhour, its fuel requirements would be 240 times greater,\nand its range in the same  direction  3.6 million miles\n-- almost  three  and  one-half SOLAR SYSTEMS, whereby\nthe fuel load would, in order to go twice as far,\nhave to be an awesome 640,000,000 tons.\nOf course,  the reader must  keep in mind that it is not at\nall  surprising  that someone could be silly  enough to\nth", "A summary of the main news stories in Asia this week.\n1.

But if we are really, truly, ready, we can easily and quickly release the old emotions and the baggage behind it, in only a couple of seconds. The key is having an energetic connection to what it is we are letting go of, and for many people, that connection often comes from having a visual representation of the old pattern.\nOne of the greatest mysteries in human experience is the difficulty of saying goodbye. It is not just the difficulty of letting go of loved ones, as you can imagine. It is even more difficult when we are moving on from something else, be it a job, project, friendship, relationship or just a situation. It's not just a little difficult, it can be devastating - perhaps what is at issue is our whole future!\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, from a personal perspective as well as from coaching others to release, and I think that we've finally made a major breakthrough in understanding why it's so difficult to say goodbye, and what we can do to release much faster. I'm going to share with you a few new ways that can make the difference between leaving things open or closed. This is a major breakthrough, so please keep an open mind, and if you are struggling to release something, you may want to try one, if not all of these methods.\nIf You Are Not Yet Ready To Leave An Old Pattern Behind\nAs I mentioned last week, when we feel ready to leave a pattern, we feel it in every cell in our body. It's an intuitive and physical sense of certain completeness, that nothing is missing. The emotions feel lighter, brighter, more joyful. At a soul level, everything feels just right. It's as though we have done everything we needed to do to get to this point. In the meantime, however, there are the automatic emotions that come in as our mind struggles with our intuitive feelings, our ego mind trying to find reasons we are ready to leave a certain situation. The question is, how long can it take to let the energy go?\nWhen we have an emotional attachment to something or somebody and we don't want to say goodbye, it's as though we have an energetic connection with them or the situation somehow, and the fear we feel is the fear of being hurt, of not being valued, of being abandoned, of not feeling good. But if for some reason, we believe in the good of what we're letting go of, the attachment can stay there with nothing but pain in our hearts.\nWe may do all kinds of tricks to delay the inevitable. In my case, I know I have to let go of my attachment to a certain person, but because the connection with what that person symbolizes for myself physically is strong, I have a lot of difficulty with it. So I tell myself all kinds of things to keep the connection alive:\n\"We have more in common than what you've observed. We don't need to leave, we can just change, and everything will be okay.\"\n\"We're not finished yet, just wait a little, there's still so much going on, let's just put it off a little and then we'll be able to go.\"\n\"Don't worry, your own path is lined with golden opportunities, it certainly has a reason for me to let go of you.\"\nThe truth is that even in the most obvious things in life, like knowing that there're only a few months of warm weather left or that the sun will soon be setting earlier, when it comes to releasing a pattern from our lives, many of us don't want to leave. Even if we know that leaving what we're letting go of is in our best interests for some reason, it's still very difficult to leave, and it's not necessarily our ego minds that create that difficulty.\nIn the past, for example, if it came down to me having to make a painful decision, such as whether to go to a job I hate or not have any job at all, and it was going to come down to losing everything I had (like my house, business, car, whatever), I would have a more difficult time letting go knowing that I would potentially lose everything I had. Even if I realized it was in my best interests to leave (that it had become a toxic situation, for example, or even if I was leaving so I could find something better) it just wasn't easy. And even though I knew, in my soul, that it was", "This rule revises the maximum allowable quantities of materials handled in bulk by barge from 627,722 to 1,249,431.

There are five steps:\nFirst, call 10 advertising agencies and ask: \u201cHow many advertisers do you have who are advertising this particular type of product?\u201d  Record the results.  50% of that number will be the current market. 50% is a 30% overstatement.   If in the future they find that these marketing firms are inaccurate, the 50% can be used as an estimate of the actual market size.\nIf 100 advertisers were contacted, the results would be:\n1 advertiser (1%)\n4 advertisers (4%)\n100 advertisers (100%)\nThe number recorded by the publisher will be:\n200 advertisers (20%)\nA 30% overestimate\nThe following questions also need to be asked:  50% of 200 is 100.  If the publisher starts his publication with 100 subscribers the results could be:\n900 subscribers a year later\nIf he starts his publication with 105 subscribers, the following results might be obtained:\nThis has a range from 450 to 945 subscribers within a year\nThe editor should also contact 10 readers of the magazine he is publishing and ask: \u201cHow long has it been since you last bought a product like this?\u201d  Keep records and compare the results.\nIf there are a total of 450 potential subscribers, 235 of them are old customers who have been buying the magazine for over a year.  The other 215 new subscribers, who have just started to buy the magazine, are being courted by mail and will not be interested in purchasing the product.\nThe publisher should get advice from a marketing firm before launching the magazine.  A publication like this should only be launched if a majority of the subscribers purchased a competitor's magazine three or more months ago.  The advertisers should also be asked: \u201cHow long has it been since you last had this product?\u201d\nThere will be differences between the results given by the advertisers and the results obtained from the readers.  50% of 100 represents an approximate market of 50. 50% of a 100% market is a 25% overestimate.  50% of 100 is 50; 25% short of the 200 expected by the publisher.\nThis formula can also be used with other types of publications.  For example, if the publisher wants to launch a children's sports magazine with a circulation of 400,000:\n200,000 potential subscribers\n800 potential advertisers\n2,000 possible advertisements\n50% potential subscribers (if the magazine is not unique)\n176 people buy sports magazines\n30% old subscribers\n20% old advertisers\n30% people who may buy the magazine\n176 people buy a sports magazine\n176% potential subscribers (if the magazine could generate 10 subscriptions by selling 2 advertisements)", "With an increased variety of mobile video advertising options, advertisers are seeing the promise of a mobile-first world. But mobile video is still a black-box. In the first of a two-part series, mobile industry veteran David Batchelor explains that while data and measurement are still challenges in a fragmented, emerging space, advertisers should look to new technology to unlock the value of mobile video with real impact on consumer behavior.\nBy David Batchelor, director of sales, mobile video at The Washington Post\nAdvertisers want to know that they are getting high-quality impressions within robust environments. The mobile advertising space is still very fragmented, with dozens and dozens of ad-tech vendors, publishers and apps.\nOne of the challenges in mobile is the measurement element around the technology itself.\nIn addition, in the ad-tech market, especially on the buy side, there have been mergers and acquisitions over the past few years, which have shaken up the landscape \u2014 leading to uncertainty over which ad tech vendors offer the best view of mobile inventory and the mobile ecosystem overall.\nThere are also a variety of different types of inventory and a plethora of environments, meaning measurement is very difficult. For example, how does advertising get distributed among different types of mobile inventory like app installs, non-search native and video, and how can you even account for it?\nIf someone is placing, let\u2019s say, a display campaign, they are trying to figure out what percentage of it should be targeting the mobile environment. This is a very difficult and highly inefficient process that has been a challenge for the industry.\nMobile video in particular is very black-box right now. We want the advertising world to be more educated about the state of the technology and the types of inventory that exist. It is still in its nascent stage.\nSo with all of the challenges around mobile media, why should advertisers consider using it?\nBecause we see advertisers trying to get in front of the mobile-first world. Mobile video advertising is a rapidly expanding product with a lot of promise. In recent years, we have seen huge improvements in technology, not just on the platform side with mobile-first video, but also on the attribution side.\nThere is the option right now to create a measurement footprint across different types of mobile inventory and different vendor platforms on the buy side. We\u2019re also seeing technology that can help advertisers better manage their campaigns, especially their mobile videos, on the sell side.\nWhen we\u2019re talking about attribution, we\u2019re talking about helping clients understand where all that impressions occurred, understanding if they are occurring in the right places and what types of formats people are engaging with.\nIf you look at mobile video today, especially in a news environment or any other kind of brand media, it\u2019s hard to even really tell whether something is actually working.\nSo you have a mobile video ad in an app, in an environment where you aren\u2019t seeing any consumer metrics about performance. There is a black box with a bunch of technology that is all kind of coming together.\nThere are technology companies that enable advertisers to better understand what is ultimately happening with the impressions they\u2019re buying. They can determine where things are occurring, how long people are staying, what their attention look-path is like \u2014 all of those factors are ultimately tied to what the advertiser is trying to accomplish.\nIn theory, you can attribute things to certain behaviors. But in reality, because the mobile platform itself is still very fragmented, it can be difficult to get your arms around.\nFrom an advertising perspective, we\u2019re starting to see some progressive trends. Some of the ad-tech companies are working to unify some of these different pieces of the puzzle. So as you see a lot of the ad tech vendors coming together, you can see a lot of the mobile environments coming together, too.\nFor the brand advertiser, we see marketers who want to better understand their campaigns using attribution so they can determine what\u2019s driving their business, where the KPIs are, what the ROIs are, etc. The next step is to better assess the impact that their ads are having on the user from a behavioral perspective. Is it actually driving somebody to go do something, whether it\u2019s to read news, to make a purchase?\nIf you think about the progression of media over the years, from radio to TV to print to digital, we\u2019re really at the nascent stage of mobile. Mobile video specifically is going to continue to proliferate and grow. If that\u2019s the case, the technology, the way to do things needs to catch up", "A successful newsroom is like a successful restaurant: It has an engaging and appealing environment that's inviting and entices readers to spend their hard-earned dollars. It's a place that not only offers them a great experience but makes them want to come back for more. A restaurant's most powerful selling tool? Food. Likewise, a newsroom's selling tool is a great environment. One that makes readers eager to return, get a new story, and maybe even share it with friends.\nAs the New York Times described, \"The new New York Times building, with its glass facade and its grand stairway, was not the product of some bold new design strategy. Rather, it was the most important work done in the Times' newsroom in recent years.\"\nNEWSROOM ARCHITECTURE: A NEW CHALLENGE\nThese words, in this article from 2007, could well have applied to the Chicago Tribune's new newsroom. While this office may not have a \"grand stairway\" at the main entrance, it is a bold step up from its former space. As mentioned earlier, the Tribune's new newsroom architecture has been well written up in many ways, the best of which can be found on Tribune blogger Eric Zorn's own site, Eric Zorn's Chicago. For example, as I perused \"Celebrating a new home for the Tribune,\" I found a blog entry describing one aspect of the new newsroom: a staircase. While this may sound like every other staircase, it's an architectural and design feature on this floor that was not found in the newsroom's previous space.\nEric Zorn, Tribune blogger\nSo in many respects, the new newsroom has some pretty cool architectural features. Yet, perhaps the most important feature is not any one specific element. Rather, it's the new environment that it affords. No, it doesn't have a pool table, or a bar. However, it does have features that are arguably much more important-features that, for example, enable \"spontaneous\" collaboration.\n\"The old office's cubicle system was designed to maximize space utilization,\" I wrote in my earlier post. \"The new newsroom is designed to facilitate collaboration and cross-coverage.\"\nFrom a physical standpoint, that entails much more than just a row or two of open cubicles. Rather, it's the open layout and lack of dividers or walls between cubicles. Also, it's the inclusion of conference rooms and collaboration areas that are intentionally designed for two or more people to work in together. In the old newsroom, these spaces were small, cramped cubicles off the main floor. In the new newsroom, there are many of them that have a spaciousness comparable to what was once found in only one old work space. In short, the new newsroom makes for a much more productive working environment. So much so that many of the new features that the Tribune embraced are being imitated around world in newsrooms-including the Chicago Tribune's own online newsroom (here's where our readers and our staff collaborate).\nIn turn, much of this is a product of the changes that have taken place in newsroom organizational structure. The old tribune newsroom was essentially a big newsroom, divided up into departmental offices. So while news editors, for instance, met at the main \"news desk\" of the old newsroom, most of the work of gathering and organizing the local news-through the old separate assignment system-was done in individual desks. The new \"group news desk\"-with its open layout- is a very different structure. This is because its emphasis is on having news gathered in close proximity, to increase the collaborative nature of news gathering and editing. In keeping with these organizational changes, the Tribune also reevaluated the amount of physical space needed by different kinds of work. With the new news organization, the new \"group news desk\" space was a more efficient space for this type of news gathering and coordination.\nAnother change was the newsroom's former emphasis on news desks, as opposed to workstations. That's another benefit of the new collaboration spaces. The openness and lack of dividers between workstations makes it much easier for coworkers to share ideas and work at the same time.\nFinally, the new newsroom emphasizes being an active part of the community-especially where local issues are concerned. This is very evident in its new collaboration spaces. This is evident in the way that the new newsroom is much more open", "In a recent article, The New York Times gave the impression that some scientists had actually found an actual cause and effect relationship between saturated fat intake and the heart disease epidemic. However, not one of the scientists with results implying a causal link (the \u201cChina Study\u201d by Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Ancel Keys\u2019s work on the Mediterranean diet, and Dr. Mary Enig\u2019s work on trans fats) has been able to substantiate his claim in a randomized controlled trial. This begs the question: How well can one scientific study really represent the entire picture?\nThe New York Times article of 8\u20139 August on the relationship of the dietary fat intake to chronic degenerative diseases was clearly overstated. In fact, only one out of four studies cited and referred to in the article had any real relevance to dietary fat intake and its relationship to disease; the other three appeared to be merely descriptive of particular geographic regions and dietary traditions where various diseases were less prevalent, rather than conclusive of a dietary relationship. There is nothing unusual or surprising about a study of a particular population\u2019s diet in the same locale and over the same time period showing the incidences of various disease syndromes to be less than those reported for the United States and other industrialized countries.\nThe first study cited (and not even acknowledged in this article by the New York Times), was Dr. Ancel Keys\u2019 work on the Mediterranean diet, which, as previously explained to your audience, was an association \u2013 not causal data. If the dietary fat intake of the population in one geographic region was, in fact, less due to their being less wealthy and thus less access to meat and dairy products; if, indeed, their higher consumption of wine and olive oil actually mitigated some of the effects of the lower fat intakes, the Mediterranean dietary pattern would still be associated with less chronic degenerative diseases even if the population ate more meat and diary products and consumed less calories and wine as they got more money to pay for these commodities for themselves!\nThe second study referred to, Dr. T. Colin Campbell\u2019s study of the dietary habits of rural Chinese and their reported heart disease, diabetes, and cancer incidences, has recently become more well-known due to his self-promoting book The China Study, which gives the impression that, somehow, the foods of rural China are more protective of all three of chronic degenerative diseases than the foods consumed in urban China, despite the fact that the rural Chinese diet is more prone to being deficient in calories.\nDr. Campbell\u2019s survey is at best merely descriptive, and if what he says, for the population studied, dietary fat intake is, in fact, what \u201cprotective\u201d and therefore, is due only to being better off financially, rather than necessarily being more healthful to eat the diet, his results would still be correct. This is the way the scientific process works, and the scientific method is based upon hypothesis testing; if the hypotheses are invalidated, the entire scientific hypothesis must be reconsidered and, if possible, revalidated.\nDr. Campbell\u2019s initial hypothesis, that a high intake of saturated fat led to various chronic degenerative diseases, was rejected by his most recent findings and his study appears to confirm the traditional epidemiological findings of Dr. Ancel Keys 25\u201335 years ago. Thusly, it would appear that further studies of this hypothesis, that dietary saturated fat intake was, or is, a cause of various chronic degenerative diseases, will need to be further substantiated; we are a long way from an absolute causal relationship.\nThe third study referred to as being a study by Dr. Mary Enig that trans fats from vegetable oils might be a cause of chronic degenerative diseases, is the only study referred to with any real validity (despite the fact that this study has been published and was originally peer-reviewed and accepted for publication) in support of the hypothesis that saturated fat intake causes such degenerative diseases. In this study, the subjects were fed an intake of about 65% saturated fat and about 7% total-trans fat as a percentage of caloric intake. This was about the same percentage of trans fat intake as that of the average person who consumed the \u201cMediterranean\u201d or average American diet.

Once these requirements are captured, the code will\nbe refactored to conform more completely to the SRS.\nThis document looks at how to proceed with the refactoring as\nthe project progresses toward completion.

The \"pilot\" branch must be maintained for\ntesting new releases of the mainline. (Maintaining trunk is out of\nscope for this document).\nThis document is useful for anyone who is responsible for ensuring\nthat the \"pilot\" branch is in good working order.

The key is not just to talk about how important a newspaper is, but rather to demonstrate it. In other words, publishers must be active partners within their communities.\nWHEN IT COMES to a discussion on being a good community member, many newspaper publishers will turn a few shades of red, saying to themselves, \u201cOh, I think we're doing all right.\u201d\nHowever, if you talk to residents of the Chicago area, a common theme among newspapers is that they are not serving readers well, that the newspapers do not even appear to belong to the community.\nThe Chicago Tribune is known throughout the Midwest as a newspaper of record; it has served the community for over 100 years. It has no local competition; it also spends a great deal of time and money to try to be a good member of the community it covers.\nWhat is one of the biggest complaints the Chicago Tribune receives? They just don't know their audience. They know what their audience does, how many of them do it and where they do it, but they don't know who their audience is as people, as individuals.\nAnd this is true of other newspapers that have been around for decades.\nMany newspapers are still fighting the \u201clocal newspaper versus out-of-town newspaper\u201d battle. People will pay more to read about themselves in an out-of-town publication because it feels important. But how can your community support such efforts when you are not there for them? A newspaper cannot be successful when it is being ignored.\nMany local newspapers are not reaching the community because they do not participate in the community; they do not know how. Publishers need to learn how to become an active member of the community they serve.\nWhen publishers are asked why they don't serve the community better, they usually say, \u201cYou are right. But how can we? It is just not in our business model.\u201d\nI would like to propose a new model for newspapers, or rather an enhancement to it. There is a basic newspaper business model:\n? News, information and entertainment are produced by a staff of journalists who are the face of your company.\n? A sales force delivers the news, information and entertainment to readers in the form of paid content, ads and ancillary services.\n? Marketing and advertising services enhance a company's visibility and establish a greater brand for the organization.\n? Support and administrative functions maintain the organization.\nThese four components of the classic business model make a newspaper organization run. A publisher manages these functions.\nBut what if publishers took steps to make newspapers members of the community; to enhance their visibility, their social responsibility and their ability to support the community? What if a newspaper organization focused on:\n? Selling the newspaper to the entire community, not just its subscribers. How do I do that? What works?\n? Serving the community with information through a community-wide effort with other organizations that share the same objective. We call it a 360-degree effort; others have called it \u201ccitizen journalism.\u201d\n? Promoting and enhancing the visibility of the newspaper organization.\n? Selling space to advertisers in a manner that also promotes the community and the newspaper simultaneously.\nSome community support activities, in addition to the above, that publishers might consider would include:\n? Supporting high school sports programs. The local paper is generally the biggest advertiser in such programs. But what if they were also the main sponsor for local teams?\n? Hosting or sponsoring local events such as holiday celebrations, charitable events, etc.\n? Providing community information and services such as directories.\nMany publishers have a reputation for being reclusive, not reaching out to the community but preferring to remain in their \u201civory towers\u201d and making news rather than being news. Perhaps that is because they do not feel they are part of the community. But publishers can change this mindset.\nThe role of a publisher is not just to be a leader in the newspaper organization. It is also to lead the community through visibility.\nThere are a number of community-involvement campaigns, but few of them are focused on a newspaper organization that seeks to serve the entire community.\nCommunal involvement for newspapers will help build greater awareness, brand and loyalty for the organization.\nThe newspaper is the most powerful organ in the community because it is the only one that touches all of its residents multiple times a week. Each resident will have a relationship with the newspaper organization multiple times a week.\nThe community's interest and support are the key to building a strong", "Leading online publisher creates content to be the \u201cbest place on the web\u201d for its users.\nWhat content strategy is a must-read for industry decision-makers? The Verge covers tech news, culture, music, comedy, and other topics. It launched in March 2011 and quickly became one of the most-important websites for young people in the space.\nIt covers all aspects of tech and tech culture, from the latest developments in space and automotive news to a series called \u201cTech IRL\u201d which focuses on the intersection of tech and society by exploring topics like body positivity and health. The Verge is editorially led by a three-person core team and has grown to about 13 core editorial staff members today, all of whom handle a significant share of the publication\u2019s responsibilities.\nFollowing a model of creating a comprehensive daily editorial calendar across the site, it is no surprise that The Verge has been a consistent performer in the CMSC industry report.\nTo learn more about its strategy, I interviewed James Verity, editor in chief at The Verge. James told me that The Verge\u2019s newsroom prioritizes the creation of content that is the best place on the web to get a story, from technology to culture. James attributes the site\u2019s performance, in part, to its focus on creating a unique voice for its audience that speaks to \u201cthe people who actually mattered in the tech world, and not just the people who say they matter.\u201d\nAt the core is a belief in telling stories that are relevant to an audience\u2019s real lives. As James put it, \u201cWe want to be a place that readers come back to every day because it\u2019s like coming back home.\u201d With this as a foundational principle, The Verge has created content aimed at all of its readers, including young adults and families, by covering relevant cultural news and music reviews. The site has also attracted high-profile journalistic contributors, such as the Verge\u2019s long-running \u201cClockwise,\u201d which has been known to profile prominent industry influencers such as Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.\nWith this background, James shared six questions with me about the site\u2019s content strategy.\nWhy is a comprehensive content marketing strategy so important to The Verge\u2019s success?\nOur strategy is driven by three things: creating the best place on the web to get a story; investing in deep audience analysis (which has involved looking to data mining, using behavioral economics to study attention, and even enlisting people into our own focus groups); and always making sure we have something for absolutely every single demographic \u2014 that includes people that are new to tech (or maybe don\u2019t even get that interested in tech) and also for people that really care about tech and culture. That last one is where we end up focusing most of our energy, but I think one of the elements that helps drive our success is really getting to understand what types of stories drive our audience to tune in every day. As a result of this analysis, we have a pretty good sense of how to build a daily editorial calendar with a mix of stories, a mix of types of news and a mix of the type of features that will engage our audience the most.\nHow does The Verge develop its story ideas?\nWe use data from a lot of different sources, so we look at the most frequently searched news stories, things like top technology stories or top entertainment stories to see what our readers are interested in. We look at our own editorial analytics, and for that we have internal metrics that are like a real time clickstream. If we see, for example, that a specific story about smartphones gets a big spike in traffic with a specific day and time, we know, well, maybe people who are interested in that type of story would be interested in other stories and content as well.\nWe also look to external metrics as well. For example, we use a tool called DataSift to look at social networks like Facebook and Twitter and pull data there to see what topics are on our community\u2019s mind \u2014 things like gaming, new phones, new services, things like that.\nAnd then lastly, we also do what I guess is maybe the most unglamorous way that I mentioned before, where we get involved with our audience. Some examples of that here include things like creating a weekly \u201cClockwise\u201d feature, where three of our staff members will pick out some of the tech news that they found interesting from that week.\nHow does The Verge define success for its content strategy?\nThe goal for success is really to provide to our readers an experience that is different.

It started slow for me, which might be natural\nafter having taken off for two and a half weeks in Maui over Christmas for\nmy brother's wedding. But I managed to hit the 750-word-per-day goal over\nthe next week, and, after a week of little more than 1,500 words per\nday, I've hit that goal nearly every day I worked on \"The Praying\nMantis Solution.\" As of today, I have written 26,375 words in 16 days. If\nI keep this up, I should have a first draft in about four weeks. If you\nwere wondering, that's about 4,000 words per day.\nThe interesting thing is that my daily word counts are coming down to\nabout 1,700 words, which is close to my average from \"Half Past Midnight.\"\nI know I'm writing faster -- I wrote 5,280 words a day on this current book\njust two weeks ago! -- but I don't know if I wrote any better.\nOne problem is that I don't seem to be rewriting from the latest draft\nto the last draft on this one, as I do when I'm revising my first draft.\nFor the first few days, I got my word counts mostly by adding to the scene\nI was working on as an afternoon exercise. Then I realized that I could\nbe writing something completely different, but still be adding to the overall\ncount. That is, writing scenes that have nothing to do with the book\nI'm working on, or working out another book or scene entirely. I ended\nup with the same amount of writing done, but a lot more words this way.\nI'd really like to see how I do if I go back and actually fix my work from\neach night as I go, rather than trying to make my day's work fit with\nwhat I'd done the previous day. I don't think this book will be significantly\nbetter, but it probably will be faster.\nMy goal is 3,000 words a day, which should be about average over the\ncourse of several weeks. And I think I'll have something by April --\nand maybe earlier, if I keep it up.

That\u2019s one of the findings of a report presented at a recent Poynter seminar on mobile sites, apps, and advertising.\nThe seminar, hosted by Poynter and sponsored by a group of journalism and technology companies, also addressed a range of topics important to publishers pursuing a deeper mobile engagement strategy.\n\u2022 In the first study of its kind, the Poynter Institute research team found that when consumers access their local newspaper\u2019s smartphone site, they\u2019re twice as likely to read articles as when they visit from tablets.\n\u2022 Mobile\u2019s growth and the ubiquitous nature of 4G LTE networks made it obvious that smartphone subscriptions would account for more of a\nnewspaper\u2019s profits. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a question any more,\u201d said Poynter\u2019s Jeff Sonderman. \u201cIt was going to happen.\u201d At the same time, he said, the number of tablet subscriptions \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be more than 10 to 15 percent of their circulation,\u201d adding, \u201cAt best, a couple of percent.\u201d\n\u2022 A study that included more than 200 mobile-centric websites, apps, and advertising campaigns revealed that publishers found it\u2019s\ndifficult to connect with smartphone users, although the same wasn\u2019t found to be true for tablet users, said Sonderman. The\nfindings include, among others:\n\uf0d8 One in five consumers said their smartphone app was one of only three apps they used on daily, while one in 10 said they had more than 10 apps on their phone. (The report is available at www.poynter.org/mobile-publishing-mobile-advertising.)\n\uf0d8 Mobile users aren\u2019t interested in news brands as much as they are in categories such as food, travel, weather, and entertainment.\n\uf0d8 Users aren\u2019t necessarily looking for the latest news on their smartphones, they said they primarily want advice and opinion.\nThe main difference between the smartphone and the tablet audience is users are more inclined to buy a product or service on a mobile device, an additional reason why news sources need to ensure all the basic information is available on their smartphone sites, Sonderman said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a native mobile app, people will never download that and they never engage,\u201d said Sonderman. In\naddition, if your smartphone site isn\u2019t up to standard, chances are you\u2019ll lose money if it\u2019s on your own homepage or\nanother advertiser\u2019s site.\n\u2022 In a study that included information from more than 200 mobile-centric websites, apps, and advertising campaigns, the Poynter research team analyzed engagement metrics and the impact on consumer behavior, said Sharon Barker, director of digital services for the research team.\nThe team discovered publishers struggle to connect with smartphone users. The study\u2019s findings include, among others:\n\uf0d8 Publishers found it difficult to connect with smartphone users; one in five said their mobile apps were one of three apps they\ndownloaded, while one in 10 said three or more were downloaded. In addition, the study found, 17 percent downloaded\na mobile app in the past week.\n\uf0d8 Users aren\u2019t interested in news brands as much as categories such as food, travel, weather, and entertainment.\n\uf0d8 The average number of downloads for the most popular apps was only 200,000, whereas most publishers needed to exceed\n1 million for their apps to be more successful. \u201cAs much as we like numbers, there are diminishing returns with apps,\u201d\nsaid Barker. \u201cThere is not a one-to-one relationship with downloads and profit. We have to be realistic in how\nwe think about mobile apps.\u201d Barker\u2019s presentation is available at\nhttp://bit.ly/U4hU00.\n\uf0d8 Readers want to connect with brands\u2019 experts on the apps. For example, a woman who took her grocery list from her\nkitchen into a grocery store found she needed more information on the store\u2019s products, said Barker. A grocery\nstore that has an app would be a more relevant source for the customer who wants information or who\nwants to comparison shop. \u201cThose are the kinds of things we can do with mobile apps, but I believe we", "An interesting set-to between the Guardian's Paul Lewis and the Telegraph's James Forsyth, in which it was established that most people know very little about climate change, and that the Daily Wail probably knows the least.\nPOLITICALLY ASSOCIATED STORY: This is a story about how well Britain knows about climate change (which has more to do with the Telegraph at the moment, really), but as far as the political climate in Britain is concerned, it's about the Tories' inability to get the Conservative Home website to publish comment from Conservative Home.\nCULTURALLY ASSOCIATED STORY: There's a new website called \"The Lefty Bookshelf,\" and I can say with confidence that it's exactly what it should be - a repository of literature on the subjects of economics, politics, and the culture wars from the left of British politics.\nIn the Guardian there's a very interesting little item about the difficulty of getting the Telegraph to publish comment on its website. Why is this important? Because Telegraph readers are far from typical of those who read other papers:\nBut, while Telegraph readers are among the most highly educated in the country, they are also the most politically extreme; the paper has the highest proportion of \"extremists\" for any national British paper - and twice as many as any other title, even the Mail on Sunday.\nEighty-two per cent of Telegraph readers - compared with 43 per cent on The Guardian - are \"extremists\", according to one of the first studies to track the political leanings of newspaper readers. A second study, which is due to be published next week, backs this up.\nSo this means that while most people in Britain have very little knowledge of climate change, they do know that the average Tory is in favour of it. There's also quite a lengthy profile of Andrew Rawnsley, who is quite obviously the Telegraph's idea of a proper political journo. If David Mellor is anything to go by, then these people are all quite similar. I'm not even going to link to this, mostly because you might just want to avoid the Telegraph altogether.\nThe comment piece is by none other than Paul Lewis of the Guardian on the subject of whether the British people know anything about climate change. Lewis's main point is that most people think it's the weather, and hence that a) it's not as catastrophic as some people make out, and b) the British media is bad at communicating the problem. He also points out that this is, in general, a widespread issue - although he concentrates on Britain, the French and German citizens are even less au fait with the basics.\nWhile Lewis is trying to do the Guardian's version of a political blog, he's not actually taking any action in the comments section - the comments there are all coming from the likes of Michael White and Polly Toynbee, people you'd expect it from, and people the readers know already - and the point is still that the media only communicates so much of the information that the people who aren't interested in it won't pay attention to it. We can see this at the moment with the government on all sorts of things - the media has made them listen on crime, asylum seekers, benefits, and they have listened, but they still don't listen on immigration, which is largely because most people don't care.\nIn the meantime, the government has been swayed and changed its mind on a number of fronts. On crime, they're looking to introduce control orders; on asylum, they're looking to tighten up the system even further; on welfare payments, they're looking to make sure they're available to people with serious disabilities, and, most importantly, on immigration, they're looking to bring in the Points Based System, which, if it's implemented properly, will work better than the previous ones, and will cut the current economic migrants from the system. There's a lot of politics involved in this, which is why the media has been covering immigration so much recently, but that hasn't had its intended result yet, and won't for a little while, if at all.\nI'm not sure how \"interested\" people get in climate change, but I'm sure it'll start working out in a few years' time. Most of the public knows very little about it right now, although it is being discussed more (see \"Economy\" below).\nNow the government has started talking about it, you can be sure that it's not going to stop any time", "A former FHFA director pled the Fifth Amendment when asked why the GSEs had not been wound down\nCourt Allows FHFA to Wrap Up the GSEs' Conservatorships\nWhat's New: A former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) pled the Fifth Amendment to avoid answering questions during a Congressional Oversight meeting in January about why the agency did not wind down the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) as ordered by a federal judge in 2011.\nThe Congressional Oversight panel's chairman and ranking member have sued the FHFA and the GSEs' conservator for access to documents regarding the GSEs' conservatorships after the director's refusal to appear.\nThe judge overseeing the GSEs' conservatorships gave permission and encouragement to FHFA to seek a dismissal motion and has asked for a report providing a detailed timeline of the agency's decisions.\nThe conservatorships have been under court review since 2009, and a federal judge has already ordered the government to make the GSEs \"independent entities.\"\nWhy is this Important?: Questions are being asked how the agency can wind up the conservatorships while the courts have indicated that they will have to be dissolved. Concerns are being raised that, given new mortgage guidelines recently announced, the GSEs' role and their impact on the market could become more entrenched.\nLawsuits Seeks Documents from GSE Conservatorship\nReuters reported that a lawsuit seeking court documents in a bid to uncover the Federal Housing Finance Agency and GSE conservatorships is a sign of frustration by many who have not been able to understand the GSEs' actions in recent years.\nThe lawsuit filed by the U.S.\u2019 congressional oversight committee is against the FHFA for refusal to comply with a subpoena for documents and to make a former chief of the agency, Edward DeMarco, to attend a meeting and answer questions. The refusal to give documents is the first time the committee has ever taken legal action about the agency.\nThe lawsuit is also against the FHFA\u2019s conservator for the GSEs, and seeks court documents to help shed light on the GSEs\u2019 actions following an order issued by a Washington lawsuit judge in 2011 to wind-down the GSEs in 2012. The judge was reviewing the agency\u2019s role in overseeing the GSEs after the GSEs\u2019 demise would have resulted in the loss of the taxpayer-funded subsidy for more than 30 million borrowers.\nAt the time of the judge's order, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Emergency Lending Assistance (ELA) program was to wind down in September of that year. The FHFA refused to wind-down the GSEs immediately and instead created a series of other steps to wind up the enterprises, including buying back bad loans and allowing a $1.5 trillion debt issue to go to market to fund lending.\nThe committee sued the FHFA in September of 2014 after a subpoena for documents over the agency\u2019s decisions to refrain from winding the GSEs down was denied. The committee claimed it had not received the more than 500,000 documents requested from the agency, and it was only able to acquire the documents after Judge Lamberth granted the committee access to the documents. The committee has claimed that by the agency withholding the documents, it is violating the Freedom of Information Act.\nThe committee also claimed that FHFA had misled lawmakers by claiming that the agency\u2019s decision to keep the GSEs going was because Judge Lamberth\u2019s order would have been \u201cdifficult to administratively manage.\u201d\nThe lawsuit has also claimed that the agency\u2019s refusal to provide information was due to the committee\u2019s role in holding FHFA accountable regarding its conservatorship of the GSEs, which the suit claimed was the reason for withholding documents.\nOn January 6, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted the congressional lawsuit\u2019s demands that Edward Demarco answer questions regarding the reasons for the FHFA\u2019s decisions. In the lawsuit, the committee claimed DeMarco was an obstructionist \u201cenriching the coffers of Fann", "___________________________________________\nMassachusetts District 4:\nSenator Ed Fitzgerald (R) vs.\nRepresentative John A.

John Regan is a\nlegislator who has been in the statehouse for several\nyears now.  John Regan has represented the 10th\nMiddlesex District in the Massachusetts House of\nRepresentatives for over ten years, and has also served\nas a Middlesex County Commissioner.  In 1993, Regan\nwas a candidate for Secretary of State, the highest\nelected position in Massachusetts, and he came in second\nto Shannon O'Brien.  Ed Fitzgerald is a sitting state\nsenator, and is a very conservative Republican.  He has\nstated that he is a pro-life candidate, which certainly\nplays well in a very heavy Democrat-favoring district.\nIn July 2005, Fitzgerald was elected 4th-ranking\nmember in the state senate, which gives him a\npermanent seat on the senate chamber floor.  The\nMassachusetts Senate is made up of forty seats, one\nfor each district.  When a member retires or is\ndefeated in his reelection, the candidate who won that\ndistrict seat takes his old seat.  Since John Regan\ndecided to run for the senate, that means that the\nvacancy would normally go to Regan under Massachusetts\nThe problem for Ed Fitzgerald is that the district for the\nsenate is very heavily Democrat-favoring.  Even in the\n2000 Presidential Election, John Kerry had won 58% of\nthe vote in the 4th district.  The 10th Middlesex\nDistrict, which Regan represents, is so heavily\nRepublican-favoring that his seat would have gone to the\nman who finished in 10th place in the district.  For\nexample, in 2004, Republican Ed Fitzgerald won 59% of\nthe vote in the district race, yet the man who won his\nseat did not even get 30% of the votes.  In the\npresidential election, Kerry won the district by a\nmargin of at least 60% to 40%.\nTherefore, it seems that the Massachusetts Senate\nCommittee will select a republican to fill the seat.\nThe committee has said that they will try select a\nmajority-favorite candidate by holding a primary.\nTherefore, if there are at least two republican\ncandidates in the primary, then they will select one of\nthem to fill the vacant Senate seat.\nFortunately for Ed Fitzgerald, however, in the 2004\nPresidential Primary, the Massachusetts Primary was the\nfirst state-by-state primary in the nation.  The fact\nthat John Kerry did so well in one primary led to\nhim being the presidential nominee, and he led the\nDemocratic ticket in Massachusetts.  In Massachusetts,\na candidate who wins the primary will not win the seat\nunless he wins the general election, so the fact that\nFitzgerald won by a landslide in the primary is a good\nindication that he would have won a landslide in the\ngeneral election had he chosen to do so.\nThe Massachusetts State Government has been a very\nDemocratic-favoring government since at least 1857.\nThe 1st District of Massachusetts was won by John\nBayard", "In a move as controversial as New Coke, The New York Times announced a dramatic change today in its iconic front page, making it all one picture and dropping the traditional black and white photograph.\n\"We believe that people get news from a variety of sources and that photographs are but one source of information, not an end in themselves, \" said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times.\nThe new photo will be more likely to evoke discussion and argument than the traditional picture, said a spokesperson.\n\"People can be more likely than otherwise to engage in discussions of the merits of photographs than they do about articles,\" said Mr. Sulzberger. \"More importantly, by the use of a single photograph, we can better control the context in which the newspaper is read and viewed, and better connect the pieces of information we present to provide a more nuanced, if more confusing, perspective.\"\nAt a meeting with a few staff members yesterday morning, the decision was made following a presentation by the paper\u2019s new deputy features editor, Amelia Bedelia D\u2019Onfrio. Amelia, whose title was previously \"Editorial Features Assistant\", demonstrated how people looking at a newspaper for a minute (3 minutes if people had a problem with the format change) would be distracted by the multiple layers of information and would not be able to process the information quickly enough to be able to act on it, or even remember it, in a short time. She also pointed out that, in a study of photojournalism students, even they got distracted by the photograph and did not remember much of the information.\nShe argued that the photograph was actually an obstacle to communicating information, an interruption. In the end, the editors agreed she was right.\nThis may not be the only change to The New York Times: the paper\u2019s traditional typeface has been dropped in favour of Garamond, and a single column of type, rather than multiple columns, will be used. \"We have to try all the time to make it more reader-friendly,\" said Mr. Sulzberger.\nNew York Post: \"Paper of Record Becomes Front Page of Newspaper!\"\nLos Angeles Times: \"Front Page is Now Back!\"\nWashington Post: \"It\u2019s About Time!\"\nChicago Tribune: \"Painful, But Necessary!\"", "We propose to revise and clarify a Start Printed Page 37405regulatory provision to assist in clarifying the proper scope of a patent, and to include an additional requirement in the regulations regarding the applicability of statutory bar provisions.\nDATES: Written comments on this proposal are due June 24, 2005.\nADDRESSES: Any written comments on this proposal may be provided to the Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Suite 5000, Washington, DC 20530 and be hand delivered to the Department of Justice, United States Attorney General Building, J Street, Washington, DC 20530.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James D. Burton, of the Antitrust Division, telephone number (202) 307-0964; or John W. Wodatch, Chief, Civil Division, (202) 307-1868.\nThe Clayton Act prohibits corporate mergers, acquisitions or asset purchases, which are likely to be substantially to lessen competition or create a monopoly. Section 7 of the Clayton Act contains an exception for acquisitions of patents, processes, formulas, patent models or copies of papers when the acquisition will not substantially lessen competition or monopolize any line of commerce.\nAn application to acquire all of the assets of a company is generally deemed to involve an acquisition of the company's process of doing business. The exception is not available when applied to all the assets of the company. An exception is also not available for an acquisition of all of the patents of the company. This is because by definition the patents of a company are not part of its process of doing business.\nThe issue for determining whether a patent is part of its process of doing business concerns the scope of a patent. Section 1.370(b) currently provides that a patent shall be construed consistent with its character and nature. A patent has \u201ccharacter and nature\u201d only when it is incorporated into a process of doing business. However, when the patent is only a component of one or more steps of a process, it has scope greater than its character and nature. Thus, a process can have several components, and one or more of the components may be patented. When this occurs, the patented component does not enjoy the privilege of a patent because it is already incorporated as a separate step in a process. However, that component does have a limited scope because, like any invention, it is encompassed by the claims of the patent. A patent is not part of a process \u201cas a whole.\u201d Therefore, the patent can be sold, licensed, assigned or otherwise be disposed of without jeopardizing, to any significant degree, the ability to do business under the patent. In contrast, if the patented component is part of the process \u201cas a whole,\u201d as when an entire process is patented, then the patented component encompasses all of the steps of that process. As a result, when the patented component is sold, licensed, assigned or otherwise disposed of, the patent holder loses the ability to do business or sell a related process under the patent.\nAs a practical matter, patent holders often attempt to obtain both an exclusively licensed process, and an exclusively licensed patented component of that process. However, there exists a potential risk that the holder of the patent, because it is unlicensed with respect to its other steps, could have its process considered monopolistic and could fail the exception to liability analysis applied by the Division to Section 7 transactions. If the process as a whole, not just the patented component therein, is performed by the patent holder, the holder is unlicensed and potentially subject to a potential challenge under Section 5 of the Clayton Act. That would occur, for example, where a patent has been exclusively licensed under Section 1.370(b), but the patent holder is unlicensed with respect to other steps necessary for the performance of the patented process. Moreover, if the patented component is sold to a third party who then performs the process using the patent holder's patented component and non-patented component, or sells to such a third party a process that uses two other patents together with the patented component, there is a potential for the patent holder to be unlicensed with respect to both its patent and its non-patented component. In this situation,", "490350  \nDUE IN: 03/30/1995  \nDATE: 03/30/1995\nLt. Governor's Office  \n  To:  Chief of Staff from:  JFV  \n Subj:  Sick Child?\nJay-Jay,\n  What do the papers say?

The rule requires\nnew engines to have low NOx emissions in both\nhot and cold conditions to insure that NOx is\nnot a barrier to a satisfactory power\ncertification. It is expected that the new\nengines will allow locomotives to be retrofitted\nwith the EPA certified diesel\nengine to be used to obtain\nemission reductions credit to meet the EPA\nsulfur regulations and to be retrofitted\neasily to\nmeet future emission levels to be finalized\nThe proposed NOx controls are expected to\nachieve a 30 percent reduction in NOx\nemissions from current engines. This will improve\nthe operation of the railroad system and the\nhealth of the environment. This change is due\nto be phased-in beginning with phase I engines,\nmanufactured in 1997 through the beginning of\n2008, through a 2004 and 2008 Phase II and III\nThe rulemaking provides a compliance\nschedule based on engine model year and a\nschedule for manufacturers to obtain sufficient\nemission data\nfor an emissions level for compliant engines.\n2.0 Background and Need for Rule\nThis rule requires manufacturers of new\nmodel locomotive diesel engines to meet a more\nstringent NOx\nemission standard beginning 1 January 2008.\nThis standard provides incentives for locomotive\nmanufacturers to move toward the Phase I, II,\nand III levels for NOx emissions. Each Phase\nlevel requires a more stringent standard than\nthe previous level. This is a result of the EPA\ndetermining that the locomotive manufacturing\nindustry is willing and able to meet the\nstandards. The rule also promotes the health and\nsafety of the public by creating more cost\neffective railroad operations.\nEPA believes that new Phase I, II, and III\nlocomotives will greatly reduce exposure to\nNO2, NOX, soot,\nparticulates, and HC. The\nprimary emission effects\nof locomotive diesel emission standards\nconcern health and welfare, including\nacute respiratory effects and\nsusceptible and sensitive\npopulations.  EPA\nfurther believes that the NOX\nstandards will enable\nthe railroad system to reduce the\noperational costs related to\ncontrolled emissions.  These\ncontrolled emissions costs\ninclude costs for equipment, control\nsystems, inspection and maintenance, and related\nassociated costs resulting from locomotive\nemissions standards.\nUnder 40 CFR 89, EPA has been implementing\nthe locomotive emission standard requirements\nfor more than three decades.  Since the inception\nof the regulation,\nEPA has required that control systems on the\nengines used on the locomotives have a design\ncertified emission\nrate of 3.0\ng/bhp-hr sulfur and\n2.6 g/bhp-hr NOx\nwhich translates to a 0.10 g/bhp-hr soot\nand HC emissions cap.  Since this\nlocomotive emission standard was\nfirst regulated in 1975,\nEPA has revised it on four separate\nperiods: 1981, 1985,\nand 1993.  In each instance, EPA\nintroduced emission standards that\nwere stricter than its previous standard,\nincreasing the emission standards by up to 50\npercent incrementally.  The most recent locomotive\nstandard included a 1.0\ng/bhp-hr sulfur standard and\n2.6 g/bhp-hr 3-way NOx\nstandard which was introduced on 1\nThe 0.75 level for soot and\nHC was implemented in 1985 with only a\n25-percent reduction in SOx\nemissions on the engines relative to 1993\nstandard.  This\nwas an effort to deal with problems of engine\nemissions for the time which were known to be a\nmain source of diesel engine SO2 emissions\nin urban\nareas.  This 1985 standard was implemented as\nthe only available technology available to meet\nthe emission requirements at the time.  However,\nEPA has been working to develop technology to\nreduce engine\nemissions beyond", "The proposed regulations would replace certain provisions of NFPA 1, Uniform Fire Code and NFPA 101. The proposal also updates and extends fire prevention regulations throughout Title 6 of the New York rules, Title 7 of N.Y.C. Administrative Code, and several other chapters of the Rules of the City of New York.\n OBJECTIVE: New fire safety regulations are required. Proposed regulations would reflect current codes and best industry practices and incorporate new technology, including high-rise buildings and technologies that have significant fire and life safety benefits. These updated rules are needed to prevent fires, fire-related injuries and deaths among the City's residents, visitors and employees.\n FINAL BACKGROUND: These proposed regulations are being proposed as an extension of the NYC Building Code and its enabling provisions, and, thus, the adoption of proposed rules is subject to the applicable provisions of the State Uniform Laws, including Article 2-B and Article 34-a of the New York State Public Officers Law as well as Subdivision 1, 2 and 3 of Section 99-cc of the State Public Service Law, as amended by Chapter 59 of the Laws of 2010.\n The proposed fire prevention regulations apply to the following buildings owned by New York City: buildings, structures and premises to include elevators, fire fighting systems or other safety elements under the Fire Department of the City of New York\u2019s (FDNY) jurisdiction; buildings under the jurisdiction of other City agencies; buildings under the Department of Buildings' jurisdiction; buildings and buildings under the jurisdiction of Housing Authority of the City of New York; outdoor recreational boating facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation and buildings subject to the jurisdiction of NYC Department of Education. This rule would also apply to fire safety of the City\u2019s Firefighters.\n SCOPE OF PROPOSED RULES: The proposed rules would regulate the maintenance of fire safety in all the facilities and would cover the entire City of New York. The proposed regulations would impact City firefighters, building occupants, the general public, and the City government and tax payer.\n GOALS: The goals of the proposed regulations are to prevent fires, fire injuries, and fire deaths in the City by addressing the need for fire prevention as outlined in the legislative findings.\n LEGISLATIVE HISTORY: Fire prevention began as an effort to stop the burning of cities by providing fire prevention services. Fire prevention services include: (1) inspections of establishments for the purpose of identifying fire hazards (2) inspections of existing establishments to ensure that fire hazards are eliminated or reduced to a level that is safe; and (3) other activities associated with fire prevention activities such as providing public education and training of firefighters to be able to combat fires.\n In 1666, the Great Fire of London engulfed much of the city. Along with the immense loss of life and property, this event marked the beginning of today\u2019s modern fire prevention. The Great Fire of London was not the first great fire in London, but it was the catalyst for major changes in fire prevention and fighting. A fire prevention system was established. A major step toward fire prevention was taken by 1676, when the Great Fire Ordinance was established, a law that demanded that all new buildings be constructed of fire-resistant materials. London\u2019s Fire and Life Safety Act (also called \u201cthe 1676 Act\u201d) established a department to regulate the building practices, called the Fire Office. This new department worked with architects to promote the adoption of improved building techniques. In response to the Great Fire\u2019s loss of 350,000 books and 80 Libraries, the 1676 Act directed the building of public fireproof libraries in all large towns.\n By 1719, the year that is now commemorated as the date of America\u2019s first modern fire department, the Fire Office began training personnel, organizing night watches and constructing public buildings of fire-resistant construction. The first fire companies established by New York and Boston were organized in 1731. Boston\u2019s first firefighting company was the Union Society, formed in 1732 by merging three firefighting companies. The Boston Pilgrims were formed from the Boston Union in 1734. The Pilgrims were the first company to", "Mr. and Mrs. M. E. McDougal, of Salem, came Tuesday to\nvisit Mr. McDougal's aged mother, Mrs. Martha McDougal, of this\nMcDougal is a brother of John S.

However, the potential return is only modest.\nThe search advertising opportunities that are available for newsrooms range from 75% editorial visibility to 85% editorial visibility, according to Greg Finn, founder and president of Local Bid\u2019er, which provides online advertising services for local media organisations. But a big issue with search advertising is the cost.\nNewspapers can get much more cost-effective results from search site sponsored listings, said Dave Taylor, director of digital development at the Toronto Star. Sponsored listings are a type of paid search listing \u2013 they are similar to what Ask.com offers in combination with sponsored link advertising.\n\u201cWhen newspapers want exposure in search engines, there are different levels of sponsored listings that show up,\u201d said Finn. \u201cThey can be anything from being displayed just when a certain search term is typed in, to appearing when there are certain keywords within the title of an area news story. The more terms that are included, the more they cost (a lot),\u201d said Finn.\nTaylor said the Star has \u201csponsored listings on almost all of the sites where we have content that is searchable\u201d. The Star is particularly adept at utilising sponsored listings on Ask.com, where it has a partnership with the site. \u201cWe have done a sponsored listing that runs on Ask.com\u2019s search engine, and it will only show up on the Toronto Star home page.\u201d This allows the Star to get some visibility (75%) without paying too much for the space.\nOn Ask.com, Taylor said that the Star can get \u201c15 or 20 sponsored listings\u201d on its homepage and another 50 to 100 sponsored listings on a section like the \u201cauto\u201d page, which \u201cmakes good economic sense\u201d.\nTaylor said it makes sense to advertise a local story on its own page and in the news section of the paper. \u201cThere are some very unique and specific opportunities to use our homepage very well \u2013 it\u2019s a good tool,\u201d he said. \u201cOur homepage has been incredibly aggressive when it comes to search engine optimisation.\u201d\nThe paper also has search engine exposure on other sites, such as AOL, which Taylor said is not as effective. AOL, for example, runs an algorithm search engine that Taylor says doesn\u2019t display news from the Toronto Star as prominently as other search engines do.\nAnother source of local listings (called business listings in the US) is Yahoo! and Google\u2019s Local.com. But local listings at Yahoo! and Local.com come at a high cost. In the case of local listings, the sponsored listing is less competitive than typical keyword-based links because there is a certain number of links included on the page to every location. \u201cLocal listings are just advertisements that show up on the Google and Yahoo! search engines \u2013 they don\u2019t show up with the organic stuff\u201d, said Finn.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to go around, it\u2019s that they are very expensive,\u201d Taylor explained.\nAccording to Taylor, Yahoo!\u2019s and Google\u2019s local listings cost \u201c$300 \u2013 $600\u201d a click (or $25,000-$60,000 a year for sponsored local listings), which is a lot more than the cost of the sponsored listing on the Toronto Star\u2019s home page, which he said was a lot less, and was \u201cprobably $10-$20\u201d a click (or $9,000-$20,000 a year for sponsored local listings).\n\u201cTo get an ad in 100 or 200 news listings is just a lot more expensive,\u201d he said.\nLocal listings on Google and Yahoo! can cost $2,000 a month, according to Taylor.\nAn example of a Toronto Star sponsored listing that showcased the paper\u2019s coverage of the G8 summit in 2006 (it was among the top local listings on Google\u2019", "The Commission\u2019s rule establishing maximum radiofrequency\nexposure limits has not prevented the development or commercialization of\nthe many products emitting radiofrequency energy that would not\notherwise have occurred.\nDATES: Comments are due on or before November 30, 2011.\nADDRESSES: Please file original comments using only one method:\nElectronic Filers: Comments may be filed using the Commission\u2019s\nElectronic Comment Filing System at\nhttp://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs. \\11\\ Filings \\12\\ may be sent by e-mail\nonly during the Commission\u2019s official filing window.\n\\11\\ https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings (ECFS) is\nthe Federal Government\u2019s e-comment filing system.\n\\12\\ When FNPRMs for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are issued,\nthe Electronic Comment Filing System is available for filing\ncomments.

DNR anticipates issuing the final permits in the summer of 2005.\nPUBLIC MEETING: A public information meeting will be held on Thursday, October 7, 2004 at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre, 30 N. Division, Grand Rapids, Michigan. The program will begin at 6 p.m. with a short presentation by DNR staff. The public meeting will be followed with questions and answers of the mining plan and the project. Public comment will be taken at this time.\nThe public meeting will last approximately two hours and will be audio-taped. Written material submitted at the public information meeting will become part of the permit application record.\nPUBLIC HEARING: The public will have an opportunity to provide individual comment at a second public hearing, which will be held on November 1, 2004, at 7 p.m. at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre. Public comments will also be accepted at that time. These comments will be compiled and submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for inclusion in the environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of the Corps' review.\nSITE VISIT: The public is invited to join DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the project applicant for a one-mile walk at the mine site to see the mine location, the mine pit, and the access road. The site inspection will begin at 10:00 a.m. on November 5 at the southwest corner of US 131 and I-96, near the intersection of M-72, north of the City of Coopersville.

It is clear that the UK's cyber defences are inadequate to meet the very real threat; that is despite the deployment of several hundred intelligence and police personnel in the UK Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (PCNI), a unit responsible for coordinating the defense of critical national infrastructure online. The PCNI also works closely with the GCHQ Joint Cyber Unit, which is part of UK intelligence.\nThe UK is vulnerable to any of the above three potential attacks, not so much because the UK is a key trading nation, noting that the FTSE 100 companies collectively generated record profits of \u00a3144 billion in the financial year to the end of June 2013, but because of some fundamental weaknesses in the UK network, some of which were highlighted by the PCNI, the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance and the Ministry of Defence in late 2012. For example:\nThere is little effective coordination between various parts of the UK government in addressing these threats, or even a consistent strategy for the use of cyber in future operations.\nA lack of cyber intelligence, with the result that GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are largely not equipped to track the hackers behind cyberattacks.\nThere is a lack of any agreed framework for international cooperation in cyber defense or offense.\nA lack of clarity about the relationship between GCHQ and the rest of the security and intelligence agencies, which have often found themselves overlapping with GCHQ and operating in the shadows. Their ability to gather intelligence has also been called into question after a series of embarrassing cyber intrusions, most notably the interception of the mobile phone of then\u2013PM David Cameron by hackers. After these intrusions were uncovered, Cameron said:\nIt would seem to me that we must be very careful that any activities we undertake are properly focused, not against institutions, but against individuals who may be involved in terrorist activities and in other criminal activities.\nThe hackers were linked to Anonymous, a loose collection of anonymous Internet hackers who have used DDoS attacks to take down or to expose various government sites, from the French government to the Bank of Serbia. In August 2015, Anonymous hackers breached the private information of HR consultant Emma Watson, the first former cabinet secretary to release any private documents related to the UK's government email system. The attack was carried out in response to a UK tribunal ruling against Watson, who received the personal emails of celebrities in return for not publishing them on the Web. Following the hacking, Watson was accused by former government officials of breaching various safeguards to keep sensitive official information private and potentially exposing it to hackers. One ex-official said the hacking was a threat to national security.\nDespite its weaknesses, the UK's PCNI is in need of more resources to respond to a growing cyber threat and to bolster public confidence in a new network architecture that is critical to the nation's economic future.\nIn April 2013, PCNI issued its annual report which warned of potentially catastrophic threats to the UK's economy, health and safety, government agencies, military and critical national infrastructure, or the loss of strategic systems and sensitive data, if the UK is slow to improve cybersecurity. In October 2012 PCNI called for more government spending on cybersecurity, including hiring more workers, investing in new technologies, and helping industry and consumers take cyber protections into their own hands. The PCNI report, which was developed by PCNI and the Home Office in collaboration with other government departments, was described in the UK press as \"condemning the lack of cooperation between government security agencies.\"\nThe PCNI's latest annual report stated that cyberterrorism poses a \"serious and growing threat to the UK's economy, society, government and armed forces.\" It stated that the UK needed \"a more coherent and joined-up approach to national security, including the growing threat from cyberspace.\" The PCNI report stated: \"Cyber attacks on critical national infrastructure, from energy supply to telecommunications and transport systems, could pose a significant risk to the economy and society. There is also an increasing cyber threat to defence and diplomacy functions, with implications for the security and prosperity", "WARNING \u2014 Danger! Danger! Danger! You might die from reading this story! And if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll probably live to see your death.\nThis is a story about how one of the most dangerous people in the world became the richest person in the world. His name was Carlos Slim and he controlled most the communications in the world and had an estimated $117 billion fortune.\nBefore you read this essay, I suggest you call your agent right now and have a contract drawn up for a $200 million advance, which you should then negotiate into half a million dollars for half of your life\u2019s work. That\u2019s pretty much what the publisher of this novel demanded for this novel of my creation. I told you this story is true.\nThe publisher then demanded a million dollars for an additional fifteen percent of my life\u2019s work. I told him this story was true and was not my life\u2019s work to mortgage for a million dollars at thirteen percent of the asking price as a gift to you and not as payment in exchange for reading my life\u2019s work.\nI told the publisher my life\u2019s work would be available to you by the end of the week for the asking price of two cents in any neighborhood of your choice. I told him to call my other agent for a contract.\nThen, since I didn\u2019t have any agents, I said the asking price would be a dollar in any neighborhood of your choice. The publisher then went off in a rage and declared they might not publish my novel for an eternity. But, since his heart could not take any more of my refusals without crying, he accepted the dollar in the parking lot and ran home like the scared dog that he was.\nHe was right. The story was not my life\u2019s work but was the true story of Carlos Slim and his rise from nothing to the top of the world. If you can even understand the plot with words, you should get a degree in English. If you do that, you should probably teach English. If you teach English, you will have to understand the plot in this book.\nThe story began long ago, although no one knew it. Carlos Slim was born into this world on January 28, 1940, in Mexico City. His father was named Juli\u00e1n, just like the Mexican president of the time, and his mother was named Linda, who would not make her fortune since she was just a working-class wife whose future seemed to be with the Mexican president\u2019s wife since she was Mexican.\nThe year before he was born, the Mexican government passed a bill giving a monopoly on telephone service to TELMEX, a company owned by the Mexican government. It was the only company that could provide telephone service, which was illegal. But, since the Mexican government made sure nothing was ever illegal but always legal, the monopoly became a money machine, which Carlos Slim would steal, since he was already born and no one ever told him that stealing was illegal.\nSince Carlos Slim was born into a middle class Mexican family, his parents bought their first telephone right away. After they paid three dollars a month for a single line, the telephone company announced they wanted to put an outside phone right by their front door, which Carlos Slim\u2019s poor parents could not afford. The telephone company told them if they were rich enough to buy an expensive telephone in the living room, they could afford to put a phone right next to the door. For three dollars a month extra, they paid for an inside line, which was good enough for Carlos\u2019 parents.\nIn 1960, Carlos Slim was going to business school and was so smart he learned how to open and run a business and became rich enough not to be poor. One of the classes he took was about the telephone and its use. Since he loved the telephone and did not want to walk or drive very far, he said it would be nice if a large city had an outside line right next to the front door.\nThe teacher said that would cost a million pesos and Carlos could only be a millionaire if it included the right to put a large, expensive billboard right next to where anyone with the telephone would be forced to walk. The billboard would have to be very large to be noticed and very expensive to convince the poor workers to make a stop at the expensive store instead of all the other cheaper ones in the city.\nSince Carlos was so intelligent, he said he could make the money to pay for the advertising if he were given control of all the streets in the city. He said a good manager should be allowed to raise prices whenever they wanted and make sure no one is ever inconvenienced by that and", "Gannett Publishing's Reader's Digest, published in Bristol, Conn., saw gains in readership and revenue in the most recent six months, reports MediaWeek, while the company also posted a small (US$103.4 million) second quarter net loss, due in part to the reorganization around the company, which has seen the creation of Gulfstream and GCD Group and the spin-off or sale of several business units.\nNew Mexico news site reports traffic stats for first time\n\"We decided to release\nNMG numbers for the first time.

This\nrepresents net growth of 5.4% since the most recent\ncensus in 2001. It is estimated that, by 2011,\nCanada's population will have reached 35,296,200\npeople, an increase of 11.3% since 2001.\nSince the beginning of the last century, Canada has\nundergone several demographic transitions and has\nmoved to new development plateaux, to a more dynamic\neconomy in which there is greater employment and\ngrowth in population and income. In the 1940s, 1950s\nand part of the 1960s, the main challenge was\nCanada's demographic structure, dominated then by a\nnumerous immigration influx of European origins. To\nthis period belong the years of strong economic\ngrowth, the years of the baby boom. After the second\nworld war, the country's fertility rate, which had\nbeen around 2% from 1921 to 1941, increased to\n3.9% in 1951, then to 4.5% in 1956, and finally to\n5.0% in 1959. However, fertility rates declined to\n3.7% in 1951, to 3.1% in 1956 and to 2.9% in 1961. For\nCanada, as we see by these illustrations, demographic\nsources have been declining in number.\nDuring the 1950s and the 1960s, Canada's population\nand economic activity were being sustained by large\npopulation inflows and strong fertility rates, a\ncombination of which helped to ensure the rapid\ndevelopment of Canada's economy and social\nprogress. The demographic structure became\ndeterminant for the country's development and had\nto be addressed. It was at first dominated by\nemigration flows which were not sustainable; they\nslowed down in the early 1960s and, by the mid-1970s,\ntotally stopped. At the same time, the birth rate also\nslowed down and the economy could no longer rely on\nincome growth fuelled by population growth.\nThe baby boom and emigration decreases resulted in\nsignificant economic consequences. The most\nimmediate consequence was to change the country's\ndemographic structure, characterized for many years\nby a young population with a median age of less than\n25 years. With an ageing population and slower\ngrowth in the working population", "An examination of how The Huffington Post's use of native advertising as both a brand-building strategy and a revenue vehicle provides a glimpse at the not-so-distant future of content and advertising.\nNative advertising is taking the advertising industry by storm. At the very least, this is something we need to be aware of as we craft advertorials and work with sponsors.\nAnd, when it comes to a site like The Huffington Post, sponsored content is often a blurred line. It is the brand\u2019s content. Ad content. News content.\nThat being said, HuffPost provides a glimpse into the not-too-distant future of native advertising being used as both a branding tool and a revenue-generator by providing a service that is not only invaluable as a marketing tactic to clients but also as a source of new revenue.\nThe Huffington Post native advertising strategy\nThe Huffington Post\u2019s native advertising strategy is a combination of social content marketing, branded content, and advertising that works together to create a full view of the brand\u2019s content. While it is clearly native content, these pieces are clearly identified by a label that designates it as sponsored.\nAs I previously mentioned, some of these sponsored pieces are advertorials or promoted posts, and some are designed and written as journalistic stand-alone content pieces such as Q&A and sponsored content profiles.\nSome of these posts are even designed to have content overlap. For example, a promoted post about the brand\u2019s product will have an excerpt and lead graphic (created by the brand) in the post itself, but will also include a graphic and link to a long-form written article and an excerpt pulled from the article.\nThe Huffington Post\u2019s sponsored content strategy\nThis is an extremely smart way to monetize a platform. By publishing content that is clearly labeled as both content and sponsored content, Huffington Post is building the brand and creating more content, all while providing a service that is invaluable to brands.\nHuffPost is allowing brands to leverage its massive social and traffic numbers by creating great content that aligns with the brand voice.\nThe native sponsored content is obviously being driven by brands, but it is still creating and delivering unique content that both the brands and the audience want to see.\nAnd, it\u2019s a great opportunity for the site to cash in on their audience numbers and advertising rates.\nThe branded content strategy provides a win-win\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the branded content strategy is a win-win for the brands.\nThe brands are getting a lot of bang for their buck by having HuffPost\u2019s editors create content that both works for the site as a whole and also works for the brand that is sponsoring it.\nBrands can also participate in this native advertising strategy if they want. Instead of hiring a contractor, brands can write unique, valuable, sponsored content for Huffington Post. In doing so, they are gaining in-house access to a great editorial team, and the site is gaining in-house source of sponsored content that will continue to be valuable to the site as a whole.\nBrands have two options: they can hire a contractor, or they can become a publishing partner. Publishing partners get a whole new set of tools and are part of the team, and are able to see the metrics at all times. Brands can also add their own advertising on the site.\nThe benefit of native advertising\nWhat the Huffington Post has tapped into is that the site, despite its massive social following, is still a news site. As the site itself says on its sponsored content policy page:\n\u201cWe strive to deliver credible news that readers can use and trust, a goal we are passionate about and believe you share. We have created some sponsored content partnerships to explore the intersection of those two goals \u2014 in ways that are beneficial to clients, to our readers and to our journalism.\u201d\nIn many ways it seems counterintuitive, but these two aims go beyond just a brand\u2019s relationship with their audience. Readers who trust the content of a site are going to be more willing to click on sponsored content than something that feels out of place and irrelevant to the news and information that the site provides daily.\nFor this reason, native content sponsored by brands that feel like native content is a way to create a win-win for the site, brand, and audience by creating relevant news and marketing pieces.\nWhile The Huffington Post is unique in this strategy as one of", "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (the Commission) is extending the comment period on whether to modify the Flammable Clothing Textiles Standard (16 CFR Part 1610), through September 14, 2011.\nDATES: September 12, 2011.\nADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted to Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 177 / Friday, September 9, 2011 / Notices\nCommission, 500 8th Street SW., Washington, DC 20024.

The Flammable Clothing Testing Rule had been in place in its then current form since 1972 for wool and in place for other natural fibers since 1992.\nThe Flammable Clothing Testing Rule required manufacturers to measure the minimum burn rate of 2-inch-square garments made of the flammability fabric in accordance with ASTM\nE-84-91 or a revised version approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).

As a result, bald eagle breeding opportunities in the area have increased to a point where managers are looking to the community to determine if a management option exists to mitigate eagle impacts while still allowing for productive oyster harvesting. The community provided input regarding potential mitigation options within two time frames. The first was at a February 2015 meeting where community members ranked the impacts and then prioritized potential mitigation actions. The second, on January 5, 2016, was an email survey on the topic.\nThe results from both the meeting in February 2015 and the email survey in January 2016 were similar in that the general opinion was that some form of mitigation should be applied in addition to, rather than instead of, other efforts by the oyster industry to reduce impacts already put in place.\nThe mitigation approach was then prioritized and two options emerged:\na. The industry adopt a voluntary best practice of maintaining a distance of approximately 225 ft from eagles (rather than the proposed 1,000 ft distance); and to report all eagle encounters and incidents to DNRC, as well as take measures to reduce or eliminate conflicts, and\nb. The industry apply for an ODFW permit to reduce eagle nesting and fledging to the average levels currently being experienced by the industry.\nA number of additional and more technical options were provided by DNRC\u2019s ODFW Biologist as alternatives, which were discussed by the oyster growers at their meeting. The growers\u2019 initial responses to each option were positive, especially in regard to the oyster management mitigation option.\nThe DNRC committee members, with the help of the ODFW Biologist, drafted a list of questions, or criteria to evaluate the merit of these options. The growers had a chance to see this list (available in a PowerPoint slides at the end of this summary) and to respond to any changes or additions they preferred. Based on the most recently submitted data by DNRC to ODFW, eagle impacts currently appear to be at a state where they are unlikely to change as a result of any actions or mitigation options on the islands.\nWhile no option is perfect (every option presented in the presentation is mitigation of some kind, albeit mitigation in different ways), it appears that managing the impacts by maintaining the current levels of impact may be the best choice. In addition, ODFW indicated that a permit allowing for the mitigation of impacts at the same level experienced by the industry in the past would receive strong consideration provided that a formal, agreed to mitigation plan involving all industry players is developed and adopted. A discussion with DNRC\u2019s ODFW Biologist may be necessary to determine if the industry\u2019s mitigation plan, as outlined by the growers, is suitable in the eyes of ODFW and sufficient to allow the agency to consider a permit.\nIf the industry is open to this option, further discussion to outline options for the mitigation plan would be required. A review of options could include holding a small meeting of the DNRC committee to hear options and receive feedback. Also, DNRC has begun reaching out to growers to determine whether they would be willing to volunteer money toward developing an informational pamphlet to further educate growers and the community on the issue. A pamphlet would be more informative about eagles and their habitat, and it would highlight oyster harvesting and some of the precautions that could be taken to reduce impacts and keep our eagles safe.\nPlease feel free to contact Steve Dill at steve@dunnrivercompany.com or (541) 875-3172, if you have any questions or comments regarding a potential eagle mitigation plan for the oyster industry.\nDunn River: Summary of Oyster Growers\u2019 Discussion 2016\nDNRC Committee\nSuggested ODFW Permit Criteria\neagle options\nNantucket Islands\noyster grow\nSteve Dill\nPrevious New Oyster Committee Chair\nNext New Oyster Committee Treasurer", "To provide transparency about how it targets readers with personalized content, News Corp Australia has created an index system that categorizes content by subject matter.\nBy David Brownfield\nGeneral Manager - Digital, \u200e\nNews Corp Australia\nIt is important for media publications to not only recognize when something has come to the public\u2019s attention but also to provide context.\nI am pleased to announce that News Corp Australia has launched a comprehensive Subject Matter Index on its digital portfolio of news websites.\nWhile our portfolio of digital news brands have long been recognized for covering the news agenda, this new index methodology will further enable our audience to see exactly how our news coverage sits within subjects they are most interested in. By giving our audience the information they need, when they need it, they are better equipped to engage when our journalists deliver the essential news that matters to them.\nThe Subject Matter Index was created to provide a more detailed and granular breakdown of the stories our newsrooms produce and how they rank against various interest areas. By having this information readily available, our portfolio will now be able to measure exactly what content is resonating with audiences and where we could improve content placements.\nThis data is available on our digital news platforms, ensuring our audience is better informed and can make a more informed and meaningful choice about the content created.\nWe aim to use the Subject Matter Index as one of the primary digital tools for increasing engagement by providing context to stories, not just a place to find them.\nTo create the Subject Matter Index, News Corp Australia worked with Gnip, the global leader in real-time social and web data, which provides us with a detailed overview of what people are saying about the topics we are covering.\nBy examining this data across a range of subjects within every title, we were able to uncover subject matter that was performing well, where there was room for improvement, and identify new emerging interest areas within our editorial mix. This information will enable our editors to adapt their coverage to ensure what they\u2019re doing is exactly what audiences want.\nThe Subject Matter Index was created on a rolling basis over the past month, enabling all our digital platforms to use it. Within each of our digital publishing brands, this will now form an integral part of how we cover content moving forward. You can expect to see the index on all News Corp Australia digital news platforms in the coming weeks.\nWe are also using the Subject Matter Index to identify trend-setting stories that are gaining traction across different regions, as we believe this to be valuable insight for producers.\nDavid Brownfield is a journalist with a career spanning three continents.

There are many reasons for writers block, but I\nthink writers block, specifically the lack of inspiration for a\npiece of literature, occurs most frequently when a story\nbecomes so boring and unoriginal that the author (whether\nknown or unknown) becomes completely demotivated.\nThe term writer's block is used to refer to the\nlack of inspiration for a piece of literature. For example,\nsomeone might be forced to write a novel but lack the\ninspiration to do so, and might sit in front of his or her\nMacbook waiting for the inspiration to come. Sometimes, if\nthe writer is very busy, he will need inspiration before he\nhas time to write, and that will cause him no longer to write,\nand his ability to write then will be blocked. Another\nhypothetical case could be a well-known author writing his\nlast novel before his death, waiting for the inspiration and\nthen inspiration will never come. However, this scenario is\nextremely rare, as he would have had enough inspiration to\nhave come up with many other novels.\nIt would be most likely that the writer would already\nknow what the plot and everything else in the novel would be.\nThe point of the novel is basically that no plot exists. It's a\nnovel in which a writer who is uninspired for a novel\nwrites one but at the end it is revealed that nothing really\nhappened and there is no plot in the story.\nhttp://www.wordreference.com/enfr\n-wikipedia.org:writers block,\nhttps://grammar.about.com/od/i/g/writersblock.htm\n-Pinterest: writers block\n-google.com", "The Northeast Fisheries Science Center is considering a\npotential action to modify the existing South Carolina\nReef Fish Management Plan to reduce black sea bass bag limits\nand increase the overall bag limit for recreational anglers\nwith federal, charter and headboat permits in the South\nCarolina Marine Fisheries Management Unit.\nDATES: In the Federal Register dated November 29, 2011 (76 FR\n69184), the Northeast Fisheries Science Center announced that\nSURF, 505 Main Street, Suite 4000, Irvine, CA 92614-2406; phone\n(920) 683-2986, or fax (920) 683-5932, or via internet:\n[cir] www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/commercial/hms/sg/sg-contacts.html.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS announces that the Northeast\nFisheries Science Center has modified the existing South\nCarolina Reef Fish Management Plan to reduce the black sea\nbass bag limits and increase the overall bag limit for\nrecreational anglers with federal, charter and headboat\npermits in the South Carolina Marine Fisheries Management\nOn October 18, 2011, the state of South Carolina submitted to\nthe Northeast Fisheries Science Center a revision to a\nstate implemented management plan that governs black sea\nbass harvests in the South Carolina Marine Fisheries\nManagement Unit.

This harvest restriction limits the economic loss\nthat could occur in a fishery in which the target\npopulation is composed of predominately juvenile-sized\nBlack sea bass.\nThis action does not directly alter the annual catch limit\nand will not impact black sea bass stock assessment or\nfishery management plans outside of the South Carolina\nMarine Fisheries Management Unit.\nOn January 16, 2008, NOAA issued an interim final rule to\namend the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) permitting\nprograms for commercial and recreational vessels in the South\nCarolina Black Sea Bass Management Plan Area (73 FR 3724).\nThis rulemaking was completed as directed by the 2006\nreauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation\nand Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\nThis rulemaking implemented a black sea bass fishing\nrestriction in the South Carolina Black Sea Bass Management\nPlan Area as a management tool to reduce economic losses\ncaused by harvesting predominately juvenile black sea bass\nby increasing the legal bag limit for recreational anglers\nwith federal, charter and headboat permits.\nThe preamble to this rulemaking (73 FR 3724) provides the\nnecessary background for this rulemaking and an explanation of\nthe rationale for these actions.\nThis rule does not contain policies with implications for\nstatutory rights and trust resources listed in section 510 2(b) of the EO 12866.\nThis action does not contain collection of information that\nrequires the approval of the Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) under 44 U.S.C 3501 et seq.\nThis rule does not include reporting requirements.\nThis regulation does not modify existing information\ncollection requirements under current approvals, and\ntherefore, a revised information collection package has not\nbeen submitted to", "The FCC is conducting a nationwide, voluntary test\nof the Alertus Emergency Notification System.

I was intrigued. I hadn't seen a self-assessment since high school and I was wondering how I measured up compared to my fellow classmates. However, the assessment wasn't going to be a simple math test and even in high school I didn't exactly excel in that area.\nWhat about the other subjects? If I failed in social studies, was that a bad thing? I had to find out my score.\nAfter making a few phone calls, I tracked down the tests from the 1985 high school yearbook. One thing that I realized while going through the notes was that life was so simple back then. We had only the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Our only worries were about how we were doing in various subjects and trying to make sense of the SAT score to determine if we were good enough to be admitted to college.\nI'm sure this is nothing new to the class of 1985 but in 2007, credit is not a simple thing to understand and it's not exactly simple to report on either. The first thing one must do is figure out exactly what his or her credit report contains, how his or her credit score is calculated, how his or her credit score is calculated, what his or her scores are, and how to find the numbers one needs. This can all get very confusing very quickly. I find myself spending a lot of time trying to figure out not only my credit situation but everyone else's too. In the course of my research, I discovered an amazing tool: AnnualCreditReport.com. This site is a treasure trove of information and it is easy to use. It is free to request a report and even the website gives instructions about how to use it. The key to the program is that you must get a report from each of the three credit reporting agencies. It's free, easy, and it gives you a lot of information, from your credit card statements to your credit score to your balance and payment history on your credit cards, personal loans, and other installment accounts. I found it to be just what the credit report doctor ordered.\nI also discovered that, while some things have changed since 1979, some things have not. Most of the companies in the top twenty-five of the Fortune 500 today were the same ones on that list in 1979. Just as before, the energy companies and the banks were high on the list, especially General Motors. In 2007, we find that Wal-Mart still topped the list while in 1979 the top spot went to the Chrysler Corporation.\nIt's amazing how far we've come in such a short time; the pace must have been even more breathless back in the 1970s when we've started this journey. I suppose you'd have thought that we would no longer need to worry about things like credit scores or credit reports since we have been so proficient in developing other technologies. Well, you can relax now! Even though we may not have developed artificial intelligence or even come close we have learned all about our own credit scores and how we're doing.\nSince this project began, I have learned about credit cards and how it all works. I'm just so impressed by the amount of information that is available on the Internet about credit scores and how to raise them. I think it truly is one of the coolest tools we have. I don't think I would have ever taken the time to figure out the mysteries of credit scores if this project had not been assigned. The truth is that I had gotten confused about credit scores before when I came across something a little confusing in one of my magazines\u2014it was something about credit scores going up after some kind of transaction. I didn't really know if I ever understood the topic or not. So I turned to the experts.\nI'm actually excited about learning credit scores because now I can look inside my future and understand it a little bit better. Learning about credit scores is like looking at a crystal ball. I know this sounds very woo-woo but you have to understand that I do love to read what the future holds for my favorite celebrities and I get very excited when I read those stories. So this credit card business is just another extension of my ability to know what is ahead.\nIt's crazy what happens once you actually know how your credit score", "In the U.S., more than half of Americans now receive their video through over-the-top (OTT) services.

Well, no, maybe you don't know.  So let me explain.  See, when you tell somebody, \"Come on, honey, you're not really in love with me,\" how does he react?  Well, for starters, he starts to give you arguments in logic; one of them being, \"Wasn't I in love with her before I met you?\"  And, of course, there are no logical answers to that. Except, if you go to her, \"Look, hon, let's say we had never met; how would you react to my saying that, all of a sudden, I couldn't possibly be in love with you?\" Of couse, you don't answer that you would say, \"Well, I would want you to stay married, if nothing else.\" You would say, \"Wait.  I'm in love with you...\"\nBut then after a while, it gets easier.  Because if you say \"I'm not really in love with you,\" to your wife, right away she'll say, \"Well, who is it, then?\" and \"Who am I really in love with?\" becomes an easier question than \"Who were you really in love with before I met you?\" Because she can be a little more objective about that. She can say, \"Well, let's take your old girlfriend.  She was pretty, but she had a head like a dog.\" And your wife would say, \"Well, if I were in love with her, I would understand you better if it didn't make me cry to see your face.\" Well, she can say that, and it would be hard to tell whether her reaction meant that she had already gone through all the stages and had already decided that she did want to leave.  Because that girl is the girl you were really in love with all the time, and in any particular marriage, it seems to be one of the few things to which you can never really say. You know that if you have had a girl, say, or you married a woman because of the way she looked, like all the other girls, then that was the girl you were really in love with, but you couldn't say that, even to yourself: that maybe you were just getting married to a particular person.\n\"And then came into my life a different girl that I didn't love, that nobody loved.  Nobody ever had any ideas about how to help her or make her happy...and I got in love with her.\"\n\"Why did I get in love with her?\"\nWell, maybe there were some other people who felt that they really loved her.  But if you say that they're going through a crisis at the moment, it's more true than anything like, \"Oh, well...I don't think that I really loved her\" kind of thing.   See, if you're talking about your wife, it's more true to say, \"The only thing that I really regret is that she was in such a crisis.  I wish I'd had the sense to put her in a hospital or at least let her see somebody else every once in a while, but there was nobody else to take her, so I didn't do that.\"   But if you start to come to some feeling like that about a girl you married, there's no reason why somebody can't just talk to you till your eyes begin to turn green and you look like an apple on top of a cupboard.   Because you might just say, \"All right.  I'll marry her.\"  Well, you'll marry her just to get married, because you think it's a terrible thing to think that you're going to say that you're not in love with her.  Because the only thing you can say is, \"No, I'm only falling in love with you.\"   The only excuse for saying that is that you're a psychiatrist, because that's the only thing that gives you the right to say that it could be any way but the way it is.  If somebody was saying that in a movie, I'd say that it's absolutely wrong.  Even the psychiatrists would want to know what else it could be.   And the only thing you can do is to try to act as if you believe it.\nOh, yes.  It always comes up; and if you say that it comes up when you're talking to the psychiatrists, then it might mean that you're more a psychiatrist than", "The AEIC seeks comment on its proposal to require certain\ninformation elements, i.e.,\n\"Business Activity Codes 5 and 5a\" (\"BAC 5 and 5a\") to be\nassociated with transaction identifiers for a specified category\nof transactions.

Critics, most notably the\nbroadcasting industry, argue that the rules will cost millions of\ndollars and will be a burden to station owners.\nBroadcasters' Opposition To FCC's Information Rules:\nThe most heatedly debated of the FCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Information Rules\nrelating to radio and television broadcasting may not have any\naffect at all, and several have already been modified by the FCC.\nThe Rules require that all data from the recently-ordered National\nTelevision Violence Monitoring study be posted on the Internet\nwithin five days of its publication;  it also requires radio\nbroadcasters to post their quarterly and annual financial reports\nand the results of other studies on the same website. In an\neffort to appease its opponents, the FCC announced that the\ninformation would be posted on the website of the National\nTelecommunications and Information Administration. This is a\ngovernment agency, established within the Department of Commerce,\nwhich would, the FCC said in its justification of the rule,\npossess greater financial stability than private industry.\nNevertheless, the broadcasting industry continues to oppose\nthe Rules, on the basis that Internet publication will prevent\nthem from being able to meet their legal obligations to timely\npublish the data:  most notably, they will now have to do so with\ntheir financial data, instead of just posting their report for\nthe Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspection during its normal open window, which\ncoincides with station owners' filing of their Form 323.\nThe broadcasting industry fears that they will become liable\nfor millions of dollars in fines for delay in posting the data,\nbecause the FCC has not yet established procedures by which the\nwebsite will be monitored for timely release of the information,\nnor has the Federal government established how it will\nadminister its website. Industry representatives maintain that\nthere is no way they can meet the deadlines for posting on the\nwebsite while they are preparing their annual Form 323 to be filed\nwith the FCC. It has asked the FCC to consider reducing the time\nperiod for posting data to no less than mid-month, a far more\nreasonable deadline than the FCC Rules. The Commission has not\nruled on this matter, though it has said it appreciates the\nindustry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns and the FCC will work with it to address these\nThe information that the Rules will require to be posted on the\nwebsite are (1) reports on the broadcasting of violent and\ninappropriate programming; (2) comparative weekly data on the\nbroadcasts of broadcast television and the broadcasts of cable,\nsatellite, and other non-broadcast programming during times\ndesignated for children's programming; and (3) annual data on\nviolent and inappropriate programming and the effectiveness of the\npublic service announcements accompanying that programming. It is\nto be noted, however, that if the broadcasting industry is found\nto have broken any of the deadlines for Internet posting, the\nFCC may impose a monetary penalty of up to $32,500 per broadcast\nday for each incident of non-compliance. If the industry objects\nto the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of such fines for posting deadline\nviolations, it may seek review of the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders in the\nFederal courts. In the process, it may be able to delay collection\nof the sanctions. Therefore, though the broadcasting industry\nargues that it cannot comply with the Rules, it may in fact receive\na financial windfall merely by filing suit against the FCC. In\nfact, many of the Rules were written to be as lax as possible. For\ninstance, the broadcasting industry may not publish its data on its\nwebsites on the same day it files it with the FCC:  by doing so,\nthe industry will run into the same financial problem as if it did\nnot comply with the Rules in the first place:  it will have to\npay a penalty for being one day late.\nThe Rules also include some guidelines for reporting stations to\npublish on their websites the following: (1) programming\ndescriptions for", "Gail M. Collins, Editorial Page Editor of the New York Times, has authored a new book, Gail Collins and the Age of Impertinence. In it she explores the rise of the women\u2019s movement and the sexual revolution.\nGail M. Collins\u2019s new and much celebrated book, Gail Collins and the Age of Impertinence, was published by the Times-based Broadway Books company on May 4th.\nThe book is at once a memoir of life at the New York Times as well as a survey of where the women\u2019s movement, the sexual revolution and the paper stood in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. A quick perusal of the book\u2019s blurb reveals the intentions of the author \u2013 not only an accomplished journalist and social observer but also an unreconstructed feminist, who has made no secret in the past that, to the degree she admits it publicly, she harbors great disdain for those she sees as anti-feminist.\nOne of the issues that she takes the opportunity to deal with in the book is a discussion of sexual harassment. Specifically, she notes that in 1990, shortly after she began writing one of the paper\u2019s most read columns, the paper\u2019s editor at the time, A.M. Rosenthal, told her that in order to avoid a $100 fine that Rosenthal was obligated to issue in lieu of a speeding ticket issued to a friend of his, he recommended that she marry the man who had issued the ticket. Collins declined.\nCollins notes in her introduction to the book that when the Times published her column on that incident, the letters of the angry male readers took up more than a page, \u201cpiling it on with a vengeance.\u201d She goes on to say \u201c[W]hen I moved to the editorial page, some of the older male reporters couldn\u2019t stop apologizing for the uncivil letters.\nTo a woman, they said, \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything like that when I was on the paper.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that this happened at the Times makes it somehow more outrageous,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe very notion that one of the paper\u2019s best editors should have done such a thing. The fact that he was a man. But not the most outrageous bit, by any means: the idea that someone else would have the power to do this to me, as an employee. What\u2019s really outrageous is that I had no sense this was something that might have happened, until it happened to me.\u201d\nShe adds that, \u201cThis was my big revelation from a few years on the front page.\u201d\nThe book was reviewed in the Times on May 4th \u2013 not surprising \u2013 by the prominent social commentator, Maureen Dowd. Ms. Dowd noted that the book explores, \u201cThe rise of feminism, the sexual revolution and the modern American family. What emerges is a portrait of the Times, and the country, undergoing a cultural change.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, Ms. Dowd was complimentary of the book. She notes \u201cThe Age of Impertinence is a pleasure-pill of old and new Times stories, ranging from Anita Hill to the recent Trayvon Martin case. Collins takes the time to deconstruct a misogynistic cartoon that was riffed in the days before Barack Obama\u2019s presidential inauguration; she also gives readers a peek inside the paper\u2019s newsroom as the young upstarts from The Boston Globe stole its thunder.\nThe book\u2019s title is a riff on the term \u201cImperial Age,\u201d coined by 19th-century historians to contrast Europe after Napoleon.\u201d\nIn the Washington Times of May 4th, the conservative commentator Richard Miniter opined that the book\u2019s central thesis is the, \u201cdissonant tone\u201d that has marked the paper\u2019s liberal editorial page since 2001. Mr. Miniter wrote:\n\u201cToday's Times is a mess, and the book is the best guide to its problems. If you only read one book this year, make it this one. Collins' book is not perfect. But it is more insightful and readable than any of the droning manifestoes I have read from professional liberals in recent years.\u201d\nThere was however significant and vocal right-wing criticism of the book. New York Post columnist Kathleen Parker, wrote on May 12th, \u201cHow a powerful and successful woman could miss the point on power is a question for historians and psychologists\u2026 But when you\u2019ve reached", "I have thought the advisability of establishing a few\nbenevolent societies, in several towns, and I think the most\nsuitable places for such is Norwich, Methuen and Newburyport,\nfor I think those towns are large enough to take care of\nthemselves, and can raise enough money to take care of any\npersons in need whom they shall admit into their benevolent\nsocieties. That which I have suggested to myself is as follow;---\nI wish to establish a benevolent society, in each of the\nnames and places mentioned above, where persons in want, upon\na certificate from two honorable men in each town, may be\nadmitted to receive money, for clothing or otherwise as needed,\nunder the direction of a committee established to that purpose.\nThat is the principal object that I want to accomplish by\nestablishing a benevolent society in each of the places\nmentioned, the persons thus admitted should pay in a\nconsiderable sum in advance, to enter into the society, and\nbe a member of it, and a certificate to the committee under\nthis society to have paid, in full, the money aforesaid,\nshould be necessary before this society would pay out any\nportion of the money. And the certificate to the committee\nbeing full, the certificate to the society should not be,\nunless it was withdrawn before the committee paid out any\nmoney. The reason why I wish to give this society, a certain\nperiod of time, after it receives the money, for making\ngood that it is full, such as from two to five years, is,\nthat I want to get the money from the citizens and towns of\neach of the places above named, without any unnecessary\ndelay, and have it at once to be applied to persons who\ncan only enter the society at the expense of $25.00, and\nthat that sum must be paid in full, before the committee\nunder such society pays out any money to the person\nIt will be my aim in the course of these notes, to try\nall the ways that I can think of, to effect a great number of\nthese benevolent societies, in those cities that I have\nsuggested them to.  Then it will be practicable for a great\nnumber of persons to be admitted into several, because each\nperson can only be admitted into one society.\nThe first society I intend to establish is here by me, in\nwhich I intend to admit all the destitute women and children\nin the town of Dracut, and so on to other towns, in the\nsame manner.  This society will cost this town only $50.00\na year, but the people whom we shall send into it, must\nfurnish the expences to get them there, to be at least, $25.00,\nwhich will cost us each year, $75.00.\nAt present, the people of this town think it best to\nconsider nothing till the next March:  but in the mean time\nI will write to several members of this society and others,\nthose that I know, and tell them to give my opinion on this\nsubject, as they consider it, and from their opinions, I will\ntry to form one, and endeavor to have all the people of this\ntown agree to it, and then I will communicate it to the\nother towns within this County, which we think is advisable\nfor us too.\nHaving said thus much, may I request the favor of the\ncompany this way, to write to me, and send their opinions,\nor any other thing they think useful to us.\nThis I do to be equal, at least, in what I do, and that it\nshould be seen to be a society that will consider the least\nthat can be done, that may be useful.   And not only in what\nmay be done here, but in what may be done by the most\ninfluential of these societies in some other place, where\nthese opinions of our people here, should be communicated,\nand that the committee of this society can try to get\ninformation from, so as to be prepared to meet any difficulty\nthat may arise.\nI have received your letter of April 21, and the\ncircular you gave me. If the idea you propose of establishing\na benevolent society here is to be carried out, I would\nrecommend that it be done before any other step is taken.\nBut if the idea is merely to get a circular printed, I\nsuppose the proposition in each town must be put up to a\nvote before any thing is done.

It\u2019s not just that they are all publishing CEOs, nor that they are all speaking together at our third-annual EMEA Advertising Week Europe conference in Cannes on February 27, from 1-2 p.m. It\u2019s the fact that they all share a common vision about how the media industry should be moving forward, and that vision is about giving readers much more than news.\nAs D\u00f6pfner explains in a video interview, as news became free and therefore less valued as a product, publishers inevitably ran to paywalls.\n\u201cA paywall is not necessarily the best instrument to monetise your audience,\u201d he says, especially in such a competitive online environment. But that doesn\u2019t mean the time for news is up.\n\u201cI believe the news world is going to become significantly more important as we are facing a rise of populism, in Europe, the world, the US, and so on. We might not have the biggest news room in the world in terms of people, but we are looking at what the future looks like.\u201d\nThe future will be about more than news.\n\u201cWe must give back the trust that we lost, and one way to do that is to say to readers: \u2018Here, you are the customer. You are not that bad.\u2019 And so, to give back that trust, we are doing that with a lot more than just news,\u201d says D\u00f6pfner. \u201cWhat we are doing, is creating an information company that is not only providing news, but we are also providing information for many different industries globally.\u201d\nWhile the concept of news is still important \u2013 particularly as advertisers seek to be associated with trusted organisations \u2013 D\u00f6pfner says that Axel Springer will move to focus on \u201cthe whole story.\u201d\n\u201cOur strategy is pretty clear,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe only way is to create an e-commerce company. That\u2019s what we have started doing in 2017 and will continue to do. But at the same time, we are increasing our emphasis on B2B because that\u2019s what is driving a lot of digital advertising today, especially in the German-speaking market.\u201d\nLooking to the digital and mobile future also means looking past the paywall.\n\u201cThe days when we could only generate revenue on our print platforms have come to an end,\u201d D\u00f6pfner says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s online or whether it\u2019s mobile or whether print. It\u2019s no longer \u2018this is advertising and that is subscriptions or single copies sales.\u2019 Today, advertising revenue is at least as important as single-copy sales or subscriptions.\u201d\nWith this in mind, Axel Springer is looking to take news outside the traditional context.\n\u201cWe are starting to expand [into other news verticals] as we are doing in the German-speaking market, including the digitalisation of information we have. In Switzerland and Austria, we want to be able to expand those platforms in the German market,\u201d D\u00f6pfner says. \u201cThe other important area is the whole advertising field. Not too long ago, we bought Ebuyer, a German online advertising platform. We are now expanding it internationally.\u201d\nBoth D\u00f6pfner and Lacy emphasise the importance of having a strong digital strategy to be successful in this new era of media.\n\u201cThe biggest issue is that the audience is changing, there\u2019s lots of new competitors,\u201d says Lacy. \u201cYou need a strategy that recognises the power of audience and the power of technology. When we say that we\u2019re a media and marketing company, when you have that mindset, the whole way you think about what you\u2019re doing changes and that means you have to think about mobile, digital, social, video and digital marketing to be successful.\u201d\nMobile devices play a big role in this new strategy. Indeed, Axel Springer launched its first native app in a non-news vertical \u2013 food, specifically a recipe app \u2013 more than five years ago.\n\u201cThe future of media is obviously online and mobile,\u201d D\u00f6pfner says. \u201cOne day, we will all be digital-only consumers. The mobile phone is the key driver, and that is true in a lot of different industries.\u201d\nLacy agrees.\n\u201cI believe as print revenues disappear, that will force publishers to focus on what we think we are best at: providing content and information", "The 10th Annual PGA Tribute to Heroes Gala was emceed by two celebrity PGA Professionals at The PGA Golf Club in Port St. Lucie, Florida.

CLS Bank, could have a far reaching effect on the online advertising industry.\nLast Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a blow to the Patent Trial & Appeal Board review process and its effect on software patents by ruling against CLS Bank International, a holding company for clearing-house transactions between Wall Street banks. The court determined that the US Patent & Trademark Office's (USPTO) standard for determining patentability didn't take into account whether patented processes were \"obvious,\" which the court said was critical. As a result, software that would have been ineligible for patent protection could now qualify.\n\"If this decision stands, it could put at risk many patents in industry and have a significant impact on patent owners and their attorneys who do business at the intersection of technology and law,\" Bill MacRae, general counsel of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers said in an opinion piece on the ruling in the Financial Times.\nAt the same time, the court's decision could create a disincentive for companies investing in innovations, which could ultimately hurt the ad industry, which spends a huge amount of money on innovations every year.\nSome tech industry players worry that Alice Corporation\u2019s Alice LLP v. CLS Bank International litigation could cause a ripple effect of damaging patent law to tech companies.\nIf the holding stands and the effect reaches software inventions, then a whole slew of technology patents could be thrown out -- and they will be replaced by the court's new standard.\nPatent lawsuits, which are often initiated by those attempting to ward off competition, have plagued the ad tech industry in recent years.\nAnd even if they aren't directly suing you, those that have patents can still use them a means for negotiation, stall or delay new product development, and even dictate to publishers which ad tech players to work with. Some say they also may also discourage further investment in new ad tech inventions.\nMany in the ad tech industry think such measures have been counterproductive.\n\u201cFor patents to really hold value, they should only be relevant to the industry in which they were created,\" Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of consultancy CREATV Media, told Digital Content Next in a recent interview. \"This is not the case. Many patents create nothing and can be detrimental to the industry.\"\nThe ad tech industry has been particularly targeted, and those behind the legal action are often big players in the industry.\nBillionaire Paul Allen, for example, has filed more than 30 patent infringement suits against tech companies such as Amazon and Google over the course of the past five years, with more than 25 of those suits currently active according to information from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\u201cAs I understand it, this could spell the death knell for 8,000 software-related patents a year,\u201d Daniel Weinstock, an intellectual property partner at DLA Piper, told the Financial Times about the court's decision to overturn the patentability of a financial transaction software patent in the Alice case.\nThe court's ruling in Alice v. CLS Bank International is the latest in the long-running series of legal actions, and the ad tech industry says it could make it even that much harder for innovators to get what they view as fair compensation for their time and money.\nThere are many patent holders in the ad tech industry, said Tom Phillips, senior director of digital media and mobile at Digitas and a member of the association's board of directors.\n\u201cMany of these patents are being asserted against small startups,\u201d Phillips told Digital Content Next. \u201cSome of the most influential companies in digital advertising are also the biggest patent holders (which creates) a dangerous situation for startups that are trying to create new innovations.\u201d\nAd tech companies are already paying a massive $14 billion per year to settle patent disputes, according to a 2012 Bloomberg report, with IBM holding one-third of all patents in America and Microsoft with the greatest share of growth in those patent holdings. IBM has more than 11,000 patents, while Microsoft has approximately 6,800.\nAnd while it's just four companies that hold more than 5", "A good relationship means you can rely on your staff, knowing that their priority in work situations will be to look after your interests. A good relationship between management and frontline staff can benefit your paper and your journalism.\nThe relationship between management and frontline staff is a vital one for all news organizations. It means that if the staff has a good relationship with management, management\u2019s work is easier. For example, if employees feel valued, the management doesn\u2019t have to worry about apathy, or resentment towards company procedures; the staff will be motivated to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. It also results in a relationship of trust, which results in a relationship of respect.\nThe inverse relationship \u2014 a management staff whose relationship is poor \u2014 causes the company to have problems in both management and production. Production is negatively affected by management who don\u2019t have a good relationship with their staff. When an editor or manager is in conflict with staff, it can cause resentment and the staff will do what they think is least likely to hurt their career \u2014 take their ball and go home. Production is negatively affected by the reduced rate of work.\nManagers will always have staff members who are difficult people, and sometimes they are the managers. Often, when managers act in a bullyish manner, they think the behavior will frighten staff and they\u2019ll get more cooperative results. Unfortunately this hasn\u2019t been the case in my experience. Most of the time the problem is either not recognized or brushed under the rug. Bullied staff members will be afraid to complain or will think that it\u2019s just their fault and they deserve punishment for \u201cwhatever it is they did.\u201d One of the results of this type of management style is a staff that feels victimized and can\u2019t produce to their capabilities.\nOf course, managers may not actually be bullying anyone, but management style has the same effects \u2014 staff members won\u2019t want to \u201crock the boat\u201d and the staff gets used to the manager\u2019s behavior. This is a subtle form of bullying \u2014 the manager may not realize it, but the staff are afraid to do anything. The managers may expect the staff to do anything and everything, in any situation, and get resentment for always being on the job. Often the staff members don\u2019t tell the management what\u2019s happening because they fear reprisal. Often members of the staff, when they\u2019ve been abused in this manner for a while, will look for other jobs.\nThis type of management style also has very obvious effects on staff members. First, the staff is less productive. Second, it damages the relationship between staff and management. This is not a healthy situation for a news organization.\nIn my experience, often the relationship between management and frontline employees is damaged by ineffective communication. To be clear, I mean communication that the staff doesn\u2019t want. This happens the first time a manager gives instructions that the staff doesn\u2019t want or don\u2019t understand. For example, a photographer is told to \u201c\u2026take some pictures of the house before you leave.\u201d Or they decide they want to make their own photographic decisions, a reporter is asked whether they want to go to the press conference today, and they say they don\u2019t have enough leads. Not understanding the importance of certain story, especially those breaking news stories with timelines, the reporter says they aren\u2019t ready.\nThis happens regularly in the newsroom. In my experience, the staff doesn\u2019t like to be told what to do, but I also know that they like to work where they like to be told what to do. This is very problematic. It is one thing to expect staff members to ask questions or to take initiative, but it is another thing to have management tell your staff what they have to do and how they have to do it. If you don\u2019t train frontline staff on how to take initiative, they won\u2019t be successful at it. If management doesn\u2019t clearly define expectations, the staff won\u2019t be successful.\nThis happens a lot with copy editing. One of the reasons copy editors are so frustrated is that they often have to take the instructions that are given to them. For example, I was asked to proofread a piece and when I got to the final paragraph that contained errors, the editor added \u201cThe author is not a native speaker. Please leave all errors. Thanks!\u201d I responded that I was not going to proofread it if the editor expected me to let every error in the final two paragraphs pass because the author is a non-native speaker. There is a real problem in this, and again comes back to communication. I know that the editor will expect that everything will pass over from the author, but it is my job to take the information received from", "The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE)\nis issuing a Notice inviting applications for its School Leadership\nPrograms competition.

Under current Regulation N, persons other than registered broker-dealers may not effect or facilitate sales of securities eligible for QIB treatment or Rule 144A treatment. This proposal would allow any person, other than a registered broker-dealer transferring securities of an affiliated broker-dealer subject to the Securities Exchange Act, to effect transfers of such securities to QIBs, subject to the conditions that the person delivering the notice is a principal in the transaction, is acting as agent for the seller (or in certain circumstances at the seller's direction), provides sufficient information in the notice for the buyer to evaluate the transaction, and receives an acknowledgment from the buyer agreeing to the terms and conditions on the notice. The Board is proposing to require such persons to be members of the Depository Trust Company, a limited purpose trust company, or a broker registered under the Securities Exchange Act. Also, a transferee buyer would be subject to the conditions that it be a QIB that meets certain criteria, be a bank, insurance company or registered broker-dealer, or be an affiliate of the transferee broker-dealer. The Board is proposing to require a person delivering the notice in connection with such a transfer to provide its name, address, telephone number, name of the person for whom it is acting, the names of the parties to the transaction, and the name and number of the account (if any other than its own) in which the securities are held. A transferee buyer would also be required to acknowledge that it agrees that it must hold the securities transferred until settlement and that the seller will be liable under the Securities Act until settlement unless the seller, in a subsequent transaction, expressly relieves the transferee in writing. The Board is proposing to require that the form of the notice include specified disclosures, contain certain identification and certification language from the transferee seller, and be sent by registered or certified mail, express delivery, or hand delivery. The broker delivering the notice would have to obtain a certification that the transferee buyer intends for its account the securities in question. The certification would have to be provided by the transferee buyer, or, in the case of unregistered beneficial owners, the registered broker-dealer for whom the person transferee is acting. Such a certification would have to be provided to the transferee seller and to the appropriate regulatory agency. The Board is also proposing in this Release to clarify that the notice may be delivered by fax or e-mail, but delivery of a paper copy thereof to the appropriate regulatory agency would have to be made simultaneously so as to ensure its preservation for a period of six years. The proposed rule would provide that the notice have a format prescribed by the relevant regulatory agency when it prescribes that notice. The proposed rule would specify that a transferee would be required to hold the securities transferred until settlement unless it receives from the seller a certification as described above and a statement that transfer can occur for cash pursuant to Rule 144A or Section 4(1) of the Securities Act. Such a transfer would have to be by delivery to an account established by the transferor at a bank or trust company as the transferor's address for delivery. Delivering securities pursuant to a transfer notice would have to be by certified or registered mail, express delivery, hand delivery, or any other methods prescribed by the relevant regulatory agency. Delivering of electronic securities to an account or to a person identified in the transfer notice, or otherwise transferring of securities eligible for delivery pursuant to Rule 144A to an account or custodian of a transferee, if appropriate for Rule 144A, would have to be pursuant to the applicable procedures for receiving such securities in its account. A person would have to hold securities until settlement or a specified time unless the transferee (or a person other than the transferee) makes an election under this Section, or a transferee has a good faith belief that the transferor will make", "When you\u2019d like to get an advertiser to partner with you, you can\u2019t go wrong by pitching the idea that you will provide them with something that others do not. It\u2019s always nice to go out on a limb and take a risk in a creative space for something other than revenue. As an added bonus, you can also use new ideas to bring people back or provide them with something that only you can offer.\nFor many companies, their newsletters are an important marketing tool. They are designed to deliver content to readers at a certain date and time to remind them that new content is available on your newsletter. Often people receive many different emails each day, and we must find a way to stand out through a great subject line. Email subject lines are crucial to the success of email campaigns. The best newsletters have a subject line that will grab the reader\u2019s attention and provide an incentive for him or her to open the email and continue reading.\nTake a look at your past email subject line successes as well as others\u2019 emails and make a list of what works. You will most likely realize that many have the same subject line structure and that you need to have an idea of what needs to be included to stand out.\nMake a note of the basics of your list and build from it. Here\u2019s a simple template:\n\u2014> Something you do better than anyone else\n\u2014> Something you can provide for your customers\n\u2014> And some news or a promotion\nIn the example above, we can take this one step further by adding a bit of data to a list or something that only we can provide. For instance, instead of stating that I have the largest selection of something, I can provide data like having the longest selection period or an average of 100 days over the last year as a comparison to another brand. That\u2019s what got me thinking.\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a bit creative and that I think of different ways and new methods to think differently or to promote something in a new way. However, I do not limit myself by what I know. I\u2019m open to learning and willing to explore other methods. I also have a passion for newsletters and a dedication to my audience that would only be possible if we had something different to offer or a new way to offer it.\n\u2014> Something you can offer\n\u2014> And something new that will appeal to a customer\nIn the example above, we could provide data that proves that we have something new. This will make us more approachable and more exciting. We are taking time away from our existing process to focus on creating something for the customer.\nEven within this example, it\u2019s clear that the words stand out better than other similar subject lines. Take some time to review your own emails, and if you feel they could be better, consider adding things that might make people take an extra second to notice your email.\nYou can use this approach to gain more readers and have more clicks each day. The time invested in coming up with creative ideas will be rewarded. It is often easier to start with a blank page and think of creative ways to communicate than it is to take a basic email template and think outside of the box.\nPREV Digital Editions: Rigorous Data Analysis for Successful Designs NEXT The Newspaper\u2019s Increasing Influence in Politics and Government", "The Department of the Treasury's Office of the\nAssistant Secretary for Tax Policy issued a notice of proposed rulemaking\n(REG-201490-8) that provides a mechanism for obtaining tax-exempt\nstatus under Section 501(c)(6) and (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986 if, in addition to the organization's core exempt purpose, the\norganization \"carries out a substantial portion of its activities to a\nsignificant extent\" by lobbying.

This rule implements\nthe statutory requirements of Section 658G of the Child Care\nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-615) (hereafter\nreferred to as ``the Act'') requiring a state child care plan that\nprovides universal access to comprehensive child and family services,\nand a plan for an administrative system which is uniform throughout the\nstate for the receipt, management, and monitoring of all funds,\nprograms and systems funded under the Act. This interim rule was\npublished before statutory changes proposed in the Children's\nFederalism Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-208) became effective; these later\nchanges amend requirements for administrative systems under the Child\nCare and Development Block Grant Act (Pub. L. 99-425, 42 U.S.C.\n658gg, hereafter referred to as the Act), funded under a block grants\nsystem from the Child Care Fund (CCDF). The amendments to the Act\nwere necessary to clarify the responsibilities of the States under the\nblock grant systems after the passage of welfare reform legislation.\nState child care planning and administration systems under the block\ngrant systems now receive funds from six program areas, which all\nrequire a uniform administrative system: Title XX-Child Care\nDevelopment Block Grant, Title XX-Child Care Development Fund,\nTitle XX-Child Care and Development Fund; Title IR-Child Care and\nDevelopment Fund; Title IR-Child Care Development (formerly ECT)-\nChild Care Development Fund; and Title IV-Temporary Assistance to\nNeedy Families (TANF)-Child Care Services Fund.\nThe Child Care Development Block Grant Amendments of 1996 have\nbeen codified in Section 658G of the Child Care Development Block\nGrant Act, 42 U.S.C. 9858 (hereafter referred to as the Act).

What we're really trying to get at here is this: I was just thinking that I was being a complete asshole to my brother last week by talking about all the things I do for a living, and it made me realize how little I think about just what I am doing with my life. I used to work very hard at maintaining the illusion that what I do isn't anything worthy of discussion, and then I wondered why I felt I couldn't talk about work. I love work, and there's nothing more fulfilling than helping someone tell their story in ways they didn't think they could. I don't have a problem with talking about my job, but if I wasn't having a conversation about it with my brother, who is not involved in journalism, then I began thinking, what's the point? What does it matter? And it scared me.\nSo I'm going to talk about what I do with my life for about two weeks. I think that's a good start.\n*My life is a constant battle between me as a person (witty, friendly, open-minded, outgoing/introverted, intelligent, thoughtful) and my profession (a shill who does whatever is asked of him and does whatever is going to make him stand out).\nI think I finally figured out what I do best. I should start working for a shoe line instead of as a journalist.\nWhen it's hot, hot, hot, you can't wear shoes. You have to be able to bare feet, but when you wear pants, those pants tend to stick to the floor with sweat. And it's not a summer without a trip to the pedicurist. But what do you do? Where do you go?\nFortunately, there's now a solution. My first footwear endorsement:\nSo what will Sven do for money, if shoe companies aren't going to pay him to wear their stuff? Well, I've always thought it would be fun to work as a traveling sales rep, where I can keep my eye on the ball (the foot) while also being able to go to a beautiful place to play golf and try to make my footwear selling a little easier. So I'm going to try it.\nSo I'm going to try. The travel part will have to go without the golf because I find I have a nasty habit of missing shots when I'm wearing spike-heeled clogs, but I'm sure the travel part will work itself out. And I've always liked golf. And I was good, once-- when I wasn't distracted by the pretty skirts. Actually, the cute butts are good too, but you catch my drift.\nYoung and full of piss and vinegar, Sven was one of the most confident and feared players on the PGA Tour. You'd find that at the end of every round and at the end of the tournament, Sven would put his arm in a circle. He'd done it at the end of every tournament he ever played and as soon as other players saw that circle in his arm they would make him prove it wasn't a weapon. Every single time, Sven would start with a single finger. Within seconds, the other players would be backing away from the circle. It was impressive even for a kid who wasn\u2019t even 21 yet. One guy actually said, \u201cHey Sven, that\u2019s impressive, but if you\u2019re going to act tough, just grow up and do it right.\u201d\nThe kid grew up.\nI didn't become a golfer, but I became a footwear salesman, and I had a pretty good career doing that too. The main difference of course was that everyone knew if you fucked with the salesman there would be a revolved door for you to go through. I can't tell you how many doors I opened on the job, but none are any of your business.\nBut we're about our clothes here. In high school I wore a 34-long sock in black patent leather and made sure every sock had a pattern in it. I even kept a pair of white socks in my car because sometimes you just have to blend in, and a white sock just won't do unless it has a stripe in it. No, I'm joking. Everyone kept telling me I looked too preppy and that white socks always showed dirt.

The print industry, rather than seeing print decline, should try to rethink its role in the ever-changing publishing industry.\nEditor's Note: In 2000, a print industry consulting firm called \"Digital Output\" was established in Australia. It was sold to the United States-based Printing Industry of America in 2009 and is now called Printing Impressions. Today, the firm has evolved into a research source for the North American print industry. Its research team is led by John Sheridan, president of Digital Output, along with Michael G. Hickerson, vice president of Digital Output, and Andrew Paparozzi, associate editor. Here are their findings, presented in this report from a recently released research survey.\nWhen we talk and write about the \u201cprint versus digital\u201d discussion, it's usually about direct mail, with the implication that magazine and newspaper publishing will be in constant battle with the digital side of the industry against all odds.\nAs the world of publishing moves closer to being driven by data and what's measurable, it seems that the entire digital industry is focusing on this concept of what can be defined as \u201ccontent marketing\u201d or simply marketing to a broader audience by offering products that are data driven and of value to the buyer, thus moving more toward the print model of giving away \u201cvalue\u201d for free rather than selling something to buyers.\nWithin that context, the magazine and newspaper industry has often seen the focus on the direct mail area and how marketers use the printed medium as the key battle arena, where they would try to outgun their competitors with tactics, using all of their resources to win this one battle.\nSo let's look at some thoughts, as they unfold, where print and digital should be seen as an integrated channel. The print industry should not focus on simply seeing print decline when it comes to new technologies and digital developments, as it seems that there is room for growth in this area, too.\nPrint Industry: The New \u201cMe\u201d\nWe have looked at an industry that relies on the \u201cme\u201d \u2013 \u201cme\u201d wants a better car, \u201cme\u201d is looking for a new kitchen, \u201cme\u201d wants a better garden \u2013 all of this focused on the individual. With increasing technology such as driverless cars and robotised kitchens and gardens, will there be a place where the individual is still looking for solutions that he or she wants?\nIn a world of increasing disruption, with new solutions being developed every single day, print and digital should be seen as an integrated channel, but rather than seeing print decline, it should try to rethink its role in the ever-changing publishing industry, looking for new markets and opportunities as the digital world keeps growing.\nWhere do I see the opportunities?\nPrint has always been in the forefront of the information wars and continues to offer a wide range of solutions and opportunities. The print industry has always been able to offer unique capabilities that can deliver real and sustainable value to their customers, and this focus on value will continue to be the key to success in any market.\nThe real opportunity of the print industry has always centred on its ability to deliver value and its ability to deliver information that its customers can respond to through that direct and immediate link it can provide through print. This is unique and offers a number of opportunities to use print information for targeted marketing programs.\nEfforts to create a link between print and the digital world are increasing and evolving every day. These efforts should not be seen as a threat, but rather as an opportunity.\nThe more digital technologies grow and expand, the more opportunities are created for print. The digital industry is a maturing market, and marketers need to understand how to integrate the two channels in a cohesive way to achieve the greatest return on investment.\nAnd we should understand that both the print and digital industries need to rely on these core functions in order for consumers and marketers to communicate successfully.\nLooking forward, we need to focus on creating a seamless experience for the consumer by integrating print and digital technologies. This will allow us to create a link between online data and offline engagement, ultimately enabling marketers to deliver a more personalised experience.\nWe also need to understand the unique role that print plays in the industry and the potential value proposition that it offers, while driving engagement and creating a physical and emotional connection with the end consumer.\nPrint should be marketed on the fact that it is used daily and remains in the home for a long time, reaching a huge audience of loyal consumers on a daily basis.

ANOTHER GREAT BOOK ADDED TO MY CHRISTMAS WISH LIST!", "Digital newspaper advertising sales, print advertising newsletters, and newspapers are being hit hard in a recessionary climate.\n\"The industry is really in a tough spot,\" says Tim Gallagher, director of marketing and research for the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. (ANPA).\nWith falling national advertising revenue, he continues, \"Everyone is hurting. Everyone is pulling back in their budgets, and that includes newspapers.\" Gallagher added that it was the first time since 1991 that national revenues were trending downwards for the industry and newspapers had \"really done that hard selling to get that revenue.\"\n\"The Internet is just taking advertising revenue - and that is hurting us bad.\"\nAs for digital advertising sales, revenue at one of The New York Times Digital's properties, NYTimes.com, was down 13% year-to-date through the third quarter, according to Gallagher.\nMeanwhile, the American Society of News Editors is holding a conference next month on the decline in newspaper revenues due to a \"slump in ad sales.\"\nWhile the revenue decline may have started back in 200), a number of sources quoted in the article predicted that it would \"continue for several years.\" Most of the decline was caused by a \"slump in ad sales and the continuing drop in subscription prices (and) newspaper readerships,\" they said.\nNielsen Blinkx recently released data from their video portal which stated that 27% of internet video viewing in the US occurs via newspaper websites.\nIn Europe, newspaper advertising has been dropping \"almost consistently for the past five or six years,\" Gallagher said.\nOne of Gallagher's theories about the trend is that newspapers \"need to get more aggressive and more creative in coming up with innovative ways of monetizing their content online.\"\nSuch moves have been made by some newspapers such as the New York Times which recently began charging for access to their website. They have also begun offering advertisers access to their content by offering \"paid-subscriptions of e-editions.\"\nThe trend toward online advertising and content access is growing, Gallagher said.\nHe added: \"(It is) all well and good to say that you have online sales to support your content, but without offline sales, and it is a tough battle for the newspapers in terms of the circulation loss.\"\nGallagher said he was \"very worried (about circulation losses).\" It is clear that newspapers are now facing an \"uphill battle,\" as the overall economic climate becomes harsher.\nWhile \"there is a long run tail for the newspaper industry,\" he said that the industry faces its \"stumbling block.\"\nHe continued: \"We will bounce back. Some people are saying that we will never bounce back to the highs of the dot.com boom (in 2000). Well, I may not see that, but I know my colleagues will.\"\n\"I just hope that those newspapers that are trying to adjust that are innovating, trying to figure out ways of supporting their print products, are really making good business decisions.\"", "This memorandum provides information about the 1998\nState Teacher of the Year program and the selection of Maine's 1998\nState Teacher of the Year (STOY) will be the week of February 9 to\nMarch 4, 1998.

Waters.", "A group of 13 people at the Newseum in Washington, a museum dedicated to the First Amendment, tried to take a photo but were stopped by a security guard.\nThe Newseum is dedicated to the 1st Amendment of the Constitution:\n\"We champion the First Amendment and the 1985 Press Freedom Act as expressions of a free nation whose lifeblood is free expression. We provide a definitive resource for the study of news history and the presentation of news and its role in society worldwide.\"\nThe staff at the Newseum is often seen wearing a \"Free to be free\" lapel pin.\nSo it seems incongruent that a museum \"dedicated\" to the First Amendment would try to stop people from taking photos inside its building.\nBut when the Newseum's security team intercepted Nicole Martinell, a visitor, in front of a display of the 1st Amendment, her friends stepped up. Some even recorded the guards, who eventually were forced to back off.\nToday 4/1/13, I took photos of a \"No Photos\" sign in front of \"First Amendment\" exhibit at the National Newseum. They did not allow people to take photos at all, in any case, in that exhibit. I asked the guard why and he said \"because we don't want people taking pictures of the sign,\" he said. \"Why would you not want someone to take a photo of that? What does it matter if it's a photo of that exhibit?\" he told me.\nThat is an interesting question. After all, a security guard is supposed to be on the side of the people, not the side of the corporations, isn't he? I mean, if the First Amendment is worth anything at all, then it should be obvious in the 21st Century that photos are the greatest 1st Amendment tool around.\nWhen I asked about the sign, the guard gave a response that is unacceptable to many Americans: \"Well, actually, what we do is we protect them if they post this image on their website or something, they can get in trouble for that, from the corporation.\"\n\"We protect them?\" What does that mean? \"Well, actually, what we do is protect the corporations. That is what the law says. That is what we are required to do.\" He went on to say, \"We protect everyone, all customers, even those taking photos. All customers are protected\u2026if they take a photo of our art, we protect them if they post it online, under the law.\"\nSo we can assume that all photos are protected by law under the 1st Amendment by default, but the corporations will still have 24 hour access to the photos taken at the museum. That doesn't sound like the First Amendment.\nAfter being told that what I was doing was technically illegal while at the Newseum, I went to the National Archives to check in with the press officers to see what they thought about it. I filmed, again, the \"No Pictures\" signs I found there, and while I was at it, I asked them another question. I asked, \"Is the National Archives aware of any instances where a photo was taken inside the museum, of the actual documents? I've tried, I've attempted to find a document, like the Bill of Rights somewhere in a book, inside somewhere and I can't find it. Is there a reason for that?\"\nAnd they tell me, \"we discourage the use of cameras here. We would like visitors to not take photos of the documents. We don't have a large collection of documents, most are in storage. They are valuable, they are fragile, they are extremely vulnerable to environmental damage\u2026so we really don't want people to use cameras at all.\"\n\"Is that a violation of the 1st Amendment to do that?\" I ask.\n\"It's not a violation of the 1st Amendment because it's a public museum. This is the National Archives, not the National Archives for the Freedom of the Press, which the exhibit is called,\" the press officer replies.\nIf the National Archives wants to stop me from taking a photo of the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence, then they are not the National Archives I visited at all and I want nothing more to do with them. At least the Newseum was honest enough to say it was protecting you from yourself. I don't know what the National Archives or its press officer even think they are doing.\nIn any case, a group of 13 people at the Newseum was un", "The final rule announced today (the \u201cFinal Rule\u201d) will prohibit manufacturers and certain importers of food contact substances (e.g., additives) from conditionally approving a food contact substance (\u201cFCS\u201d) for a new use in a food or food contact article without first submitting data derived from a valid and reliable scientific study conducted in accordance with good scientific practice (\u201cGSP\u201d) or from a validated and reliable testing method in order to demonstrate the safety of the FCS. Additionally, the Final Rule will require an application to demonstrate the safety of the FCS, unless the FCS does not present a risk of adverse health effects for any of the conditions of use.\nFOOD CONTACT SUBSTANCES:\nOn September 13, 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) published the final rule amending its food additive regulations to provide for safety testing required for certain types of FCS, a summary of which is available at: //www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm 363182.htm.\nDuring the drafting of the rule, the Natural Resources Defense Council\n(\u201cNRDC\u201d) expressed concerns regarding a provision in the rule that,\naccording to NRDC, would in the future allow \u201cconditional\u201d\nauthorization for new FCSs and new uses for FCSs already (pre)conditionally\napproved, when there are no data that meet the new safety standard that is\nintroduced in the Final Rule.1\nNRDC argues that there are no adequate data to demonstrate that a food additive or a product containing a food additive will be safe for its\nproposed conditions of use.2 Thus, according to NRDC\u2019s analysis,\nthe rule creates the possibility that there will never be adequate data\nto demonstrate safety prior to a new use of a product being allowed to\nbe made.3 In response, the FDA stated that the conditional approval\nprovision was intended to enable new technology, but recognized\nthat it could be unduly burdensome.4 Thus, the FDA began soliciting comment from\nthe public in 2016 on a number of aspects of the Final Rule,\nincluding a proposal to require any new use of a FCS to be based on\nnew data.5 Following these comments, the FDA published\na supplemental proposed rule, which included additional safety\ntesting conditions, a summary of which is available at: //www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives\nSENIOR PARTNER, KENTUCKY\nOFFICE, RADISH LLP\nmstewart@radishllp.com\nThe information contained herein is provided as a service to clients and other interested persons and is not legal advice.

In their most vibrant days, the papers kept a watchful eye on the government and on politicians. And in an age of cynicism about the political process, Canadians still turn to their local papers for incisive coverage of the political process and to better understand the choices voters are asked to make.\nYet in addition to fulfilling their democratic roles, newspapers continue to play an important cultural and sociological role in local communities. In rural areas, newspapers remain a primary means by which small communities maintain contact and share a sense of pride.\nAs a weekly newspaper, our role is more than simply that of an enabler in the political and cultural life of our communities. In fact, as a weekly newspaper, we are in a position to tell the stories that are not often told anywhere else.\nIn our coverage of municipal and school board meetings, we not only provide insight into the decisions that are made, we often play a role in shaping the discussion.\nAnd we do this within the context of weekly community papers. No one weekly newspaper can cover everything important enough to be a worthy story. Even we here in the Valley Gazette, in our tiny community, find we often must make choices about what we can and can't do.\nIt is this challenge that is perhaps the most important of the challenges facing weekly newspapers, both in terms of their role in a democracy and in terms of their ability to report what's happening in a local community.\nGiven a choice between printing a press release and a paid advertising insert from an elected official, or a personal story about a local farmer, the story of the farmer will always win. Yet sometimes the choices are not so clear, and making the right choice takes careful consideration.\nWe think we have come up with an effective formula to meet this challenge. We have a weekly newsroom meeting that involves both the editor and the publisher. The week begins with an agreement on the paper's \"house\" editorial position on major current events. What is the Valley Gazette's position on this subject, and how is it reflected in our columns and articles for the week?\nThen we discuss the news we think is important. In terms of the week's editorials, this conversation is focused on how our readers might look at this news from a variety of viewpoints.\nAnd we end with an open discussion about news that is important to individual readers. This final category includes not only submissions to the newspaper's \"Back-Page\" column, but also stories from readers.\nBut while it is impossible for our newspaper to cover everything in the Valley, we think that we have developed a formula that allows us to fulfill our obligation to be responsible democratically and sociologically.\n(This week marks our 14th anniversary as publishers of the Valley Gazette, though we sold the paper in 2008 to John Campbell and the Campbell family, longtime newspaper operators in the Valley.)", "What's your \"future proof\" strategy?

He\u2019s currently advising Warner Brothers on their big screen transmedia movie tie-in for the next iteration of James Bond, which will take the brand, as of now, into the 21st century.\nMediaPost: What were your original intentions in going into the entertainment industry?\nGomez: I was one of nine kids and grew up in a household with little cash. So I had to sell lemonade and paper routes to make ends meet. In the process, I learned how to hustle. Hustle, hustle, hustle. I learned how to use every ounce of energy to maximize the results, because that was going to ensure that my family was going to eat the next day.\nI learned how to take an advertising message or anything people were saying and apply it to things that they never thought about\u2026I learned all of my best hustler and marketing concepts by selling newspapers when I was a little kid. As a result, when I graduated from college, my goal was to try to break into entertainment and advertising.\nI\u2019m always amazed because if you look at the storylines of a lot of the Hollywood movies, it\u2019s always about hustle, hustle, hustle.\nMP: What has been your success in the advertising world?\nGomez: It\u2019s always been about the hustling: trying to figure out business problems and figuring out how to do things differently and better, and that was based on my childhood experience.\nAs such, I used my own story as a template as to what to do with brands. I believe everything should be built as an ad for something else, and I love using storytelling to help businesses connect with their audiences.\nFor example, we turned a $100 million movie campaign for a company I was working with at the time. They had spent $100 million to build a brand out of a movie.\nThat movie was being pitched as one of the biggest films of the season, but it ended up being a big, giant bomb. I spent $10 to get it from the street and get it into the theaters, and it made $250 million for one night.\nThat movie is proof that advertising, when done well\u2026there are no guarantees, because you can have the best creative team in the world and do everything right, and still have issues. But it was a phenomenally well-received movie.\nI took the advertising that had originally been used to pitch this movie and turned it into the movie: the film ad copy and the commercials. I turned them into the movie\u2019s website. I actually ended up getting permission from the studio and filmmakers and the writer to do that. It was done in a way that was appropriate for the movie, and the studio was so thrilled with this.\nThey were, especially because they hadn\u2019t done anything like it before and wanted to try it. I said, \u201cLook, if it works, it works, but you should also know that this is the best thing that\u2019s happened to you", "To get ahead in today's marketing world, you need to leverage data across channels.\nThe 149 media companies that are 2020 World's Most Innovative Media Companies, from The Business of Media newsletter, understand they must use data to drive decision-making and marketing.

And I have been in a relationship with another man since December and he and I have lived together since March. My ex-husband and myself have two children. We have been involved in a custody dispute over them. Recently we have been talking about a \"modified final parenting plan\". My ex- husband asked for a DNA test to prove paternity of our oldest son (now ages 5). I agreed to it. They used the 2 best labs in the country for this. The reason was that my ex-husband had hired a lawyer that would not take my phone calls or answer my letters. And he had gotten his girl friend's younger brother's phone number and address and was mailing letters to him from the court asking him who my ex's brother had been hanging around with to help me help get the DNA test done. I was not going to let these injustices stand without doing something to stop it. The judge in the case was very liberal but he also seemed afraid that if the paternity test came back that I was not the father then that would mean our youngest would not be entitled to a minority vote and a trust would have to be created for the youngest. My lawyer was trying to tell me that was not true. So I talked to my older son's doctor and got his medical records and called the judge and told him that I had my son's medical records that state in the record about the birth of my son as \"unspecified male\". I then told the court that I was asking that the records be entered in as evidence and they be copied to the lawyers and the court because I wanted to make sure that there was a court record that shows that I was not the brother of my ex husband. After much back and forth discussion over the summer, the judge agreed. We are finally heading for hearing that was agreed to. We had a pretrial hearing in September. The judge had ordered my ex husband to bring all the mail and bills to the hearing regarding the custody hearing and our youngest son since March. My ex husband was present to produce those records. The judge had also at the same time ordered my ex husband to turn over to me and my then boy friend, now husband, all of the records he had of his financial life since January which was when I started seriously seeing my now husband. He did it at this hearing. He handed me all the records that I requested of both my oldest son and my youngest son. He said I would still have to go into his personal records but he handed me the records of everything I was supposed to have. Since June I had called and emailed the judge asking him to hold a hearing to get the records of my now boy friend since he had threatened him and he had me emailed him the papers he sent to him. Since we are both lawyers the judge said we would meet at his chambers and he would tell us what he found from him. A few weeks ago the judge told me that he could see that my ex husband had not tried to help me at all to get his own records so he did not know where else to get documents from him. The judge also told me that he had found my now boy friend had written to the judge about how he was scared for his life because of my ex-husband's actions so the judge was also finding my ex husband financially unstable. The judge said he now needed to know what it would cost to go on with this hearing since we have gotten so far as to get 95% of what we need. I asked the judge what he would charge me if I had a lawyer of my own for the hearing and he said he would probably charge a minimum of $5000 and maybe more since my brother and sister both wanted to be my lawyer and he told them it was against the order of the court not to do that. So we still have to go back to court and find out if my ex husband has any more money or how long he can go on what he has to pay the lawyer so it is not up to me to pay for most of it. In the meantime my younger son's father is telling everybody how I have made him out to look as some awful person when he does not even work except for when he is in his summer job when he has to work. The judge told him to knock it off and not talk about the case. He told us that the child is not supposed to be in school to help their parents decide what happens with the custody and he ordered my son to leave my older son alone unless it was under", "\"He's Going Over,\" The S.

These young people tend to understand and use a variety of Web 2.0 tools better than those in their older generations, thus their ability to report the news and tell the story of a community on digital platforms is often beyond that of their elders. It therefore follows that new forms of digital journalism and the new ways that news outlets report the news should be led by those who are most comfortable with the new ways of reporting and distributing the news.\nAlthough most people are still thinking in old media terms when they discuss journalism and the new roles that journalists have to play, social-media-savvy reporters and news organizations are evolving quickly to meet the growing demand for digital-native journalism and news. These digital natives are the next generation of journalists and new media outlets and journalists, and there is much to be gained by embracing these digital pioneers. This chapter explores what journalists can bring to the table in the new news environment and what they can do to create news for the digital native audience. It looks at strategies used by some pioneer-journalism-education facilities to train these digital natives and give them the education to make them effective journalists in the digital age. Finally, the chapter concludes with suggestions for the media-consultancy-and-marketing community as to why social-media-savvy reporters, and particularly digital-native journalists, should be embraced as the new generation of digital reporters who will lead the media evolution.\n#  Digital Native Reporters\nAs part of its Digital Natives research, the Reuters Institute recently published a Digital Natives news diary study that explores the news-gathering habits of the new generation of journalists. The report found that a growing number of journalists in the 18\u201325 age range use Web 2.0 technologies such as social media and online forums to source information and news. These digital native journalists tend to know how to tell a good story in the online world and bring an audience. The key point to consider is that the next generation of journalists will most likely be raised in the digital world and as a direct result will know digital better than many of the news publishers themselves.\nThe digital native is likely to be more familiar than most in the 50\u201370 age range with a variety of Web 2.0 platforms and technologies. While the older generation may still be wondering what that word _Twitter_ is used in reference to, the next generation of journalists will also be the early adopters of innovation, and thus, their influence on the direction of journalism and news-reporting techniques cannot be ignored. The digital native learns more about the world from the online realm than from traditional channels such as television and radio, as many young people have grown up without knowing how to use a TV or a radio. Thus, the digital native often knows a lot about the world in terms of global news and information, yet may not have learned enough to become a traditional journalist. Digital native journalists know how to tell great stories online, but they may not have the editorial experience, for example, to help shape news coverage and have an opinion about the way a story should end. As digital publishing becomes the new norm, so will digital native journalism, and traditional journalists can learn much from their upcoming replacements.\nWhile most people have never heard of some of these digital platforms, some will be more familiar with Google+ than Twitter or Facebook. It is this digital native generation that may eventually decide what the mainstream news will look like. They already report on and write about the news.\nAs the next generation of news readers, these digital natives are accustomed to consuming content in short bursts, and they like to digest information from a wide variety of sources, whether that source is a person, platform, organization, or just a good article.\nThe Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford conducted a Digital Natives study during the latter half of 2012. Researchers looked at the ways these digital native journalists gather information, what they share, how they engage with others and participate in discussions, and how they source their new and important stories across different Web 2.0 technologies.\nThe report found that digital native journalists use the new technologies available for finding information but tend to do so in the context of existing professional norms, such as the norm that a news source be an established, trusted organization.\nAs new technologies became more prominent, digital native journalists", "The article summarizes the findings from this study that included 300 participants.\nOBJECTIVE: The study was designed to investigate the effects of an educational programme on diet and physical activity in patients attending a cardiology outpatient clinic. This article presents results from a study examining the effectiveness of educational techniques in improving diet and physical activity levels in patients.\nDESIGN: This was a repeated-measures randomized controlled trial with baseline assessment, the main assessments (including one measurement in year 1 and in year 2) and further follow-ups.\nSETTING: A cardiology outpatient clinic.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 300 patients who attended the clinic were randomly allocated to an intervention group, which was offered a series of educational booklets and a videotape, or to a control group. Data for this study were derived from questionnaires at baseline, the end of year one and at the end of year two.\nINTERVENTION: The intervention group received two booklets (physical activity and dietary guidelines) and the videotape (which was used to educate patients about food pyramid eating).\nMAIN VARIABLES MEASURED: Dietary and physical activity levels were measured by the validated Diet and Physical Activity Questionnaire (DAPAQ).\nRESULTS: In years one and two, significant improvements in diet and physical activity levels were found in the intervention group. Particularly, the intakes of fish, nuts, fruits and vegetables were significantly increased. There were small improvements of physical activity level too. Although physical activity levels were not altered significantly, overall physical fitness improved in the intervention group significantly.\nCONCLUSION: A structured educational programme for patients attending a cardiology outpatient clinic results in improved dietary and physical activity levels. Such an educational programme will be useful in improving diet and physical activity levels more widely.\nKeywords cardiology, education programme, heart disease\nCitation: Kikuchi H (2007) Education programme: an assessment of diet and physical activity levels.

I thought I had made clear a few months ago when I was interviewing for his job that I wouldn't be interested, but somehow he got my address again and now he's calling to say they gave him the position. All of a sudden, I'm being called and emailed from all the top fashion magazines. So here I am at the Lansdale Country Club and I have no idea what to wear. Oh, and did I mention that Michael is an accountant? An accountant!\nSo I decided on the only thing I knew would look nice, and that was my one nice party dress that my parents bought me a couple years ago when they thought I might actually land a position at a fashion magazine. Michael told me to meet him before my interview, so I could get some pointers for the interviewing process. When I got to the club and asked the valet parking guy where to find Michael, he said, \"Let me see here. Is it like a guy you know, not necessarily a guy you think you know, because you know guys are notoriously unreliable, who is this, uhmm . . . whatshisname?\"\nIt was then that I realized I didn't, in fact, know his name. So I asked the man, \"Do you mean my boyfriend, Greg? No, this man is an old friend of mine, but I haven't seen him in years, he was just a good-looking classmate of mine from college.\"\n\"Oh, did we have the same girlfriends in college? No idea. Now listen, honey, I've got my hands full right now\u2014I've got to find this woman's party dress, because apparently she wanted to wear it to her interview. It's not like I can just go around asking people, Can I have your party dress? Can I have a look-see at whatever I can get my hands on here? It doesn't work like that, hon. You have got to be pretty slick to get those people to part with their fancy clothes, especially on the day when they want to be wearing those clothes the most. You need to really be cool about it and act all friendly and friendly-looking, and I think that will make the valet guy give you a better price. So here I am, giving you all the advice I can, because you got the wrong guy. I think you'll need to call my boss. Maybe he can give you pointers. I would love to see you wear that dress and I'll let you borrow it for an evening or two and then my boss can have it back. How does that work out for you, hon?\"\n\"Great,\" I said, \"I'm pretty happy with that idea.\"\n\"What am I supposed to wear?\" I asked, looking right past Mr. Lansdale Country Club Valet Guy, who was wearing a nice tweed jacket with a gold watch chain, his bowtie tucked neatly underneath his vest, and I couldn't decide between a blue serge suit with spats or a blue serge suit with spats covered in red velvet. I wasn't sure myself.\n\"My advice is to forget all about it and not even bother to wear anything, but I can have them call over to the ladies' room at Chilson's and see if they can send you up a spare outfit, I'd wager that they know when one of our patrons walks in here,\" said Mr. Country Club Valet.\n\"I just need to know to where I'm going.\"\n\"I don't know, I haven't had that one out of my mouth in so long that I forgot what it was . . . I mean, it's been a long time. I don't know about you, but when I get so busy all at once, I forget the names of everyone I know.\" Then he frowned, and I had to ask myself, what kind of person frowns in order to give advice? \"You know, people tend to have good ideas all by themselves when they're thinking for themselves. So you're going here . . .\"\nHe pointed across the street. No, wait. I was looking at a hotel. The place where he'd said I was going was a park.\n\"Well, yeah, you are. You're going to the Lansdale Country Club. You are.\"\n\"Oh shiiiit.\"\n\"Hey! I was getting to the bottom of your story.\"\n\"That story ends right now, as of today.

I decided to\nattend in 2007 for two reasons. The first was to see if it was more fun than\nbeing at work. The second was to gather data for an annual report to my\nclient, who is a brand in the event.\nThe CFR is like no other agriculture-related event I have ever attended,\nand there are probably several reasons for my high level of enjoyment. There\nis nothing like the thrill of watching eight-to-twelve-second\nrepresentatives from the agriculture industry compete, and nothing like the\nspontaneous applause of a crowd of 10,000 people.\nThe rodeo, which is held in Edmonton, Alberta, has a strong agriculture influence. Although we have the Western Canadian Farm Progress Show\nin Saskatoon, SK, and the Pacific Agri-Food Society of Alberta conference\nin Banff, AB, this is the only major event of its type in western Canada.\nThe fact that there are approximately 10,000 people in attendance is very\nimpressive in my mind. There is huge agriculture influence in this crowd, as I\ncan see people wearing their blue jeans, cowboy hats, shirts, boots, and\nslickers -- but all of them still very attractive.\nThere is definitely an attractive cowboy influence in the crowd. It is great to see a female cowboy with boots and jeans. You see this kind of crowd at many agriculture events, but this crowd is more concentrated than many of the other events, and it feels right that\nit draws such a big crowd.\nAt one point during the rodeo, a young cowboy came out -- actually running\nonto the arena floor -- with a newborn calf. He was just as wild as you would\nexpect him to be, holding the calf around one knee, while holding himself\nup on his other leg and looking at a group of women in the front row with\nsuch love and excitement in his eyes. He made an even bigger impact when he\nstarted making kissing noises when the crowd started cheering at the top of\ntheir lungs.\nIt is great to see branding at an event in the agriculture industry, as\nthough it might seem overdone, it is well deserved when a crowd of 10,000\npeople are excited, and they are showing their support for the brand. The\nsponsorship banners are just as expected, except the boasts that you would\nexpect to see from a sponsor like SARP or Egg Farms were replaced with\nmessages such as \"Thank you, Edmonton\" and \"Support Rodeo.\" This is just a small\nchange that makes such a difference for a sponsor, especially if they put in a\nlot of effort to gain a sponsorship position of this stature.\nAt this stage in the rodeo, the crowd and the rodeo-goers are starting to thin out. The crowd thins out, but the seats fill up quickly when\nthe evening show starts. The evening show is a stage production, which\nstarts after a break for dinner. There is a special section dedicated to\nchildren, which has a magic show, a puppet show and some other kid-friendly\nactivities. This is a great example of entertainment for all ages. As an\nadult, my children are my age -- and there are also a lot of empty seat\navailable at this time in the evening.\nThere are so many things a brand can take into account for\nevent-marketing success. Attention to detail and a plan make a world of\ndifference. When I look at this event from both an event organizing and\nagriculture industry point of view, I truly feel that it would take a lot of\neffort to make a rodeo at this scale more enjoyable and more successful.\nThe people who work hard to make agriculture the success that it is are also the people who will work hard to make an event like this one the most enjoyable it can be.\nAbout the Author: Tim McBride is President and Creative Director of\nThe McBride Agency, a marketing firm that specializes in direct marketing for farm businesses.

At the Daily Mail Online (DMOL), 8 million unique browsers were converted to five million unique browsers; at the Daily Telegraph Online, conversions dropped for all but two sites; the Independent Online recorded a 42 percent increase over the previous quarter; the Financial Times Online recorded an 81 percent increase over the previous quarter; and The Times/The Sunday Times recorded a 23.6 percent increase. In a related UK study, a consumer survey from the Audit Bureau of Circulations and the Publishers Audience Measurement Company reveals that more than 31 million individuals are either members of or access the information on their favorite newspaper's website.\nDespite some declines in print circulation, these metrics are an indication of the growing popularity of online content. But while there are no hard conclusions to be drawn with so many variables involved, these developments do indicate that the two mediums are complementary with an increasing correlation between the performance of the print and online editions. As a percentage of subscriptions purchased, online subscriptions are up two points.\nhttp://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=4&storycode=40193\nCONCLUSION: The question is how many browsers become subscribers, that is, how many buy from the web instead of the standalone subscription?", "\"The media does not serve the people\" is a frequent refrain from readers and journalists alike. Readers are disappointed; the media is unhappy. But the media is doing precisely what it should be doing.\nReaders of the Media Briefs newsletters have heard this argument many times: the media does not serve the people. Some readers disagree; they think the media does a pretty good job. But most of us agree. We argue about why -- and what we'd like to see if we were in charge.\nThose who think the media is serving the people well are still missing the point. They should take a step back to understand why that is true.\nThe media is an aggregation of many parts working independently of each other, yet in concert with many other parts to produce a whole. And the whole is the product consumed by individual members of the audience. Some of the members get a lot and some of members get hardly any.\nThe whole is not just the product of all the separate parts. Not at all. For instance, take a book. Each section -- each sentence, every word, the type, the order of the chapters -- were put together to produce a whole. But then again, there's no such thing as a book, there are just some number of copies of a book.\nFor a book to exist, there are a whole lot of independent parts, but once a book is created all those parts go away.\nWhen we're buying a newspaper or watching the evening news on TV, the media is the whole, not just the sum of its parts. The media we see is the product of all of the parts that are aggregated into a particular piece in which we're now consuming.\nA media outlet is more than a collection of individual stories. It's the product of the individual stories, of the photographer, the reporters and producers, the editors, the advertiser and the reader. The media outlet is the physical product that you get by putting all those things together -- including the person or persons who do the actually reading. (To borrow a phrase from Henry Blodget, the average media consumer is \"much better informed than she realizes.\")\nThere is a difference between media and products of media. If media was simply the product of it's individual parts taken in sum -- if newspapers were just the sum of all the individual stories -- that would not be the case.\nIf media was just the sum of the stories being told, there would be nothing on that newscaster's desk. The cameras could be turned off. They have to take some of the story and not all the story. They decide what goes into the product. The product is the product. So the media -- the product -- is not the collection of facts. Nor is it the sum of the stories.\nYou cannot buy a media product without other parts being there. If I buy a newspaper, my purchase was not just the sum of the words and words in the paper and the photos and so on. You can't separate one part from another. The whole is not just the sum of each part.\nIf you can't separate the parts from the whole, then you can't separate the parts from the market -- a product's audience.\nThat's why the media cannot be \"consumer-driven.\" A media product cannot simply respond to each individual customer. It has to respond to the total number of people who read or watch it. At the same time, each individual can choose how they want to consume the media. You can't make it more or less available -- not by your buying choices, anyway.\nSo the media does not serve the people -- not directly. Even if every one of us in this country paid $1,000 a year to buy all the news media we wanted, we would not be getting the whole news media anymore. And just giving everyone a dollar every year is not the same as letting everyone buy anything they wanted. They could buy whatever parts of the media they wanted, but they will not have a media made up of everything they wanted.\nEven if every person in this country was giving $1K a year to the newspaper industry, I'm not sure it would help the industry much.\nThere also have to be rules about how much money is there for ads? What will the media look like when there are no \"classified ads\" and no ads in general? Will there be a cost to having that news, or is the news there with or without the ads? What happens if there's too little ad revenue to pay the reporters?\nIt's not the same if the newscasters and reporters get a salary or if they work for a big company where they have to compete for sal", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is\nissuing this order denying an application by the Northwest Public\nService Company (Northwest) to waive the requirement that the\nCommission accept jurisdiction over a rate for use of the Western\nHemisphere Trail  (WHT) system.  Specifically, Northwest seeks\nassurance that the proposed rate  will be implemented without\ninterference from the Commission.  The Commission declines to issue\nsuch assurances in this proceeding.\nThe application was assigned Docket No. EL98-55 on June 22, 1998,\nand is scheduled for a procedural hearing and decision on July 10,\n1998.  For the reasons set forth below, the Commission disapproves\nof the Northwest application, pursuant to section 205(e) of the\nFederal Power Act (FPA), 16 U.S.C. sec. 824d(e).\nThe WHT is a route connecting the lower contiguous state of\nWashington, the states of Oregon, and Idaho with the lower 48\nstates.  It is 7,700 miles long and primarily follows existing high-\nvoltage transmission lines.  At some times of the year, the\ninterconnection with the lower forty-eight states occurs across\ntwo high voltage transmission system (HVTS) lines operated by the\nWestern Area Power Administration.  Northwest has announced its\nintention to provide WHT service on an inter-HVTS basis at no\ncharge to system customers as described in the June 4, 1998 letter\nsent to Northwest by the Bonneville Power Administration.  This\njurisdiction-free HVTS service was approved by the Bonneville Power\nAdministration on June 15, 1998.  The Northwest proposal to waive\nservice jurisdiction over the inter-HVTS portion of the WHT system\nwould enable Northwest to provide rate-free interconnection service\nto customers in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council\n(WECC) balancing area (the Northwest Interconnection).\nNorthwest requests a waiver of jurisdiction over the inter-\nHVTS system for WHT service in the following three circumstances:\n(1)  for transmission not exceeding 100 kilovolts (kV); (2)\nany transmission at non-zero megawatts (MW) above 100 kV; and (3)\nfor any transmission through line segments above 115 kV and\nbelow 230 kV that are not included in the FERC-approved\nfacilities used by Northwest.  Northwest also requests a waiver\nof jurisdiction over any transmission over 230 kV and above\n1,100 kV that is not included in the FERC-approved facilities\nused by Northwest.\nNorthwest seeks reassurance that this Commission will allow\ninterparty transmission of electricity over the inter-HVTS system\npursuant to the Northwest application.  The Commission does not\nwish to prejudge its review of Northwest's application.  The\njurisdictional status of this rate must be decided in the proceeding\nbefore the Commission.  The Commission believes it prudent to make\nthe jurisdictional determination before assuring Northwest of the\navailability of requested transmission services.  The Commission\nwill decline any applications filed after the jurisdictional\nhearing.

As stated in the Declaration of Independence, the\ngoal of this dream is \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.\"  Today's American Dream is a dream of\nadvancement. With the growth and expansion of America's\neconomy during the period of 1870 to 1970, the dream became\na reality for many.  However, during the last five\ndecades the economy has had little to no growth. The\nAmerican Dream has become a state of being. To be is to\nstay \"average.\"  Although America's 20th century\neconomic surge allowed \"average\" Americans to buy\nautomobiles, houses, washing machines, and color\ntelevisions, America in the 1980's and 1990's has become\ndisappointed on \"average\" life status.  The American Dream\nhas degraded into the American Dreamless. Today America\nis still recovering from the recession of the early 1980's\nand remains with its economic slump.  As the American\neconomy grows, so does the American Dream.  The American\nDream is the dream of progress. Progress is achieved daily\nby Americans. This is due to the great diversity of the\neconomy. Americans from all walks of life contribute to\nits growth. Since America is so large and diverse, the\neconomy is also diversified.  Because of this economical\ndiversity a larger market base is established for more\nAmericans and for lower prices. Although, America's\ngrowing economy has helped the majority of its citizens,\nthe growth of the economy has had little effect on the lower\nmiddle class, and many of those Americans are the\ngeneration closest to the old American Dream.  The\nAmericans on the lowest socioeconomic rung are also the\nyoungest members in our society, whose dreams and aspirations\nare the most important. America is in need of a\nre-established dream. The American Dream is an\nAmerican invention.  The American Dream does not exist\nanywhere else in the world.  The only \"dream\" is to be an\nAmerican.

In fact, many studies have found that the use of essential oils can help the body cope with chronic stress. Since chronic stress can lead to depression, the use of essential oils could be an excellent addition to traditional treatments. In addition, it could help those who are fighting depression.\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) suggests that people who are experiencing depression might want to try essential oils for stress and depression. This is because essential oils contain important antidepressant compounds. However, many people might not know which types of essential oils can help someone feel better. In fact, different studies have shown that particular essential oils could help people who are fighting depression. Some essential oils can help improve mood, which could also help manage depression. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) suggests that using essential oils could be beneficial because they are usually well tolerated. In fact, studies have suggested that people who use essential oils for mood-boosting purposes are less likely to experience side effects. With these factors, some people who experience depression might want to consider essential oils.\nMany people might worry that using essential oils for mood-boosting purposes is too much of a commitment. However, people might be shocked to find out that using essential oils could be simpler than they think. For example, some people use essential oils with an aroma diffuser. This is an excellent way to inhale the useful compounds in essential oils. Others might want to diffuse essential oils or put a few drops in their bath. In fact, there are many different ways that people can incorporate essential oils into their daily routine. Because these essential oils could help people feel better, some studies have suggested that their use is becoming more widespread. According to the NCCIH, essential oils are even being used as complementary and alternative therapies. However, it is important for people to talk to a doctor before they use essential oils for mood-boosting purposes. That is because the use of essential oils could potentially interact with medications that treat depression.\nPeople who are seeking a natural treatment for their depression might want to consider essential oils for stress and depression. Although the use of essential oils has not yet been proven by researchers, people who are using essential oils could feel like the products are helping them. Some people might also notice that using essential oils is a natural depression remedy. In addition to providing better mental health, using essential oils could also reduce the risk of side effects that are associated with medications. To ensure that using essential oils is right for each individual, people who are considering using essential oils should talk to a medical professional first. By considering essential oils, people might be able to better learn how essential oils could help them manage their symptoms.\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

That's a tall order, yes, but the result will be a new pathway to success. It will be easier to implement a system to meet the needs of clients, and it will help you achieve the business goals that you set for the project.\nWHO IS THIS GUIDE FOR?\nThis guide is for marketers at marketing agencies, and also for their clients.\nYou can be working with or on behalf of B2B companies, and you need to be able to help your clients use marketing automation effectively. In these sections I'll start to outline some of the steps you'll need to take to get this done.\nToo often we find marketers (and the people who work with them) wasting time on manual tasks, instead of moving their precious expertise to their key business differentiator. They do, however, have the capability, along with their clients, to create an effective marketing automation system for their business that will deliver on some business goals.\nIn this guide, I'll help you to define the business, technical, and operational requirements for this project.\nWHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT\nIf you work with businesses, you need this book. You can, of course, apply these lessons to your own business, too, but perhaps we can help you to better serve your clients, by using your knowledge and experience within a different lens.\nThe lesson plan that follows, outlining the strategy and technology that we use, will help marketers and agencies create a business goal-aligned marketing automation system.\nIn Chapter 1, we will look at the challenges that marketers face while working with their clients around the business problem you and they have in common. If you work at a marketing agency, it's likely that your clients are struggling with the same challenges that make up your workday:\n  * How do we set up a consistent marketing cadence from a business perspective?\n  * How do we track and score leads' behavior from their initial actions, through the pipeline, and on to conversion, so that we know where they are in the funnel, and what the next best step for them could be?\n  * How can we track what content our leads are engaged with, so that we know what is resonating with them?\n  * How might we set up a personalized content strategy for each one of our leads?\n  * When does an account salesperson come in?\n  * How do we ensure that the information about your team's goals and activities is communicated effectively, whether you're on one of your team's projects, or you're on a different team?\n  * How do we define the strategic goal so that your team can understand the project scope, goals, and deliverables?\n  * How do we track and attribute business goals with your work?\nIf you're working on this project, perhaps you're going to do this exercise with your client team as well.\nIf you are a marketer or an agency working with your client team, this is your challenge. How can you set up a system to help your client team do the work to define their goals, set the system up, and implement the system in a way that is beneficial? You want to make a business different with marketing. You need to make the system work for your team, your clients' team, and for your clients' business partners.\nIf you're a marketer, and you work at an agency, you can do this project independently, but you need to include your team in the challenge. You can involve your team, or you can do this job as an individual.\nI recommend that, if you are a marketer or an agency, then you start to do independent business development: setting up a series of interviews with potential clients, to help you understand their situation better, and to understand how your services could help.

News Digital Media and MSN, however, did not have content control over the postings within their servers.\nAlthough the judge refused to set down \u201cgeneralisations about the Internet,\u201d the court noted an increasing number of libel proceedings over online material and the prevalence of online media, where \u201cit is common for an individual to post material on a web site, the identity of the author not readily apparent,\u201d stated the decision. \u201cThat fact creates the possibility that some of the material will be defamatory and will fall to be considered by the courts in the same way as print publications, whether in newspapers, bulletins or leaflets.\u201d\nThe decision follows a decision from the High Court of England and Wales in December 2005 that a British web magazine was held responsible for comments made to a discussion board by others. In that case, the defiendants, London-based Associated", "As the media business becomes more complex, we can no longer\nexpect staffing and skillset to match in-depth product planning and\nexecution.

Alleged torture and\nmistreatment continued in Iraqi prisons, and several hundred\npersons had been executed since UNSCOM had begun operations in Iraq\nin August 1991.\nThe United Nations (UN) continued to demand that Iraq comply\nwith Security Council resolutions. The United States also intensified\nits campaign against Iraq, leading a boycott against Iraq in late\n1993 and seeking UN sanctions against Iraq's oil exports.\nIn the run-up to the April 1994 UN Sanctions Resolution, UN\nofficials and human rights groups called on Iraq not to use forced\nlabor in its military research institutions and not to infringe\nupon the rights of its citizens. The Iraqi Government acknowledged\nthe existence of an underground gasification unit in 1991.\nCovering the late November 1993 Security Council debates over\nthe first sanctions resolution, Iraqi Vice-Minister of Defense and\nMinister of Public Works, Kadhim Amin Hashim, stated, \"Iraq is a\nsovereign state, free and independent. No government is to give its\nsovereignty to another state in an unconditional manner. . . . Iraq is\na member of the United Nations and one of its founding fathers,\nand Iraq has a constitutional right to defend itself against\naggression and to use whatever methods the UN itself has given it\npermission to use to maintain its security. These sanctions go against\nthe very concept of the inviolibility of the State and the right to\ndefend oneself.\"\nThe sanctions resolution did not call for the use of force.\nBut the UN Security Council gave unambiguous statements that it\nwould use force to accomplish its goals: To disarm Iraq of all\nweapons of mass destruction and not to permit Iraq to export\npetroleum, \"except on a humanitarian basis.\"\nThe sanctions resolution did not include exemptions for Iraq's\noil-for-food sales.\nA 10- member committee formed under the resolution was instructed\nto report to the Council by June 30, 1994 on whether an\n\"emergency\" had occurred to warrant lifting the sanctions. If\n\"emergency\" did not occur, the sanctions would be in place for 8\nyears, \"unless determined by the Council by a second resolution,\nafter June 30, 1994, to be no longer necessary for a prolonged\nperiod.\" Even so, the sanctions resolution stated that \"normal\ntrade [in exports] including supply of essential commodities and\ncritical items shall be permitted. Iraq shall also be provided\nwith such humanitarian supplies as may be needed to the extent\nconsistent with paragraph 9 (d) of resolution 687.\"\nNevertheless, the U.S.-based Iraqi Freedom Campaign, which\nopposes sanctions, said the sanctions resolution violated the\nspirit of the December 18, 1991 UN Resolution 687 because that\nresolution, unlike this resolution's provisions, allowed the\nselling of medicines and food through the UN Oil for Food Program\nimplemented by the World Food Program and U.N.

From the very beginning of the manhunt that followed the horrific terrorist attacks, there was an urgency to understand exactly what had taken place.\nAs new details emerged, so did new questions such as: What can we learn about Norwegian society and the attacker? What might be done to avoid such events in the future? How will Norway respond?\nBoth traditional and new media outlets were on the scene, from on-scene reporting to providing an ongoing stream of context.\nBut the information presented was rarely about facts; instead, it was about context and analysis.\nThe World Economic Forum presented research that showed that media outlets are best at providing context during and directly following such events, and can provide analysis that brings the story beyond the simple fact that one person carried out a mass shooting. The report is based on research that involved a large sample of major events taken from 60 countries between 1995 and 2002, where researchers examined media\u2019s response to 45 violent news events such as mass shootings, deaths in war or terrorism, political assassination, or suicide bombing. As a result of this research, the report\u2019s analysis highlights media\u2019s role in disclosing information about the attack, investigating the attacker and the circumstances around events leading up to the attack, identifying the impact of the attack, and helping with the recovery phase of the event.\nFor media outlets, providing context is an essential part of the editorial role in news. In a crisis situation, media must deliver relevant information from different angles to help readers understand what events took place, and gain a better understanding of why the events occurred.\nIn Norway, the media fulfilled these functions, but they went beyond them. The media also communicated with society and helped build public understanding around many questions and answers, including whether or not we had failed to recognize signs that something might take place. This is where the analysis component is extremely important, in terms of helping readers understand the situation and what the future holds.\nThe World Economic Forum report concludes this way: \u201cResearch of the role of media in crises consistently finds how the media is a key player and that its role is crucial in helping an affected community gain a more accurate perspective, cope with a crisis, and take the appropriate steps.\u201d\nThis article first appeared in the July/August digital edition of INMA\u2019s magazine, titled: Norway Crisis: What Can News Media Teach Us?\nPREV Scripps Cincinnati to buy the Dayton Daily News NEXT PwC Tries to Bring Transparency to Digital Ad Exchanges", "Samsung reported a dramatic drop in digital camera sales for the company and an associated decline in handset unit shipments for the three months ended June 30.\nBroadcom Corp. reported solid revenue and gross margin growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended July 3 despite a 1 percent decrease in semiconductor revenue year over year. But the company issued cautious current quarter fourth-quarter guidance based on a continuation of current inventory and demand trends.\nThe stocks of both Broadcom and Samsung Electronics finished the week modestly higher, and the semiconductor sector and the overall market remained upbeat.\nFor its fiscal third quarter ended July 3, Broadcom posted a nearly 11 percent sequential increase in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) on a 12 percent increase in revenue. GAAP EPS were $1.55, including a non-GAAP net tax income gain of three cents per share. (The net tax gain resulted from the reversal of an estimated tax charge that was previously booked related to Broadcom being an early adopter of a tax amnesty program in Korea. Broadcom expects to book a tax charge related to the decision in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 2.)\nIn the non-GAAP measure, the EPS gain was attributed to improvements in gross margin and operating expenses. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 69.0 percent compared with 57.7 percent for the prior-year period, while non-GAAP gross margin was 69.9 percent compared with 65.0 percent.\nThese results fell below Wall Street\u2019s estimates. In its most recent consensus estimate based on the results of five analysts reporting to Thomson First Call, Broadcom was expected to post $336.95 million in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of 17 cents a share.\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom expects total sales of $359 million to $369 million. Non-GAAP EPS are targeted to range from 16 cents to 17 cents a share, or from $59.5 million to $61.5 million. Revenue guidance for the fourth quarter includes the normal seasonal pattern related to semiconductor sales, such as the Chinese New Year in January, as well as the impact of the newest version of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPod model.\n\u201cI am very confident in our ability to deliver strong gross margin, high-end non-GAAP profitability and positive earnings seasonality from a year ago, as well as the usual seasonal pattern from the fourth quarter,\u201d Broadcom CEO Scott McGregor said in a conference call.\nIn the handset market, McGregor pointed to a slowdown this quarter in unit shipments across wireless handset suppliers.\n\u201cBased on trends we have observed and industry research, we expect the year-over-year unit shipment decline of the industry\u2019s leading handset suppliers to be even more pronounced in the second half of 2009, and we believe that demand drivers for broadband handsets will continue to grow well into 2010,\u201d McGregor said in prepared remarks.\nBased on this view, Broadcom lowered estimates for semiconductor revenue and handset unit shipments.\nBroadcom expects handset unit shipments to range from 1.6 billion units (an 8.5 percent year-over-year decline) to 1.7 billion units (a 7.7 percent year-over-year decline). This compares with previous guidance that handset unit shipments to range from 1.7 billion units (an 18.4 percent year-over-year decline) to 1.85 billion units (a 38.2 percent decline).\nMobile handset chip sales are pegged to range from $4.65 billion to $4.85 billion. This compares with previous guidance that mobile handset chip sales to range from $5 billion to $5.4 billion.\nWithin handsets, Broadcom expects smartphone unit and sales trends to be stronger as compared with the past year, particularly for CDMA-only smartphones and other 3G products.\nMcGregor said wireless infrastructure sales in the third quarter will benefit from the strength in the handset market segment, while gross margin in the segment could slip further, to as low as 24 percent.\nWireless infrastructure chip revenue and sales are targeted to decrease from 10", "On May 9, 2019, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) voted 3-2 to issue its first decision in PCC Structurals, Inc., 367 NLRB No. 126 (May 21, 2019). In this case, the Board addressed four employer policies at issue in three consolidated cases. It held two of the three employer policies are lawful, and one of the policies is unlawful and is prohibited pursuant to Section 10(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The Board also, for the first time, granted certification pursuant to Section 10(a)(2) to a union representing all employees in a 330-employee bargaining unit.\nAs explained in more detail below, the Board first analyzed the legality of two employer policies: prohibitions on wearing apparel related to current or future employer clients and a social media policy. It found both to be lawful.1 It then analyzed the legality of the employer\u2019s policy prohibiting employees from disclosing confidential information. It overruled its previous precedent under the Administrative Practices Act of 1947 (39 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\u2014405 (1947)) and found this policy to be unlawful and, accordingly, prohibited pursuant to Section 10(a)(1) of the NLRA. The Board\u2019s decision in PCC Structurals, Inc., 367 NLRB No. 126 (May 21, 2019) has implications for employers in determining appropriate employee workplace behavior. Further, the Board also, for the first time, granted Section 10(a)(2) certification to a union representing all employees in a 330-employee bargaining unit. Because the Board did not grant certification for a sub-unit, this decision is also the first time an employer is bound by the terms of a union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement without first affirmatively bargaining. This section provides a summary of the PCC Structurals opinion and the Board\u2019s first Section 10(a)(2) certification.\nI. Overview of Facts, Procedural History, and Interpretation of PCC Structurals\nIn 2018, the Board consolidated PCC Structurals, Inc., 366 NLRB No. 141 (Dec. 21, 2018) with the following three related cases: NLRB v. Beverly Metal Fabricators, 889 F.3d 371, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (representing 40 employees); NLRB v. NLRB, 886 F.3d 344, 349-351 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (representing 32 employees); and NLRB v. NLRB, 886 F.3d 352, 354-357 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (representing 33 employees). In these consolidated cases, the Board was presented with three employer-written policies: a customer identity ban policy; an apparel policy; and a social media policy that prohibited: (i) disclosing to non-employee third parties confidential information related to the employer\u2019s business, including client lists, information and documents, non-public financial and operational information, and strategic decisions, (ii) \u201cpublishing\u201d work-related blogs using the employer\u2019s domain or information systems without the employer\u2019s prior permission, and (iii) communicating through non-public Facebook groups about \u201cwork-related matters.\u201d\nIn the case subsumed in this decision and the other two consolidated cases (collectively, \u201cthe Beverly cases\u201d), the employees asserted that the customer identity ban policy was unfair labor practices under the NLRA, pursuant to Section 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(4) of the NLRA. The employees also argued that the apparel policy was an unfair labor practice under the NLRA. Finally, they asserted that the social media policy was an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, under Section 8(a)(1), and was incompatible with employee rights to organize pursuant to", "How Newspapers Can Use Social Media to Reach Their Community\nPurpose: Using social media can help newspapers to connect with members of the community and provide better service.  The purpose of this article is to explore how to connect effectively with social media sites, from the technical requirements, through the advantages, and the way that newspapers can help to maintain an ongoing dialogue with community members to ensure that they are getting what they expect from the paper.\nHow Newspapers Can Use Social Media to Reach Their Community\nTo do this, we looked at how some major newspapers are using social media as well as interviews with experts in the field. The news media should always attempt to use the most up-to-date and appropriate methods possible to reach the community and engage in a dialogue.\n\"The newspaper industry is in flux and newspapers are struggling in terms of having any real influence,\" said Professor of Political Science at UC Davis and expert on social media, Robert Huckman.\" Huckman said that one of the major factors is that newspapers haven't made it easy for people to consume their papers.\"\nWhat Huckman was pointing to is an area that has been at the focus for newspapers, and which we have already mentioned in a few previous articles; the importance of making material available in the format that best suits the particular device that the reader has available when they are trying to consume the content. For example, a user of a smartphone usually has far more limited access to the news that a user of a more traditional form factor device, such as a laptop or a desktop PC. Smartphones typically use a touch screen interface and have far less memory and less processing speed than a laptop or desktop PC. This means that, although almost every newspaper has a website that can receive material that can be read using a web browser, as a mobile phone browsing interface is very different to the browsing interface used on a laptop.\n\"For a long time, the media industry has been a technology industry, but for the last dozen years or so the media have been using social software to get more information, data, from their community. The media industry is really starting to change and use social media in a very powerful way. Social media offers the opportunity to start a two-way social connection with an audience to listen in in a way we could not do before to hear their feedback and opinions as opposed to just using technology to send information out to communities.\"\nAs Dr. Jillian York has pointed out, social media can be defined as a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideology of sharing in an effort to create an ongoing dialogue and engagement. These applications range from blogs to videos to user discussions, among others.\nSimply put, social media allows for an ongoing two-way conversation to occur. While much of that interaction occurs online, it also has implications offline as well. Social media has been a part of the online landscape for a number of years but has had the most impact over the last few. In 2005, MySpace.com had 1.2 million users worldwide. In 2007, it had 83.9 million users worldwide and had seen 600 million page views to date.\nWhat was true last year is that things move fast in the world of social media. While, in 2008, MySpace was still the king of this type of service with 101.4 million users, Facebook had 52 million users and was growing at 300 percent year over year. Now, MySpace has 132.5 million users while social networking sites in general have 810.6 million users, up 24 percent since last year. In addition, many other sites, such as Twitter, are also very popular.\nSocial media applications are very popular because of the way that they allow for more direct, interactive interaction. When people want to talk about something, they are used to the ability to share that discussion in a way that can spread virally. A good example is a recent poll of people on Facebook; there was a poll that asked users to indicate whether they thought that Obama should \"go easy on the banks\" for their role in the current economic crisis or whether he should \"be tougher on the banks.\" The question was a simple yes or no question with no additional information included. This was a highly controversial political issue and when it was brought up, the discussion quickly turned into a heated debate that was covered worldwide with each side being able to articulate their position in an ongoing discussion where information was shared.\nNewspaper websites have long included features in which people can comment on specific stories or columns. A recent example can be found on New York Times' website. On June 3,", "A \"Mother of All Charts\" depicting the changing landscape of pay TV\ndelivers to media companies the opportunity to better serve\ntheir audiences.\n\"For content owners, it's all about getting the right\nconsumer to the right screen at the right time in the right\nenvironment, and having a more compelling narrative about the\ncontent that's part of the package at any particular moment,\"\nPowers notes.  \"They need to think about the consumer experience,\nwhich means they need to know what consumer expectations are\nand whether those expectations will continue to be met or\nwill need to be adjusted accordingly.\"\nContent owners, Powers suggests, should not \"assume that\nwhat has always been comfortable for the consumer will continue\nto be comfortable.\"  The need to engage with multitaskers,\nwho are watching TV while talking with friends for example,\nhas altered the consumption experience.  Similarly, as\nconsumer expectations of interactive functionality -- such as\nDVR and on-demand -- are reaching a saturation point as\npart of the \"all-consuming\" bundle, TV programming is\ntransitioning from \"watch to participate,\" with consumer\nexpectations for interactivity at an all-time high.\nFor media companies, the value of having the right\ndata, the right analytics tools and the right resources to\nbuild a better consumer experience will result in: 1) a\nfaster turnaround on development of the product and, 2) the\nability to make decisions based on sound analysis, not just\npast experiences, according to Powers.\nAchieving this goal, according to Powers, will require:\n1) A good understanding of what consumers value today and\nwhere their consumption patterns are headed; 2) a solid\nunderstanding of the value that content owners expect to\nget from content investments; and 3) a commitment to\nlearning from the consumer experience. Powers explains that\n\"money begets money,\" and content investment should be\nguided by a company's overall goals rather than the current\nenvironment or other short-term concerns.\nAt the end of the day, Powers suggests a shift toward\nconsumer-centric solutions as \"where your ultimate\ncompetitive advantage is going to be\" is at the center of\nall consumer marketing and advertising initiatives -- and\nmedia companies need to stay true to their own businesses.\nAsks Powers: \"Do you love your business?  Does this\nbusiness make you happy?  Or do you love the consumer?  Do\nyou love your audience?  Do you love the people who watch the\nTV?  If it's not your audiences, if it's not your business,\nthen the content and the experiences that you develop for\nthem in terms of TV are going to be the wrong content.\"\n(NOTE:  This white paper is a result of the annual\nInternational Advertising & Media Summit held in Beverly\nHills from April 14th through April 16th, 2009.)\nThe State of Pay TV in the 2000s (2009-04-03)\nThe Next Big (Pay) TV Service?

They can join with a powerful marketing force like local businesses and work together, or they can be a mere repository of news that can be consumed anywhere. But most newspapers have not made that decision. The problem is the product, the fact that the newspaper as a whole lacks focus, and that it fails to engage the reader. There is no single solution to the problem, but a package of solutions exists that has already been successful in major markets.\nJOURNALIST: If newspapers are to regain some of their lost influence (in\ncommunity), then they may need to do some business with these businesses.\nHow the Times-\nHERON: Right, I think that\u2019s one point we\u2019re missing. That\u2019s the\nbiggest problem we have, that we\u2019re so separate from the rest of local\nbusiness community we don't get the resources the same way. It\u2019s a\nproblem.

That\nmay have been just the kind of thing a blogger would do, but they weren't doing it. Maybe it's just getting harder to tell the difference between a blogger and a journalist because, at the same time, many of the best bloggers are turning into journalists.\nThis new journalism, according to Rosen, is a journalism for everyone. The way that's different from, say, the 1930s journalism, perhaps when newspapers came into their own and had their greatest circulation numbers, is that newspapers then were mostly for subscribers. A subscription to the newspaper and a subscription to the news were separate things, whereas today it's pretty hard to separate the journalism from the rest of the Internet.\nJournalists still have a great responsibility to tell a factual story and to tell it in an accurate way.\n\"In the 1930s, the job of the journalist was to tell the truth as the subscriber saw it,\" Rosen explained.\nRosen was at the National Association of Hispanic Journalists summit in Pasadena, Calif. Rosen said that the\nInternet is allowing anyone to create news stories, and that's a good thing.\nSo, now the problem isn't just to see how new ideas and technology in news delivery can help\njournalists tell their stories better, but it is more to understand how technology and Internet can be used in new ways to better tell all the other kinds of stories journalists want to tell.\nThat's why journalists are now looking for ways to be more innovative, to be more experimental\nthan they maybe were in the past. And, more importantly, the goal is to use that to tell better stories.\n\"Journalist used to be the gatekeeper; now [journalists, in general] have made themselves part of\nthe audience,\" he said. \"But that shift of power is still just beginning.\"\nSo this raises lots of concerns. If it's hard to distinguish bloggers from journalists, how do you get people to trust you?\nThere's not a consensus among journalists how to answer that question. Some of them think that journalists have a professional responsibility to distinguish themselves from other people telling stories online.\n\"Thinking about who gets to tell stories, the old answer was: the newspaper, the TV station, the network,\"\nRosen said. \"How do you figure out who today should be able to tell other peoples' stories?\"\nIt used to be that journalists had to demonstrate that they were trusted by having established facts and sources. That's a good thing, but there is now increasing concern about what happens to the trust in journalism when no one can be sure what's real anymore.\n\"Who gets to be a journalist means who gets to be the news gatekeeper,\" he said. \"But the news\ngatekeeper no longer has the only access to the news. It used to be that the only person who had\naccess to a presidential news conference was the journalist, and the same news conference. But now the\npresident himself is giving the press conference to anybody who asks for the transcript.\"\nIt's a new world, and, as a result, we have to change how we do our journalism, and how we do the news, as well as being careful to maintain the standards of journalism.\n\"The rules for getting news may change, but the journalistic rules for getting the story are still the same,\" he explained.\nAnd that's where we have to come to a new understanding of just what is journalism. Is it only the news that journalists can get access to? How do we define their responsibility to tell a story, to get and tell that story, to determine what's news? Do they have more of that responsibility in the future because they may have more of a role in how people get news? What's a journalist anyway? If they're the only ones reporting from a warzone, what are they, then?\nRosen noted that he's gotten letters asking him whether a photographer was a journalist if", "This document includes proposed revisions and additions to the Privacy Shield Framework (\u201cFramework\u201d). The European Commission published a proposal on September 29, 2015, to introduce a new mechanism to facilitate transatlantic data transfers (the \u201cData Transfer Mechanism\u201d). On July 12, 2016, the European Commission announced its adoption of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which replaces the Safe Harbor Framework for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to organizations within the United States. The updated framework, known as the Privacy Shield Framework (the \u201cFramework\u201d), offers increased legal protection for EU individuals when their personal data is transferred to the U.S. by providing more guarantees to individuals whose personal data is processed by organizations in the United States.\nThe United States has agreed to strengthened limitations on U.S. government access to data transferred to the U.S., to provide safeguards for mass and indiscriminate surveillance, and to protect privacy rights and liability in respect of processing under the Framework. It includes new elements: a set of limitations and safeguards for processing of personal data subject to Privacy Shield, new commitments by companies participating in the process and other elements relating to the functioning of the Privacy Shield Framework. This document, which is an official policy guidance document, has been developed in a collaboration with the Council of the European Union and the Article 29 Working Party to assist organizations in complying with the Privacy Shield Framework. It also lays out the requirements that data controllers will need to fulfill in the absence of an adequacy decision with regard to the transfer of personal data to third countries.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce will update this document as necessary to facilitate the consistent implementation of the Framework. In its review and updates to this guidance document, the Department also may be assisted by the Article 29 Directive Working Party (\u201c Article 29 WP \u201d). A key consideration in developing its guidance on the Framework will be to provide adequate protection for the privacy of Europeans\u2019 personal data being transferred to corporate actors in the United States.\nAdaptive Clinical is working to achieve Privacy Shield certification.

Goss, former CIA Director -- and headlined \"POTENTIAL HIT ON OSAMA\" -- was obtained by former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette, who was part of the SEAL Team Six that killed Bin Laden last year.\nThe document contains a number of detailed proposals for locating and killing Bin Laden, drawing on intelligence obtained from a number of sources, the paper noted. One proposal details the possible uses of the C.I.A.'s proprietary aircraft company known as Air Compass Management Company of Pinal Air Park, Arizona, to assist in such an operation.\nIn an earlier article in the Times on 25 April 2012, Bissonnette -- under the pseudonym Mark Owen -- outlines his participation in the raid, but does not provide a copy of the documents.\nThe Times says it has not received comment from the CIA on the document and is not publishing the entire document. \"We reviewed the proposal for more than 10 days,\" a spokesman for the Gray Lady said, \"because the document is extremely sensitive. Among other things it sets out a list of potential targets for the Bin Laden operation, and provides the location in Pakistan of a specific individual believed to be close to the terrorist leader.\n\"We also reviewed the documents closely and made a judgment about redactions,\" the spokesman said.\nThe Times quoted Bissonnette's book, \"No Easy Day,\" as saying \"there was some uncertainty over who was going to have final say on whether America should take the target off-board and kill him, or at least, get the ball rolling before allowing him to disappear into whatever safe house the C.I.A. maintained for him.\"\n\"Most of the SEALs who were interviewed for No Easy Day supported the mission,\" the paper said.\nOn the other hand, the Times article states that while Bissonnette made \"a lot of money\" from the book, \"he felt very guilty that he had contributed to a widespread misunderstanding of the mission.\"\n\"Too many people are looking at this as a movie\" -- that \"it was a straight-on raid against a guy in a cave.\"\nThe paper said Bissonnette wrote that when he was asked by officers at the SEALs' unit in Virginia Beach, Virginia, if he wanted to be involved in the mission, after which, \"the people you would trust your life with.\"\n\"You only had to say yes,\" he said, the paper reports. \"People who didn't go were never asked again.\"\nIn the book, Bissonnette recounted that the unit was notified in the late afternoon on the Saturday before the Sunday operation, about 10 or 11 p.m. that night.\n\"On the flight to Afghanistan, everyone knew that the team would be called on to conduct a 'direct action' operation against bin Laden. They didn't know that bin Laden was the target,\" Mr. Owen's spokesman John Rizzo told the Times.\nThe paper said that during training, teams were expected to \"go to the mat\" against a common adversary.\nBissonnette, a native of Florida now living in Arizona, said that he and some others \"bickered among ourselves about the mission's feasibility and the level of certainty with", "The proposed rule for exemptions to section 407(b) (5) and 408(g) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 is inappropriate.

What advertisers can\nonly guess at is the extent to which people are targeted by marketers without their\nknowledge. Our research confirms that people are being targeted, and finds that the\nInternet is the primary source of this data for advertisers and publishers.\nWith Internet activity being tracked, advertisers can now know their target\naudience. As we show, advertiser data is combined with cookie databases and\nsold or exchanged between publishers and ad networks.

They are attracting both advertisers and audiences, not only locally, but nationwide as well.\nAnd the business model underlying a paper\u2019s success should be to ensure that the content is compelling, even as it is delivered in multiple ways.\nWe recently reached out to our readers, asking them not only to weigh in on print versus digital platforms but also which sources they prefer. We also asked readers to comment on why they prefer one over the other.\nThe responses show that consumers are more than willing to invest in a well-delivered print newspaper for their news and information.\nNearly 20 of the responses we received \u2013 all from loyal print subscribers \u2013 described reasons they prefer print editions. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\u2022\u201cWe like to read in paper format at home. My husband also likes to read in print format from his reading chair while I like to read in my lounge chair,\u201d reported one.\n\u2022\u201cI prefer to read in print. It is easier and more comfortable. Also, you cannot be distracted (no cellphones, or computers) by electronic gadgets, especially if it is a good book. It is more relaxing to read.\u201d\n\u2022\u201cI actually don\u2019t have a home computer, so a subscription to the print version is the only way I can receive the paper. If one day technology doesn\u2019t allow the print version to happen I think it is an important resource to have.\u201d\n\u2022\u201cI prefer print and I always have. I don\u2019t mind having a newspaper website for my local paper. There are certain stories where you want the full coverage. The more I read online, the less I want to read in print.\u201d\n\u2022\u201cI prefer print because I am not a computer person at all. I also like to hold a paper in my hand and have a good read. Also, I do my best reading in the tub,\u201d reported one reader.\nWith many newspapers having an international or global footprint, readers also told us that they still prefer to read the content in print, even if they can also access it online.\n\u201cPrint versions are available in bookstores around the world. You can pick them up and enjoy them, as you wish,\u201d said one reader.\nIf you live in an area where there is not a single paper available to you, or multiple editions require a subscription to all of them individually, then online is the way to go.\n\u201cWhen not home, a printed newspaper is not available, so no choice,\u201d was how one reader put it.\nOthers told us that the print edition is the only one available to them, which may be due to location or budget constraints or both:\n\u201cIn the remote rural area where we live, the most common method of delivering news and advertisements to our communities are from the print and email. We do have cell service and access to wifi, which means we have the option to receive online news. Most people don\u2019t have time to read a computer screen and the cost of receiving newspapers and mail is prohibitive. Print is the most practical, inexpensive, and most popular form of delivery we have.\u201d\nMany newspapers still rely on print, with some being hybrid products offering subscriber or digital edition content online as an add-on.\nIn its latest reorganization plans, the New York Times says it will focus on growing digital subscriptions, but the print product is not going anywhere: \u201cThirty percent to 40 percent of total news spending will go toward growing paid digital and mobile subscriptions, while the majority of the remaining costs will be allocated to traditional print and publishing operations.\u201d\nA reader told us that this is a sound business model:\n\u201cNewspapers have a business model that is dependent on print revenue. I prefer newspapers to be in print, instead of digital only as in some countries.\n\u201cPrint readers are more serious readers and digital only is less committed readers.\u201d\nBut some readers are not interested in a print product at all. One reader we spoke with told us: \u201cI do not subscribe to the print version because this information is available in the local library for a modest cost of $30 a year \u2013 and that includes all the major newspapers in every metropolitan area around the world, which means that the print versions are not unique!\u201d\nFor another reader, the print version was a bonus, not a requirement: \u201cI prefer to read the print version. I live in", "A 10-year study of Swedish newspapers concludes that online advertising revenue is now catching up with print; and a study of social media engagement by local news publishers finds the most successful publishers are the aggressive ones.\n2010 was a banner year for newspapers, the year that they began to turn around the long downward spiral. In 2010, newspapers\u2019 advertising revenue declined at its slowest rate since 2002, according to a Pew Research Center analysis released last week, adding that \u201cnewspaper advertising revenue still fell 11% in 2010, but the rate slowed considerably from a drop of 30% from 2008 to 2009.\u201d\nAfter reading about these latest revenue improvements, it looks like an \u201cA.\u201d\nBut you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. The study is based on Pew\u2019s report, \u201cNewspaper Industry Trends,\u201d published in July 2010, and a subsequent analysis paper from Mark Potts and Andrew Lih at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. In both publications, the overall rate of decline in the newspaper industry is slowing considerably.\nBut as is often the case with statistics, the data can be misleading. According to the report, the average annual rate of newspaper circulation increase from 2009 to 2010 was 1.5%. Despite the fact that the average annual rate of paper circulation increase was less than a quarter-of-one-percent, it helped contribute to the dramatic slowing of decline overall.\nMeanwhile, overall newspaper revenue declined at a rate of 8.1%. But if we are to believe the data presented in the study, newspaper print advertising revenue is now back to 2008 levels.\nIn 2009 as a whole, newspaper overall print advertising revenue declined by $9.1 billion, a 12.4% drop. In contrast, overall newspaper print advertising revenue declined by $3.5 billion, or a mere 2.8%, in 2010, according to the study.\nIn 2009, for every 100 newspapers, there were 566.6 full-time employees. But 2010 saw a sharp improvement, and in 2010, there were 553.1 full-time newspapers per 100 newspapers, representing a reduction of 23.2 full-time employees per 100 newspapers.\nOnline Advertising Revenue Close With Print\nPublishers in a Newspaper Association of America (NAA)/News-IQ study released Dec. 6 reported 11% of their total 2011 advertising revenues would come from digital advertising.\nIn the newspaper survey, 61% of publishers said they expected digital advertising revenues to be between 8% and 12% of total revenues, while one-fifth predicted their digital ad revenue share would be greater than 12%. NAA predicted that in 2014, newspapers\u2019 digital advertising revenues will almost match print (including TV and classifieds); digital advertising revenues are expected to reach 43% of total advertising revenues.\nSocial Media Enables Local Engagement and Success\nLocal news publishers are moving ahead with their social media initiatives by investing in social media-enabled content, and many are reporting a high rate of success, a new Newsweek/Dow Jones study released Dec. 5 concludes.\nThe Newsweek/Dow Jones study, \u201cSocialize Your Local News,\u201d found the most successful local publishers were the most engaged of all local publishers with the social media. News-IQ News Publisher Survey respondents who said they had a clear social media strategy, for instance, were 44% more likely to generate more engagement than those who said they did not.\nThose who said they had a social media strategy with a specific emphasis on social networking also outperformed peers by 42%. And news publishers who said they had a clear goal for their social presence \u2013\u2013 such as to generate more revenue \u2013\u2013 were 32% more likely to report success than those who said they did not.\nThe report found, in short, that the publishers who are the most effective with social media have defined goals and specific outcomes, are the most proactive in their engagement, and are more likely to be aggressive with their overall digital efforts.\nAs with", "The United States Commission on Civil Rights held a public\nhearing to receive testimony relating to civil rights violations and the use\nof force by law enforcement.

Unions thus play a key role for the finance\nneeds of private businesses. The effects of unions on the profitability of businesses are indirect\n(due to taxation) as well as direct (interference with management control), and they operate\nthroughout all businesses throughout an economy (not just those directly affected). While\nthe influence of unions on the productivity of businesses and, thus, in tax revenues, is\nwell documented, there seems to be less evidence on the link between unions and financial\ndevelopment. However, the indirect effects of unions on the need for and supply of finance\ncannot be ruled out. There have been important direct effects on demand for finance, through\nthe fiscal and tax framework, through higher interest rates in public debt, and through the\ntaxation of bank profits. Finally, indirect effects cannot be ruled out, mainly on the need for\nfinance, as unions tend to hinder the financing of businesses.\nFor further reading, see:\nRaymond J.G.

The FCC's proposal would take effect January 1, 2011.\n Section 870 of the 1996 Act requires the FCC to adopt a \"National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) 2.5\n\"The FCC first adopted an NNPPP in 1992, and amended the NNPPP in 1999. The FCC published its revised NNPPP for public\ncomment in 2005 and 2007. In 2008, the FCC updated its rules regarding international inbound toll free call completion,\nand announced its adoption of the ITU's ITU-T Numbering Plan. In August 2009, the FCC made further changes by shifting\nfrom a ten number block framework (in which there are ten blocks of ten thousand numbers starting at 800) to one in\nwhich the blocks are of varying lengths, ranging from ten to one hundred thousand numbers. Additionally, the NNPPP\nis limited to numbers in the range of 218-500 in the blocks, as well as 888, 877, and 866.\nThe FCC proposes to adopt certain modifications to accommodate certain changes to the NNPPP which resulted from\nthe adoption of the ITU's ITU-T Numbering Plan. These modifications are necessary to ensure that the telecommunications\nindustry is able to make all necessary arrangements in time to be able to prepare for the implementation of the NNPPP\non January 1, 2011. The adopted modifications include: 1) modification of the ten-number block framework and of the\nlength limits for new blocks from ten thousand numbers to ten thousand in some cases and one hundred thousand\nnumbers; 2) a new rule, which is to be incorporated into the definition of \"Number Plans\" to make clear that the\nfew numbers in range 218-225 reserved for special services and defined-length ranges by the ITU must be\ntransferred from the NNP or existing ITU ranges into the NNP or into the new ranges; 3) modification of certain ITU-\nT Number Plans from the six-number plan to the seven-number plan, in order to maintain comparability with\napproved US numbering plan; 4) the modification of certain ITU-T Number Plans, while retaining the ITU's\nsix-number plan, to establish comparability with the US NNP, in order to eliminate inconsistency in the manner\nin which the industry uses the ITU Plans under each plan's provisions, a result of the US NNP's rules that\ntreat ITU-T Plans as if they were a distinct part of the US NNP; and 5) amendment of the definition of \"PSTN\" to\naccommodate ITU-T Number Plans not included in the NNP in the definition of equipment used on the PSTN.

It was the first day of school. There was a new girl in Lulu's class. Lulu felt like something was wrong as she arrived at school, but soon realized there was only one thing wrong. The new girl liked Snake. A lot.\nI didn't want to get up and it was hard not to but there was no choice. The sun streamed in between my blinds and made me squint. There was no need for it to do that, there was never any reason for it. It was a hot day and I didn't want to get up on it. I didn't want to get up today at all. Not to shower, not for breakfast, not to get ready for school, and certainly not to walk the fifty extra minutes down the street to get to my school's front door. I did not want up. But I didn't have a choice. I had to.\nIt took me a minute, but I finally managed to stand with my heavy eyes and heavy limbs at my doorway of woe, opening it and peering inside the pitch-black hallway with my bad eyes with a deep sigh. Then, I turned to face into the wall.\nMy dad would be making me eggs and waffles, and probably fried toast if he had the time, and I was going to scowl at the eggs and waffles and fried toast and drink a sliding amount of orange juice and coffee and maybe finish it off with some grapefruit as a snack before school started, and then head out the front door with my backpack and my hair in my face and my shoes on already and head into the bus. I hate the bus. It's always crowded and slow and loud and noisy.\nBut that day was different. I didn't want to board the bus at all. In fact, I didn't want to go to school at all.\nMy backpack bounced against my skin as I left the house and stepped onto the staircase which led up to the bus stop. I took one last look at the yard. I knew I wouldn't be looking at it for a while.\nSoon, I knew I would be seeing the school's grey walls and brown floors. If I was lucky, I might just catch a glimpse of the new girl in my class. She looked like a girl that could be fun. I hoped she liked me. I really did, too. I don't know what it was, but I just had a feeling about her. I didn't want to like her. It would be really awkward to have class with two girls that liked Snake. I didn't want to like her.\nMy hand clutched at my hair.\nYou know, why bother? As if it wasn't going to be awkward to have class with two girls and Snake, it also wasn't going to be fun to be in school when Lulu wasn't there, either. The new girl was taking Lulu's spot. Everyone knows what happens next, right? The new girl starts to do everything just slightly better than Lulu did. She'd have new friends, too, because everyone would want to be her friends. Snake would start liking her and Lulu wouldn't.\nWhy bother, Lulu? It's not like you could make things better. She'd be there soon, anyway. It would be her time next. That was just the way the world was. You can't stop it. She'll be there when she's supposed to be there, and Lulu will be out when she's supposed to be out. The new girl will have Lulu's spot for now, but not for good.\nThe bus came and I got on it. My mood immediately lifted when I saw the rest of our regulars, but instantly went down again when I realized I was surrounded by the new girl's new friends. \"Lulu, hi,\" they greeted me in twos and threes as we boarded, their heads bowed and their eyes lowered.\n\"Hello,\" I mumbled back.\nI glanced at them and then, I looked forward. I refused to look behind me. I didn't want to see my own shadow.\nThey all boarded and we were off. And soon, I knew, they'd all start talking about Lulu again. It was going to happen. If I turned around, they'd say something to me.\nI knew what they'd be saying, too.\n\"I don't know why Lulu isn't here. I don't know who she really is. I don't know why she's always", "Newspapers can build audience by integrating multiple digital publishing efforts.\nNewspapers have a number of digital publishing efforts underway, but I fear that we are not taking advantage of the full potential of those efforts.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that newspapers have to accept less interest when it comes to their online content.\nA key to building audience is creating integrated digital publishing efforts, with a cohesive theme linking all of our digital efforts. Let me offer several ideas that may help you build your own online communities.\nMarch Madness in Mobile\nTribune Media Services worked with AT&T to create a March Madness mobile site and game to capitalise on this season\u2019s basketball tournament. The mobile site provided comprehensive information on the NCAA bracket, standings and the tournament\u2019s leading scorers.\nTribune\u2019s mobile version of the New York Sun featured the first-ever \"Mad Clips\" mobile video contest. Viewers uploaded short video clips to the site, and the winning entry was turned into a video game.\nThe mobile site included a Mad Clip-a-Day game, which offered prizes to the reader who accumulated the most points after making predictions and answering general basketball trivia.\nTribune Media Services and AT&T both made a tremendous effort to promote March Madness, the mobile site and the prizes, making sure that all New York Sun Mobile and March Madness Mobile Web site users were aware of the promotions.\nWhen you give your audience a reason to return to your mobile site, you\u2019ll find audiences do check in to get exclusive content. One important lesson to be learned here is that a mobile site can feature content that isn\u2019t easily accessed on a desktop site.\nBroadcast.com also features exclusive content on its mobile pages.\nIt\u2019s not hard for newspapers to make a mobile site. The key is to make sure the content is unique. In other words, it needs to be something that cannot be found on your main site.\nMobile-specific advertising is another way to create a new revenue stream, as well as attracting new readers to your mobile site.\nHere at the Chicago Sun-Times, we run a daily mobile horoscope on our mobile site, and this has become a highly successful section that can be monetized with mobile-specific advertising. This is a section that doesn\u2019t exist on our main site.\nBroadcast.com had a mobile site featuring special offers for advertisers who could take full advantage of using their mobile offerings. The New York Sun mobile site had a special coupon feature linked to a local business, where users can register for free coupons and offers via SMS.\nIn a world that is increasingly mobile, companies are becoming more and more aware that this is the medium to market to their audiences. Newspapers have to do what our competition is already doing.\nGetting Your Mobile Media Package Together\nThe mobile media package is an important part of any mobile strategy, and it is something that will keep you coming back each day. It could range from a daily horoscope mobile site on our mobile offering, to mobile-specific advertisers and products.\nBroadcast.com is focusing on its mobile media package, featuring a daily entertainment news headline. The New York Sun is doing daily horoscope messages, as mentioned earlier, a great concept, especially with its mobile subscribers.\nBroadcast.com mobile site offers an impressive array of content, while the New York Sun offers a unique horoscope offering on mobile.\nThere are quite a few options available for newspapers to explore if they want to incorporate mobile media packages into their efforts. These are just a few examples of some great ideas out there.\nBroadcast.com is also adding special daily horoscope messages to their site, a great concept, especially with their mobile subscribers. If you\u2019re looking for ideas for your mobile horoscope site, just take a look at other mobile horoscope sites out there.\nA key is for your content to be special to the mobile user. By making things mobile, you are taking advantage of a market that just can\u2019t be ignored anymore.\nBy offering up content on mobile devices, you take advantage of the increasing numbers of mobile-device users. And you build loyalty amongst mobile readers.\nNewspapers should", "MEGAN\u2019S LAW", "PARAGON\n\nTHE STORY\n\nOF\n\nMARSH, LORD OF ILLUSION,\n\nAND\n\nRAPPORT, LADY OF WORDS,\n\nIN EARLY VERMONTLAND, YEAR THE NINTH AFTER HIS CHAOTIC HIGH MAJESTY.\n\nWITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY THOMAS PHILBRICK\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLONDON,\n\nMACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED.\n\nNEW YORK,\n\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY.\n\n1907.\n\n[_This Edition is Printed in Great Britain at the Machinery Company Limited, Edinburgh and London._]\n\nTo ELIZABETH PHILBRICK WISHART\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\n\nEloquence is a thing that has its own laws. In the old days, like most other useful arts, it was studied by the use of fanciful examples; and to show the way in which a certain subject ought to be handled we must use certain cases, and such as are of a very select and peculiar nature. It is necessary, before any discourse is delivered by those whom a people esteem as masters of rhetoric, that the listeners should know those selected cases very well. No one is competently fitted for the task of a law-giver or a judge who has not already a stock of cases in his mind. The orator himself must know these cases very well. We see in those works on rhetoric collected by the Roman rhetoricians, that there were whole books in which nothing else was recorded than rare and singular cases; and the first books composed on this subject in our own time are the collections of English rhetors, of which the most celebrated are _Conrad's Dialogues with Oratores_, and Dr. Charterhouse's _Treasure of Eloquence_.\n\nNow in the present days, the study and practice of eloquence has almost departed from the use of selected cases; and it has got almost into the practice to deal in all speeches with the general. And when we compare this modern fashion with the old, we may in truth, as Thucydides saith, in the beginning of his _Peloponnesus War_, be seen to be speaking even now unto men who, forsooth, will be to us as if we were speaking to children. Nevertheless, in these modern times, I have undertaken to speak in the manner of the old speakers, both to men and to women. For with the greatest good fortune will I write no more, I trust, after any other manner.\n\nIn the time of the Romans there was a great city,--as the great cities of the Italian republics now are. And in that city lived certain citizens; to wit, the young women; and in that ancient city the young women were wonted to be very beautiful. It was the custom with the men of that city in certain seasons, to go and view by day and by night the beauties of the young women. In their walks in the public places of the city, and also in the streets and public places in the country, the beauties of the young women were wonted to be seen. As they walked on the streets, the beauty of each young woman was as clearly discernible in the minds of the men as as though seen in person. And if one young woman was better than another, it was a like discernible and manifest. It was in the winter months and in the summer months,--in both the women wore clothes of such quality that they shone in the light. And the young women also had their faces shining with a natural splendour; for, in the customs of that city, nothing was more common for the young wives and damsels than to take care that their faces should be shining with a natural brightness. These young wives and damsels had a great commerce with their fathers and mothers; and also with their brothers and sisters; and also with their friends. So it had been the custom with them--with both young men and young women--to resort to that beautiful city with a great company, so that they might be seen, and that others might see them, and that others might be reminded thereof. The young men of that city had also another way of seeing young women. The great nobles were wont to give entertainments in their houses in the city; and also in the country, in their villas. And all the young women of that city were accustomed to put on their best clothes, and to wear rings with jewels in them", "The OECD Working Party on Public Governance met in Paris from 21 to 23 March 2018. The three sessions, with a combined of nearly 40 countries, focused on \u2018Public Governance at Cities\u2019, \u2018Open Innovation for Public Sector Clients\u2019 and \u2018Partnerships for Public Governance\u2019. A side event was also held on \u2018Blockchain for Public Governance\u2019.\nThe next OECD Working Party on Public Governance meeting will be held in Vienna, Austria, from 13 to 15 November 2018.\nOECD\u2019s Public Governance work is a broad effort to address governance issues, including in digital governance, in the public sector. The work spans the governance of government organisations and delivery of public services, including the digital public sector; governance in the open government area; and the governance that supports good governance at a country and regional level including in the South. This briefing summarises the OECD\u2019s recent work on these topics under Public Governance, drawing on the work of its Infrastructure and Public Governance Networks.\nOECD\u2019s work on public governance has three foci:\nDigital public governance \u2013 The OECD\u2019s Digital Economy and Society Outlook 2018, OECD (2018), describes how the digital economy is playing a catalyst role in reshaping the way in which governments engage with citizens and businesses. Its Public Governance Committee (PGC) is building on its work on the digital public sector for example at its 2016 meeting on The Digital Public Sector: New Skills and Innovative Methods for Better Governance. A further PGC meeting will be held in December 2018 on Digital Government Futures: Skills for Growth. The 2018 DIGITAL GOVERNMENT STRATEGIES BUDGET AND CITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTS: OECD COST COUNTRIES INITIATIVE, OECD (2018) summarises the work presented at that meeting and outlines the main policy challenges ahead and a methodological approach developed by the PGC. The OECD\u2019s Digital Government Strategies Budget and Citizens\u2019 Rights (DGS) Country Initiative is under development to assist countries on this journey.\nOpen government \u2013 OECD\u2019s Open Government National Action Plans work is ongoing. The first round of Reviews of OECD National Action Plans to Open Government was held in 2015 and the second round of reviews in 2016. A further round of reviews is planned for 2018. OECD\u2019s OGP IN ACTION 2018, OECD (2018) shares outcomes from these reviews. The OECD\u2019s Open Innovation for Public Sector Clients project is described further below. Key results from the OECD\u2019s 7th Global e-Readiness Indicators 2018, OECD (2018), included that only 12% of governments report that their procurement policies incentivise open government, only 12% regularly publish data on citizen engagement in policy prioritisation, and just 13% of citizens participate in policy prioritisation.\nGood governance \u2013 See further the Workshop on Good Practices for Public Consultation, OECD (2018). The Working Party on Public Governance held its regular Meeting on the Future of Public Governance from 9 November to 2 December 2017 when key issues identified were the need to increase the skills and capabilities of the public sector at all levels, support for a culture of co-creation between government and citizens, recognising and sharing best practices, co-creation and openness as key principles for digital government, the use of evidence to evaluate progress in public governance and the role of the private sector in supporting this work.\nThe 2018 OECD Reviews of National Policies for Education: OECD COUNTRIES, OECD (2018) highlighted the fact that citizens engage actively in education policy in many OECD countries.\nOECD\u2019s Public Governance Committee Meetings: A list of the OECD Working Party on Public Governance Meetings from 1991 is on the Publications page.\nIn 2018, the focus of the regular meetings of the OECD Working Party on Public Governance\u2019s committees has been on openness, co-cre", "The FCC is seeking comment in order to determine (1) the amount and character of the data that should be collected in order to determine whether cable operators are able to provide programming to minorities and women which represent their respective populations; and (2) how such data can be used to reduce program access disparities. The FCC's goal is to develop rules that establish an orderly process for determining and achieving compliance with the program carriage rules. Comments will be due 30 days from publication of this NOI in the Federal Register.\n SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Through this Notice of Inquiry (NOI) the FCC is soliciting comments on what data is needed to enable it to (1) determine the extent to which minorities and women are effectively programming their own programming tastes via cable operators; (2) develop and implement reasonable remedies that are consistent with statutory requirements and reflect a consensus view regarding the appropriate role for the FCC in addressing disparities; (3) provide clear guidance to the cable industry, consumers, and other stakeholders on the FCC's expectations; and (4) promote further diversification of the cable industry.\n1. The FCC needs data to determine the extent to which minorities and women are programming their own programming tastes through the cable industry.\nIt is the position of the FCC that cable operators must offer programming that represents the viewing habits of, and reflects the diverse interests of, the communities they serve. Programming that reflects the diverse social, cultural, geographic, gender, racial, and other interests of the population it serves is essential to serving the public interest. For example, without information about demographic characteristics, the FCC would not be able to determine whether cable operators are complying with the program carriage rules. The only publicly available data concerning the demographic characteristics of the cable viewing audience is the Nielsen Audience Profile (Nielsen). The FCC recently reaffirmed that it is interested in analyzing Nielsen data for program access purposes. See Comment, The 34th, 4th, and 6th Rules of the Commission, 13 FCC Rcd 3463, 3496-97, para. 10 (2008). The FCC is currently in the process of reviewing the Nielsen Audience Profile data for the first quarter (Q1) of 2006 in order to determine the extent to which cable operators were offering the most popular, locally-rated minority and women-oriented networks in each market. See Nielsen Audience Profile, Q1 2006, Public Notice, 22 FCC Rcd 20305, 20312 n. 3 (2007). Without the demographic information contained in the Nielsen data, the FCC is uncertain as to the extent to which program carriage of minority and women-oriented networks and programs by both mainstream and niche cable programming distributors remains an issue. Moreover, the FCC has concerns as to whether cable operators continue to offer women and minority-oriented programming which reflects the actual viewing habits of women and minorities. In light of these concerns, the FCC seeks further input from industry members, programmers, and others regarding the current demographic data on cable viewing audiences. The FCC is particularly interested in collecting more information about the minorities and women who regularly watch various network tiers.\nThe FCC notes that the Nielsen data that is currently available does not indicate where local subscribers fall within the various minority and female demographic groups. Specifically, the Nielsen Audience Profile 1 (NAP1) data describes the viewing habits of local African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic households that subscribe to the Cable Television Network Reporting and Research (Nielsen) panel and that represent the top 26 urban television markets within the United States. See Nielsen Audience Profile (Nielsen) 1, Public Notice, 21 FCC Rcd 22117, 22131 paras. 20, 22, 26-27 (1996). Further, the NAP1 data includes statistics for household viewers in the top 90 Cable TV Network markets (approximately 75% of the entire cable universe) within the United States. Id. This data is extremely helpful in gauging cable access to African-American households nationwide and in many cases, for the entire country. Id. Nielsen also collects dem", "A long-held theory in the advertising business was dispensed with once and for all, putting ads back where we belong: in front of human eyes.\nWhile I am a firm believer in the value of creativity in the media realm, I also think it is important to take a step back from the hype and celebrate what is undeniably an achievement: a completely new, never-done-before product and service concept. This was done by Google and its team for AdSense, which is arguably one of the most ingenious inventions of our day and age.\nA year-and-a-half ago, when I started at my company, I would never have imagined that I'd end up a year and a half later reporting back to my boss on the benefits of Google AdSense and why it is the most exciting development in the print media world since the creation of the printing press itself. As the media business continues to make bold new moves, this event once again emphasizes how innovative thinking can lead to successful business development.\nWhen I first heard that we would be launching this program at our newspaper, I was curious, to say the least. The whole concept was completely new to media executives and businesspeople as well. It took us some time to wrap our heads around it, but now we are glad to see that it is one of the most popular features on our news site.\nWhen the team came to meet with us to kick off this program, they presented a new way of doing things. Most advertisers were familiar with our standard banner ad and had a general idea of how that worked. AdSense is a new kind of concept; once we understood it, we instantly knew it was the way to go forward.\nIn the past, any time we put together a promotional idea for a brand-new campaign or product or service, we always thought about it in terms of print. And we knew that we always had an inventory of products in this format that we could use as leverage. So we had to plan, work, and do everything in print. But with AdSense, this type of planning had to change. Now we know that we need to be thinking differently.\nIt is a challenge for us when we have to come up with new innovations to keep our customers and business happy while considering all of the different angles of the market. And we had to be a step ahead to think of this new concept. It took a few weeks to figure it out, but it took less than one week for the idea to come to fruition.\nI believe that AdSense is going to lead to bigger things for us. It has already become more popular with our advertisers, who are now able to take advantage of the fact that this is no longer an online-only product, but a great tool with good potential to be more successful on our sites.\nWe would never have been able to achieve the same results in sales and reach by continuing simply with our standard, offline print advertising. It would have taken us so much more time and effort and money to generate those same results. It would have been too difficult and too time- consuming, so we would have continued with online solutions for online advertisers if we wanted to do it in the past. But with AdSense we are now able to have the best of both worlds.\nThis product is the future of advertising. It isn't just about online banner ads; it is about putting the best of your online and traditional marketing methods together to reach a bigger audience through both channels.\nIt is hard to make bold statements when it comes to the future of your company, but this is one that I am willing to make based upon seeing what is happening in our marketplace. We have always had to be open to changing the way we work in this business, and AdSense allows us to do just that. And it is exciting that companies will be able to benefit from the reach of their online and offline ads. It should also change how we sell our products to brands: we'll be able to provide the same benefit and experience they've gotten from traditional advertising in online.\nThe Google team is excited, because they've got something new to sell and something new to do. They seem to get excited each time the business offers them the chance to reinvent themselves\u2014and that is a good place to be.", "A few questions need to be asked about the role and\nintent of the RIAA. RIAA is not an organization set up merely to\nprotect copyright holders.  I suspect their intent is to\nprotect them from competition as they know the Internet allows\nconsumers a way to find music that they can't afford to buy at\nretail.  And I fear that they want to keep people from finding\nmusic they don't make or can't sell for whatever reason.\nI'm not saying I know for a fact that's what the RIAA is doing, but\nI suspect that's the basis for their position.  It could of course\nbe for both, in which case their motives are suspect.  Any RIAA\nmember that can provide information to show that the RIAA's\nprimary intent is anything other than their own self-interest in\nthe copyright market, and to prevent Internet music downloads which\nthe RIAA doesn't make or can't sell, I am all ears!\n[http://www.rda.org/aboutrda.asp] is the link to their website and this is their\nThe Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA) is a trade\nassociation which represents the U.S. record music industry.  More than\n230 domestic record companies are members of the RIAA, including the\nBig Five record labels, the six major U.S.-based foreign labels, and\nmore than 150 independent record labels.  The RIAA also represents a\ngrowing number of non-record music industry companies, from small firms\nthat promote independent labels, to manufacturers and distributors of\naudio products such as CD players, to services such as cable systems,\nradio stations, and the electronic toll calls of the U.S. Interstate\nHighway traffic management system.  Although the RIAA primarily focuses on\nthe U.S. market, most RIAA members also do business throughout the\nworld, with the majority of those businesses outside the U.S.\n[http://www.riaa.com/About_Recording_Industry_Association_of_America.asp]\n<http://www.riaa.com/About_Recording_Industry_Association_of_America.asp>\n[RIAA] is not an organization set up merely to protect copyright\nholders.  I suspect their intent is to protect them from\ncompetition as they know the Internet allows consumers a way to\nfind music that they can't afford to buy at retail.  And I\nfear that they want to keep people from finding music they don't\nmake or can't sell for whatever reason.\nOf course you are correct. I have never suggested to anyone that the\nonly goal of the RIAA is to protect copyright owners. I would\nguess that their role in the RIAA is in large part marketing driven.\nMarketing has to be the primary reason for the big labels to be in the\nbusiness they are in.  And the RIAA gets involved at a very high level\nbecause it has such an impact on the businesses of the big labels.  It\nis also the case that the big record labels work best together and are\nable to do so because of the RIAA itself.  They share a belief about\nwhat is best for themselves and they work together to make that\npossible.  There are other roles that the RIAA can fill as well.\nIt is possible for the record labels to use the RIAA to exert\nlegitimate political influence by using it as an advocate to lobby\nfor better copyright law, tax law, trade law, and so on. In fact,\nit is essential for it to be viewed as an advocate because the labels\nlack the financial ability to directly engage in these fights and so\nneed and use the political capital created by the RIAA.  The RIAA\nalso plays a major role in informing the public about the business\nand so it is part of marketing the record labels' products.  Lastly,\nthe RIAA is a conduit through which the labels receive intelligence\nthat is necessary for business.\nI have never suggested that the RIAA was solely in the business\nof protecting labels.  There have been many very profitable\ncompanies like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Circuit City (among others)\nthat have suffered because of the RIAA and have fought back.\nI believe the RIAA is not driven by protecting labels, but is", "Wine sales at Costco are often undervalued because employees have limited training on the selection and storage of wines. To overcome this challenge, Costco began training Wine Directors on how to select and store wines, with emphasis on the four Cs: color, clarity, corks, and cost.

A list regarding this order follows the narrative summary below.\nAUTHORIZATION RENEWAL GRANTED TO RADIO SYSTEMS - The Commission grants a request for consent to the assignment of certain assets involved in the Commission\u2019s broadcast licensing program from Radio Spectrum License Co. Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radio Systems Corporation, to Cincinnati Broadcasting Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radio Systems, in order that Radio Systems may pursue more aggressive acquisition strategies. In connection with its application to acquire certain assets including Broadcast Radio Communications, Inc., Radio Systems asked the Commission to assign the station involved in the licensing program, station WLMP in Huntington, West Virginia, to Cincincatti Broadcasting, which will be the licensee for the Radio Spectrum license in question, in order to simplify the management of radio stations of common ownership. This assignment will permit Radio Systems to operate both the licensing program at a national level and the station at the local level. The Commission has approved this transfer of the construction permit (which has been transferred by request of the applicant to Cincinnati Broadcasting) from Broadcast Radio Communications to Cincinnati Broadcasting, and the Commission will therefore grant the application for consent to assignment for WLMP. The Commission also assigns channel 43 at Bridgeport, Alabama, to Radio Systems, and approves a one-time extension in the expiration date of the construction permit previously issued for Station on Channel 36 or Channel 63 in the Bridgeport, Alabama, television market, in order to permit the operation of the station under the new assignment.

Prisoners are unique recipients of health care\nservices because they must be confined under legal authority; the\nmanagement of health issues must, therefore, be part of the total\nmanagement of the institution. The provision of medical care to\nprisoners requires correctional officials to devise means for dealing with\nthe medical problems of the inmate population in a way that recognizes\nthe importance of a medical diagnosis and the need for medical treatment,\nwhile at the same time managing the institutional operations, including\nsecurity. The following excerpt from a report to the Legislative and\nNorris-Laguar Treatment Centers describes a typical medical problem:\n\"The report describes a 69-year-old man who was\narrested and charged with forcible rape and kidnapping.\nWhen apprehended, he had severe asthma and took\nan inhaler 12 times per day. There was no apparent\nmedical justification for incarcerating the patient\nbased upon their physical condition, except that\nthey were awaiting court appearance. If asthma was\nso severe, why couldn't they be hospitalized? Why\nis their physical condition a reason to hold them\nin a state prison? On February 6, 1991, a court of\nreview ruled the patient's incarceration to be an\nunreasonable seizure of the person by the state of\nPennsylvania. The patient was released from custody\nwith a court order forbidding them to leave the\nstate to avoid a second court proceeding. As a\nresult of this incident, the county medical\ndirector took the position that the Department of\nCorrections should incarcerate patients only if\nthey were in imminent danger and medical\ntreatment was unavailable out of the prison\nsystem. Following this incident, the Medical Staff\napplied the \"Do No Harm Policy.\" The Do No Harm\nPolicy calls for the immediate transfer of inmates\nwho are very sick and have urgent medical\nneeds; that is, they are so ill that they can't\nwait for help to arrive.\" (1)\nMedical screening of prisoners and staff, as well as\nhealth education of prisoners, can help reduce the number of\nmedical problems. Medical screening, however, does not usually\nprevent major medical problems (e.g., renal failure, asthma), but it", "A woman whose daughter was killed in a hit-and-run  accident involving a drunk driver, as well as a retired police captain who once chased down a fleeing drunk driver, and a man who has seen the effects of drunk  driving on victims and on police officers who respond to the crashes speak out about the issue.  It's estimated that $109 Billion USD is lost every year from work-related  accidents and occupational diseases. They don't include the costs of drunk  driving and injuries to members of the public.\nA. Managing Risk:  How 1 of 4 Americans can be involved in a crime this year\nA recent article in Fortune magazine, \"Managing Risk\",  takes a look at how \"43.6 million\nnonfatal crimes\" occur each year in the U.S., and how \"1 in 4 U.S. workers can be \nvictims of crime.\"  It's a startling fact that costs a lot to  everyone, but what can we do\nabout it?  Fortune writes that \"risk management is not a black box that can be\nseparated from the rest of what  goes on in an operation.\"  It \"goes together\nwith financial  planning, legal advice, information technology, and so on.\"  An\nexample of being able to prevent a  drunk-driving crash is:\n\"The New Hampshire Executive Council has recently started a program to cut\nthe number  of alcohol-involved  driving fatalities  by 1,000 a year, or about\n3% total, over five years.  If successful, that means it has cut the loss of\n$39 million annually, for  a projected total of $1.95 billion.\"\nC. Innocent Victims:\nAn  innocent  family  lives  in  pain  every day because of a  drunk  driver who crashed\ninto them, as well as another innocent family, whose lives were shattered in a  drunk\ndriving  crash  that was caused by a hit-and-run driver.\nThe police have arrested John Stoner, 46, for the hit-and-run that killed 23-month-\nold  Jessica Cromwell of Springfield,  Massachusetts.  Her father was  driving her home\nwhen she was  struck  by  a car.  The family is asking for  anyone who knows the  driver\nof the car to come forward.\n\"We can never  replace Jessie,\" said mother Dina Cromwell. \"This is  something\nthat  changes your entire life. . .  Jessie was here only 16 months,\" said Cromwell,  who\nalso has a 19-year-old daughter,  \"and to lose her  all these years later, it's a terrible\nand a tragic  thing to go through. I don't know how you'd ever  get over  that.\"\nDina  Cromwell had been home from work  and had gotten on the highway.\n\"I started hearing the noise  of what sounded like somebody swerving out of\nsomebody's  driveway  up ahead. Then we hit Jessie  and flew  to the other\nlane.  I looked and I saw the woman hit her at the last second, I saw her roll\nin the air and land. I had no idea she had rolled, that she wasn't  dead.\"\nStoner was identified through a blood test matching him to the car. He was  arrested\non suspicion  of driving drunk and fleeing  the scene of a  crash. Prosecutors  have\nsaid they will seek a  felony charge.\nStoner was  previously  arrested by police in  January 1994  and  charged with \nleaving  the  scene  of a  motor  vehicle accident.\nProsecutors also charged him  with  driving  under  the  influence,  leaving  the\nscene of a crash  and unlicensed at the time.  The other incident took place in\n1993 in  North Grafton,  Massachusetts, and left a  young man  with  severely\ninjured  legs and feet.  The young man still suffers  physical  and  emotional  pain\nfrom the crash.\n\"We need to  find that individual, because they have hurt  enough people.

In particular, the protection of computer source-code provides an\nencouraging environment for innovation by Australia's digital trade\nexchanges. It remains to be seen, however, how IP commitments in the trade\npact will be enforced.\nRising tariffs will incentivise local digital trade exchanges to\ndevelop their business abroad. This is particularly relevant given recent\nannouncements from trade agreements between Japan and Mexico and the\nUnited States. Trade relations between both of these nations and Australia\nwould benefit significantly from the TPP.\nAustralian digital exchanges may begin to use the TPP to protect\nthemselves against competition from Asian services, including those from\nChina and South Korea. Despite Australia's significant efforts to establish\nits dominance in the region, the TPP would seem to provide a new avenue\nthrough which Australian digital exchanges can compete effectively on a\nworld scale. In particular, we may begin to see more Australian businesses\nusing regional platforms like FXstreet.com to trade foreign exchange in\nother countries.\nThe TPP is a powerful platform which could have great implications\nfor Australia's digital advertising industry. Ultimately, it remains to be\nseen what affect ratification would have on Australia's digital trade\nexchanges. Nevertheless, we could expect to see significant changes with\nmany Australian traders seeking to increase their exposure in markets which\nwould previously have been difficult or prohibitively expensive to access.\nWritten by: Daniel Pinkerton.", "On May 21, 2013, the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decided that an employee's request to speak on his Facebook page with his wife and 15 fellow employees about a company announcement related to wages was protected by the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNRLA\u201d). Additionally, the Board overturned the National Labor Relations Board Division of Judges (\u201cDivision\u201d) ruling, which held that the same employee\u2014a manager\u2014was unlawfully discharged when he refused to rescind his comments about the company's policies on social media. This case summary presents an overview of the case as well as discusses the National Labor Relations Board's rationale for overturning the Division\u2019s decision.\nWHEN APPLIES: This case does not set any type of precedent, but is noteworthy for employers who use social media in the workplace and monitor their employees' social media activity, especially with respect to discipline or termination.\nEmployer Background: American Moulded Products Inc. (\u201cAMP\u201d) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that employed approximately 244 production employees.\nPrior Incident: On December 13, 2012, John Duffy was discharged for stating in a Facebook post that he found a company press release on its website to be \u201creally f**ked up.\u201d AMP argued that Duffy\u2019s post was \u201ctantamount to\u201d unprotected threats to co-workers to commit physical violence because the post stated that he \u201cmay go postal\u201d and that he was \u201cthinking seriously about going postal.\u201d1\nAMP also alleged that Duffy\u2019s post was \u201cgrossly insubordinate\u201d because, according to AMP, Duffy\u2019s post \u201cimpugn[ed] AMP\u2019s integrity\u201d and was intended to embarrass the company or the company\u2019s employees.\nThe Division held that Duffy\u2019s post did not constitute protected activity, therefore AMP did not unlawfully discharge him for exercising his rights under section 7 of the NLRA, because Duffy\u2019s post was not made for the mutual aid or protection of the employees at AMP, he did not speak on behalf of the company or any of its employees and instead used the post to make personal comments about management. The Board disagreed with the Division\u2019s analysis and held that the post was a statement that the employees were \u201cmad\u201d about the wage information and that the communication was one of mutual aid or protection with other employees and could be considered concerted activity. According to the Board, Duffy was speaking about the manner in which AMP shared the Wage Information, not the disclosure itself.\nAMP\u2019s Facebook Page: The Facebook page, titled \u201cOfficial Amp, Dustin and Dale page!\u201d had the following description: \u201cAMP is an employee owned, family run manufacturing business. We are not public or trade. We are private family holdings.\u201d Duffy was employed at AMP for 37 years and was a shift lead. He also worked with an inside salesperson (Sandra) and an inside production operator (Dustin).\nAMP\u2019s Facebook page originally included Duffy or his colleagues because employees had taken photographs while \u201chaving a bit of fun.\u201d However, the Facebook page transitioned from a closed page to \u201cpublic,\u201d allowing all Facebook members to access the page because the page administrators would \u201cthrow a ball around\u201d with employees and would post a picture.\nPrior to the incident at issue, Duffy took various photographs with other employees and uploaded them to the company\u2019s Facebook page. On December 13, 2012, Duffy noticed that the company website listed the Wage Information and decided to update AMP\u2019s Facebook page. However, Duffy was not aware that Sandra did in fact post the Wage Information, and the post simply stated that it was \u201cworth noting that on December 12th at 10:00 pm AMP officially made wage information public. It is also worth noting, that we are mad as hell.\u201d\nAMP Did Not Follow Its Policy: AMP prohibited employees from disclosing or posting information about the company without permission. This policy was included in the company\u2019s employee handbook and stated: \u201cEmployees may make public statements regarding AMP products or policies only if specifically authorized to do so in writing by AMP\u2019s legal counsel. Public statements by employees that are not authorized by AMP in writing may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u201d AMP\u2019s Vice President and General Coun", "A look at media innovation across Europe, Latin America, Canada, and the United States from a local perspective \u2013 as opposed to an overall economic one \u2013 shows how innovation is a powerful force that impacts local media operations. But in order to innovate, publishers say they also need to invest time, resources, and money.\nIn the face of an economic crises that is changing the media environment worldwide, Innovation Media Consortium, a global media innovation network comprised of 210 member news organizations, set out to establish what \u201cmedia innovation\u201d meant locally.\nThe study was conducted in four major markets: Toronto (Canada), Los Angeles (US), Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Delhi (India), the latter of which were partnered with media in the United Kingdom for some interviews. Together, these five case studies cover the print, broadcast, digital and mobile mediums. And because Innovation Media Consortium is not an academic institution, the focus was to examine what news organizations are doing on a day-to-day basis rather than getting a report from an academic who may conduct research on a project at certain point in time.\nA report on the Innovation Study was presented by Michael Goldhaber, Consortium Leader, during a panel discussion at the International Symposium on Online Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.\nIn short, media innovation was defined as \u201ccreativity and entrepreneurship in an effort to improve the media enterprise. Some see it as a matter of experimentation and improvisation; others view innovation as an ability to change and adapt operations due to the changing economic environment.\u201d\nThe key trends observed in the United States are: A renewed importance \u2013 and pressure \u2013 to produce the bottom line, and an increased amount of experimentation being done with digital projects.\nThis study suggests that publishers need to make innovation a priority. Here are a few lessons media executives shared so far:\n\u2013 Innovate or die. Some journalists are starting to think it\u2019s a matter of life or death.\n\u2013 Media innovation is more than a technology project. It requires a holistic plan for the entire organization \u2013 and there may need to be a complete organizational culture change in order to carry it out.\n\u2013 Digital is not the future, it\u2019s the present.\n\u2013 Investment in new media, rather than cutbacks, is crucial.\n\u2013 Audience and community engagement should go hand and hand when it comes to media innovation.\n\u2013 Leaders should have the ability to \u201cembrace ambiguity.\u201d\n\u2013 Media organizations need to rethink who their audience is in order to fully engage them online.\n\u2013 There is no right or wrong when it comes to experimenting with new products and content. The challenge now is to experiment and find a model that works.\nThis entry was posted in Innovation, Journalism, Newspapers and tagged delhi, innovation media consortium, los angeles, Sao Paulo, Toronto.

It has never\ndenied to Germany the right to maintain defences.  It recognises\nthat Germany has certain legitimate interests.  It has not\ndenied to Germany a role in the system of world security.  But\nit has taken the view that this legitimate interest of Germany\nshoud not be allowed to be used as a pretext for a\nrearmament policy which is dangerous to the peace of the world.\nWhen one considers that there were several other countries\nat that time which did not deny to Germany the need to\nmaintain defences it follows that the action taken by Austria for\nthe purpose of maintaining her own neutrality was fully in\nline with her duty  in that direction and cannot be construed\nin any way as hostile to the legitimate interests of Germany.\nSimilarly when one considers that Austria recognised that\nthe German interest was not one of purely  local importance,\nas was demonstrated by the fact that  the question had been\nraised and treated on  the level  of  an international  question\nand not through bilateral treaties, it follows that Austria\nhas recognised the principle of the need for maintaining the\nbalance of power.\nIn view of the fact that as far   as   German policy was\nconcerned, Austria could not be charged with any hostile attitude,\nAustria could not in the circumstances and  on  principle\ntake an attitude which was hostile to Germany, even as an\naction  taken  in  its own  interests.\nFurther  consideration  was  now  being given to whether\nAustria's  foreign policy in regard to Germany should be put\non  a permanent basis.    Austria had to  do this in the light\nof the fact that events had  occurred since the Anschluss,\nwhich she had not foreseen,   and  had  to  take into account a\nnew international  situation  which  had affected the balance\nof power.  Austria therefore desired to draw up a new Charter\nof   Friendship   between   Austria   and   Germany,   which\nconstitutional  arrangement  would  be  put  into  effect at\nThe Government  was  convinced  that  a  policy which was\ninvariably  favourable  to  Austria  would  not  only   be in\nconformity  with  principles,  but that it  was in Austria's\nmost  vital  interest.\nA  foreign  policy  based  on mutual  confidence could  only\nserve the cause  of peace, and it was  not possible to find  a\nforeign policy on the lines  of a policy of  suspicion  or  of\nhostility  to  Germany,  since such a policy would only lead\nto a reciprocal attitude.\nIn the present situation when one considered that  with\nthe  exception   of   Japan   the  world   had   been  split\nbetween the two main blocs of the Axis and the Allies, a policy\nof mutual confidence was the only policy which would be in\nthe best interests of Austria as  well as her neighbours.\nThe   Government   of  the   Republic   was   not  unmindful\nof the interest of the Austrian economy and  hoped  that\nthere  would  in  the near future no longer be a question as\nto the continued independence of Austria with regard to her\nrights which were laid down as a consequence of the peaceful\nannexation of Austria by  Germany, and  a new German-Austrian\nCharter of Friendship would serve to make it more certain.\nThe Government of D.M.R. considers that  the  policy,  of\nmaintaining  neutrality  has  been  proved  by  the  events\nsince the Anschluss,  since  the  3 States  with  which  Austria\ncame  in  closer  contact   have  always   regarded  her  in a\nfavourable   light   and   have   not   made   use   of  her\nsituation  in  their  fight against Germany.\nAustria    hopes    that    the    Anschluss,    by   enabling\nAustria again to be independent without the interference of\nforeign  countries   and   to  enjoy  peace,   will  help   to\novercome  the  present difficulties in regard to the world\neconomic situation.\nAustria was conscious that the international situation\nwas  not  what", "In 2007, the news industry should begin to focus on the \"social newsroom\".

The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12) and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (HC-14) have increased the financial burden, risk, and responsibilities for many NFIP policyholders. These and other changes have increased pressure from insureds to maintain lower effective premiums, which have in turn caused an increased emphasis on the use of risk rating in the NFIP program. This is creating a series of challenges including those associated with the effective use of risk rating, the accuracy of current and potential subsidies, an ability to manage the program, and the ability to administer rate changes in a timely manner. In an effort to address and mitigate these challenges, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in its 2015 Report: Toward Reforming America\u2019s Community-Based Manufacturing System, requested the Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (FSOC\u2019s) 11 Federal regulatory agency members to develop joint recommendations regarding possible reforms for the NFIP. In response, the agencies developed a jointly recommended set of proposals to address current challenges.\nFollowing a series of public discussions by representatives of the private and public sectors throughout the country, the agencies have finalized the joint recommendations by establishing and publishing a set of five recommendations that are consistent with the FSOC\u2019s Request and support the NFIP\u2019s ability to improve the accuracy of risk analysis, strengthen its financial position, and streamline the rating, application, and appeals process. The recommendations also include adjustments to the effective premium that would reduce subsidy rates and strengthen the rate adequacy of the NFIP program without affecting the affordability of rates for some insured properties. The recommendations outline changes that would mitigate some concerns and concerns that the current NFIP program may not remain affordable or competitive. They also acknowledge that the final design and implementation of the recommendations will require continued dialogue and further study, and will take time to implement.\nThe five agency recommendations are:\n\u2022      Improving the accuracy of the risk analysis in the NFIP to provide risk\nratings to more accurately reflect the financial characteristics of the risk to ensure that adequate\npremiums are collected from those properties and insurance for those properties are available,\nand to reduce the reliance of rating using other non-risk factors,\n\u2022      Enhancing financial stability by eliminating, phasing out, or capping subsidies\nof up to $4,500,\n\u2022      Strengthening the appeal process by consolidating it at the local level,\n\u2022      Improving operational efficiency by focusing rate adjustments on those properties\ninvolved in multiple policies and the use of the Biggert-Waters Consensus Bill of Costs to\nreduce errors and eliminate duplication,\n\u2022      Improving the affordability of rates for eligible structures that receive property\ntax benefits by using a common rating methodology to develop rate categories.\n\u2022      This notice discusses these five agency recommendations and summarizes some\nof the concerns associated with the use of risk rating and the process associated with the\nrating of NFIP properties. The rating of properties may affect the affordability of a policy,\nand any changes to the rating of properties may affect a property owner\u2019s ability to purchase\na policy from any NFIP provider. The following recommendations are also identified in the\nNFIP Reform Act. Public hearings to understand the implications of implementing these\nrecommendations have been conducted, and a discussion of their impact on NFIP policyholders is included in this notice.\n\u2022      Currently, the Risk Rating System (RRS) used in the NFIP program is an inaccurate predictor of the overall risk of properties insured under NFIP policy. The accuracy of the RRS is based on several risk factors including elevation, flood zone, damage history, policy number, and subsidy status, and the RRS may not incorporate other risk factors such as property type (i.e., mobile homes and homes of log construction), dwelling age, building type, occupancy, waterfront location, and presence of structural features that aid drainage (i.e., gutters). In some instances, the RRS rate may not appropriately recognize the risk of a particular property.\n\u2022      NFI", "The State Health Officer issued an order prohibiting any person from selling or offering for sale any smokeless tobacco products in this State.

In 2016, a circuit court order declared that the provision prohibiting the sale of smokeless tobacco products violated the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause. In re Regulation of Smokeless Tobacco, Okl. Civ. App. No. 108,739, 2016 WL 3494159 (Okla. 2016). The provision was thus struck down as unconstitutional.\n The State Health Officer filed a petitioner to this Court challenging the circuit court's order stating that, by doing so, the State would lose more than $37 million during fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Therefore, the State Health Officer sought an expedited resolution of this case via expedited interlocutory appeal as provided by Okla. Stat., tit. 20, \u00a7 194. An expedited interlocutory appeal may only be conducted if necessary to eliminate a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and practical importance to warrant a decision before a final judgment and to prevent irreparable injury. Cite as State ex rel. Heavin v. Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Fin. Auth., 2016 OK 19, n.1. If the Court determines that expedited interlocutory appeal is warranted, the Court shall order the case expedited, limit the time for filing briefs and grant oral argument at the discretion of the Court. Okl. Stat., tit. 20, \u00a7 194.\n On August 19, 2016, the State Health Officer filed an appellate complaint in which he sought a declaration that the circuit court's order was void as lacking the authority of the district courts as Article 7, \u00a7 6 of the Oklahoma Constitution clearly gave the district court original jurisdiction over appeals from the judgment of a trial court. See Okla. Stat., tit. 27, \u00a7 125. The State Health Officer further sought a writ of mandamus directed to the district court to order it to dismiss the action filed by the Tobacco-Free Retailers in their capacity as intervenors.\n On December 13, 2016, the Tobacco-Free Retailers, by and through R. David Wright, filed an answer and counterclaims against the State Health Officer. R. David Wright alleges that the State Health Officer fails to comply with the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Also on December 13, 2016, R. David Wright filed a request for hearing for the purpose of obtaining relief from an \u201cillegal order\u201d entered by the district court.\n On December 13, 2016, the Tobacco-Free Retailers moved the district court for the issuance of a temporary injunction against the State Health Officer to compel the State Health Officer to comply with 63 O.S. 1991 \u00a7 137.\n The State Health Officer filed a response in opposition to the temporary injunction on January 4, 2017, contending that issuing a temporary injunction would cause irreparable injury to the State and could lead to the State's liability being quadrupled. See Tex. Med. Assn. v. Scott, 614 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that the party seeking an injunction must demonstrate that the threatened injury will be irreparable if an injunction does not issue). The State Health Officer also filed a response in opposition to the request for an order to", "The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced the availability of applications for the 1998 round of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP).\nDATES: The application guidelines are available here.

Hydrology and hydrometeorology:\nThe Hydrology (or Hydrogeology) Program in the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is a\nmulti-disciplinary program addressing the hydrologic needs of the many functions of the\nBureau.  The needs of the program include  forecasting, monitoring, and research\nrelating to the water needs and resources for the Upper Colorado River basin; the upper\nBoulder River basin; the Colorado River basin (in cooperation with the Lower Basin\nCommittee of the Central Arizona Project); the San Joaquin River and Delta Basin;\nNevada; and to many other States in the Pacific Slope States as well.  At present, there are\n9 Reclamation and 11 other Federal agency offices in Washington, D. C., that contribute to\nthis program; Reclamation offices include:\na.  National Office,\nb.  Southwest Region,\nc.  Denver Office,\nd.  Upper Blue Basin,\ne.  Upper Colorado River Basin, and\nf.  Pacific Southwest Regional Office.\n2.  Environmental concerns:\nReclamation is deeply concerned with the use of natural resources that are critical,\nvaluable and of public interest.  One of which, is water.  Because of this concern,\nReclamation will need to:\na.  maintain and enhance water quality and maintain the balance of natural ecosystems\nthat exist in the areas where surface water is used;\nb.  provide for the safety of workers and the public when natural resources are utilized,\nand thus, the protection against the hazards of floods, fires, etc.;\nc.  develop plans and methods that will ensure the efficient use of water, and will result\nin cost effectiveness of the development and use of those resources;\nd.  reduce adverse impacts on natural resources related to energy consumption;\ne.  develop methods and models for monitoring and forecasting natural resources related\nto water;\nand, lastly, f.  develop and utilize environmental decision support systems for the better\nhandling and planning of natural resources.\n3.  The Hydrology Program goals:\nThe Hydrology Program's goals are to meet the needs and requirements of water\nresources for the Upper Colorado River Basin; the Upper Blue River Basin; the\nColorado River Basin; Nevada; and many other State areas.\n4.  Programs (Broadly defined):\nA multi-disciplinary resource and decision support program of hydrologic research\nincluding watershed modeling, simulation, hydrologic forecasting, real-time sensors,\ncomputer based management information systems and computer aided decision support.\nSpecific Programs to be conducted by the Hydrology Program (in general):\na.  Hydrologic forecasting:\nThis program has two objectives:  (1) to aid in the decision-making process by providing\nhydrologic forecasting products; and (2) to assist in the evaluation of hydrologic forecasts.\nThese objectives are met by developing new capabilities in watershed modeling,\nsimulation, hydrologic forecasting, real-time sensors, computer based management\ninformation systems and computer aided decision support.\nb.  Advanced watershed modeling:\nThis program uses mathematical and computer techniques to model the various components\n(such as rainfall, stream flow, runoff and reservoir levels) of a particular watershed and the\nexperienced effects in the area of the flood, droughts, snow-melt, and water quality.\nc.  Operation and management of dams:\nThis program is focused on the monitoring, operation and maintenance of the dam and\nreservoir facilities within the Bureau of Reclamation.  It will provide for the continued\noperations and maintenance of those structures.  It will also provide for the\ndevelopment of new techniques and procedures that will be used to perform the\nmonitoring, operation and maintenance to assure continued safety and serviceability.\nd.  Hydrologic investigations:\nThis program investigates the hydrologic conditions throughout the Upper Colorado River\nBasin and the Upper Blue River Basin.  These investigations include the collection and\nevaluation of data throughout the year, development and testing of watershed model\nmethods, maintenance of data collection stations, development of hydrologic\nforecasts, studies related to water quality, and analyses of water supply and water quality\nin the area.  This type of work must be conducted in order to evaluate the hydrologic", "The 30-year old case of MKULTRA was never closed; it\nwas just hidden from the public.\nOn March 31, 2000, CBS's \"60 MINUTES\" devoted a segment to\nunearthing records from the FBI and CIA that prove that the\nagencies have continued to experiment with individuals'\nmental processes, as they had during the MKULTRA era. (CBS\ndistributed copies of the 25,000 page documentary record.\nSee http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/31/mediares/main563671.shtml)\nIn the first of the 60 MINUTES reports, correspondent\nDan Rather interviewed author David Martin. He read\npassages from Martin's books MARY'S MONSTERS/THE FBI'S\nILLEGAL SEARCH FOR A \"MACHINE THAT WOULD PICK THOUGHTS\nOUT OF THE AIR\". This book, which is being serialized in\nthe April 2000 edition of THE WASHINGTON SOURCE, was a\nmeticulous review of hundreds of CIA documents that shed\nvaluable light on the agency's attempt to perfect a remote\nmind control system in the 1960's.\nMartin told Dan Rather that the Agency did indeed come\nclose to achieving mind control, but that it was forced to\nshelve the project until further research could be done by\nagency scientists. The original MKULTRA project was\nabandoned in the 1970's. In 1996, however, with the aid of\ncomputer technology, researchers discovered that some of\nthe agency's experiments with mind control had been\nsuccessful. The researchers were conducting a study that\nanalyzed CIA documents, in order to track down any CIA\nprojects involving the \"remote viewing\" of another person's\nthoughts. Such a project would be known as \"psychic spying.\"\n\"Witnesses\" of psychic spying were later identified as\nthe \"programmed multiples\" studied by psychiatrist Ewan\nClark, the man who pioneered psychic spying technology and\nwho eventually became Merton's MKULTRA handler and\nprogrammer. One of the witnesses identified by CBS,\nVictor Marchetti, was subjected to psychic spying at the CIA\nuntil the agency's psychic division was closed down in\nBoth authors Dan Rather and David Martin suggested that\nthe FBI might have resumed work on the CIA mind control\nproject after its cancellation by William Webster. Webster\nserved as Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's\nWashington Field Office.\nWebster was responsible for the FBI's counter-intelligence\noperation, including its COINTELPRO program. Both the\nSenate Church Committee and the House Rampart Committee had\nchastised the FBI for abuses in these COINTELPRO programs.\nIt may well be that Webster, while working for the\nFBI, revived the CIA MKULTRA projects at the agency's\nrequest, and used COINTELPRO for his illegal operations\ninside the United States. He would certainly have the\ntalents needed for illegal mind control operations without\nthose of the CIA programmers.\nWhile the FBI's counter-intelligence projects used\nCOINTELPRO, this operation had strict guidelines and used a\ncourt-approved process that involved the issuance of FISA\nwarrants (see my book WAR ON THE ROVE, pages 139-163).\nCOINTELPRO used secret \"papers\" (that is, orders that\ncould never be revealed to the targeted individual).\nWebster, as Webster, used no such guidelines or\nrestrictions. His counter-intelligence operations were\ncompletely illegal. It could well be that he resurrected\nthe CIA MKULTRA project--which was a \"papers\" operation--\nin order to continue the Agency's covert research into\nmind control that had already been conducted by Ewan\nClark, a psychiatrist, and his colleagues at the CIA.\nAfter watching the 25 minute \"60 MINUTES\" broadcast,\nPresident Clinton called CIA Director John Deutch to ask", "\"It is the press which is the greatest power on earth.\n\"It is the judge of the moral character of all institutions, and\nits record of the actions of the great\nfor the illumination of the minds of children in future ages.\"\n--- Horace Greeley, founder of the New York Tribune,\nwhich Greeley named the 'Greatest\nMercantile College In The World',\nfounder and President of the\nNational Temperance Society,\neditor of the Liberal Party,\nauthor of 17 books,\nco-inventor of the moldboard plow,\norganizer of a national banking system,\nreform of the American Postal service and\ninstigator of the First Interstate Bank of America\n--- Theodore Roosevelt\n\"In a country made up mostly\nof young people, it is our duty\nto help build a society\nof young people, a young\nnation.

(in \"The Peace\") :\n\"There are two classes of men who never take action: one because they lack the necessary data, the other because they cannot get organized.\"\nIn other words, the leaders of war are, in general, very short of any kind of data or very inefficient organizers.\nIf you analyze any war, there is always one common aspect: the leader who starts it is, in general, the most disorganized person on Earth.\nThat is, he is the worst possible organization and the least possible data.\nThere are, of course, always exceptions to common rules, but most often they are also exceptions to another rule:\nIf a war is started and its leader has organized himself, then usually the war will end quickly and its victory will be total.\nOne of the greatest tragedies of World War I was the fact that its leaders were so disorganized and unintelligent that its outbreak was preventable.\nIn general, the longer any war lasts, the more disorganized the leader is.\nIf he is the least possible data source, then the war will go on for longer.\nOne can study every single war and one will see this factor is present.\nIf a war lasts a long time, then we can be sure that the leader has not organized himself or that he lacks data or both.\nFor this reason, most wars never end.\nBecause their leaders are too disorganized, they go on for millennia, without stopping, even as the population of the world increases, the world gets better and better and people live healthier, longer, fuller lives.\nWar wastes human and physical energy and, above all, wastes opportunities for social and economic investment and development.\nThe fact that it lasts this long is not a surprise.\nThe fact is that war is too complicated an affair and its leader is too disorganized to be solved by anyone or on any continent.\nNo country, no leader nor any army can possibly succeed in doing so.\nThat's what makes every single war the longest war ever fought.\nNo matter how intelligent is whatever army, no matter what weapons it uses, no matter what political or religious ideology it fights for, no matter even how many people kill for it, the war we are fighting now will be the longest one ever fought.\nBecause its leaders are the least prepared, the most disorganized, and the least informed in 2500 years, as well as the least data about who they want to fight.\nThe world's longest war could last", "How the Web changed one local newspaper\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/local/\nla-me-localmedia6-2006mar06,1,4841077.story?coll=la-headlines-bty-local\nThe Times of Huntington Beach, a 15,000 circulation newspaper, is\na little different from other papers because its website is its top\nsource of news.

The rulemaking would make the following modifications: (i) Adjustments to the case-mix weights based on the most recent wage index data and the latest available occupational mix data to reflect the direct costs of providing PAC services in a particular market area; (ii) adjustments based on the most recent information available on the total nursing and personal care labor costs in PACs; and (iii) adjustments to the case-mix weights for certain patients to address the effects of certain characteristics on patient length of stay (such as the age of individuals with ESRD when first enrolled in a PAC program). CMS seeks to provide appropriate payment to PACs for the care they provide based on the most current costs of care for the populations they serve. CMS believes that this proposed adjustment to CY 2011 annual rates and the new rates in the LTCH PPS proposed rule will provide adequate payment to PACs for providing service to acutely ill populations while ensuring that a consistent percentage of costs are paid as case-mix adjustments. Payment for capital-related costs to PAC facilities is also proposed to be changed from 25% to the industry-average of 22.5%.\nADDRESSES: CMS must receive your comments on this proposal by June 7, 2010. Comments on the amendments to the CY 2011 payment rates for PACs may be submitted as follows:\nhttp://www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions in the\nRegulations.gov User Tutorial to submit written comments or\nfacsimile to (202) 386-6702 or by mail to CMS Reimbursement\nCenter, Public Communications Division, Room 3445-G, CMS,\n7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.\nPublic comments, including any personal information provided,\nthat are submitted on a timely basis will be included in the\nproposal and will also be available for public inspection.\nYou may submit your comments on a timely basis through Regulations.gov or by mailing your comments by June 7, 2010, in advance of the public display.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The PAC proposed rule is available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PACRR/.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CMS believes that, in establishing PPS rates, it is appropriate to take into consideration the average cost of providing a given level of care to a given patient population. In the previous notice of proposed rulemaking for PACs, CMS proposed specific methodologies and assumptions in establishing case-mix weights reflective of the costs to hospitals of providing treatment to patients in different patient care classifications (64 FR 17938). In addition, by section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) if the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), CMS must adjust PAC payments for case-mix factors to ensure adequate payment for treating acutely ill patients. Specifically, section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii)(I) of the Act requires that 68 percent of the estimated average allowable Medicare expenses for a standard PAC patient, net of noncovered costs and cost reduction amounts, must be paid in the standard (naturally expected) case mix. See also CMS' proposed notice on the annual adjustment to the wage index for hospitals (69 FR 4595-6). CMS received public comments on this section and the proposal to implement the requirement. These documents can be found on the Internet at: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register.html, http://www.cms.hhs.gov, and http://www.cms.hhs.gov/floor/summary.asp#top.\nCMS also stated its belief that an equitable percentage of costs to treat a patient population should be paid in the case-mix classification, based on the costs for treating patients of a similar severity and illness burden. In accordance with section 1886(d)(5) of the Act, CMS believes that there is variation, over time and across areas, in the costs of providing hospital outpatient services. The Act therefore also requires CMS to adjust the prospective pay", "Reporters at a German national newspaper have learned the importance of social media and the need to be timely when sharing breaking news online. They are finding the best news on Twitter through an \u201cinterest cloud\u201d around news items in certain areas, allowing for better story ideas and more social influence for the newspaper.\nDPA, Die Welt: How to use social media effectively for news reporting\nBy J\u00f6rn Fischer\nAs a new media editor at German national newspaper Die Welt (DieWart), I am constantly looking for new and alternative ways to find news and report stories online. One important source for me are social networks including Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or YouTube.\nTraditionally, journalists used \u201ccanned searches\u201d on the Internet to research topics. This was the first phase of the Internet era for journalists. Certain keywords were queried with the expectation they were enough to find all news on a topic. But this method of searching had a few weaknesses: It was slow, and it was not 100 percent reliable. The results also depended on the search engine or search engine operator you were using, as well as your skill to formulate a query.\nIn the second phase of journalism on the Internet, we learned the power of hashtags for reporting stories. But it was not so easy to report trending topics on social media. There were a lot of reports about the subject and not much information was offered about the original source of most information, leading to misinformation and a lot of \u201cnoise.\u201d\nAnd still, there is a third major phase of news production on the Internet, called \u201ccrowdsourcing.\u201d People do not just report on news on social media networks, but also take part in the actual creation of news. There are several examples of that in the German-language region on Twitter alone. There is a \u201cGerman Breaking News hashtag,\u201d in which journalists, citizens, public institutions, companies, and politicians compete among themselves to be the \u201cfirst.\u201d\nThe best way for reporters to get a \u201cfirst\u201d on Twitter is to follow the best journalist in a specific subject area such as #breaking, #sport, #local, and #national. But that was before there was another type of crowdsourcing, which is the \u201cinterest cloud\u201d around certain news items in specific subjects. This approach does not require you to follow as many people or as many interests. Instead, you simply have to create one central interest, such as #football, #sport, #swimming, #soccer, etc., and then enter this central focus of interest into a crowdsourcing tool such as TwapperKing, which will do the hard work of \u201cmining\u201d all related content on Twitter. And then it is as easy as typing #football and waiting a few seconds. This will make the search much faster and help you find interesting Tweets in the \u201cinterest cloud\u201d of #football.\nFor example, if you enter #soccer and then enter \u201call\u201d or just the word \u201ctweet\u201d \u2014 no spaces in between \u2014 on the TwapperKing search engine, you will reach the best #soccer tweets reported on Twitter. You can also use other keywords such as #germany, #england, and so on.\nIt just takes a little time to build an \u201cinterest cloud\u201d around different topics if you are looking to find new and original stories, breaking stories, or to follow people with a specific interest on Twitter. You can also use these techniques to find people and people-based stories that you may want or need to interview for a story or story project.\nFor example, if you type #soccer or #football and #england in your TwapperKing search engine and then add, for example, the word \u201cfans\u201d or \u201cfollowers,\u201d you will get interesting stories, not \u201cnoise.\u201d You can also use these techniques to follow people with a specific interest (in this example: #germany) on Twitter, and you can also type \u201call\u201d or \u201cno space,\u201d for example, #germany instead of #germanywithoutspacestoo.\nThis leads me to the question of what types of news we can find on social networks. There are many different types of news, and we often hear news reporters say that there is \u201cno news in the newsroom.\u201d\nWith social media, it has never been like that. Journalists, however, often miss the \u201cmoment\u201d of the story. The best stories may appear in the \u201cmoment,\u201d not after a day or two, but right then and there.\nFor example, in April 2006, German actor Heino Ferch went to South Africa without making any special attempts to contact journalists. Later, when he came back, it was the best thing", "The Adoption and Amendment of Amendment No. 1 to Rule W of the N.Y. Comp.

It will now be up to the EU's Council to confirm some amendments, before the Directive comes into force.\nUnder the Directive, advertising placed on video sharing services will be governed by law in all EU member states. Under existing law, the national courts are the arbitrators, with little uniformity around Europe. From the date this Directive comes into force, there will have to be consistent rules around Europe. The Directive will apply to internet service providers, as well as to publishers and broadcasters. There will be some exceptions, including for content with a political, philosophical or religious nature. The Directive will also provide protection for advertising of medicaments and medical devices in the event of illegal trade in human beings. EU Member States that apply the law will have a minimum of seven years to implement it, and the Directive will apply to online content hosted and broadcast in the EU.\nThis paper examines the current position, as well as the proposed Directive as at July 2008, and sets out what may happen post-implementation.\n1.    The current position\nUnder the current system, the laws governing advertising are dealt with on a national level, with some variation between countries. There are currently no pan-European laws governing advertising or the internet; so when content from different EU states is viewed by a European Union consumer, different national laws may apply to how any advertising is handled. For publishers and broadcasters of audio visual media there is additional uncertainty - it is not always clear whether, and to what extent, their activities are classified as media services. Advertising is included within the definition of a media service. So there is a possibility that an advertiser's activities could be governed by media law and by competition law, thus making it potentially easier for a country to set and control the content and manner of any audio-visual advertising.\nIn the absence of such laws in each individual EU Member State, there is a role for EU institutions to try to harmonise, to some extent, EU law in the area. The EU has recently been taking steps to do just that, including the European Commission's Green Paper on Audiovisual Media Services published on 12 December 2006 (\"the Green Paper\").\nThe EU Green Paper addressed the impact of digital technology on media services and advertising, and the regulatory issues and principles that needed to be addressed. It identified certain areas where there was a need for action, including advertising and self-regulation. This led to a public consultation, as well as a series of meetings and the adoption of a Communication to the European Parliament, European Council and other concerned parties of 12 September 2007. This set out proposals for the revision by the European Commission of the existing EEC Council Directive on the advertising and sponsorship of products to  children and adolescents (\"the EEC Council Directive\") and for the updating of the EU Directive on services in the internal market (Directive 89/552/EEC). The Communication set out proposals for pan-European rules governing the advertising of products, services and events online and over the internet and via interactive services. This includes harmonised regimes for advertising of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The Commission suggested three steps to be taken immediately: an agreement by 2007 on the need for new rules on advertising of audio- visual media services; a report in 2007 on the development of European advertising self-regulatory bodies; and an impact study of any further EU action in the area in 2007-2008. The Commission also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should assess by 2008 the need for revising the proposal or starting negotiations on harmonising the regulatory regime for audio-visual media services.\nThere have been calls for harmonisation of EU law to deal with the online activities of media services. For the Green Paper to be successful, the drafting group will need to consult with concerned parties, which includes advertisers and publishers. This would need to be carried out urgently, given the time pressures within which the European Parliament works, with a view to the law coming into force before the end of 2009 or early 2010.\nIt may appear surprising to readers that the Green Paper has not yet given rise to greater certainty of European law in this area. However, this may be because of", "In a world where people live to age 120 and are never sick, the only way to be sure a product is contaminant-free is for each bottle to have a unique DNA code to authenticate the contents from the manufacturer. The Coca-Cola company used a blockchain to do just that. Readers had to take a quiz to enter to win a bottle of Coca-Cola branded with their DNA. Coca-Cola\u2019s brand promise is \u201cOpen Happiness\u201d, so this campaign was all about how happy they would feel when they cracked open their bottle. The prize was an unbranded bottle of Coke for people to do whatever they wanted with it.\nDETAILS: The campaign worked in many respects. First, this was a great example of bringing digital marketing to a more traditional category like a canned product, so people who normally do not think of blockchain when they are buying a bottle of coke could associate the familiar Coca-Cola brand with it. Second, this campaign did well at integrating social media and messaging with the experience people got from consuming the product \u2013 making it feel \u201cOpen Happiness\u201d!\nBrand: Coca-Cola/KO\nMedia: Digital marketing\nBrand Challenge: The only way for them to guarantee that all of the ingredients of each bottle of Coke were good \u2013 and did not have a contaminant \u2013 was to use a DNA code for each bottle. They used blockchain technology to make this possible.\nChallenge: People have to trust that when they buy a product there is very little chance it will be a contaminant, but this is not entirely possible today. How would you let people know you used a DNA code to make sure each bottle of Coca-Cola was safe to drink?\nCampaign Objective: To promote a better trust in the Coca-Cola brand.\nCampaign Solution: A quiz for people to take where they had to identify various things that were made of Coca-Cola.

The purpose of the Board's action was to clarify that an administrative law judge\ufffds finding that a statutory requirement has been complied with is not subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Rule was based on the recent decision in National Labor Relations Board v. RKM Associates, Inc., 416 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2005), a case brought challenging the validity of the Board's electronic records retention rules.\nThe NLRB's notice of intent, which appeared as an attachment to a notice of proposed rulemaking and a proposed information collection (\ufffdRPM/IC notice\ufffd) (69 FR 44355), provides the text of the amendments to the Board's current rule, as well as a summary of the changes and the regulatory analysis associated with each change. The text of the Board regulations may also be accessed directly on the Board's Web site at http://www.nlrb.gov/rules/retention.htm. The Board also invited interested persons to submit written comments on the amendments to the rule. The comments are a helpful complement to the published summary in assessing the impact the Board's changes may have on the business community. The Board will consider these comments prior to making a final determination.\nThe NLRB is accepting comments on the proposed rule change through October 15, 2004. A paper copy of the RPM/IC Notice may be requested from the Agency Public Document Room at (202) 273-1086 (this is an automated system, please refer to your fax number).\nOn August 25, 2004, the NLRB published a second notice regarding electronic records, which provides copies of the comments it received on its proposed rule change (\ufffdcomments\ufffd) (http://www.nlrb.gov/rules/recordsofnotice.htm).\nThe NLRB received the comments from the business and academic communities, and from the legal profession. The Board reviewed the comments very carefully in preparing a final rule, which was filed on October 6, 2004.\nOnline Retention Regulations\nIn 1999, the Board amended its Rules of Practice in order to adopt electronic recordkeeping regulations, allowing the NLRB to retain certain information electronically instead of physically.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, which had the same type of records in their possession, had already adopted the same rules in 1999.\nThe Board, however, adopted the final rules differently than the Treasury Department, which had previously adopted similar rules. In the NLRB\ufffds final rule, the Board deleted certain provisions from the draft that the Treasury Department had added to its final rule.\nRKM Associates, Inc. Challenged the Electronic Records Retention Regulations\nThe company had challenged the amendment, arguing that the Board failed to provide a reasonable opportunity for public notice and comment, and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs administrative agency operations. RKM Associates then brought suit against the Board as a result, arguing that the amendment was arbitrary and capricious. The Board had found RKM Associates liable for three separate violations of the National Labor Relations Act.\nThe company argued that the Board violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to hold a public notice and comment rulemaking. In denying the Board's motion to dismiss, the court found that the 1999 amendments did not constitute a rulemaking requirement requiring notice and comment. Since the Board had not made a rule but an informational rule \ufffd that the company had to keep records \ufffd the company did not have any right to challenge the amendment before the Board.\nThe Board's Revised Rule Changes\nAfter the court case and the rulemaking process, the Board was required to make a number of changes to the regulation for this notice (\ufffdthe final rule\ufffd). Under the final rule, the Board has two primary aims.\nFor one, it seeks to ensure that all companies within its jurisdiction retain information electronically without violating", "For many readers, news in digital format could be life or death. A new survey shows that news users rely on news apps with more frequency than ever before with many turning to the news when in danger or needing help.\nAs much as readers use news apps and websites, they still seek advice in life-or-death situations, with 87 per cent turning to news apps when in danger.\nNew research by Google and Ipsos confirms news usage to be pervasive \u2013 95 per cent of US adults use at least one news app and 74 per cent use multiple apps.\nWhen in need of important life-or-death information and advice, 87 per cent of US adults turn to a news app or website first (78 per cent), followed by 16 per cent seeking help from their healthcare provider (13 per cent) and 7 per cent consulting a friend (5 per cent). Notably, only 1 per cent (0 per cent) turn to social media first.\nThis preference for news-based life advice is consistent regardless of age (76 per cent adults 18-49 years old, 80 per cent ages 50-65, and 81 per cent ages 65+). The data also reveals that younger, educated, urban, professional, and female users favour accessing online news first over other sources. While age, gender, and race are not found to significantly impact access to specific types of news and news-like sites, the online news app users surveyed were 9 per cent more likely than other mobile smartphone owners to be African-American and 8 per cent more likely to be Hispanic.\nAdditionally, US adults are twice as likely to use online news apps and sites today than only two years ago (78 per cent vs. 41 per cent).\nWhile millennials are not the most prevalent news users, it is an established fact they access news most frequently on their phones and are more likely to use news apps than others (40 per cent of US adults have news on their phone in comparison to 35 per cent of adults using news apps).\nAnd, millennials are also slightly more likely than average to use news apps more frequently (108 per cent vs. 97 per cent using more than one news app in the last month).\nMore than 65 per cent of US adults say they use at least one news app at least once a month, with young adults aged 18-19 as the most dependent news app users at 87 per cent.\nGoogle and Ipsos also surveyed the impact of news on users' knowledge and attitudes in order to measure the impact of news apps beyond news-related research. Some of their findings include:\nNinety-five per cent of US adults (ages 18+) have relied on news to make a big personal decision, 63 per cent have done so within the past six months.\nNearly two in three (63 per cent) say having access to news influences their decisions. Over half are influenced by news at least \"some of the time\" (51 per cent).\nHalf of US adults (49 per cent) would like to see more people discuss current affairs. And when it comes to what people would like to see in the news, the respondents say they see value in news about \"everyday life,\" 34 per cent.\nOther types of topics the respondents say they'd like to see more about include:\nThe environment (29 per cent)\nAfrican-American culture (15 per cent)\nHealth issues (14 per cent)\nFemale issues (14 per cent)\nAfrican-American news (12 per cent)\nWhile readers of news have increased, there is still a desire for more African-American culturally relevant news from different platforms.\n\"Black women are a significant majority of our most loyal readers,\" Vibe and the Urban Network's Chief Executive Officer Scott Dale said when the company was acquired by Urban One, Inc. in 2015. \"African-American is part of our brand. It's so much about the community as well. And this community is an avid news consumer.\"\nThe study also found that nearly half (49 per cent) of US adults would use a news app for daily information versus 55 per cent who would use an app to access localised information.\nAnd while 61 per cent of smartphone and tablet owners used their phones for news the previous day (and 41 per cent did so within the hour before/after), only", "The Department of Alcoholic Beverages and\nInspections publishes an order finding the applicant a reputable\nperson in the conduct of the liquor business; and authorizes the\nlicensee to hold raffles.\nDATES: October 21, 2015 until the order expires.\nREASONS: This regulatory notice is being issued to inform\ninterested persons that the Department finds the applicant in\ncompliance with the requirements of the Alcoholic Beverages Law", "PAGES FOR REVIEW\nI've put together a draft of the \"pages\" part of the\nwebsite design I've come up with so far.

And since glossy advertising doesn't take a lot of space, advertisers of all kinds can use high end production values on a limited budget.\"\nBy David Widgington\nLONDON--One very important lesson learnt from the recent UK government investigation is that advertisements for financial services must be honest. The general public does not like to be misled and it's not very popular when you're trying to convince someone who is already feeling a bit confused for doing something foolish.\nThe big question then is how can we get across an important financial message without confusing the reader or trying to sell them a product they don't want or need?\nFor advertisers of all kinds the answer is relatively simple: glossy paper, ink and colour should be enough to convince consumers. And since glossy advertising doesn't take a lot of space, advertisers of all kinds can use high end production values on a limited budget.\nThe financial services marketers need help from the creative industry, but we need help as well: designers.\nGood financial design is more than just pretty pictures, though. It's about providing a clear and legible communication which aims to inform, educate, persuade and finally sell. This must be done in a space-efficient way so that the reader can easily see the key message.\nIt's also important to use text which is unambiguous - words which clearly say what consumers need to hear. For instance, if a company wants to advertise a personal pension, they need to make a point of this.\nFinancial and pension providers have tried every device to get through to consumers. The problem is that in the rush to get more information into the public domain, the message gets diluted and confused. The more messages, the more likely it is that the consumer will simply switch off.\nAll this means that more and more design and creative agencies are trying to give clients a better understanding of what their target consumers are thinking. One example is J. Walter Thompson, which has created a new range of strategic services called T.I.B.I.P.\n\"Money matters,\" said J. Walter Thompson, \"and people are not very money orientated. At the end of the day it's a simple equation: you save, you have money on hand when you need it, then you buy.\"\nJ. Walter Thompson also believes that in order to win the consumer's trust, the industry needs to engage them in a meaningful dialogue. But the problem is that there is a barrier of distrust.\nThe financial industry needs to be more direct. Advertisers also need to take a more structured and systematic way of approaching design. This is because it's no longer enough to present a nice looking brochure or leaflet in a shop. This is not enough to create a personal relationship with a consumer.\nThe financial industry needs to be more direct. In order to win the consumer's trust, advertisers need to engage them in a meaningful dialogue.\nThe aim needs to be focused: what do people need and when do they need it?\nAs the UK government report on financial services clearly outlines, the industry has the basic problem of being too secretive. This means that there is an information gap: one side has all the information, but the other side needs it to make an educated decision.\n\"You have to ask yourself,\" said J. Walter Thompson, \"why we have this problem? I think it's because financial products have traditionally been complex - the products weren't designed right for the consumer.\n\"That's one of the problems facing the industry - and why they're having so many problems today because of the collapse of the markets. People are confused, they've been duped, they're fed up.\"\nThe question is how do we re-educate the consumer and get an open dialogue going? From my experience working inside the financial industry for many years, including with major banks and life assurance companies, it's quite difficult to change the way we relate to the consumer.\nThe banking and financial services industry is built, as far as I can see, on three fundamental principles: secrecy, de-humanisation and non-engagement.\nDealing with money is so important that the world of finance is shrouded in secrecy. The only people you talk to about investing and spending are the ones employed to sell you something.\nIf you make a deposit or buy a mutual fund, the only person you ever get to know is your bank manager or the person at the fund management", "This document contains proposed information collections.

The FDIC is proposing to make minor changes to the collection in order to update and improve the reporting and information requirements.\nThe FDIC is responsible for maintaining a minimum reserve level which provides the resources needed to insure deposit accounts for which insurance funds might be demanded. The Intra-Bank Deposit Sweep (IBDS) program, administered by the FDIC, allows the FDIC to acquire funds in the event that the deposit insurance fund (DIF) assets fall short of the required level. A bank that is experiencing difficulty meeting its reserve requirements may enter into an agreement with the FDIC to temporarily sell and/or pledge securities to the FDIC in return for DIF funds. As a result, the bank is able to continue providing deposit services to its customers and does not face a disruption in its lending operations. The IBDS permits the FDIC to receive securities that are equivalent to reserves and provides the bank with a greater opportunity to continue providing the lending services that its customers expect. The collection of data is required in order to comply with the agreement under the IBDS and is subject to the terms and conditions contained in the agreement. Additionally, the collection of data is used to determine whether a bank is able to meet the reserve requirements as specified in its IBDS agreement.\nBillions of dollars are swept each day using the IBDS and there are approximately 800 IBDS agreements in effect with commercial banks. The IBDS program provides the FDIC with the ability to fund DIF shortfalls when institutions are experiencing temporary shortfalls in DIF reserves. Additionally, the IBDS program allows these institutions to quickly repay borrowings upon improved reserve levels.\nThe proposed IBDS information collection will consist of the following sections: 1.

Or if the editor is asked to edit that article on the editorial page?\nOr if the editor is asked to edit a story about the former editor of the paper, who had recently retired after a distinguished career with that newspaper? The former editor is the editor in question, and in our story he is interviewed by an up-and-coming reporter on the evening of the retiree\u2019s last day on the job.\nThen comes the punch line in question: If the editor is both the subject of the interview and at the same time an editor on the editorial page to which the story will be sent, how should he handle the copy coming out of the reporter\u2019s hands for that particular story?\nI think of our story as being about the editorial page. But I think of the reporter\u2019s story as being about me. The reporter had spent the day interviewing several key players in the eventful career of our paper\u2019s former executive editor. What she produced was an excellent piece of journalism. She had put together a nicely written story that told it the way it was.\nThe only problem was that she had told it from the reporter\u2019s point of view. As a matter of fact, I had gone to lunch with the reporter, whom I liked and admired. I\u2019d enjoyed the interview and the story she turned in was about a fine man who had made important contributions to the world of newspapering and deserved wider recognition. But all she reported about the man was what came out of her own mouth. She did not go out of her way to get the subject\u2019s unvarnished commentary about his life at that newspaper in which he worked for so many years.\nMy take was, she didn\u2019t have to. She was a good reporter. She knew the drill. She didn\u2019t mess with such important stuff. My sense was, though, she didn\u2019t go beyond what she knew she should, and that in itself was journalism, too.\nI\u2019ve made a living out of writing my own stuff all my life. That is a good way to do it, the old way. Sometimes I have done that way, too. It is the time-honored way. After all, journalism is an art, like photography or music or painting with colors or words. Each of those is what it is, but no two of them are exactly alike in its particular manifestation.\nIn newspapering, there are many more ways to do journalism. It is not always necessary to put words on paper.\nThere\u2019s a way of doing it that doesn\u2019t require the use of the letter \u201cO\u201d when you can do without it and do a story as adequate as can be.\nI have spent most of my professional life as an editor, as a reporter, as a news writer, as an associate editor, an assistant editor, a senior assistant editor, an editorial assistant, an assistant editorial page editor, and a news-side editor of one kind or another, all that plus a special assistant to the managing editor, one of the most powerful people in the place except for him, a writer, story editor, headline-writer, reporter, editorialist, and columnist: I have been and am all of those things.\nI am now about to be a person no longer on the newspaper\u2019s staff.\nBesides all of that, I am also the person who runs the editorial side of the paper, on which you\u2019ll be reading an editorial now and then. I run the news-side side of the editorial page, too, although not the editorial part of the newspaper.\nBut all those many jobs don\u2019t necessarily make someone an expert or an \u201cexpert,\u201d as the story in question reported I may be coming to think of myself. The paper has many other folks running several of the other sections of the newspaper, as the story\u2019s reporter, I imagine, found out.\nEvidently, an editor is like a teacher: If that is what you want to think of yourself, go ahead. Everyone", "How can we transform the print content landscape into the local content world to make it the central feature of our business?\n1. It was clear that consumers were becoming more immersed in our content with the growing popularity of smartphones, tablets and PCs. But how did this reality change what needed to be done to keep people reading our websites regularly?\n2. As a journalist, part of my job is to make sure that our clients in the business world stay up to date with what\u2019s going on in their industry. But I had a good feeling that there was something more that we needed to be doing to help our customers stay informed about their local communities. Could we transform the print content landscape into the local content world to make it the central feature of our business?\n3. This would work for both print as well as digital.\n4. The digital content space was still developing and undergoing tremendous change as it tried to adapt to the new digital reality.\n5. In order to grow revenue, we needed to start working hand in hand with the print content space, including newspapers, free sheets, magazines and catalogs; this would open up opportunities to use content across multiple platforms for maximum impact.\n6. But what were journalists who were more specialized in print content going to think about this new world of working across multiple media platforms?\n7. This is still a highly specialized job, and it took time for journalists to get used to the idea that they might have to do something they were used to avoiding, like writing headlines.\n8. But I could tell that our journalists were really starting to embrace this idea, and I wanted to keep pushing the envelope and experimenting with our products in order to maximize the impact that content could have.\n9. Now, when I go to work in the morning, I like to be sure that I know what to do. Not only am I the editor for a local, print weekly newspaper, I\u2019ve also been appointed as the community content coordinator.\n10. Our new editor wanted to ensure that the news and other community-related features in our paper were available online with an eye towards improving our online readership.\n11. One of my new goals would be to expand our digital presence by creating content from the community through the newspaper, as well as through social media and partnerships with other websites.\n12 One example would be the social media partnership we\u2019ve created with the local radio station. This partnership includes sharing content from the radio and newspaper blogs in order to reach a larger, more interconnected audience.\n13. One area in which our print publications have always been very popular is in the areas of entertainment and sports.\n14. Through our entertainment blog, we try to let readers know what\u2019s going on at the nearby movie theater or local theater. We also keep them informed about the different plays and shows in the area, as well as the events that support the arts in our community.\n15. For sporting events, such as hockey or baseball games, our sports blog focuses on both the scores and the stories behind the games. Whether it is highlighting a player\u2019s amazing ability to return to the ice once again after an injury or an article discussing how the team managed to overcome adversity, we want to take an in- depth look at what makes our local teams so special in our blog posts.\n16. The print content space is where real writers can shine.\n17. I was the editor for a local, print weekly newspaper, but that didn\u2019t mean I had to write headline after headline myself. My job is to make sure that these great writers can focus on writing the articles that will have real, lasting power.\n18. In a digital world that is ruled by quick, snappy blog posts, I understand I might feel the need to write a quick headline in order to connect with a reader before he or she moves on to click the next link. But I was now the community content coordinator \u2013 we needed to take the time to consider what would be the right headlines to generate the right kind of response from our readers.\n19. We had to start thinking on deeper levels.\n20. The digital space is where consumers can find out information 24/7. This is one of the reasons why they are so willing to use a search engine over traditional sources such as a phone book, newspaper or a TV guide.\n21. But if a consumer can get information fast through our websites, we also needed to create compelling content that would push them to stick with our site on a regular basis.\n22. But if consumers feel like they are getting the same level of content with our company that they would get with others,", "The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)\ninadvertently failed to include a proposed definition of the term\n``priority mail'' for purposes of 39 U.S.C. 3622(b).

And, therefore, you need a platform that understands what the new generation of stories is going to be.\u201d\nHe added that newspapers \u201chave to start to get clever about the way in which we package the kind of work that we\u2019re doing for print and make it work for the web.\u201d This is where we are right now with The New York Times.\nAs much as print is the original news platform, it\u2019s also a medium that\u2019s changing and adapting to new ways of engaging audiences. The problem with the industry is that print advertising has been declining for decades, but we don\u2019t know when print will no longer be essential, according to The Guardian article. The industry needs a way to continue to get value from print beyond the news in the morning.\nAdvertiser-supported print platforms are a dying beast as the industry has shifted the bulk of spending to digital. According to eMarketer, digital\u2019s share of total ad spending will account for 57% in 2017, compared to its 42% share in 2012. By 2021, eMarketer estimates that digital will account for 63% of total ad spending. As much as 61.5% of the global ad spend in that year will go toward digital, including mobile and desktop.\nThe traditional news media needs to innovate to adapt and stay relevant to print audiences. The Guardian says print can thrive with advertising dollars only if it continues to innovate, and it can take its lead from The New York Times Co.\n\u201cIf the world is going to spend more than $1 million a page for a marketing initiative, then something in the market needs to take advantage of it,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd that something is the Times and other newspapers in general.\u201d\nHe said that his company will find a way to make a print product work despite the fact the market is going digital. It will keep print going until it\u2019s irrelevant and make it thrive.\nNews media could even incorporate 3D printing of products into the mix, according to a blog post by Daniel Cukier, writing for Media Post.\nThe newspaper industry has seen a resurgence in readership as more people are turning to news sources to find all the news.

I have taken a trip to the\nCaribbean, trekked through Africa and enjoyed the hustle and bustle\nof New York. The key word here is opportunity.\nWhile on holiday last summer, I took the chance to sit up and\nwatch TV -- for once without thinking I will get it on the News\nChannel tomorrow -- and came across a program which highlighted how\nwomen are paid 12% less than men doing the same job. After\nwatching this with my mouth open and a shocked look, I realized\nI was just another statistic.\nSo this made me think. Why should we be earning 12% less in an\nindependent job and writing amazing stories? This made me think\nthis cannot be true. With this in mind, I knew I just had to get\ninto that situation.\nI had never really thought about writing for the News Channel\n(NTV) because it just seemed like a channel that you watch after\nthe news is over, so when I got home I started looking for some\ncompanies that will pay you.\nThen it hit me, not only had I been writing for NTV for years,\nbut I could be getting paid for it too. Just as the phone rang\nwith a colleague on the end saying we needed an article, I knew\nI\u2019d hit the jackpot.\nSo, I came back from holiday, dug out my old piece of paper\nwhere i wrote down all of my ideas, and I wrote down \"short\nstories\" to make money.

He explained what he was looking for, and\neven said he loved the creative side of my writing. I wrote back\nand emailed him a selection of ideas.

No other\njournalist ever thinks of getting paid to write.\nBut with the ideas coming into my head so quickly it wasn\u2019t long\nbefore I had another story put in front of me and paid that week.\nBy this time, I was working alongside the deputy head of\nmarketing for my publication and a few weeks later wrote my\nstory: \"Taking on the world at 17.\"\nAs well as being written in a different style, it took a\nwhole new angle.

OFRHP will establish ACO demonstration projects to deliver healthcare through PCP-Medical Home models. ACO demonstration projects will be established for up to 5 years, beginning in calendar year 2012 for the first ACO demonstration projects. A full announcement of this opportunity can be accessed at http://grants.hrsa.gov/2011/data/paperforms.asp#117P-10818. Applications received after the established deadline will not be accepted for the opportunity announcement.\nFORHP strongly encourages health care providers to contact the primary contacts listed at the end of each Demonstration Project description below to obtain additional information about individual proposals. The application for the opportunity may be obtained and downloaded from the http://grants.hrsa.gov, at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) website at http://http://grants.hrsa.gov, or ordered from the FORHP contact listed at the end of each Demonstration Project description below. This is a cooperative agreement award which will provide for project management support and monitoring, as well as training and technical assistance support. Additional details are provided in the full announcement of the opportunity, which may be accessed at http://http://grants.hrsa.gov, or requested through the FORHP contact listed at the end of each Demonstration Project description below.\nI. Program Purpose:\nThe purpose of the ACO Demonstration Projects is to provide primary care healthcare in a PCMH via an ACO model. The Demonstration Projects will be developed in two phases. During the first phase (calendar years 2012\u20132013), Demonstration Project applicants shall develop PCMHs that apply to participate in the Demonstration Projects, including the designation of the proposed contract vehicles; implementation of the inter-professional provider team's ability to provide patient and population-based care; and development of a population-based health information system (PHIS) to support continuous quality improvement activities under a coordinated ACO model integrated with other relevant quality improvement entities. During the second phase, Demonstration Project participants will develop ACO contract vehicles that will provide incentives to health care providers for the provision of high quality, and high value, integrated primary care services using the PCMH model. Demonstration Project participants will demonstrate increased quality of care over benchmarks and cost efficiencies over benchmarks that are sustainable beyond Phase I of the Demonstration Project. Demonstration projects are intended to begin no earlier than January 1, 2012.\nII. AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE:\nThe FORHP expects to award up to $10,000,000 in grant funds during Phase I to develop and build PCMHs. This grant amount has been established based on anticipated funding availability based on enacted appropriations of FY 2011 funding for HRSA programs. The anticipated FY 2012 amount for each Phase I project is the projected Federal share of the combined development and implementation amounts of $40,000,000 per project.\nEach Demonstration Project shall include a total development and implementation budget of at least $12,000,000 in both of the Phases I and II. Each full Demonstration Project application must develop a full, itemized budget based upon a full implementation budget of at least $40,000,000 over the two-year period. This amount represents each Demonstration Project phase and each Demonstration Project's estimated cost over the 2-year period (based on a 3-year implementation period). The Demonstration Project's estimated cost must be based on full costs of developing and implementing the Demonstration Project to deliver high-quality, coordinated, and team-based care. FORHP strongly encourages applicants to propose a budget for the full implementation period of each Demonstration Project (Phase II). In addition to this application, applicants must submit a separate budget for each Demonstration Project (Phase I and Phase II, as appropriate per application), to be in", "In response to a question from an audience member, the Board was informed about how the new state law changed school funding.\nMr. Miller reported the following:\n\u00b7 Attendance was low (approximately 90/99) last evening at the presentation about the NECAP testing, partly due to the weather (and low temperatures).\n\u00b7 The new state law requires the state DOE to change the way it funds schools. There should be more funding for the elementary and middle schools and less for high schools. The superintendent indicated that the funding for high schools could be significantly reduced (depending upon how the state decides to adjust school budgets for the different school levels). He explained that there is likely to be a lot of negotiation over the next two years over how this funding change will be implemented (and who gets what and when). The district superintendent has already notified the state DOE and the state has stated that the new model must be in place within the next two years (by 2013). The school board will address this issue on an annual basis starting in February.\nMr. Rice moved that the minutes of the Board of Education meeting of April 15, 2010 be approved as written. Mr. McNamara seconded the motion. Motion carried unanimously.\nThe Board has an opening in this committee. The meeting dates and times are usually on the third Monday of each month at 5:30 p.m. \u2013 usually the first third Monday meeting of the month. The next meeting will be April 20, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.\n1. Student Government Association will address the Board at the next meeting. Ms. Gould asked the Board whether it would be appropriate to allow the SGA to bring a guest representative. Mr. Rice suggested, and the Board agreed, that the SGA bring a guest representative from Bow. Mr. Rice also suggested that the SGA representatives from North Country meet with Mrs. Allen, Ms. Gould, and Mr. DeWolfe to discuss North Country SGA business.\n2. The Board has been very impressed with the North Country Student Government Association. The Board commended the student representatives and the two faculty/staff representatives for their accomplishments.\n3. The SGA will be selling T-shirts as well as bracelets that are blue and yellow on April 20th at Bow High School for $8.00. All profits will be donated to North Country Animal Shelter.\n4. The SGA will hold the Bow High School\u2019s second blood drive with the American Red Cross on April 30, 2010 between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.\n1.

The internet's\ninfinite capacity for disseminating information in different formats\nincluding audio, video and\nmultimedia, makes it the best medium for the dissemination of\nthe latest news, weather, sports, entertainment and so forth. This\nmedium of distribution was\npreviously accessible only to professionals -- journalists,\njournalists, photographers,\nfilmmakers or anyone else with at least the slightest degree of\ntechnical expertise and\nexpertise. The new medium that offers this infinite space for\ninformation and its\nendless opportunities for creativity is what Internet users and the\nInternet's information\nbusinesses call the web.\nThe web is a two-way interactive medium in which information circulates\nback and\nforth between sender and receiver -- between the news consumer and\njournalist or\nother professional author.\nThis medium offers a unique opportunity for the free-flow and exchange\nof information and to\nexchange experiences and opinions with a wider public. This will\nrevolutionize our\nworld and our concepts of information and knowledge, as\nexperts. What\nwill remain inviolate will be the professionalism of our journalists\njournalists,\nthose who carry out the news on the web and those who distribute\ninformation through\ntheir traditional means.\nMIC has already launched a project to distribute our publications and\nnews through\nthe internet. What is our concept as publishers of MIC News and of\nMIC Weekly?\nOur aim as far as the public is concerned is that our traditional\njournalism, that of the printed press, will go the same way in the\nnet as it has gone to the tunnels and underground passages in\nJerusalem and in the past, we were not afraid of being\nunderground to make a report or a\nfilm, this is so 1967! Today, we are also not afraid of being web or\ninternet site,\nwhich is the new underground, and we will do with our website in the\nsame way as we do with our\nnewspaper and journal.\nAs far as we are concerned, every issue that goes online will be\nonline as an important\npublication and the newspaper or journal will be a printed edition only\nThe printed edition will be the main one used by a large part of our\nreaders, but the\ninternet edition of the newspaper will be considered a new edition\nand a new\nseries of the main publication.\nOur policy regarding the internet as an information medium, also\nincludes a\nnew and important step towards strengthening our relationship with\ninternet public and turning the\naudience as a participant in the distribution of information. This\nis the basic\nconcept of media that is not afraid of going the public way, of\nturning its\naudience from passive receiver to the sender of information. The\naudiences are at the heart\nof the internet publishing venture and are the basis of the public\nservice venture\nof MIC News and MIC Weekly.\nThe internet will be the public service information centre of MIC News\nand MIC Weekly. It\nwill be the new and updated version of the internet site of MIC. It\nwill be the site with\nthe real time news of MIC and the real time public opinion of the\nIsraeli and global public opinion - a site where our readers and the\nother public will be\nable to post and publish their comments and ideas.\nAs the real-time information centre of our newspaper, radio and\nwebsites, it will host the\nlatest news and commentary, with a particular focus on the media,\nfilm and music news and\ndevelopment. It might have to do away with some of the more\ntraditional media news\nto concentrate on the more dynamic parts of its reporting -- media\nindustry news, media\ndevelopments and culture, entertainment and creative industries.\nSoon, there will be a real time monitoring of all social and\npolitical comments by our readers and the other public to add a\nunique dynamic to our website, to link our readers and the public in\na new and wider circle of\ndiscussion and debate, a dynamic circle that will, we hope, be an\nimportant part of the\nMIC's contribution to the local and global media, culture and\ninformation scene.", "A study by BuzzFeed found the New York Times\u2018 journalism was more trusted than Facebook. BuzzFeed used its own proprietary and public tools to measure both trust and relevance. There was a notable difference between the two metrics, but also a connection between the two.\nThese findings speak to an often-held public belief about journalism: It is inherently trusted, meaning it cannot be disastrously misread. This report, compiled with the help of the University of Pennsylvania and the Reuters Institute, is meant to add evidence to this belief, and it will likely also provide news publishers a way to measure and, in some ways, recalibrate their journalism approach in order to better compete against and appeal to a new generation of consumers.\nIf journalists know their content is trusted, then they will do what it takes to write and publish it.\n\u201cIf consumers trust news and information, they are more likely to have an ongoing relationship with journalists and brands. At the same time, consumers who trust businesses are willing to spend more time reading news and information about brands,\u201d the report stated. So, if journalists know their content is trusted, then they will do what it takes to write and publish it.\nThis includes the traditional tenets of reporting: verification, accuracy, and factual reporting, but also a new way of thinking about trust in the digital world.\nThe report breaks down the difference between perceived relevance and actual trust. Those who read journalism and deem it trustworthy also want to be informed and educated, which means journalists should focus on delivering information that will answer the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how\u201d questions. Readers want their time to matter.\nAbove all else, trusted journalism should focus on delivering clear and coherent messages, using a journalistic approach \u2014 facts, verification, context, and authority.\nThis is where the real impact of the Internet comes into play. The Internet has a notoriously fickle public who are prone to hopping onto the next big news fad. To be successful, news organisations need to be a constant in readers\u2019 lives, and the report emphasizes that this is directly related to trust in their work.\nThis is something that news publishers need to put into action, both on an organisational level to create a unified branding and vision, but also at a story level. Audiences will be more receptive to long-form journalism if they know it is part of a trustworthy news source.\nHowever, the focus should also extend to audiences\u2019 own online behaviours and news consumption patterns. When users are looking for trustworthy information, they are looking for clear labels associated with that information, including but not limited to: news, trustworthy, authoritative, and verified. These labels and terms will help them decide what information to consume and what to dismiss as nonsense.\nUsers are looking for clear labels associated with news such as \u2018news, trustworthy, authoritative, and verified.\u2019\nA lack of trustworthy or quality content labels on the Internet has led users to develop their own strategies to figure out which information they will read, which they will not, and what they will share and what they will not, which means news publishers need to be on the front line helping those strategies develop.\nThe report stated one of the major problems with measuring trust was a lack of a common definition, so it looked directly at what users associated with the word \u201ctrust\u201d and what they did not associate with it.\nThere were five characteristics the researchers found were not associated with trust:\n\u201cWords associated with risk, fear, uncertainty, and doubt help explain why trust might be a better predictor of attention \u2013 or interest \u2013 than quality, relevance, or truth,\u201d the report states.\nIn the same way, the report found three common labels or definitions associated with trust as identified by the study\u2019s participants. All of these definitions came with a common thread: trust was associated with the user being able to identify something that was authoritative, trustworthy, and of high quality, and to recognise or understand it did not have an agenda.\nThe three words that were most associated with the idea of trust and what drives people to consume information from a particular source were:\nRelevance: When something is aligned with a user\u2019s individual interests, information consumption will be more likely. Interest, in turn, creates relevance. For example: When a user\u2019s Facebook friends start reposting BuzzFeed videos to their feeds, they are more likely to actually head to and check out the site.\nAuthority: The study concluded authority was important for people when gauging whether they trust a source.

Calio is Chairman of the Council\non Environmental Quality. I am deeply honoured\nto have been asked to address you\nand to share with you my thoughts on the progress\nmade by the Administration in the environmental\narea during the first term under this Presidential\nMr. Calio. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,\nand thank you very much for this opportunity to\nspeak to you at this annual conference.\nLet me first say how pleased I am that this\nyear you chose as your topic that on which any\nenvironmental policy must eventually be judged\n- environmental protection. Environmental protection, indeed, all other\nissues in our field, have to meet some\nprerequisites in order to get the kind of attention\nthey deserve. In my view, what you should\nalways look for first are the needs, for in a\ndemocracy like ours, every issue is judged by\nits merits but must ultimately be measured by\nI believe strongly that government should\nbe driven by the needs of the people. This\ngoverning philosophy is the very foundation of the Council on Environmental Quality,\nwhich I have the privilege of chairing. At the\nCouncil, the fundamental job we face is to identify\nthe environmental needs that, in the national\ninterest, the government must meet.\nBefore we can address any of these needs,\nwe first must ask ourselves whether the American\npeople themselves will allow us to do so. Only\nwhen we believe that we can fulfil any\nparticular need in their name can we, as a\npublic servant, set about identifying the\nproblems and proposing solutions. If, after\na comprehensive national debate, the American\npeople determine in the clearest terms possible,\nby electing their political and social leaders,\nthat they in fact do not require protection\non some particular issue, then we have no\nright to pursue the effort.\nThat, to me, is the heart of environmental govern- ing in a\ndemocracy. It must be driven by\nthe needs of the people - not only\nare we mandated to do only those things\nthat the American people want; they\nmust feel obligated to support both the\nprocess of decision making\nand the outcome of that process as\nsoon as it is carried out in their name.\nIf we have properly served the needs of\nthe people and those people have approved\nand ratified government action on some\nparticular issue, then we have fulfilled our\nmandate. From that point on, the American\npeople should feel obliged to support\nthe results of that decision-making process.\nI believe firmly that this philosophy should\napply to environmental work and is indeed\nthe cornerstone on which the entire edifice\nof modern environmental policy has been\nbuilt in this country. The fact is that all of\nthe great environmental breakthroughs\nwe have had have emerged directly\nfrom public demands, whether those\ndemands emerged from individual\nconcerns, community protest, or\nnationwide public movements.\nThe foundations of environmental progress\nwill always come from public demands,\nand it is imperative that government\nnot forget those basic truths in\ntheir own environmental policies.\nIt is clear that environmental needs\ndo not remain static over time, and it\nis in the national interest that govern-\nment respond to new information\nand new demands. In 1980, the\npeople were very concerned with air\npollution and toxic substances. By\n1984, that was no longer a priority,\nand the American public turned to\ninvasive species, wetlands, and\ncoastal development. Through all\nthese changes in public focus,\nhowever, many environmental\nneeds remained constant, such as our\nneed to protect endangered and\nthreatened species, and our need to\nprovide Americans with open space\nwhere they could enjoy the beauty of\nnature or engage in passive recreation..\nThat is why there is a National Park system, a National\nFor", "THE FUTURE\nThe year is 1952. A new scientific theory is being proposed, one that will upset the existing framework of modern physics completely. If proved correct, this theory will radically change the way we view the universe.\nThe paper is read by some of the physicists of the world. Many of them write back questioning the theories in the paper. The authors get together and write a response clarifying and expanding upon their initial theory. They then write a new draft, which clarifies their theory further, and send it to the community.\nThe response is written back and forth for two months. Finally, a consensus emerges, and a formal paper is put forward, written and written down exactly as the proposed theory outlines.\nAfter two years, a second theory, supporting the principles of the first, is put forward by a new group of physicists. The physics community is once again caught in a flurry of activity, with everyone trying to decide which theory is the \"right\" one.\nThe papers from the original group are sent to every reputable journal known in the physics field. Each journal is inundated with new papers, and many of them will be rejected because they were sent after the second draft. Each individual paper is attacked from all sides. The theories are criticized, the mathematics is attacked, and, more importantly, the conclusions are questioned.\nAfter six months, both groups agree not to write anymore. The community is now caught in a state where it is not clear what will happen. There is a standoff. It will continue until either someone concedes, or someone dies . . .\n10 years later, an interesting discovery is made, and both groups are forced to admit that they are not \"right.\" In fact, it has been made clear that both groups were wrong! A new theory is put forward that will resolve, once and for all, the questions that the original theory could not. Some physicists now find themselves wondering how _that_ theory can explain a certain mystery . . .\n100 years later, one of the men who wrote the second theory, 100 years dead, is called a genius by new generations of scientists. 500 years later, a descendant of the second theory's author is also called a genius by new generations of scientists.\n600 years later, the first theory's author and some of her students are honored as the \"founders of modern physics,\" while the current theory that was proposed 200 years before is not even mentioned.\nA thousand years later, several generations of physicists have debated why the original theory's founder is not mentioned:  She didn't follow the \"normal\" methods!\n   THE  \nELEMENTS\nThe elements are the basic building blocks of all matter. There are sixty in a total mass of 92 elements, all of which occur naturally.\nSome of them occur very commonly, and form most of the world around us. Others occur so rarely that it would be difficult to find, say, rhodium in your backyard.\nThere are sixty-three naturally occurring isotopes in the total mass of the world's elements. Three of them are radioactive, which means that they undergo a change in their state as time passes. The rest of the isotopes are stable.\nSome elements have more than one isotope, so all of the sixty-three that are found in the world occur in more than one form. To make them easy to understand, they are all grouped in a series of 18, which includes all of the main isotopes. The series goes something like this:\n  **#1** | Beryllium | Two isotopes  \n---|---|---  \n  **#2** | Boron 1 (B1) | Two isotopes  \nB5  \nB10  \n  **#3** | Boron 2 (B2) | Two isotopes  \nB12  \nB13  \n  **#4** | Carbon | Two isotopes  \nC2  \nC2,1 (d)\nIf you look at the numbers between parentheses, you will find the atomic numbers, which are used to determine which element in a series isotope should come next. For example, boron number 10, which has the symbol B10, is actually 10 below number 10 on the periodic table.\nThe difference between the two series of isotopes are the numbers in the parentheses, which represents the amount of neutrons in the nucleus. If the difference is a single digit, the element is stable (", "The Commission extends the license term for the    radio      stations    at    Memphis,        Tennessee to      August      26,  2011,    and adopts special terms and conditions applicable to the    license as modification of its action in Order on Reconsideration  11-266 to enable the licensee to reorganize.\nDATE:    September      26,   2001\nThe applications for new  station.", "Media24, South Africa's only truly national broadsheet media company, has released its", "The Commission makes technical corrections in Parts 60 and 100 regulations, which govern the permitting of hydroelectric developments.

GENERALIZED THREE DIMENSIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING\nSeveral methods for obtaining accurate plutonium measurements\nfrom samples in the actinide laboratory have now been described.\nThe  measurement procedures reported here were developed for a  mass\nspectrometer which makes use of the isotopic ratios to plutonium,\nneptunium, americium, and curium to determine plutonium. These\nresults and others previously reported in this journal will allow a\ntechnician to measure plutonium content with an accuracy better than\n0.3 to 0.5%. In the past a variety of methods have been proposed to\ndetermine plutonium contents  from samples, in contrast to the other\ntransuranic isotopes this method has produced results which are\nextremely sensitive to the activity of the sample. A general description\nwas given in March, 1958, to the technique of using silver to detect\nplutonium. In the May, 1959, JOURNAL, we described a method for  measuring\nthe plutonium, neptunium, and americium activities in samples which\nrequires only a simple  burned silver overcoat, an emulsion which has\nbeen developed in house and the analysis by a mass spectrometer.\nPlutonium and neptunium measurements are made with special\ncameras and americium  with a general-purpose camera.\nAn important  consideration in the use of this technique is the\nneed  to develop a method for obtaining  reproducible  photographic\nresults.  Thus in several  experiments  we will describe  in this\nreport  the  method  and results  of  an analysis of  the  photographic\ntroubleshooting and techniques.\nA description has been made of the use of a 1' by 1' emulsion\nfilm  which,  when exposed to  a high energy photon,  yields an\nisodensity distribution which  can be used  in a calibration curve\nto determine the number of  photons which have  been converted to\nan isodensity band in the emulsion.  The  result gives  the\namount of  radiation in that band after the film has been  subjected\nto various  photon energies before it is", "GPS is an important asset for publishers who want to be mobile first. Publishers can use GPS to offer more location-based services, like location-targeted ads and sponsored content, says GPS-focused advertising platform Placed.\nBENEFITS: More and more consumers use location technologies, such as GNSS, to find local businesses and services. Publishers who use data from GPS can better support their mobile advertising channels as well as the quality of their content.\nPUBLISHER RISKS: Some publishers worry about privacy issues associated with GPS and other geolocation technologies. In the past decade, many US and international laws have been passed to require companies to obtain permission from users before being able to use location data they collect. However, these laws have not yet affected publishers\u2019 practices in a significant way.\nVENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING: Digital location data company Placed has raised US$21 million in Series B. Series A funding is about US$12 million.\nPublishers interested in using tools such as Placed to gather and manage GPS data should reach out to the startup to find the best fit for their needs. Some publishers have their own location-focused advertising platforms that serve ads based on GPS locations as well.\nPREDICTIONS: Publishers may want to look for products that allow them to make location-based decisions. GPS provides more visibility on how publishers can reach their audience.", "A 5G New Radio deployment with a 5G signal in a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario has been the subject of much controversy that has highlighted many concerns of the residents living in that neighbourhood. One of those concerns was the potential to cause adverse health effects, particularly on children as a result of microwave radiation exposure. The 4G/LTE technology that was deployed by the carrier that ran the equipment is known to cause a range of health impacts, although the same carrier (and other carriers) claimed that the exposure was far lower than that of a microwave oven. A new residential neighbourhood in Mississauga, Ontario, with 5G equipment installed by a different carrier, has been the source of more recent controversy, as more residents became concerned that they might soon experience some of the negative health effects that some residents living next to the 5G installation in Toronto has reported. This report considers the exposure of the residents in Mississauga on 5G signals, as well as other sources of exposure. Some of the residents complained of microwave poisoning symptoms, but more prevalent were the reported effects of the exposure on the health of the children in the neighbourhood. The resident complaints were investigated by an acupuncturist who lives next to the 5G installation. By the time the acupuncturist completed his work, he had interviewed 11 people in the neighbourhood with information provided on 58 children that were experiencing problems including microwave sickness, insomnia and other symptoms. In the course of his research, the acupuncturist visited one of the residents, Mr. Chris, who had developed a severe allergic reaction as a response to his 5G exposure, described at great length in the interview included in the report. At the conclusion of his investigation, the acupuncturist concluded that 5G was detrimental to health and recommended that the current 5G roll-out be halted while more investigation is conducted and that the government develop a system that will allow the residents of Canada to be notified of the locations of all 5G installations.

These criteria ensure such materials do not pose a significantly greater risk to the commuting public than other modes of transportation under the Federal Public Transportation Safety Program.\nPHMSA was not able to publish a notice of the new regulation in the Federal Register before the December 6, 2011 target date because the rule was not complete and had not been sent for a review by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences. It still has not been sent for a review by the Transportation Research Board. PHMSA was able to make other regulatory and policy improvements and did publish these changes in the Federal Register on or about December 19, 2011. These changes are reflected in the rule published in the Federal Register at 76 FR 79919 on December 19, 2011.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The rule being published for amendment is found at 68 FR 62192 (November 18, 2003). PHMSA, which then had the name of Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), published a final rule modifying the FTA's Hazardous Materials Regulations to implement certain new criteria for the placement of hazardous materials (hazmat) onboard buses and other modes of public transportation, including school buses and shuttle buses. A copy of the Federal Register entry can be found on the Internet at http://www.regulations.gov. PHMSA's proposed regulatory language is in the DOT docket HM 239E at http://www.regulations.gov. This new criteria, which was effective in May of 2003, was the first revision of these regulations that was developed over a period of seven years since 1995 with input from industry (e.g., bus and transit manufacturers, transit operators, hazmat shippers, highway safety organizations and emergency responders). The primary purpose of the rule was to eliminate a substantial risk of injury associated with the transportation of hazmat in passenger vehichles. The new hazmat standards went into effect nationwide and apply to all modes of public transportation, including buses, rail transit and paratransit buses, shuttle buses, limousine and taxicab vehicles and school buses. This rulemaking also amends the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, 300 Ill. Compo. Stat. 205/3, et seq. (1985).\nPHMSA is making these regulatory corrections in response to a request received in the docket.", "The old-timey west isn't what a man remembers it to be.

This is a big concern for all media, especially with news about ad fraud surfacing constantly in the popular media.\nThe truth is that media companies are not measuring value. We are counting what we can measure. And as the industry and its measurement structures grow, brands will make an effort to ensure everything they pay for is worth it.\nEven the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), which has developed a self-regulation body in the US, seems to have accepted the metrics created by the industry \u2014 and that have been created by those companies that measure them \u2014 rather than working towards ensuring they are better and clearer for all.\nMeasurement systems must adapt to the changes caused by new uses of traditional media, or the industry will find itself in an isolated, isolated position.\nFor media buyers, metrics must be an essential part of planning the campaign\u2019s delivery, with a particular focus on the value of brand equity. To understand how they work, we need to return to the basic elements of integrated communication and the roles of advertising as a source of information for end-users.\nMarketers and advertising agencies have long recognised that advertising is one component of an integrated communication strategy, where several methods of the communication process come together to produce a desired impact on the audience.\nAs a result, brands should measure and report whether an article is seen by users or if the advertising is seen in a context related to the information that users are looking for \u2014 an editorial page in a newspaper. Or if a video shows before reaching the content. In short, they should measure exposure to contextual content or brand messages, a clear indication that a campaign has worked and that the brand is relevant to consumers who have previously showed an interest.\nConsumer reactions and intentions are a key factor in determining ROI for brands. Measurement systems for advertising, such as viewability or audience analytics, should be able to inform both short- and long-term ROI and influence brand sales \u2014 a factor that has been overlooked.\nMarketers and advertising agencies have long recognised that advertising is one component of an integrated communication strategy, where several methods of the communication process come together to produce a desired impact on the audience.\nMedia has evolved from a physical product that was limited to only a few brands to a more complex and competitive environment. For consumers, it is now possible to interact with media, which increases the complexity for the brand.\nTo achieve success, brands need to identify ways to connect with users based on context and relevance, and to measure that success.\nAs a consequence, this complex and competitive environment can benefit from a metric that is tied to real context and relevance. It\u2019s time to go beyond counting the number of times an ad is seen to measuring its impact, and to look for new metrics that can help achieve results for the advertiser and the audience.\nToday, consumers have more devices to which they can access mobile and digital content than ever. Media consumption has also changed, leading to a shift in the viewing habits of audiences on the couch or on the go.\nThis has created a need for a new metric, especially in light of the increased relevance of branding as a marketing strategy.\nThese new metrics are important for advertisers, because they allow them to measure the results of advertising campaigns, the effectiveness of branding strategies and their performance in relation to the return on investment (ROI) from their marketing spends.\nMedia buyers have access to more metrics and more platforms than ever before. Marketers, on the other hand, find that they need to change the way they work.\nWith more advertising technologies, it became crucial to set up an end-to-end measurement infrastructure on a single platform \u2014 from the conception of an idea to the implementation of action.\nBy integrating their brand\u2019s communication strategy into one platform and bringing multiple data sources together, marketers achieve a single view of the consumer, helping them understand consumers\u2019 media consumption habits, their journeys and", "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is publishing this alert to notify broker-dealers and transfer agents that certain individuals have emailed them posing as a representative of a publicly traded company.

If I give up blogging and try to establish a business by using my blog, how would I still generate traffic towards my website? Should I sell my domain and create a new blog on another blogging/networking platform?\nWritten by Anon\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s the right solution for individual bloggers, as that depends on the nature of the blog, individual\u2019s expertise and ability to market, and the blog\u2019s brand recognition.\nHowever, in general, when monetizing your blog, you want to create a product that has a connection to the services and products covered by your blog. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t write about other things, but your product or service focus can build your traffic and brand.\nFor example, if you are a fashion blogger, perhaps you can use your fashion expertise to create a fashion tips eBook or maybe some fashion iPhone apps. The focus is on what your content can provide the customer rather than merely how often you put up new posts on your blog.\nAs for creating a new blog on another platform, that might work for you, but the key is whether you\u2019d have a good audience. So focus first on creating a product that relates to your blogging interests. After that, it all depends on how you market your new product, and it\u2019s very hard to say how others will respond to your new marketing strategy.\nPREV 2 Tips on Successfully Building an Author Brand Next Digital Media Entrepreneurs: Is There a Market for Mobile Entertainment and Apps?", "\"I Am a Poppy,\" by Jessie Redmond Searspower, appeared in The Boston Herald, May 2, 1908. Poppy seeds sprouted in her stomach and ate the paper she carried on her back. \"Auntie,\" she told her aunt, \"I have made such a lovely surprise for you today.\" Poppy seeds sprouted in her mouth and gurgled: \"Don't eat my paper, Auntie\u2014it's the Bible.\" Poppy seeds sprouted in ears, nostrils, mouth, and eyes and jumped like red ants under her skin. The seeds were harvested. \"Auntie,\" she said, \"I have a surprise for you.\" Paper was not recovered, not even for funerals. Poppy seeds sprouted in her brain and sizzled. TEXT OF STORY: In the spring of 1908 I was invited to make up stories to be published in The Children's Corner of a Boston newspaper. My mother sat me at our old stand by the kitchen table. This table, at which my father was always leaning over my shoulder, was always covered with pencils, envelopes and all sorts of papers, where he kept on file letters, bills of all kinds, advertisements, and a thousand other things. He had just got some seeds and was looking as if he would be interested in hearing stories about them. \"Well, Jessie, what shall it be?\" he said. \"A story about seeds,\" I cried. \"I have been wondering what I shall write. I couldn't make up anything else worth sending in, and now I will write a story about seeds,\" I said. The seeds had come in the mail. He was delighted at the suggestion, and sat down to listen to me as if I had put them under a glass to show them to him. \"I am going to call it, 'I Am A Poppy.'\" \"You have already done that twice,\" he said. \"You needn't call it that again. We do not call it that,\" I said. \"I am going to write a story about poppies,\" I said. \"So far I have not touched paper,\" I said. Then I began to make up my story as I wrote it; not knowing what each sentence was going to be, and not caring much how it came out. When it was done I sent it in to the office, where I had often gone on errands, and where I was asked to come in and read it. It was published three times; and so much was said of it that it was reprinted in my magazine. For a long time it stood high on a shelf in my pine bookcase. Aunt Nellie said it was the best thing I ever wrote, and that nobody before or after could make a story out of a sentence. \"I don't see how you did it,\" said Aunt Nellie, and she couldn't say much more than \"Goodness!\" without tears. A few days ago my mother died, and I had to get out all the things that once were on the table, and I found the copy of \"The Boston Childrens Corner.\" I took it to her grave and sat down and cried\u2014just where she had sat\u2014as if she were sitting there beside me\u2014crying, as if she were crying at the same word\u2014and then putting the copy back as carefully as ever she had. \"I just know she was reading that story,\" said Aunt Nellie\u2014\"I know she was.\" CALL NUMBER: F.V.S", "In an innovative move, two New York newspapers joined forces to produce a mobile e-edition. Read more in this week's Mobile Innovation Report from emedia VP, Digital Media Brian Kane.\nIn today\u2019s world of hyper-technology, many news consumers are \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and opting for online content. Some of the reasons cited are: lack of time, wanting to be selective about which news sources they consume, cost of news content and accessibility. The good news for newspaper companies is that they now have the opportunity to offer news readers exactly what they want and need \u2013 news that is not only timely, but that they have access to wherever they happen to be.\nRecently, The Daily Freeman, based in Kingston, New York and its sister paper, the Times Herald-Record, a newspaper based in Middletown, New York, took a page out of the playbook of the late great \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d by introducing a mobile sports-specific e-edition.\nhttp://www.thefreeman.com/sportsedition/\nThis first-of-it\u2019s-kind offering delivers the paper\u2019s sports news in an elegantly designed, easy-to-read-and-navigate format, right through the user\u2019s Smartphone, Tablet device or iPad; in other words, it\u2019s a mobile news and sports reporting vehicle that news readers can take anywhere.\nNews of local high schools and college coverage is the focus of the mobile edition (though the editions also include professional sports teams in major markets in the Northeast). The sports edition has three pages of content that include: sports news and high school scores and standings; photos, videos and interviews; and, local and national sports headlines.\nThis edition of the newspaper was the brainchild of Diane Strasburg, Executive Editor of The Daily Freeman and Drew Kesler, Sports Editor of the paper, who met shortly after the paper launched its digital edition on the NewsCore platform. Recognizing that many of their customers followed their stories and liked the content they wrote about, they decided to launch a paper that would focus on sports headlines and local scores, and keep it as a mobile sports edition.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile edition is not available on the mobile website, but instead is specifically designed and formatted for mobile consumption. The mobile edition is a stand-alone app that can be downloaded from the Apple AppStore for either the iPhone or iPad. The cost of the sports edition is $1.99 per month or $10.99 per year, which compares to the cost of a New York City newspaper delivered to a NYC zip code, which is $2.15 per day for a weekday edition or $4.30 per day for a Saturday edition \u2013 that amounts to a lot more than $9.99!\nThough the daily paper may have been designed with digital content in mind, that\u2019s the last thing that\u2019s being thought of by the reader. The print paper is a very important driver for the mobile edition (a fact that the editors at both papers will readily admit). Each customer of the two papers is offered the mobile edition through the same access point as the print version, so that a loyal customer can receive both printed and mobile editions with ease and at the same cost. The mobile edition brings more revenue to the print offering than if it was offered as a free stand-alone service.\nThis project was not an overnight success \u2013 it was a year in making. As Strasburg told me, \u201cWe wanted to do something really unique\u2026(and) I knew that mobile consumption from our sports pages was growing; I knew that our mobile edition was very popular and that our mobile site was getting a lot of traffi in our sports sections. When I told the newsroom (what we were going to do), there was really loud, enthusiastic applause and support to do the mobile edition of just our sports section.\u201d\nThe sports section is an extension of The Daily Freeman\u2019s website, http://www.thedailyfreeman.com, which has been a stand-alone site since 1997. The editors at both newspapers are happy to report that over the last six months, the mobile sports edition is averaging an audience of 30,000 downloads a month.\nStrasburg believes that this project can be a great model for other newspapers. \u201cWe were very lucky that we had the resources to launch this because our parent company has invested in new technology and been very successful at launching this kind of project before, so we were very happy to have their support.\u201d As for what they\u2019ve learned, they believe that newsp", "The Commission amends the existing Commission  rules,  and  repeals one rule,  establishing  the  fees  for  the  Consumer Credit  Card  Access  to   Cardholder's  Account  File  (CCCARF).

The  parties proposed  to  amend  the rule to delay  the effective date until July 1, 2008  on  the  grounds that  by  then  the amendments to  the rule would  be  more  fully  understood  and  considered.\nIn addition, the parties presented four other alternatives  to the original effective date of  July 1,  2007.  The options  included: (1) delaying  the effective date one  to two years; (2) establishing  different  effective  dates  for  different  parts of the rule; (3) delaying  the effective date 12 months from the date  that the Commission votes any recommended amendments to the rule,  which  is  based on the June 2007 agenda; and (4) conducting  a  formal  rule  making  process.\nThe parties indicated that each of the alternatives,  except delaying the effective date by one  or two years, would be complicated and  cause confusion. The Commission  did not believe that  any of the alternatives would be preferable  to delaying the effective date until July  1, 2008.  On July 2, 2007, the Commission voted to delay  the effective date until July 1,  2008.  The Commission voted to reject each  of the parties'  alternatives proposed and instead  to delay  the  effective date  until July 1,  2008 on the grounds that a postponement  of  the  rule's  effective  date  until  that  day  would  be a sufficient  transitional  period.  This  amendment  establishes  the effective  date for the  amendments.\nThe Commission also decided to remove a paragraph  from the  proposed rule  that would  have  required a  data file  of  a  single  credit card  to  contain  all  required fields and  to  be compatible with  the  Commission's  system  of record  maintenance,   to  allow  the  Commission  to  determine whether the systems in  the industry and  the  industry proposals are complete,  accurate, and capable of  being processed by the  Commission's computer system.\nIn addition,  a  technical amendment is made to  one paragraph that modifies one  of the rules  to exclude an existing  exception that was  improperly  cited  to  include  certain  credit  card  information  in  public  record  files.\nThe Commission also  directs that the Chief  Technology Officer review  the requirements in  the proposed rule and that  the Office of the Chief", "A growing number of retailers, in an effort to reach consumers during the holidays and to strengthen the relationship between retailers and their customers, are turning to social media monitoring tools to listen to consumers online.\nA Look at Holiday Social Media Marketing\nI'm finding that more and more mainstream brands are seeing the benefits of using social media as a marketing tool. But, as I'm sure many of you who work in the industry already know, some of this marketing is falling flat.\nSeveral large companies have, after experimenting with social media over a certain period of time, either given up or switched up their tactics in an effort to reach consumers. Some of the bigger consumer brands include Kraft Foods and Procter and Gamble. What I'm noticing, however, is that the bigger businesses that aren't doing anything are the ones who are usually sitting around talking about social media and what a great idea it is.\nOne company I've been following closely has been Best Buy. They have been doing a great job of keeping up with the latest social media news, including blogs and Twitter chats. However, when it comes to actually marketing to consumers, this large company has stayed true to its old-fashioned advertising tactics.\nEarlier this year, Best Buy came under a lot of criticism after using a blogger to cover the holiday shopping season, but never disclosing the blogger's name. They eventually did follow the best business practices in disclosing who the blogger was. I'm wondering, though, where Best Buy would have been if they never took the time to respond to consumers.\nIn August, Walmart announced that it would not use social media in its advertising because the company believes that consumers are more interested in shopping than in talking to each other on Twitter. However, the world's largest retailer still has the potential to strengthen its relationship with consumers through social media monitoring tools, as evidenced by the fact that customers took notice of the company's decision and began using the hashtag #walkalmart to talk about the move.\nSophie Bejjani, managing director of B2C Markets, tells Econsultancy that Twitter is not going to kill TV, it's just going to add to it.\nAccording to new data from Experian Marketing Services, one in five shoppers will make a purchase online, while 87% of online shoppers have relied on social media for holiday shopping inspiration. In another study conducted by RetailMeNot.com, the average holiday shopper will spend $85.15 online and another $95 in-store.\nConsumers Warming Up to Holiday Social Engagement with Retailers\nLast holiday season, retailers were experimenting with their social media marketing. A few weeks before the holiday season, I wrote about my frustration with the marketing campaign that Target had launched at the time. Target had launched holiday-themed videos that were promoted on the company's Facebook page, as well as on Twitter and on other social channels like Youtube.\nI was disappointed that Target didn't provide more information about its holiday products, and, therefore, I would have to leave other channels and go visit the company's website. As it stands, retailers like Target have no incentive to use social media to actually sell merchandise. I believe this is a missed opportunity, and I hope the Target campaign was just that \u2014 a test that the retailer will use to improve on this coming holiday season.\nHoliday shoppers, according to RetailMeNot.com data, are starting to warm up to social media promotions because they want to learn about the deals.\nIn January, RetailMeNot.com's analysis revealed that consumers were looking for deals and discounts when holiday shopping online. The study was based on data compiled between November and December 2012 and found that the more than 5,000 online shoppers surveyed went online with the expectation they would find at least one deal.\nAccording to the study, one in four (25.9%) consumers said they did holiday shopping on their mobile devices, as opposed to the 18.5 percent who said they did so last year. Of those who used their mobile device to shop, 76.7 percent used an app rather than a mobile browser to complete purchases on their wireless devices.\nDespite consumers being more comfortable with social media and mobile devices, there was a surprising amount of caution toward new", "This NPRM proposes to establish a framework of\nstandards for the operation, installation, and testing of certain\nequipment on ships. This equipment includes marine pollution\ncontrol (MPC) equipment, automated engine control system (AGCS)\nequipment, and automated machinery control (AMC) equipment on\ncertain types of tank vessels (Tank Vessels).  The proposed\nrulemaking is in an attempt to improve the safety of operation\nof AMC, MPC and AGCS equipment aboard Tank Vessels.\nAUTHORITY:  This proposed rulemaking is issued under 46 U.S.C.\n701, 70101(b), 7103, 7211, 7214, 7215, 7302, 7305, 7306, 7310,\n7311, 7312, 7314, 7315, 7502, 7503; 46 CFR subchapter \"K\"; 49\nU.S.C. 5103.\nBACKGROUND:    Marine Pollution Control (MPCs) is designed to\nreduce the creation or discharge of oil into the ocean from\ntankers. MPC equipment is capable of preventing or significantly\nreducing the risk of loss of oil from the ship's tanks or fuel\nsystem to the ocean.\nOn July 20, 2005, the U.S. Coast Guard proposed amendments to\nthe current requirements for MPC equipment.  Specifically, the\nCoast Guard proposed to amend the requirements for the following\nitems of MPC equipment:\n-  the requirements for the design review and approval of\nMPC equipment;\n-  the requirements for testing of MPC equipment;\n-  the requirements for certification of personnel to carry\noverview of the rulemaking. The Coast Guard proposed to amend its\nrequirements for the implementation and operation of MPC equipment.\nThe amendments proposed to update existing requirements and to\nreduce the administrative burden on the industry, in particular the\ntesting requirements for MPC equipment. The Coast Guard received\n176 comments.  The Coast Guard received 112 comments regarding\nMPC equipment, 25 comments regarding automated machinery control\n(AMC) equipment, and 39 comments regarding automated engine control\nsystem (AGCS) equipment.  The comments received regarding MPC,\nAMC, and AGCS equipment are provided in the Table in the following\nparagraph titled, Comments Received.\n(TANK VESSELS). The Coast Guard has established a framework of\nstandards for the operation of equipment on Tank Vessels. The\nstandards established in this rulemaking would replace current\nstandards that are inconsistent with the Coast Guard's most recent\nstandards or do not address technological advancements that have\noccurred since their adoption.\n1. Section 710.3 requires a tankerman licensed by the Coast\nGuard to perform oil transfers from vessel to vessel in\ncombination with a U.S. Coast Guard-approved system;\n2. Section 710.4 requires an endorsement to each STCW\nCertificate or Document that authorizes an individual to work as\na ``Tankman,'' ``Assistant Chief Engineer,'' ``Chief\nEngineer,'' ``Second Engineer,'' ``Third Engineer,'' or\n``Deck Assistant''; and\n3. Section 710.5 provides for approval of oil transfer\nequipment by National Institute of Standards and the Technology.\nThis proposed rule would replace Section 710.3 and Section 710.4\nwhich would continue to apply to those individuals who previously\nreceived those credential and those individuals who currently seek\nofficer endorsements on their STCW C1/D or STCW C1/D and E\ncertificates or documents to work on board Tank Vessels. This rule\nis not a final rule.  We will consider public comments and\namend the proposed rulemaking as appropriate to fulfill our\nmissions and objectives.\nThe proposed rulemaking would create new requirements for\ncertain categories of MPC, AMC, and AGCS equipment on Tank Vessels.\nThis proposed rulemaking would replace the current regulatory\nrequirements.

On June 30, 2015, the Department published guidelines in the Federal Register at 80 FR 38019, and amended (72 FR 34731) the guidelines on December 30, 2012. There is no specific authority in the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 or the final guidelines to permit modification of an agreement that would result in a material change to any term of an agreement. Further, there is no Federal statute, regulation or other authority permitting the approval of modification of an underlying note or loan agreement that would involve an unsecured refinanced loan. Accordingly, all FHA Streamlined Refinance Initiative modifications must be documented under the terms of all outstanding FHA/VA Streamlined Refinance Initiative agreements, and an agreement by the lender to modify those terms must be made directly with the borrower. Thus, the borrower must be fully informed of the potential benefits, costs, and risks involved in the refinancing of student loans and must execute a new agreement that conforms to the Federal Housing Authority's guidelines. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 permits such borrowers who are participating in the Streamlined Refinance Initiative to provide a signature block on FHA/VA Streamlined Refinance Initiative Forms HUD-92900 and HUD-92600.

We believe that it's really important to make sure that everybody understands that, to avoid political bias and political manipulation.\n\"We're trying to help people come to the opinion that's right.\"", "There are opportunities for publishers who get their audiences engaged by using data and personalisation.\nBy Steve Ladd\nPublishers are using personalisation to enhance their readers\u2019 experience and engage them better. To use data and personalisation, publishers have to first be able to use the data available to them.\nWe know that publishers are collecting data but they don't know how to connect that data to the stories they are producing. But doing that isn't always easy; publishers have access to a number of different data sources, each telling a different story, so how do they connect all these pieces and, most importantly, why would they want to?\nA recent study by the Reuters Institute, Digital News Research, and News Media Canada showed how Canadians wanted to have access to real-time data from a newspaper or news site. When presented with information from different sites, the respondents were 23% more likely to subscribe for real-time info from their local paper.\nI recently spent several hours talking with publishers in Canada about their approaches to data collection and using that data effectively. I was extremely impressed to see publishers putting their audiences, and therefore, the consumer first.\nThese publishers are not doing this just to satisfy the data consumer, but they have realised that having a better understanding of their audience and providing that audience with unique, relevant content gives value to the reader. This in turn builds trust. It also means advertisers and sponsors can be sure that when they're reaching consumers, their money is going to the right audience.\nIt goes beyond that. Being able to put all the data together into a single view enables publishers to put content in front of the consumer exactly when they want it. Putting this data together also helps publishers to figure out what types of content their readers really care about.\nFor example, using data, a publisher can figure out that an article on sports isn't going to be as interesting to their readers on a Tuesday as it might be on a Friday. The publisher could then use data about other stories that their readers have previously engaged with, and use these insights to develop a program for their readers.\nOne of the reasons The Economist is a leader in this space is that they have put the entire world of data in one place. With The Economist, data from a variety of sources is stored in a single repository and managed by a single team across departments. This team looks at all the data for things that have already happened. When looking at data for the future, they identify specific, relevant content that the reader might be interested in.\nA key part is understanding the reader's journey using data, then providing relevant content to the reader where they need it the most. And that, as publishers, is where you add value.\nFor example, The Economist is using data to personalise the way they send their newsletters via email. They know when you are most likely to read your newsletter based on your interaction with previous mailers. And, rather than sending one newsletter at the start of the week, they use the data to send you a newsletter at three different times throughout the week.\nSo the key point is that publishers want to be able to make a connection between their data and the content they send out. So how do they actually do that? What's the first step?\nWhat's really important is to understand first who you are: your target audience and what your audience wants from you. The publishers I worked with in Canada have a deep understanding of this. Each publisher is well aware of who their reader is and what they want from their news organisation.\nBecause they have this information, they are able to create a very personalised product. Each publisher has their own ideas of how they engage their readers. However, the goal is the same\u2014to get as close as possible to their audience.\nOne of the key steps publishers need to take is to figure out exactly what content they are going to create and, once they've picked out the type of content, they need to understand the audience better.\nTo make a connection between data and content, publishers need to be aware of what kind of content their readers like. So, for instance, one publication I worked with has done some research around what kind of videos their readers watch. Through surveys and other sources of information, they have discovered that most of their videos are about sports and that their users don't want to see news as a linear stream. So they create segments\u2014they take some longer videos and make short, easily-digestable clips out of them\nA good way to start getting more information is to ask your readers the following question: What do you want to see from us? Asking that question will tell you what kind of content", "GAO's work supports the legislative and oversight responsibilities of Congress.

It also represents an effort to provide a brand-led platform that\u2019s not beholden to traditional metrics on the web, but can measure itself by its own yardsticks.\nAlbert Porcellato, editor-in-chief of iCrossing, said in an interview with MediaPost that the site reflects the importance of the new way of thinking about content in the digital context, rather than simply relying on the 50-word stories that fill an old web paradigm.\n\"What can we do that sets us apart from the way that people think about news and content on the web,\" Porcellato said of the motivation behind the \u201cVICE\u201d site. \"We want to do things that have a certain amount of immediacy and are visual-first.\"\nHe said that Vice will also \"continue to push forward as a brand, as a global publisher\" that does not have to rely on ad dollars to sustain its operation. It'll be a \"happy medium\" for Porcellato and Vice where the brand becomes more established and eventually, revenue comes from other sources that Hearst will bring into the mix.\n\"All of us have some faith that the content we do will get to a point where it\u2019s viable in terms of economics or monetization,\" Porcellato said. \"There\u2019s always a plan to do more with the content itself and the revenue that attaches to it.\"\nThe site is focused on mobile devices, with a very small share of traffic coming through desktop browsers, Porcellato said. He likened the structure of the site to an app, with users going through a navigation that looks at the newest piece of content first, or being brought to new material depending on which content section they\u2019re in.\nPieces include written features, longer video, short video (for example, Vice's \"Ridiculist\" segment on the New York Times), or multimedia and graphically driven pieces.\nContent is curated in a way that appeals to younger minds, Porcellato said. While the Vice content strategy focuses more on social content, some of the curated content pieces will be linked to Hearst\u2019s other brands.\n\"We\u2019ll try to help each other by sharing the things we see, and we\u2019ll put them out on our various platforms we have,\" Porcellato said. \"We\u2019ll create a branded experience, but we\u2019ll bring other stories from elsewhere into them also.\"\nIf you look at Hearst, for example, you could go to The San Francisco Chronicle and share a story via Twitter, or vice-versa. There\u2019s a lot of sharing to be done between its sites, and hopefully a benefit that Vice content can bring to some of the longer-form pieces Hearst publishes as well.\nAudience Building in Long-Form Video\nAdAge called VICE a \"news site with a brand\" that serves up \"snort-worthy articles, but also long-form video.\" The idea of a long-form video site that builds an audience on a specific platform could be a potential trendsetter within the industry and a testament to the power of video in the digital age, and could possibly be compared with Vice\u2019s influence on the print magazine/newspaper market.\nPorcellato said it\u2019s easier to create a content strategy around video now than it was a year ago.\n\"We were doing a big push at the turn of the year to hire more video talent throughout the different properties, video producers, video editors, and now it\u2019s paying off,\" Porcellato said.\nVideo may be an even truer reflection of what media companies deliver to readers, considering a site like VICE, while having editorial control through content partnerships, can actually shape its brand and content based on feedback from the audience -- not a particular media outlet\u2019s focus group or advertising clients. Hearst, in turn, is hoping to make the site an effective way to attract that audience that will eventually grow and drive other advertising to the publisher\u2019s other", "Requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to provide to a citizen of the United States who is a victim of a vehicle accident in California assistance from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) with any DMV task that is necessary to resolve the accident.\nREASON: At the request of a victim of an automobile accident resulting in $10,000 or greater in damages, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) is not allowed by law to provide assistance with any DMV task that is necessary to resolve the accident without authorization from the DMV, which means that the person who is a victim in the automobile accident is deprived of any needed assistance from the CHP in the DMV process.\nThis bill changes the law to provide the assistance from the CHP to the victim of the vehicle accident without the victim needing to request permission from the DMV in advance.\nThis bill provides the DMV with the power to suspend and revoke a license pursuant to certain provisions of the law or any regulations it may adopt and authorizes a person whose license or privilege has been suspended or revoked to request an administrative hearing to review the matter.\nThis bill further requires a person who is the victim of an accident, who has been issued a citation or warning, or who has been arrested by the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the scene of a crash, to receive notice before the citation hearing is commenced that he shall appear if he is a resident of California and chooses to obtain assistance from the CHP.\nThis bill authorizes the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the scene to take the steps necessary to provide assistance from the CHP for the victim.\nThis bill repeals a part of the Business and Professions Code that relates to DMV and replaces it with another provision that pertains to DMV as an administrative agency.\nFEES, FINES\nBILL NUMBER: SB 645\nAN ACT to add Section 1602.5 to the Vehicle Code, relating to driving.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that in a vehicle accident in which there has\nbeen damages of $10,000 or greater, the California Highway Patrol may, without\nobtaining authorization from the Department of Motor Vehicles, assist the person\nbeing treated at a hospital emergency room or outpatient orthopedic clinic with\nany task necessary to facilitate completion of the required forms and required DMV\nThe Legislature further finds and declares that in a vehicle accident in w\nhich there has been material damage only, if the lawful driver or owner of the a\nctive vehicle being treated at a hospital emergency room or outpatient or thora\npedic clinic submits a police report as required, the California Highway Patrol\nmay, without obtaining authorization from the Department of Motor Vehicles, assist\nthe lawful driver or owner of the active vehicle being treated at a hospital emer\ngency room or outpatient or therapeutic clinic with any task necessary to faci\nlitate completion of the required forms and required DMV tasks.\n(a) A driver involved in an accident resulting in injury or death to any one person, or in damage to\nany vehicle which Is driven, owned, or controlled by any person engaged in the transportation of\npassengers for compensation, shall immediately, if the driver is physically and mentally capable,\nstop the vehicle at the nearest location that will not impede traffic or otherwise constitute a\nhazard, and shall forthwith return to and in every event shall remain at the scene of the\naccident until he or she has: (1) Performed the duties required of him or her by Section 20051.5\nand, if required by the California Highway Patrol pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 20002, also performed the duties required of him or her by paragraph (3) of subdivision\n(c); and (2) Fulfilled any requirements imposed upon him or her pursuant to subdivision (d).

It\u2019s been a very tough year for media, whether broadcast or in print.\nIf we look at these two areas, one clear and one not so clear, we can see that these are critical times in publishing.\nLooking at a clear issue, TV is no stranger to losing audience, and they\u2019re certainly not strangers to advertiser loss either.\nOverall, the broadcast sector has seen a 6% loss in revenue this year, with all of its key categories (network, local, and cable) losing money.\nThis is the reason we see media companies going bankrupt, struggling, fighting on all fronts, and fighting for their lives.\nOn the broadcast side, we have seen a huge loss of viewers, who are now migrating to cable.\nThe loss of viewers has been as much as 15%, so it\u2019s obvious that there has been a huge shift in the entertainment and consumption side.\nWe have been in a world that has seen more and more people watching less and less broadcast TV for at least five years. What used to be a one-way platform is now a two-way platform, and the shift from the single platform to the dual, and possibly even triple platform approach, will keep growing.\nThe industry is now a platform business. We must build an ecosystem. We can do that in a way that can work either in a transaction or a subscription manner. There is nothing that binds those two models.\nSo where can we find that model we need?\nWe should keep in mind that the model we are looking for should be scalable in a global approach.\nThe fact is the consumer can\u2019t and won\u2019t go through this migration unless the content is globally scalable.\nSo you need to scale in a local and a global way at the same time, and you also need to find a way to make that process a simple process for the viewer.\nThere are going to be different ways to monetize this content, however, the biggest part of monetizing the content has to do with localizing the content and being able to bring the global product to a local level.\nIt has to be a model that allows for global scalability, global economies of scale, and the ability to bring this global scale to a local market.\nThere also must be a way to make it easy to bring global content directly to the individual consumer, which requires an aggregation of content, a distribution of a huge amount of content -- and all that content needs to be global, global in geography, and also global in media.\nWhat does this model look like?\nIt\u2019s a very exciting time to be part of the publishing industry. There are a lot of changes that are happening, and there is a lot going on.\nThe business models have to be designed in a more flexible manner, and that flexible model is going to be much more a part of the future than it is today.\nFor the old models, they will continue to exist, but there will exist new models as well. The new models have to be able to have all this localization and globalization of content. This localization comes about because you want to bring global content locally. You still want to have the global content.\nSo the problem is how you create an aggregation, an aggregation in terms of providing a platform where people can do that with simple, elegant, and transparent approaches to the consumer.\nLooking at what companies need to do to provide that aggregation, there are three basic things to keep in mind:\n\uf0b7 Be scalable: In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s all about scaling and the ability to scale quickly and cheaply, both on the demand side and the supply side.\n\uf0b7 Be easy for the user: The user should be able to get in and out of your service in a very easy and a very simple way.\n\uf0b7 Create a flexible business model: Allow yourself to be agile in terms of allowing yourself to do anything that is appropriate. Don\u2019t get anchored to a way of doing things that make it difficult, not only for your consumer experience, but also for your publisher experience. You always have to keep an eye out for the publisher\u2019s view as much as you do for the consumer\u2019s view. We must think about that balance.\nBut all of this thinking about", "In March 2019, the World Bank approved the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a USD 14 billion investment in Pakistan that has been a priority of Pakistan\u2019s government since 2013. The World Bank stated that Pakistan had met the eligibility criteria for funding under the project, having a \u201csolid track record\u201d of performance against World Bank projects in the last four years and an \u201coverall fiscal and external sustainability that is expected to be met under the project.\u201d[i] The World Bank had approved USD 761.7 million of funding for a previous phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in 2018, and has provided approximately USD 250 million in technical and advisory services to Pakistan.[ii]\nThis support has been controversial among Pakistani commentators and activists. Critics argue that the project\u2019s financial costs and associated environmental and transparency concerns will dwarf the economic gains associated with the project. In particular, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is often conflated with a second project \u2013 the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA) - with the two projects often described as a \u201cdebacle\u201d or a \u201crecipe for disaster.\u201d\nHowever, while much has been argued about the economic merits of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (I), not much public or civil society-led political accountability assessment has been carried out about the project. This has been primarily due to the opacity of the CPFTA to the population, but also due to the lack of available and inclusive political assessment instruments to carry out an analysis of the agreement and an evaluation of its likely impact.\nThis is particularly relevant given the concerns raised about the impact that the CPEC\u2019s 2,211-meter-long Gwadar\nPort on the coast of the Arabian Sea, and the associated port area will have on local communities and their traditional ways of life. This paper argues that the project and associated CPFTA is important as it is part of China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d and overall vision of an \u201ceconomic corridor\u201d \u2013 the \u201cChina Pak Economic\nCorridor\u201d \u2013 that will cut across the Eurasian continent; and that is therefore critical to understanding changes and impacts taking place as a result of globalization for civil society and ordinary people. This paper argues that the CPFTA is relevant to international development studies as well, as the agreement has the potential, and many have indicated will in fact, have massive impacts on the development of Pakistan\u2019s domestic industries and on the population. [iii] This paper therefore uses a \u201csocio-cultural lens\u201d in order to understand the political economy of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement in Pakistan. The first objective of this paper will therefore be to argue for using a socio-cultural lens and the method of political assessment to analyze and understand transnational economic agreements and impacts. The second objective will be to provide a brief description of the project and the arguments opposing it made in the public sphere, with a particular focus on its impact on Pakistan\u2019s social and economic fabric. Finally, the third objective of this paper will be to highlight several critical questions about the project, including whether the CPEC will have a positive impact on people\u2019s lives or whether it will exacerbate existing challenges in the country.\n[i] \u201cChina- Pakistan Economic Corridor,\u201d China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPR), 24 Nov 2018, www.cpec.com.pk/project-overviews/china-pakistan-economic-corridor/.\n[ii] \u201cChina- Pakistan Economic Corridor\u201d; and \u201cChina-Pakistan FTA: A Win-Win for Pakistan,\u201d Pakistan Today, 18 July 2018, www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/18/featured/china-pakistan-fta-a-win-win-for-pakistan/.\n[iii] This paper will use the term \u201cinternational development studies\u201d to refer to the set of academic disciplines \u2013 ranging from political science, sociology, economics, geography, anthropology, and development studies \u2013 designed to understand how political change and its impacts on people\u2019s lives.

He tracks his wife down and discovers her true motives for leaving her family. She has also moved to a new city and married a wealthy surgeon. When the son is let go for lack of evidence, he runs away and goes on the road. The father follows him with the help of the son's girlfriend. They discover that the father's wife is up to something.\nIt was very difficult for her to get to the phone without him noticing.\nBut she would not be caught off-guard. She would call her attorney, and she would start making plans.\nShe knew his motives all to well. As she picked up the phone, she was reminded of the words of his attorney who advised her. \"If you sign the divorce papers, he will move out. If you take an apartment, he will move back in. If you put a nanny in his apartment, he will move out again. It is a losing game. Just divorce him. He will move on.\"\nIt had been an awfully long 10 years. She had expected things to be better when it finally came to an end. And indeed, she couldn't be happier with her plans. But she could not allow herself to think about the ramifications of her plans yet, because so soon after her divorce, he would remarry. She could not do that with their son still at home and not knowing what is going on.\nShe wanted to be absolutely sure that her plans had been accomplished. It wasn't the same as if their son were married. But that's a difficult challenge. But she had figured it out months ago. And she could not let him know. She had to leave first. And she knew it would be a problem for him to be left with nothing while his wife is off on her honeymoon.\nIt was a long road for her. She had traveled with the son to help him move to a new home for a new school for a new life in a new city. She could hardly recognize the new life and new home he had created for himself. And she had no regrets. She couldn't wait to start life again.\nShe had not had a chance to see the new home, except for that fateful visit with his son to see if he would be up for the visit to the new home. She knew she was in for a huge change. But at least there was a bed for the visit. And she couldn't stay. It was too soon.\nAnd now she was just waiting, and she had to be very patient. She knew exactly what the son would do. She knew the boy. She had known the boy since he was 2 years old, 7 days, to be exact. His birthday was July 14, and she knew exactly how he would react to her leaving him behind.\nShe knew it wasn't the easiest thing to do. And it was much more difficult for the father. To see his only child go off on his own was almost heartbreaking. But it had to be done. She had no other choice. But she couldn't just up and leave. She had a long car ride ahead of her. But she was sure that he wouldn't leave her. Or would he? Would he take off with the child? Or would he go?\nOr would they come after her? Who knows and nobody saw her plan as well as she did. A plan like a chessmaster!\nBut now she had to be patient. She had to wait for the father to make his next move. She had to wait for the father to come forward, like she knew he would.\nWhen he had to go, she had to leave. If it weren't for the law enforcement agency in her city, she would have left months ago. But the law enforcement agency wanted to send a clear message to the public about its \"zero tolerance\" approach to domestic violence. That law enforcement agency was just a ploy. A trap by law enforcement to keep her imprisoned. It was not a good time to be a woman.\nBut she would not stay another day and wait around while the father took his anger out on her child.\nHe would come after her. She knew it!\nHe had never been violent during the past 10 years. But that was the time when she was married to him.\nAnd she would not take another beating.

Where they are going (our 15 million monthly unique visitors is overwhelming). Why they are coming to us (our 63 million unique monthly visitors worldwide).\nAre they getting a sense of what we\u2019re covering? Or is it harder for them to do that because the amount of information is so overwhelming?\nWe have more multimedia content in our stories than ever before.\nAnd we are trying to figure out the right ways to aggregate all the content we are getting from our readers.\nOne of the problems is that our readers are not all at the same sophistication level. There are people getting their news from their TV sets, then finding it on the Internet.\nIn fact, these days, the most efficient way to get to our front page is through a Web search. The most efficient way to get to a specific story on our Web site is via e-mail.\nSo it\u2019s very important that at each level, we provide the right signals so that people can figure out what content we have to offer them and how to get to it.\nWe see this two ways. First is aggregation. On The Times\u2019s Web site, people can go to the best news on the Web, which we curate to show how we see it. Or they could go to a section within what we call \u201cThe New York Times Home News Page\u201d that shows every single story as it comes in from all parts of The Times worlds. You can see this in the screenshot below of a video.\nSo, we have to decide: Are we curating the best stories, the most important news of the day, for our audience? Or, are we allowing them to aggregate it all for themselves? And then there is the issue of \u201cpersonalization\u201d \u2014 of helping them figure out how to get information on a particular topic or to a particular geography.\nSecond is how to deal with the proliferation of content \u2014 an issue that is only getting larger as the number of e-mails that we are receiving is also going up. We have about 900,000 a day from readers sending in ideas. Some of these ideas are good, and some are not so good. And we cannot send out an e-mail for every single one.\nSo, we need to be smart about figuring out how to do that. But how smart are we about this issue? Are we, as a company, smart enough about figuring how to do this right, or aren\u2019t we smart enough, and should we do it in partnership with our readers?\nIt\u2019s a big question, and it\u2019s important that we not lose out on the content we\u2019re getting from our readers.\nThis post appeared first here on Poynter.org.\nPREV 5 ways to create news that lasts NEXT 10 reasons why \u2018digital journalism\u2019 is the future", "Advertorials, sponsored content, and content marketing have a crucial role to play in the future of print.\nAds, Content, and a Changing Media Landscape\nBy Eileen Seal\nPrint advertisers have had to compete with online for more than a decade. Print continues to survive in part because there is a large audience that continues to gravitate toward its tactile medium. This audience has not totally abandoned newspapers for the digital world nor are they simply reading the papers online.\nIn addition to keeping up with the news, they are also receptive to advertisements and editorial content, and so they continue to purchase print advertising.\nHowever, the future of print might be to focus less on what content it can deliver and focus on the value it provides in other ways. It can no longer be the \u201cfree\u201d version of the website.\nThe free website gives immediate access. Access to print requires the workforce or purchase of the magazine.\nPrint creates a more luxurious experience and adds more value. This is why the print audience is so valuable to advertisers. Ads are still one of the most important sources of revenue in the print industry \u2014 but more and more, the competition might be with editorial content and sponsored content and advertorials might hold their own against paid editorial as the primary driver for sales.\nPrint publications might also hold an advantage with audience engagement and data analytics.\nIn the digital world, companies can easily determine how many people are reading their ads. In the print world, companies might not see how many people are looking at their ads. However, the reader reaction to sponsored content and advertorials can be measured. Newspaper editors and publishers can tell readers who their biggest fans are, what they like or dislike, what their favorite stories are. They can engage the readers in a way they cannot on a website because it\u2019s more difficult to identify the reader and engage them. The publisher can also tell advertisers who the most engaged readers are and provide them data and insights that will help them create and improve future campaigns.\nThis might be particularly important for the luxury brands that make up a substantial part of the sponsored content target audience.\nThe ability of the print media to target advertising and sell sponsors into publishing content becomes a primary value-add to newspapers \u2014 and it gives them an important upper hand on news sites.\nPublishers might not have the luxury of the big tech and media companies (such as Facebook, Google, and Apple) that already know who you are since your account is tied to your actual identity.\nBut publishers are learning more and more from their audiences. In exchange for providing value in the form of advertorials and sponsored content, publishers can also receive unique email lists and information about readers so they can learn what other products they\u2019re interested in and how to best engage with these readers.\nA print publication knows so much about its audience, such as their favorite articles, how often they engage on the mobile site or in the print edition, which advertisements they see, and which ones they don\u2019t \u2014 and all of this is valuable information for sponsors and advertisers. Ads can be targeted to the right readers, and the companies selling to those readers can get actionable insights about them.\nPrint has long been a primary source of revenue for many media companies. It will need to find new ways to sell that revenue to stay competitive in the marketplace. Advertorials and sponsored content could be important parts of a modern print media revenue strategy.\nEileen Seal is an online advertising manager and consultant who helps publishers launch sponsored content programs and find advertiser clients. She has worked at major print publications, including Parade, Parents, and W, as well as with a diverse array of advertisers, from major retail brands to national nonprofits.

This story, told in part through the words of a freelance photographer, explains the difficulties faced by the print media in this fast, furious and confusing market.\nOn 8 December Sydney freelance photographer Bruce McKinnon was contacted by a New York-based television producer who was doing a story about Australians who had fled the country and were now seeking permission to return. With only two days to get the pictures the producer needed, she was struggling to get a Sydney-based agency to cover the story. McKinnon had some spare time so he accepted her request to photograph six people with stories to tell. They were interviewed in three locations around the city and the images would be sent directly to the story's producer when the shoot was finished. The next morning, McKinnon was puzzled when he heard nothing from the agency. \"I phoned around Sydney to see if they were there. They weren't. I was the only one with the photos,\" he says.\nA week later, McKinnon rang the agency to find out what was happening and was told the producer had no idea why she'd asked for the pictures. \"Then they said, `Well, the New York producer didn't even get paid, so I don't think the pictures are going to sell at all.\" (Sales) McKinnon was out of pocket more than $500. But the agency sent the photographs anyway.\n\"That's only the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"It seems to have become an almost expected part of the freelance business that the money promised is just a phantom paper. It's like a giant pinboard where things can be pinned, and people say `Well, we agreed to pay, so we'll pay'. . . . I know of a photographer who received a check from a London paper dated August for a story the newspaper ran in October. The publisher went insolvent.\" McKinnon said he believed the paper had tried to pay the photographer after it was too late for the company to do so before it went under.\n\"This isn't new. It's been going on for years and years. This is no way to run a business. This isn't the way people should make a living and it's not the way publications should earn their money,\" said McKinnon.\nNewspapers have come under attack since the Federal Government gave Australia's 400-odd regional daily papers tax relief to compete with the metropolitan and other specialist titles, he said. \"There's not enough money to go around. This makes it even worse.\"\nMcKinnon said that he'd heard stories from fellow journalists and photographers of how they had been paid $2 or $3 for a full story. \"There's probably a lot of people [who haven't] got a clue that when they do stories for newspapers they might not be paid for them at all. . . . The story of the journalist or photographer who never gets paid or is paid late is the story that has never had a satisfactory ending. This is a very sad state of affairs but, when the market is tight and newspapers are trying to fill their papers, the whole thing gets out of control.\"\nJason O'Toole, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph and The Australian Financial Review, who now works as a freelance journalist and editorial consultant, said he was now doing much of his work on the contract or the speculative mode. That meant that he would work on an assignment for which the publication had told him it was planning to run a story, but which the paper had not actually paid for, with the understanding that it would be paid once the story ran. That agreement, he said, was often ignored, with payments delayed or cancelled. In the more difficult days of working from home he would have to get up early to catch a train downtown and do the work on whatever he could scare up. He said sometimes the stories would be paid for, but the payments he could receive at various news organisations could vary from $5 a line to more than $200.\n\"For a lot of freelancies it depends on them having a lot of work backed up", "The rule requires that, beginning on January 1, 2010, all of the energy used by commercial kitchens be provided by renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, small amounts of hydropower, and waste-derived energy such as landfill gas, methane from coal mines, biogas, anaerobic digestion gas and others.\nThe rule will promote the use of wind, wave, solar and other renewable energy sources that increase economic benefits; support development of new markets and industries; create manufacturing or construction jobs; promote clean energy; and support increased investments in research and development of renewable energy technologies and manufacturing.\nIn sum, this rule will benefit not only the environment but also the American economy. It is a smart policy supported by science and good business decisions. I strongly endorse that the Renewable Energy Standard remain part of the American energy future.

The Commission seeks comment on whether to adopt, prior to the commencement of the next biennial data gathering interval, a schedule through which broadcast stations must file the Localism Surveys during even numbered years, the next of which is 2011.\n EFFECTIVE DATE: Comments are due June 3, 2010; replies are due July 2, 2010.\nFederal Communications Commission. Richard L. Rosser,\nSecretary. Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.\nFor the Commissioners: Michele A. Batchelor, Peter D. Doyle, Gigi B. Sohn, Ajit Pai, and Mignon L. Clyburn.\nIn this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Federal\nCommunications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on whether it should extend and simplify the biennial broadcasting practice and community involvement reporting requirements to the following broadcasters: (1) The local programming obligations imposed by Section 73.3555(a)(7) of the Commission's rules (2000 Programming Regulations) are applicable to commercial television and radio station licensees that serve commercial clusters in primary and secondary markets; (2) the requirements to file and keep public inspection files are applicable to television licensees serving commercial markets, television licensees serving commercial clusters in primary and secondary markets, and radio licensees having a weekly or more frequently occurring program of any duration; and (3) the requirement to maintain a public file is applicable to commercial and non-commercial stations, non-commercial educational (NCE) radio, and non-commercial educational (NCE) television. The Commission has previously reported on this biennial localism survey. See Broadcast Regulatory Management Information System Program Data, Report No. 512 (Dkt. No. 95-254, FCC 1998).\n2. Report and Order. In 2003, the Commission adopted a two-pronged order as part of an ongoing effort to improve localism at broadcast stations. See Biennial Surveys of Broadcast Viewing Patterns,\nCommercial Television Viewing, and Commercial Radio Listening: Requirement to File Biennial Localism Surveys and Broadcasters' Report on Whether They Are Participating in Community Service Activities,\nMB Docket No. 03-15, Report and Order (Biennial Reporting Order or Biennial Report), paras. 137-47, 25 FCC Rep. at 11945-11961. The Biennial Reporting Order requires local commercial television and radio station licensees that serve local commercial markets to file biennially a detailed survey reflecting the station's public service commitments that will assist Commission enforcement efforts. The Commission, in its first set of biennial surveys, found that almost all station licensees had complied with the localism requirements.\nAs the Commission continues to work toward improving broadcast programming and its involvement within the local communities served by broadcast stations, in 2006 the Commission decided to begin an ongoing effort to promote further broadcaster responsibility, and to gain a better understanding of the impact of localism requirements. The Order and NPRM initiated this effort by, among other things, including revised biennial reporting requirements for broadcasting station licensees to provide the Commission with the most current information on their locally produced programming and station community issues. The Order also adopted additional filing and form requirements for information and verification of compliance with the localism rules. Biennial Broadcast Survey Report, Second Biennial Report,\nDkt. No. 02-48, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 21 FCC Rep. 18565, 18800 (2006) (Order and NPRM). Specifically, the Biennial Reporting Order and NPRM modified the reporting burden on broadcasting licensees by, among other things, requiring them to document the impact of the reporting obligations. To do so, the Commission modified the localism reporting requirements and added a localism \"survey\" of 27 questions that a broadcast station licensee must answer, as", "The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA or EPA) is announcing the availability of a draft human health risk assessment for bacteriophage (BPV) types a18, a24, \u03a63X2, and \u03a6X174 for use in microbial disinfectant manufacturers and other users of these strains. The final draft human health risk assessment addresses possible risks to human health from intentional and inadvertent exposure to bacteriophage. The USEPA is also seeking comment on the adequacy of this information on which a decision will be made on whether or not to issue an amended registration of these strains for commercial use. The final risk assessment will identify the potential toxicity associated with these BPV strains. The draft human health risk assessment evaluates the potential that these microbacteriophage may cause adverse health effects to humans; based on the draft risk assessment information, in the absence of inoculation, these bacteriophages are not likely to cause any effects. The availability of this information may help inform manufacturers of BPV as they consider whether to grow bacteriophage in a facility that houses a biologics manufacturing facility. This approach would avoid having to make regulatory submissions for both the biologics and BPV. A USEPA staff member will be available to answer your questions concerning this information. For more information, contact Sandra Giddens, National Exposure Unit, RE: Docket ID No. EPA- HQ-OPPT-2008-0417 at Giddens.Sandra@epa.gov.

On May 27, 1997, FDA announced that the regulations would become effective on June 17, 1997.\nand, on May 23, 1997, the Office of Management and Budget approved under 5 U.S.C. 801 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 the collection of information requirements contained in this document. FDA solicited public comment on the notice during a 60-day period that ended on May 24, 1997. The amendment to parts 110 and 113 of the food code is now effective.\nComments should be identified with this document's docket number, which is 96N-0523. All comments should be submitted in triplicate (or more) and follow the provisions of 21 CFR 10.30. All comments must be received on or before June 16, 1997. The agency may ask for written submissions postmarked after that date but before November 24, 1997, for it to be considered. You also may fax them to 301-827-5872.\nFDA has prepared an economic analysis of the proposed rules. For a copy of the summary, see the Federal Register of June 3, 1996, or FDA's Internet home page (world wide web). The analysis demonstrates that the proposed requirements are economically significant, but are not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small, economically disadvantaged entities. If you have any questions regarding the economic analysis, please contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT at the beginning of this notice.\nAs an attachment to this document, are 635 additional pages of pre-publication comments received during the notice of availability of the proposed regulations on May 13, 1996. Those comments are submitted to the docket under docket number 96N-0523. Each page contains just one comment.\nHearing. Any interested person may request that an oral comment opportunity be established in connection with this notice of availability by contacting the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. FDA normally does not set an oral comment opportunity in connection with notices of availability.\nSummary: The final amendments to the food code and the guidelines do not require any substantial change in State or local jurisdictions' current food safety practices. Most of the new regulations will help promote uniform food safety practices across the country.\nThis amendment to parts 110 and 113 only amends definitions. The other definitions in part 110 are not affected. The other amendments to parts 110 and 113 pertain to fish and fish products from retail stores. The State jurisdictions that operate from retail stores typically already have in their State or local regulations requirements that closely approximate the requirements of this amendment to the food code.\nThe list of fish products in Sec. 113.340 of the food code would be expanded from the current list of 8 to 9 lists. A new list of fish and fish products is added to the current list that includes a description of the product and the name of the type of fish (such as \"mackerel\") from which the fish product is\nderived. In addition to the new and the expanded list there is also a proposed\nrevision to the current list. At present the fish\nproducts that contain anchovy are listed in the current listing as \"Fish Products Derived From Anchovy\" (Sec. 113.340(a)). The proposed change is to make it specific and remove\nthe parenthetical phrase: \"Fish Products Derived From\nAnchovy\" and make the new listing read \"Anchovy Fish Products\". The anchovy, along with sardines, herring, cod and mackeral comprise a\ngroup of oily fish that have a large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids that is known medically as \"good\" fats and that are the only fish", "While the world was focused on an international terrorist threat from Europe and the Middle East, the next wave of terror was much closer to home. In fact, it had emerged at a point in time far closer to home than previously imagined.\nIn October of 2001, when the world was struggling to find words, definitions, and meanings of the events that had just taken place, terrorism hit home in a number of locations throughout the United States. These included the state of South Carolina, where authorities had barely caught a glimmer of the menace that had begun to threaten American cities, communities, and families.\nFBI Special Agent Samantha Reid was among them. And during this same period in history, something else was happening in the same city of Columbia, as well as the city of Nashville...\nCHAPTER # 1\nThere had been too many late-night emergency calls on too many nights. They were beginning to weigh heavily on Samantha Reid's mind as she prepared herself for the early hours of work. That said, there had always been the usual routine to start each new day.\nMorning arrived all too soon, like an unwanted guest with no manners in Samantha Reid's world. For some reason, the sun and her boss seemed to be more interested and intent on taking the office with them. It was all a part of life.\nFive AM.\nThe phone rang, breaking into the morning's quiet, as she stepped off of the elevator onto the 13 th floor of the FBI offices in Columbia, South Carolina, the state's capital city\u2014with Nashville to the north and Greenville to the south.\nSamantha was an agent. A special agent. An FBI special agent with the Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia. She'd moved several times already in the years since the Bureau had first offered her a position in their field offices. Samantha had been assigned to a variety of positions and locations throughout the country as she had sought to climb the ranks within the FBI's ranks.\nAnd now she was in Columbia. There was a reason for that. Samantha had seen many cities and places during her career; she had studied their backgrounds, the people in her life who belonged\u2014and didn't. The people who were not to be trusted. It was an art and a skill she had long since learned\u2014and practiced.\nIn her own mind after such experience and training, there was no one better than Samantha Reid. There was nobody within the Bureau to be trusted with such secrets or details than Samantha Reid. As she sat on her bed in her home in Nashville, Samantha took out of her purse a piece of paper and a pencil. She'd written the person's name and address on the piece of paper. It sat near her as she looked across the room to the clock on top of the dresser. Five twenty.\n\"It's not much past five on a Friday morning,\" she told herself.\nShe reached for the phone and dialed a number, listening closely to the sounds of people as the phone rang. She waited as other voices came into the background of the phone, until she finally heard a female voice she had long since known and trusted.\n\"Samantha. Is that you?\"\n\"Yes, Manda. It's me. What's up?\"\n\"Nothing. I was just up thinking. Remembering. Good times, not so good times. But never enough of them. Do you remember that time at my club? I did a little dancing there with you.\"\nSamantha laughed. \"Oh, yes. That night in Vegas. Don't ever forget it. I got the feeling that weekend something was gonna happen.\"\n\"And it did. And you knew it. I knew it.\"\n\"How could you not have? Those were the hours you came around here and knocked on my door.\" Samantha's voice was soft. \"You were doing my hair, painting my nails. Anything you knew I liked doing with my hands. The hours leading up to those moments are still so clear. You showed up. You were there.\"\n\"You remember that?\"\n\"Of course I do. I just remember what you said to me. _This is going to be the last time that this happens, Samantha. Do you understand?_ You said it to me right after the two of them had killed that man. This was going to be the last time that this happens, Samantha. You knew. You understood. That night, those moments, you put everything into understanding. You believed\u2014as did I\u2014that you were in", "We must remake media. For the Web and its tools are now a platform for creativity, and creativity matters. We must redefine the terms of the creative economy, with content creation at its centre, and open up unprecedented possibilities to a new generation of creators\u2013especially a new generation of designers, artists, authors, musicians, filmmakers, and storytellers of all kinds. The question is not how can we defend an old institution of the book and the newspaper and film that is in danger of being undermined by a creative technology\u2013but how can we use today\u2019s creative technologies to make tomorrow\u2019s publishing more valuable across the full range of media.\n\u201cThe only thing that could stop us now is us.\u201d This was one of the slogans of a recent advertising campaign. It was designed to stir confidence at a time of economic recession and to remind people of the unprecedented possibilities of the World Wide Web. It worked.\nTo give a slogan the credit for a resurgence\u2013a return to growth and innovation in our industry\u2013is to put the role and value of creative technology in too simple and even too narrow a frame. Certainly, the World Wide Web and its tools are now a platform for creativity\u2013and at the same time, the toolkit of the web makes creativity accessible to a new breed of creators across the full range of media. The real challenge ahead lies in unlocking the web\u2019s possibilities for the full spectrum of creative publishing\u2013inspiring and supporting a new generation of creators, designers, artists, authors, musicians, filmmakers, and storytellers of all kinds\u2013and defining a new creative economy. For, as much as the old economy still matters\u2013and matters very much in terms of global financial stability\u2013there\u2019s a real question of whether we\u2019re able to define the real terms of economic value appropriately in a changing global market.\nIt\u2019s not just about technology; it\u2019s also about values. There is a moral dimension that has to do with the need for new forms of media, new forms of publishing, and new business models to support and sustain creativity in the face of an economic model built on and shaped by an industrial economy\u2013and, in that context, on a system of production that creates economic value around scale and efficiency. It\u2019s true\u2013as with any industrial system\u2013there can be great inefficiencies in the system, and huge waste. But it\u2019s also true that the very idea of value and scale and efficiency and return is different in a digital system. They don\u2019t work in the same way. And they didn\u2019t serve, from inception, the purposes they served in an industrial system\u2013to deliver the goods and services at the greatest value to the greatest number of people. In the industrial model, that system worked pretty well and generated much wealth and value over an extended period of time. But industrial systems have a very different kind of logic and value from those of the information age.\nIt\u2019s not just about technology, it\u2019s also about values. And this has real implications for the creative economy\u2013as I think it would for the value of any commodity in the same context.\nIn what sense can we understand something like the news in digital media terms if we consider it solely through the lens of traditional economics on the one hand, and the industrial system on the other?\nNews matters as the defining force of what it means to be human. The news is the place where people make sense of their experience and act on it.\nThe news is not a commodity.\nI argue that news is not a commodity and never will be.\nThe Web changed the meaning of news forever.\nNews became the currency of the Web, but no one can own it because for every atom of news every individual creates a unique piece of it (e.g., each story in the WikiNews, every blog posting, Flickr, Twitter, etc.)\nNice is a story, not news, news is not nice.\nThe value of the news is not defined by its monetary cost, it is the cost in human terms.\nTo be \u201cin the news\u201d implies social impact and is a measure of cultural power; news is \u201cworth what someone is willing to pay\u201d or as the saying goes worth a great deal or nothing at all.\nNews is always a story, it cannot be measured.\nIn news people make sense of reality, and the most important part of that is that people are involved in making sense of their world. It\u2019s the thing that gives news the human value\u2013the creativity and innovation, the human connection, the engagement of the human brain that matters.\nIf", "The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) is required to conduct a periodic review and publish the findings and recommendations regarding any changes in the rules or actions relating to the functions and activities of OASH activities. This is the second report on OASH activities and programs.

Newsbrand, formerly known as ZEIT Digital, has been instrumental.\n\u201cNewsbrand is a strong force on the german market\u2014so far it has been a big success,\u201d said Thomas Reutter, CEO of Axel Springer Digital in a recent conversation with me about the company.\n\u201cThe team has worked on the project for more than three years, always delivering innovative technology while developing an outstanding content offering. The team has become a major asset for the Axel Springer digital portfolio.\u201d\nNewsbrand was created three years ago, but in early February of this year all its members came under the corporate wing of Axel Springer Digital.\nThe Axel Springer Digital team, led by Thomas Sauerwein, has developed its digital news business by working closely with the editorial side of the business.\nSauerwein said that Newsbrand\u2019s aim is to create the German equivalent of The Skimm, a news startup aimed at millennials, and similar products aimed at the same segment of the population by Yahoo and several others. (See my column on The Skimm from last week.)\nNewsbrand is trying to develop a unique, engaging editorial voice that will bring in younger readers while also using the best of mobile tech to create a product that can be read on any device.\nThe results are apparent.\nReutter said Newsbrand \u201cincreased its unique users and page impressions by 40 percent last year, and the website is now the most-visited news site with its native ads.\u201d\nA big part of the team\u2019s success is its focus, which centers on offering the highest quality news possible no matter the platform. (For more on this from Newsbrand founder Sauerwein, see the video below.)\nI asked Sauerwein what the team\u2019s priorities are now that the Newsbrand team has come under the Axel Springer Digital umbrella.\nFirst, the team continues to offer a unique, mobile-centric news brand, based on a strong, engaging editorial voice, that is tailored to the audience that Newsbrand targeted as consumers.\nSecond, the team continues to work closely with handelsblatt.com to promote the brand and create best practices that can be relied on to help grow the business.\nThird, the team will also promote the successful approach to mobile news that Newsbrand has developed.\nNewsbrand is still a significant part of Axel Springer Digital, with all its resources at its command, and it continues to develop, grow, and lead its peer groups in mobile, native ad development, and innovative technology.\nNewsbrand is already the mobile news brand that Axel Springer Digital wants to be, Sauerwein told me, and the focus from Newsbrand on the company now is on pushing forward with mobile.\nAs soon as I was able to get Axel Springer Digital CEO Reutter on the phone, I asked him what newsroom technology developments he views as most important in the next three years or so.\nHe pointed to two areas, one already happening:\nEnsuring that Axel Springer Digital has the best, most capable, and most-flexible platform of any news organization in the world.\nThe other is to help Axel Springer Digital\u2019s newsrooms, which currently rely heavily (though not exclusively) on a traditional and costly WAN infrastructure, get away from those costs and onto an open network that combines multiple media and content delivery services.\n\u201cWe have started to do that already, and it\u2019s something we will pursue in earnest\u201d in the next three years, Reutter said.\nHe also described the mobile-first approach to news that Axel Springer Digital is developing, and its reliance on Newsbrand to develop that approach into a digital-first, mobile news publishing infrastructure.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.

He'd come to believe that only a violent revolution could avert environmental catastrophe, and after writing a 50,000-word book, sent it to major political figures. The book was called The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence and the Will of the People.\nThis past week saw another wave of protests over climate change, this time in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia. The People's Climate March was held in New York the day after the United Nations launched its historic climate summit, UNFCCC COP 21.\nA number of groups and individuals joined the march, including a coalition of about 150 indigenous groups of the Northern region of Africa, Asia, Canada, Mexico, and the USA.\nAmazon and Climate Change at the United Nations COP21 Summit\nHannah McKay from the UK's Independent newspaper writes: \"Indigenous chiefs with their red and blue feathers and beads marched through the streets to the United Nations summit this week to deliver a message of hope and action to save their homelands from the ravages of climate change. The delegation from the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC) spoke on behalf of some 400,000,000 peoples worldwide, whose numbers could swell by another 50% by 2020. They warned that we only have ten years to halt CO2 emissions before they climb over the safe level of 350 parts per million, after which time the planet will heat beyond a point of no return.\nTribal languages of Asia and Pacific\nTowards the conclusion of the IIPFCC Climate Change Tribunal in Paris, the delegation had the opportunity to be translated by their home languages; those words ranged from the melodious Chinuk to the guttural Nuxalk to the gentle Mayan. The tribunal featured 30 indigenous speakers speaking their native tongues about a rapidly changing planet in the face of climate change, with each individual speaking for just eight minutes. Each language was translated by the Indigenous Language Institute at Oregon State University, USA.\nThe tribunal began with a declaration by the IIPFCC's Council of Indigenous Peoples, and was supported by indigenous communities from Africa, Latin America, Oceania, Asia, North America and the Arctic, along with allied international organisations. Speakers included Indigenous community leaders Waneek Horn-Miller and Derek Nepinak, Nishiyuu elder Bernard Yawanawa, Greenpeace Arctic campaigner Ben Ayliffe, and IIPFCC leaders, and the delegation's declaration was signed by an estimated 75 indigenous leaders.\nAccording to IIPFCC, the message was delivered loud and clear that:\nThe climate crisis is a common concern for all indigenous peoples of the world who are already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 droughts, extreme weather events, floods and other ecological disasters, and the erosion of our livelihoods and food systems.\nIIPFCC warns that without urgent political intervention of the world's major economic powers we will witness catastrophic climate change that will leave indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural survival and food security vulnerable.\nIIIPFCC calls on world leaders to recognise the historical wrongs done to indigenous peoples of the world, to stop the climate crisis, and to honour their responsibilities to the earth and to humanity.\nIIIPFCC encourages the COP21 to build on the unanimous and urgent call by the IIPFCC Climate Change Tribunal and to call on the world's powerful to act immediately to halt and reverse the climate crisis.\nIV. Indigenous peoples of the world are calling for justice and action from the COP21:\n(1) A binding agreement from all world governments to endorse IIPFCC\u2019s call for a global moratorium and redoubling of the efforts of the international community to halt and reverse climate change.\n(2) The implementation of urgent measures from world leaders and governments to urgently halt emissions, and to fund and promote the rapid scaling up of renewable energy, agro-ecology and energy efficiency as well as the conservation of the world\u2019s forests, oce", "Mysterious objects are circling the Earth at light speed. Earth is not alone. It is among 70,000 planets or exoplanets like it, orbiting stars throughout the cosmos. While there are no known civilizations, extraterrestrial microbes may exist. What might they do if they ever get contact? In a new novel, \"Communion of Dreams,\" the late science-fiction writer Frederik Pohl imagines an alien invasion and an extinction. But not all life is lost.\nI had the opportunity to work with Mr. Pohl on \"Communion of Dreams\" shortly before he passed away in 2010. His novel is about the intergalactic invasion and the struggle to save humanity. It's science fiction with a strong social justice aspect about respecting life.\nMr. Pohl died of pulmonary fibrosis on Sept. 2, 2010. His final published novel, \"The Siege of Eternity, was a science fiction story with a theme of redemption and hope against impossible odds.\nI began working with Mr. Pohl in 2008 on an adaptation of \"Man Plus.\" The original science-fiction story deals with genetic engineering. His story is about an experiment in human evolution as a scientist and his creation search for their humanity. I am honored to have worked for two months on this project with one of the greatest science-fiction writers of the 20th century. We had our differences. Yet the collaboration made both of us better.\nI found Mr. Pohl open minded and willing to let me explore my ideas. He once told me that he wasn't a \"big fan\" of science fiction because he said, \"Amazing happens all the time.\" I enjoyed his attitude. I said to him that he would never be a successful screenwriter because he did not have a \"save the world\" kind of mentality. I challenged him to do something unique. It was a fun and enlightening conversation.\nI was able to create some visuals for Mr. Pohl to develop his story. I showed him the first set of images I created for his short story called \"The Pursuit of the Millennium.\" I was inspired by a painting called \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" by Peter Brueghel.\nThe story was about an \"elderly\" man (my interpretation) who stares out an airplane portal to the world. Flying for some mysterious reason high above the clouds, I created an image of the Earth from above the continents and the clouds that obscure the blue of the ocean below.\nI did not have any background to work with, so I researched paintings and photographs of the Earth from space. This led to my own visions of space, technology, and exploration of the planet. I then tried to merge the worlds of technology with nature.\nI remember Mr. Pohl's enthusiasm and excitement about my images. \"I had this vision, but you made it come together.\" With a handshake and the enthusiasm of an inventor, I felt like I'd done my job. (Mr. Pohl said to me a week or so ago that he had taken the print with him when he left.)\nThough I'm a newcomer to his world of science fiction, I feel that I've lost a great friend and a creative mentor. I will miss my monthly phone calls with him and his encouraging words.\nIt was a privilege to meet him in person, though I wish I had had more time to talk with him about the worlds we worked on together. He said he was proud of how I worked with the characters.\nCommunity is a big part of science fiction. Without the support of the science fiction community, Mr. Pohl never would have become the great writer he was. It is a big world. He wanted to share in it and help the next generation of science fiction artists and screenwriters. I, too, share my work and am always open to new ideas.\nI had not spoken with Mr. Pohl at all or received any payment for the two months of work done on \"Communion of Dreams.\" When I first started hearing rumors that he might pass away, I called him right away but he didn't answer. I left a message telling him that I loved his work and wished him the best. I wish I got the chance to do this live.\nI believe Frederik Pohl would have told someone to make this film in his honor. Somebody should tell his son. The film is an important story about the value of life, even in the most dire of circumstances. It is a story I would", "Increasing digital ad revenues are expected to help offset the decline in print ad revenue, according to a forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Forecasts 6% Decline in Magazine Ad Revenues Through 2017\nPwC released a report, entitled \u201cMedia and Entertainment Global Outlook 2013,\u201d estimating that worldwide advertising revenues within newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV are projected to decline approximately 6% from 2012 to 2017.\nMedia and entertainment leaders should prepare for the growth of digital media and a shift in advertising spending from TV to digital formats, according to the report.\nThe study noted that total U.S. traditional media ad revenues are projected to decline by approximately 8%, or $6.6 billion, to $72.0 billion. Digital media ad revenues will grow 3.5%, or $10.3 billion, to $299.6 billion.\nThe report stated, \u201cU.S. ad revenues of $72.0 billion will decline from $88.7 billion in 2012, but this reduction will be more than offset by the significant increase in digital media. The combined market is projected to grow to $361.6 billion by 2017, for a CAGR of 5.4%.\u201d\nAccording to the report, in 2019, the U.S. digital media portion of the advertising market is expected to hit 50%, where it will represent 10.7% of the total U.S. market. The percentage of U.S. TV ad revenues is projected to decline from 39% to 32% from 2012 to 2017.\nThe PwC study also forecast that the global e-commerce market is expected to more than double, from $1.7 trillion in 2012 to $3.5 trillion in 2017. Ad revenue is projected to drive digital growth, with a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017, and the overall ad market should increase at a 1.2% CAGR to $207 billion in 2017.\nDigital video revenue is projected to more than double from 2012 to 2017, and TV will see video revenue grow at a 5.8% CAGR to $135 billion in 2017.\nNorth America is expected to have the largest e-commerce market at $444 billion in 2017, the report noted. While Europe ($257 billion), the Asia-Pacific ($256 billion), and the rest of the world ($914 billion) are projected to have smaller e-commerce markets, their rapid growth is projected to make the Asia-Pacific the biggest market for e-commerce by 2020, and Europe the second-largest market that same year.\nSlow growth in print ad revenues was expected to continue. PwC stated, \u201cTV continues to grow slower than expected; the pace of decline in advertising markets is accelerating; the size and structure of the market continues to evolve and technology continues to disrupt the status quo.\u201d", "With the help of a mobile application, an Australian outdoor clothing store turned its most frequent customers into sales associates, giving them the opportunity to earn points via social sharing activities which could be exchanged for in-store vouchers.\nWHY IT WORKS: The application is a convenient and user-friendly experience, as there is no need to enter any personal information.

This\nprogram allows the category-based text messages to be sent by\nWireline Carriers to telecommunications customers who have not\nopted-out so that the category-based text messages can be\ndelivered even if the subscriber's wireless devices are turned\noff or out of range.  A telecommunications customer may opt-out of\nreceiving category-based text messages by providing one of three\nways for doing so.  The customer may state that the customer no\nlonger wishes to receive such messages or the customer opt-out\ntext message, or notify the Wireline Carrier directly.  As noted\nin the rules, the Commission will review this program in three\nyears to determine whether there remain any significant costs or\nother negative impacts related to implementation of the program.\nThe Commission requests comments on whether the program remains\nfeasible or necessary based on the customer opt-out rate\nobtained in the first three years of operation.

The notice contains revisions establishing temporary rules for the Federal-aid highway program.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark J. Smith, Federal Lands Highway Division, (202) 366-9692.\nOn January 11, 2005, FHWA published a document announcing the availability of an economic analysis of the temporary rules for the Federal Lands Highway Program (FLHP) and requested interested parties to comment on the temporary rules. FHWA will continue to accept public comments on the temporary rules through March 23, 2005. FHWA has extended the deadline for comments on public safety and traffic operations through March 10, 2005.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 206 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA, Public Law 102-240) directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish, as necessary, temporary rules applicable to highway construction, reconstruction, relocation, and demolition projects on lands owned by the Federal Government under the following conditions: When special conditions of safety or security prevent a notice of proposed rulemaking from being given; when necessary to expedite the completion of a project; or\nwhen it appears to the Secretary that a permanent rule cannot be reasonably issued before the date on which the emergency is terminated or conditions have changed as to require the permanent rulemaking. The temporary rules are effective for a period not to exceed one year from the date of publication in the Federal Register unless revoked. ISTEA also provides that temporary rules shall be published in the Federal Register and that interested parties shall have an opportunity to comment on the proposed rules. Furthermore, ISTEA directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations setting forth the guidelines that shall be followed in reviewing and commenting on proposed temporary rules.\nThe FHWA is adopting temporary rules as necessary to carry out the FLHP. These temporary rules will apply to projects on lands owned by the Federal Government on January 1, 2005 and will remain in effect through September 30, 2004. The provisions in 23 CFR 635.102 are effective immediately and will expire on September 30, 2005. The FHWA intends that these temporary rules expire on September 30, 2005. The temporary rules set forth the procedures to:\nComply with ISTEA and its implementing regulations;\nCoordinate reviews with the Federal agency that will award the work;\nComply with environmental requirements;\nPrevent potential roadway obstructions;\nPromote safety and economic development in the project area;\nCoordinate road conditions and highway traffic safety with local agencies;\nMonitor work progress;\nImplement and communicate temporary rules; and\nEnsure compliance with contractual terms and conditions.\nFHWA believes that the temporary rules are not an undue burden to affected parties because:\nIn general, the temporary rules are consistent with the process that is followed for FLHP projects;\nThe temporary rules have no significant economic impact on the States; and\nThe temporary rules will not prevent any States from undertaking necessary safety improvements.\nThe temporary rules are necessary to avoid disruption to FLHP construction contract work.

In addition, we learned that some of these incidents are reported as burns from fabric. In light of this information and our review of the available safety data, we have determined that burning incidents caused by appliances such as dryers and washing machines are likely underreported or misclassified as other types of injuries. As a result, the number of reported cases could be substantially underestimated. This is a significant concern, because burning injuries can have a substantial negative impact on a child\u2019s health and safety.\nBased on the information we have reviewed, we believe these incidents are likely more numerous than currently reported. As a first step, we are proposing to collect information on these incidents from the public and from manufacturers and importers of appliances in order to improve the estimate of the number of incidents, and more accurately characterize the causes of these injuries and their frequency. While not all reported incidents involve a child under 5 years of age or adult burns, we believe that these incidents are also likely underreported and that the data collected in this rulemaking will also result in better identification of adult burns as well.\nThis preliminary analysis of incidents reported to the CPSC and consumer\ncontacts suggests that these burns have a substantial impact on children and families. Many consumers report that clothing is regularly burned on their appliance at a frequency that is comparable to child burns. We believe, based on data from consumer contacts, that clothing is commonly scorched on appliances at levels that are sufficient to cause injuries to children and/or cause adult burns. Additionally, consumer contacts indicate that the frequency of these incidents is not a result of appliance misuse or other factors that may be associated with clothing damage during the normal life of the product, suggesting that these incidents represent appliance related events.\nWe have also reviewed the available burn statistics and other injury\nstatistics for the United States, and we believe the number of these incidents are likely significantly greater than is currently reported. Given the nature of these incidents, and the number and severity of the burn injuries they may cause, we believe that these incidents warrant an effort to improve the public\u2019s understanding of the risk, and to develop means to prevent them.\nWhile burns from clothes ironing and drying are known to be a\nsignificant contributor to burn injuries, we believe that this incidents involving applied home laundry equipment, such as washer dryers, dryers, and washing machines, may cause significant burns to children and should also be studied. These incidents, however, may be more difficult to classify or report as such; and the reporting of injury may not yet have included the category of appliances that is the subject of this petition. We have also reviewed the available burn statistics, and we believe that the number of injuries from clothing contact incidents with these appliances is likely significant, as is their severity. For example, based on injury data the burn injury rate for clothing contact with appliances appears to be comparable (or only slightly lower) than that for non-clothing contact incidents that involve these appliances.\nWe also note that there is some indication that the burn rates per child\nunder 5 years of age could be as high as 75, and even possibly as high as 100 for laundry and drying appliances, which would be roughly the same range as our petition requests. We believe that it is critical to develop a better understanding of these injuries, especially to children, and to take steps to prevent them.\n2011 was a record year in terms of children\u2019s clothing damaging and being pulled by washing machine motors and causing serious injury.\nThe CPSC is petitioning to collect data and information on children\u2019s clothing damage, and adult burn incidences resulting in an average rate of 258 clothing items per machine, or roughly 5000 items in 1 machine per week, resulting from 30 to 60 minutes of running.\nThe CPSC will attempt to obtain data on 100,000 children ages one to five from hospitals, health agencies and consumer-product makers.\nWashing Machines Cause Injury to Children\u2026\u2026\nhttp://shinybeastdaily.com/post/", "This is the first report from the first international symposium on the subject of the future of print. The idea behind the event, held in San Diego, was to invigorate the conversation and discussion over the topic. The meeting was designed to stimulate creative thinking and to encourage a diversity of voices, but the organizers also wanted to keep the discussions practical and applicable.\nNewspaper Next: The Future Print is the Future\nBy Bob Cauthorn\nApril is National Newspaper Month. I wonder if you feel it\u2019s significant that it is a national recognition month.\nMost likely, your response will be similar to what you just thought: It\u2019s an American event and shouldn\u2019t matter to us? What\u2019s so special about April, anyway? I don\u2019t get it.\nBut if you are a newspaper industry analyst, I\u2019m sure you would think much differently. National Newspaper Month is significant in the fact that the industry\u2019s annual convention is held during the same month, this year in Boston, just before newspaper publisher membership in the National Newspaper Association, the trade organization, comes to a close.\nIt\u2019s also when the American Society of Newspaper Editors meets for its own convention.\nFor better or worse, the month of April has become the industry\u2019s annual convention time, a time to gather, network, share ideas, listen to presentations on the state of the industry, conduct one or two official elections, and then, to top things off, gather one final time for entertainment before coming home.\nWhy does it matter what month the convention happens in? The media is filled with stories about the newspaper industry and its struggles, its losses, its reorganizations, its bankruptcies, its mergers, its sales, and its closings. All of this has been happening for quite some time. There\u2019s nothing particularly newsworthy about any of it, and yet, in newspapers\u2014and more than in newspapers, the local TV market and, increasingly, local radio markets\u2014it seems to have increased in late 2007 and throughout all of 2008. Why all this attention? That\u2019s hard to say for sure. The industry isn\u2019t a monolith as big and powerful as the automotive industry, but if there is a monolith anywhere, it is the newspaper industry. It\u2019s powerful in that the industry has a unique ability to impact the lives of citizens more than any other media. It is the news media, after all.\nThat being said, the industry has never come to terms with the changing nature of its product and its business\u2014its relationship to a consumer audience that expects to communicate, view, and interact with information in a variety of ways not currently being supplied by the traditional print news product. In one sense or another, the industry has never successfully adapted to the Internet.\nWe\u2019re not just talking about newspapers here, we are talking about all of them: the large metro, the large suburban daily, the small town daily, the medium-sized daily, the community weekly, the specialty weeklies and niche markets of our society.\nThe idea behind Newspaper Next is to get as diverse a group of our industry\u2014if that is even the right word\u2014together in one place for a period of discussion about newspaper issues and the future of the industry. As someone from a metro daily, we naturally gravitate toward these large newspaper issues. As someone who has spent much of his 25-year newspaper career with both weekly newspapers and one non-daily weekly, Newspaper Next is an important idea, one that I\u2019ve supported as both a participant and contributor since it began two years ago in the mind of Dave Armano and others.\nI am sure Newspaper Next will be a good meeting. It just might not be something that our industry should use to plan its next five years.", "This rule would remove regulatory language\nthat is duplicative of the Department's revised regulatory\nlanguage regarding the implementation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\nDATES: Public Inspection of Comments: All comments received\nwill be posted, without change, to http://www.regulations.gov, including any\npersonal information you provide.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn Jackson, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary for Federal Programs, 336 Neapolitan Court, Suite 429,\nMarlton, NJ 08053.

Taylor of the Knight Ridder Digital Institute has been asked by MediaNews Group to help coordinate the ongoing initiative.\nHe said, \"A key point in this initiative is to develop, launch and maintain a comprehensive online strategy at the Oakland Tribune that is tightly aligned with the daily news cycle.\"\nThe five-part plan includes:\nhttp://www.tribtv.com\nTo date, the initiative has focused on creating a news/community brand and online portal to help redefine the Oakland Tribune's community and serve as a portal or home page for readers.\nLaunched in March, 2008, the site includes news, community events, lifestyle, sports and blogs from the newspaper and other contributors. The site includes more than 50 columnists from the\n\"Tribune\" and throughout the Bay Area, and also features video and text contributed by readers.

While she sat down I waited for him to finish his phone call. A minute later his phone went off. He picked it up and looked at the screen of the phone but said nothing. I had hoped we could finish our conversation but it was now clear to me that this was Mark\u2019s priority.\nIncreased patient awareness\nHe then spoke into the phone saying loud and clear: \"OK I have it now.\" I asked him what he was talking about but he was already hanging up the phone. I asked him why had he been called from the ICU to another hospital room and he explained to me that this was all because of my newspaper as, the day before, the local newspaper had run a story about his condition. I was puzzled by this, but he then explained that the story had been on the newspaper's \u201cweb-site\u201d which he had just seen in the hospital and that it was now \"talk of the hospital\u201d\nThe day before, the local newspaper had published a story on Mark which had been picked up automatically by social media and was now \"talk of the hospital\". Mark's condition, it seems, was one the hospital\u2019s staff were interested in. The news story and the fact that the local newspaper\u2019s website was the sole reason for Mark and his wife being seen at the hospital.\nSuddenly I understood what the paper\u2019s online presence meant.\nThis was before we even had a mobile app. This was years before Facebook and Twitter and Whatsapp became a household name to young people. The message was very clear: the online publication and the \u201cweb-site\u201d were the sole reason Mark was having this conversation in 2014. Mark had seen the story, and this made the paper visible to him in this particular setting. Mark was the target of the news story and today he was Mark the reader, making him one of the two-thirds of Swedes who daily use the internet.\nMark not only found the news story interesting, he realized that the fact that he was seen reading the local paper at that moment, was reason enough to be seen by this doctor. Mark has a unique need to be \u201cseen\u201d in this setting. He has a very high need to be visible to others. It\u2019s a need he is willing to make compromises over. He needed to see the story because he wanted to be read and he had the opportunity to. Now, the local paper was to him, the sole reason he was in this room. The paper gave him an identity and value. Being seen in this way had become more important to Mark than the conversation I wanted to have with him.\nAs soon as the conversation was over, Mark asked if this was the last article on him and if this would be the reason he would be \u201cseen\u201d again during his stay at the hospital.\nHe was now free to be seen again by others as Mark the reader in a different hospital situation. He was free to be read about something else as Mark the reader.\nThe situation is like the way Facebook is becoming the sole reason young people are friends, even more than love or social responsibility. People have a very need to be seen by others. It is the main reason why an increasing number of young people think that it is better to not have \u201cfriends\u201d because then they cannot be judged and criticized without it affecting their own image of themselves in that community. It is the main reason that children are more insecure now in the classroom than ever before, and they are increasingly dependent on digital devices as the solution to the fact that they are a group of young people who are extremely invisible.\nThe newspaper was the only link between Mark and the outside world, and when he was seen through the lens of the media Mark knew who he was. This is how the daily needs for identity and significance is fulfilled, by having a voice that can be heard, and by being a face on Facebook that people can take as real.\nBeing read is the most important reason\nThe reason was that the story in the newspaper was the only connection that Mark had to the world, and it established his identity for this group, in this space. This is what gives the identity it needs, and gives it value. Mark is seen and known. Mark is real and important.\nThis is similar to the effect of online newspapers in this country. Newspapers like Metro and Aftonbladet are read and read in the metro, on the street, in the train, etc. They are the most important source of news people read on the street, because it is", "A few minor bug fixes...\n- New \"Edit\" link option (at bottom of each article) allows you to \"Edit this page\" to quickly edit the page, without having to navigate through options and save the page again.\n- New \"Edit this page\" link at top right of each article to \"edit\" the article.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in online newsrooms, publishers have a chance to move beyond advertising toward a newsroom model where people, technology, and data work together to create and distribute content.\nCN has used AI to redefine how journalism is created and distributed. By using AI for data management, journalists can improve user engagement, personalize news and advertising, and better understand what works on its platforms.\nThe AI platform is able to create stories with data that would take months to gather for the human editor staff at CN to do manually. The CN editorial team has 40 journalists and editors (including writers, managers, and data scientists) working with data-driven storytelling, content recommendation, and product development.\nOn the CN website, the AI allows readers to receive highly personalised content based on their location, interests, and reading habits. CN analyses and selects the stories for the reader. The aim is not to replace human editors but to add another perspective to the editorial process. This technology has resulted in new formats that are being introduced to readers. By using AI, CN can have personalised and relevant content displayed every day in the readers\u2019 newsfeed.\nAn interesting use of this technology has been to create a video that combines human storytelling and data visualisation. It is a video of eight hours of audio from the past 50 years, the footage shows eight hours of data that was compiled and put into audio form, which is then projected on a giant screen. The video\u2019s sound was sourced from the \u201cHuman Audio Archive,\u201d which consists of conversations of ordinary people and is used in storytelling all over the world.\nBernard Chazelle, one of the creators of HARP (a CN AI tool), talks about the power of algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses. These strengths and weaknesses need to be understood by brands and publishers as they look to integrate AI into their media strategies.\nChazelle is from Princeton and is the father of HARP and the creator of several AI programs used in numerous fields. He is also the cofounder of Google Apps. During an interview, he described several aspects of AI\u2019s use in the media and publishing world.\nChazelle said: \u201cI see lots of companies who are trying to use AI for content recommendation in books, music, and movies. They are trying to have data-driven decisions, which isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d He added that with more data and time AI technology is improving and developing.\nThe goal of the newsroom is to personalise each reader\u2019s content, says Chazelle. The reader\u2019s consumption of personalised content is also monitored so that in some cases, it will have to rethink its reading habits.\nChazelle said: \u201cPeople have always been suspicious of personalisation, I don\u2019t think it is personal when you are the only person looking at it. It really comes down to who is making these choices.\u201d He added that it is important that there are people at the other end who are trying to build a relationship with the reader.\nIn the age of fake news and social media, where users can create anything from any location, Chazelle said: \u201cIt is not just about giving information to a larger audience, it is telling a specific story. AI is used to build the data platform for specifics so that the story can be told.\u201d\nDespite the progress that has been made in the development of AI technologies, there will be challenges and hurdles that will need to be overcome in the years to come. Chazelle said: \u201cThe biggest challenge will be scale, but if you can manage scale and provide a personalisation that people can trust, it won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d\nFor now, brands and publishers must look to create and manage the data and the technologies that can support them and their readers as they continue to evolve in keeping with the changing world. \u200b\nPREV The Flip Side NEXT What Are the Advantages of Live Video Streaming?", "In this column, I focus on some key issues for the future of journalism (in light of recent predictions for the demise of traditional news media, newspapers, publishing, and television. These are all based on the idea that everything will be digitized and, accordingly, journalists will have to be more media savvy and flexible.\nI will also look at some interesting projects in Australia \u2013 one is a newsroom for the Internet, and one is a training program for journalists at the national broadcaster, which is a pioneer in multimedia journalism.\nFinally, I will refer to some recent projects that I am involved in, including a weblog developed for a new university on multimedia teaching and learning, a virtual online exhibition, and the launch of a website about new approaches to pedagogy in the digital realm.\nCOMMENT: In an earlier column, I reflected on the media\u2019s reporting on the \u201cimpact of digital technology on traditional news\u201d (Journalism Education Today, No.66, p175). In particular, I focused on the work of US media futurist Daniel Burrus.\nHowever, it seems that the media has not fully understood the impact of digital technology. I would suggest that the media\u2019s own use of the Internet creates a huge opportunity for journalists and other media professionals to interact (in an open and interactive fashion) with audiences who are interested in their areas of expertise. In other words, journalists need not be restricted to traditional forms of media and can be much more entrepreneurial and innovative.\nAccording to Burrus, traditional news in the US will be replaced by the following:\n1. Online newspapers and news bulletins,\n2. Blogs and podcasts,\n3. Niche-oriented news services (eg specific channels, etc.),\n4. News sites by organisations and institutions in the commercial sector (eg universities, hospitals, governments, corporations, etc.).\nHe also predicts:\n1. Online-only newsmakers (eg, the newsmakers are the citizens of the digital world via blogs and the like).\n2. Media and content aggregation: \u201cIn the real world, there are now more people and information available to us than we can absorb and process. Our need for information will not go away. But in the digital world, it will become even more important to have a reliable filter.\u201d\n3. Online-only content (eg, bloggers and podcasters).\n4. Online-only publishers, and\n5. Online-only broadcasters (eg, podcasters) \u2013 \u201cPodcasting will eventually eclipse broadcasting in terms of traffic and influence.\u201d\nBlogs represent a new \u201cpersonal\u201d media and journalism: people using a blog as a way of expressing their opinions, ideas and thoughts about things (blogs are open journals). The information excerpted and aggregated from a variety of sources in blogs are used as raw material for more informal, personal and opinion-based discussions, usually on topical issues, which are of interest to the blogger and to others interested in the subjects. Blogs function as a tool of individual reflection (they give the writer freedom to express themselves in a more spontaneous and organic manner) with a tendency for a more personal tone.\nThe blog phenomenon is gaining pace as a result of the \u201cfreedom\u201d afforded to the Web surfer. Blogs are an extension of Web surfing and reflect the culture and \u201cworld-view\u201d of the blogger, often giving an insight into the lifestyle of the blogger. Some people have tried to use blogs as a way of enabling others to participate in certain subjects of interest.\nIn an article in the Sunday Times entitled \u201cThe future of news is blogging\u201d, it was stated that: \u2018A new generation of bloggers are stepping in and becoming journalists of the blogosphere, a virtual world whose borders are fast disappearing and whose influence is extending into all parts of the web and into the media and political world and the world beyond. Blogging will become the new journalism' \u2013 \"a global view of world events told by ordinary people, from the streets of Afghanistan to your living room. Journalists are being replaced by the blogosphere. The blogosphere is made up of many blogs, each one representing the unique outlook and opinion of a particular journalist or \u2018citizen\u2019.\"\nThis concept has its advocates and has its critics. However, it could be said that, like its print equivalent, blogging is based more on the writer\u2019s opinion than on an objective assessment of the news event, and that blogs are sometimes more opinion-driven than not. Furthermore, the blog format and", "The amended exemptions would allow telecommuting for a number of positions across CBS, including writers, editorial producers, talent coordinators, segment producers, production coordinators, unit production managers, line producers, and associate producers. A new list has been developed following input from CBS personnel and employees of two other broadcast networks, NBC and CNBC, to clarify responsibilities at the various positions, so that the exemption is more consistent with the FLSA\u2019s rules. Other changes to the exemption would clarify what CBS means by \u201cfull knowledge\u201d of the employee\u2019s duties and ensure compliance with recordkeeping, notice, and certification requirements. Lastly, the exemption is being amended to simplify the recordkeeping process by updating the existing forms\u2014\u201cEmployee Record of Performance and Job Information\u201d and \u201cEmployee Leave Record\u201d\u2014to match current CBS internal processes.\nDATES: The amended exemptions to the FLSA become effective November 26, 2014.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, contact Dora Schriro, Corporate Director of Human Resources at the CBS Corporation, 151 West 54th Street, New York, NY 10019, (212) 975-5423.\nOn July 24, 2014, CBS Corporation (CBS or the Applicant) filed a petition, pursuant to section 17(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. 217(b)) and section 18 of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 218), to institute a new collective bargaining agreement, which includes a new and amended blanket exemption from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions for various executive employees, production staff that are part of the news department, and certain production staff working for CBS News or its affiliate, CNBC. The FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions are codified at 29 U.S.C. 207(a) and provide that \u201cno employer shall suffer or permit any of his employees to work in excess of 8 hours in any workday or to work more than 40 hours in any workweek, unless the employment is overtime work and the overtime work is outside of the employee\u2019s regular working hours or the overtime work is specifically permitted by section 207(k) of this title.\u201d\nThis notice seeks to obtain public comments on the proposed amendments. The comment period is expected to end on September 8, 2014. CBS may submit other modifications to the amendment to address comments from the public before submitting the amendment to DOL for notice and comment and subsequent DOL approval. A notice of approval by DOL will also be published in the Federal Register. Once DOL approves the final amendment, it will be effective nationwide for 3 years.\nII. Description and Justification of Proposed Exemption\nA. Detailed Description of Exemption\nThe Applicant requested and provided a detailed description of the proposed blanket exemption in its application. Under 29 CFR 553.25, this description is being published. The applicant\u2019s detailed description of the proposed amendment is reprinted below.\nThe CBS Corporation operates the CBS Television Network and television affiliates, CBS Radio, CBS Interactive, CBS Television Stations group, CBS Television Studios, CBS Entertainment and Cable Networks, and CBS Television Distribution, collectively referred to as CBS. In addition to these domestic operations, CBS operates the CBS Television Network, several affiliates, its radio division, CBS Interactive, CBS\u2019s Global Content Sales division, and CBS Outdoor, primarily internationally. CNBC and CBS News share production facilities in New York City and West 57th Street and operate in the broadcast news industry pursuant to separate FCC licenses issued on June 16, 1994 and August 10, 2010, respectively. CNBC produces business news content for NBC.\nAs of March 31, 2014, there were approximately 31,980 full-time equivalent employees who provide services for CBS. Of those full-time equivalent employees, roughly 26,000 employees are subject to the FLSA overtime and recordkeeping requirements. Because of the size and scope of the organization and the large numbers of employees in the CBS News Division, separate exemption requests have been filed with D", "The following notice amends the notice of waiver of certain requirements published on Thursday, September 24, 2015, (80 FR 57612) for which requests for a further delay of the compliance date were received.", "Revenues in first quarter of 2011 were US$ 1.0 billion, compared to US$ 823 million in 2011; Operating cash flow rose to US$6.3 million, compared to US$1.8 million in prior year period.\nDENVER, Colorado, May 9, 2011. Lingo Media Corporation (TSX VENTURE: LMC) (LMC: 3.79-0.00-1.12%) (\"LMC\") and its subsidiary Embrature, announced first quarter 2011 revenues of over $1.01 million versus $1.22 million during the same period in 2010. This represented a 7.1% decrease. The change was mainly due to a larger than anticipated adjustment under the terms of a license agreement signed in November 2010 with a major client. The first quarter of 2010 results included licensing revenues of $311,565.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were $791,002 against $458,045 during the same period in 2010. This represented a 61.9% increase. The major drivers for this increase were the following: higher compensation costs related to certain staff; development and production activities for ESL as well as additional travel and professional service fees. The first quarter of 2010 operating costs included one-time expenses of $215,167 related to the acquisition of Embrature and other start-up costs.\nOperating cash flow in the first quarter of 2011 was negative US$169,000, compared to a positive US$1.38 million in 2010. The cash flow change is primarily related to the cash used in operations of approximately $160,000 in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $1,352,000 in the first quarter of 2010, when the Company had no revenues.\nLMC also announced that current working capital rose to $768,166 as of March 31, 2011 from $273,766 on March 31, 2010. The increase in current assets is primarily due to the recognition of $564,292 resulting from the accretion of the redemption value related to the warrant issued to the founding shareholders of Embrature at the closing of the Embrature acquisition.\nRevenues in the first quarter 2011 were $1.27 million compared to $823,394 during the same period in 2010. This represented an 40.3% increase. LMC derived a large portion of its revenues from foreign operations, which totaled $1.05 million during the first quarter of 2011, compared to $582,270 in the same period of 2010.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were $748,512 compared to $394,486 for the same period in 2010. The increase is primarily the result of a major research project, which increased general labor expenses, development expenses for the Embrature program which went into production in the first quarter of 2011 versus limited development activities in the first quarter of 2010 and higher travel expenses.\nOperating cash flow in the first quarter of 2011 was negative $680,446, compared to negative $25,069 in 2011. The change in the operating cash flow results is the accretion of the redemption values, which in the first quarter of 2011 totaled $352,533.\nOperational Update\nAs previously announced, LMC's Embrature program is now available for purchase and download at all major online retailers, including Amazon.com, Apple's App Store and for the Android platform through Google's Play Store. The current price for the program under all platforms combined is $2.99, which represents a 50% saving from prior retail prices.\nLMC's Embrature program may now be previewed on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdK-WW333C0.\nLMC continues to", "A couple of months ago, the idea crossed my mind that there were a lot of interesting things I could do \"between\" my books--that is, in the gaps, between edits, writing.\nThere were many possibilities I could fill with things I find interesting, including the following:\n  * Read books about writing\n  * Read books about writing, writing, and writing\n  * Read books about writing and editing\n  * Research new techniques in writing\n  * Research and explore new tools for writing\nWhat would you do if you had this sort of spare time? How would you spend it?\nWhen I wrote this column, I immediately knew that I wanted to spend this time improving my skill as a writer and editor. Above all, I wanted to hone my craft, and the best way to do that is to have a lot of practice.\nI decided to take the idea one step further and create an experiment. For one year, as of the day I submitted my latest manuscript to my editor, I would challenge myself to write one new, publishable article every week. \nThroughout the year I would share this column with you, and we could have some fun together.\nIn this column, I will share my insights gained through this process of learning and publishing.\nI will share how I write these articles during the week, how I research them, and how I edit them using different techniques and tools.\nI will share where these articles have been published and how they have performed financially because I know you will love that.\nFinally, I will challenge myself to find one new publisher each month. If I don't publish that article anywhere I will share my insights and thoughts on why it didn't get published. I challenge anyone who wants to try this experiment to do the same thing I'm doing and see how you fair.\nAt the end of the year or even in a 3-, 6-, or 9-month period, publish the best-performing articles so we can review the results together.\nRemember, we're experimenting here to see if this is something worthwhile for everyone to do. As I mentioned earlier, this is something I find exciting and interesting, and I want to share it with you in order for you to benefit as much as I do.\nWhile I've only been doing this for one week, I can already safely say that I know this is something worth doing. In the first week, I already submitted an article and have it published. I could not believe how much time I used to create an article that is both educational and entertaining to my readers. My articles range from 700 to 1,200 words; I know, you may laugh, but to me, at least that is a very reasonable length for an article.\nI never realized before I started on this experiment that it was a long process and it certainly didn't take just one week to create these articles. While I'm still learning a lot, I'll continue to research new writing techniques so I can provide the best value and highest benefit to everyone, including you.\nFor the month of February, I am going to share with you the article titled, \"Can You Really Make a Full-time Income as an Author?\" I hope you enjoy this and that this inspires all of you to share your own publishing experiences with me.\nYou can comment on this article at the following Web site:\n<http://ThePublishingPro.com/Blasts/InBetweenBlasts>\n\"Between\" My Books Is a Challenge for All\nBetween books, between deadlines, between edits.\nThe time in between. The gap.

Signal phase was found to be\nthe operational parameter  which, in a majority of the\nexperimental studies,  appeared to have the most effects on\nthe  safety   of  the  intersection.   In  general,  longer\nsignals  resulted in fewer crashes at the intersection.\nHowever, other studies reported significantly more crashes\nfor  longer  signals;  the NTSB safety study concluded that\nfurther extensive research should be conducted before any\nfinal conclusions could be made.   The NTSB study  also\nfound that the safety of intersections was enhanced by lower\nlight  intensity,  or  decreasing brightness  of  the traffic\nlight's lens.\nThese  two results  -  the  beneficial  effect  for  longer\nsignals,  and detrimental effect for higher brightness - appear\nto   indicate   a  trade  off,  but  no  consensus  for the best\nsignal  phase and brightness has yet been established.   The\nNTSB recommended  that future research  be implemented to\nexperimentally study traffic lighting at  unsignalized intersections.\nIn  July 1992, UDOT's    Safety and Economics Office\n(SEO)   received   a   grant   from    DOT's    National\nTransportation Planning Program (NTES)  and set forth on  a\nstudy  of  unsignalized  intersections  and  their lighting.\nThe study was organized into five major tasks:\n1. Review of  Traffic Lighting and Unsignalized Intersection\n2. Review of   Traffic Lighting Operations at Unsignalized\n3. Review of Intersection Design at Unsignalized Intersections\n4. Experimental Studies\n5. Report Dissemination and Public Seminars.\nThe  first  four tasks  are  reported  below in this document.\n2.  REVIEW OF TRAFFIC LIGHTING RELATED TO\nUNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS\n2.1   Historical Perspective\nLighted   traffic   signals   first  appeared  in 1919 at an\nintersection  in London, England.   Over a period  of\nfifteen  years  they  spread throughout England  and\ngained world popularity.  Over the next thirty years\nU.S. traffic  light usage grew in tandem with that of\nother   nations   throughout   the   world.   U.S.  usage\ninitially  was  limited,  however,  to  large  urban\nareas, where the number of traffic  light intersections\nwas  greater  and  where  the  cost  of  signal equipment\noutweighted  the costs of installation at small  towns\nand unused stretches of highway.\nBy 1930, the U.S.   industry was supplying traffic  lights\noverseas,  and by 1935,  interstate highways were being\nbuilt in the United States.   These highways linked  the\nU.S.   together  and introduced a nationwide  culture  of\ntraffic  light use.   In 1940, it was estimated that 85\npercent   of  urban  intersections  in  the U.S. had   been\nlighted with signals.   By 1941,  the American  Highway\nAssociation  had   made a national push for  increased\nlighting of the nation's  highway system in order to  avert\nfatalities  and  ease congestion.   Signals  soon  began\nappearing in smaller communities  and on  new urban  high\nways.   In the 1940s, the American Association  for\nProgressive (Automobile) Highway Engineers (APHE) advocated\nthat  traffic  lights  and  signal  timing  be  used   to\ncontrol major flows of traffic.   The concept became known\nAS THE BLANE ACT,  FAVORING THE DELAY OF TRAFFIC BY\nINTERSECTIONS  WITH NO TRAFFIC", "WOW!

In other words, when people see that you have interesting and engaging videos, more of them will stick around to consume your content.\nThe more consumers hang out in your ecosystem, the more valuable your ad inventory becomes to advertisers.\nAdvertisers often prefer to associate their brands with video because video-based ads are proven to generate higher click through and conversion rates than static ads.\nIn addition, most major digital video players have introduced brand safety technology to their platforms, helping to ensure a greater level of video content protection.\nWhile the traditional approach to monetising video content is to run ads, there is a new and growing trend emerging across digital video platforms. This is what we call \u201cIn-Content Advertising.\u201d (or In-Stream Ads)\nIn-Content Advertising (In-Stream)\nThe ads are placed within a program or an episode, instead of being placed with in-program, pre-roll, or mid-roll video ad spots, giving marketers the ability to reach highly tailored audiences that share similar interests with their brand.\nThere is an opportunity for publishers to use this new approach to in-content advertorials (i.e., videos that advertise a brand or product) in order to increase revenue from their video content channels. These are not traditional video ads and typically, have lower ad load requirements, in order to maintain the audience experience and viewership. In fact, these \u201cadvertorials\u201d provide high-quality content to the viewer, giving them interesting information and providing a more personal, engaging brand experience.\nAnother upside, is that it creates a branded content video where your audience could potentially learn something new, get entertained, or share your video.\nThis trend is becoming more and more popular each day and we predict growth trends will only increase exponentially over the coming months.\nIn terms of the business results, using branded content to drive advertising can generate more qualified leads for advertisers and can help publishers attract more video-producing advertisers looking to expand their reach with in-content ads.\nThe question now is, where do you start with these types of ads?\nFirst off, your audience and their interests should be top of mind.\nIn order to be successful with in-content advertising, you\u2019ll want to start with your consumers\u2019 interests and target your content based, on those interests.\nAs a publisher there is a high likelihood that you may already know who your audience is.\nTo get started, create content to target your audience segments and then run ads for each of their interests. For example, as a food, gadgets or technology publisher, create an advertorial of your best recipes for your audience who are interested in food and wellness.\nYour audience is already engaged with this content, so why not tap into those passions?\nIt\u2019s important to note that in order for these types of ads to function properly, publishers should have a solid grasp on video metrics.\nYou should understand how many plays the video got, and more importantly, who are those people that viewed it. This knowledge will enable you to create a more compelling package for your advertisers and for the potential consumer who wants to purchase your advertised product.\nWhat to keep in mind with in-content ad trends:\nKeep your existing ad load standards\nIt is important to keep your existing audience\u2019s user experience in mind, so make sure to adhere to your established advertising load guidelines.\nBrand safety \u2013 You should only work with advertisers who reflect the image and core values of your brand.\nDifferent Ad Placement/Scheduling Opportunities \u2013 You should not only work with advertisers that fit with your core brand image, but also know that there are an abundance of advertisers looking to get their brand ads out to consumers with your content.\nThese advertisers can be placed strategically into content with different scheduling opportunities like", "As a means of increasing the circulation, New Media\nInternational decided a web-native video series and podcast featuring\nthe people behind the stories was needed.\u00a0 It was not enough to simply\npublish the stories on the page.\u00a0 In many print publishing\ninstitutions, the newsroom is still seen as the only source of news. In\norder to break down that silo and connect our content more personally, a\nseries was developed under the title, \"The Source.\"\u00a0 Each chapter\nfeatures the people behind the stories.

As an industry, we only really had to battle rival traditional products like broadcast media -- notably radio, but also cable TV when that became significant. Although our market was often quite fragmented, with different products competing for the consumers\u2019 minds and hearts, it was a relatively stable model.\nToday, the competition for consumers and advertisers is much more diverse and fluid. Not only do we have to contend with other traditional media products like broadcast television, cable TV and radio, but digital media products are often used in tandem with these media channels. The challenge is further complicated not only because many of our audience members consume multiple media products, but also because they take in information through multiple digital devices -- often simultaneously -- as they jump from website to blog to social network to video to smart phone app.\nIn the midst of all this change, the newspaper industry seems poised for a \u201cdigital disruption.\u201d While we are still somewhat better off than other industries, it cannot be denied that we face some pretty stiff challenges.\nThe big problem in this marketplace is that we have a product that is essentially an old-fashioned, slow, costly distribution platform, and at the same time a competitor in the digital space that is extremely fast, almost instantaneous, ubiquitous and free! Although other traditional media products have begun to move into the digital space, such as magazines and broadcast TV, they still have the advantage of being somewhat traditional media products. Their content is still delivered in magazine racks, and their advertising reaches specific audience segments defined by demographics. It is this last point that is significant.\nWith digital distribution, the entire market becomes much more competitive in multiple ways. The product must be free of charge, while content needs to be instantly available to readers. Advertising needs to be able to reach the broadest possible segments.\nToday\u2019s newspaper reader needs to constantly be provided with information, often with new information, often in ways that allow for a \u201creal-time\u201d experience, all on a platform that can handle large amounts of information, delivered through an accessible technology device. A newspaper\u2019s website must function in all of these ways.\nWhat a newspaper\u2019s print edition cannot do.\nIn their new book, \u201cThe New Rules of Marketing: How to Use News Releases, Blogs, Viral Marketing, and Online Media to Reach Buyers Directly,\u201d David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan state: \u201cIf there is a common denominator to news-release success, it is this: a news release can go viral because a good new release, whether electronic or print, can be so engaging that a journalist consumes the release whole-heartedly and passes it on to their readers.\u201d\nAlthough Scott and Halligan use this statement to demonstrate how to craft very well-written, interesting and viral content -- content that can travel from traditional to social media platforms -- the real point is that a news release is a great way to explain to consumers what a newspaper does, and it still works today.\nA newspaper\u2019s news release still works today.\nEven though a newspaper\u2019s print medium has certain advantages over digital distribution media, we still need to have a comprehensive understanding of the differences in terms of product, delivery and use. This understanding is vitally important in terms of creating a product that is able to respond appropriately to these differences. For instance:\n\u2022 Content - Newspaper readers do not expect to get any specific information through a news release; they are simply looking for information concerning an agenda item or a government meeting. In effect, they are looking for a summary of an issue or the results of a trial, for example. This content needs to drive print and digital traffic to the web site.\n\u2022 Frequency - News releases are now published in a wide range of media platforms including newspapers, websites and blogs. This allows for them to be published on a frequent basis. Although the industry has focused much attention on the number of times a newspaper runs a \u201cstory,\u201d the need and opportunity in terms of news releases is for a newspaper to increase its overall \u201cstory count.\u201d\n\u2022 Platform - In the digital space, this really means \u201cplatform count.\u201d One news release can be distributed online on several platforms. It\u2019s really a question of how much and how often, depending on the product. For a newspaper, it might be a matter of how many news releases are published on a wide range of platforms, including social media.\n\u2022 Immediacy - Content is often immediate and needs to be published \u201con demand.\u201d", "Widespread industry and consumer concern over the adoption of new advertising standards by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers -- the organisation that operates the Internet's domain system -- and the European Union Copyright Directive has contributed to slowing down the adoption of this controversial framework.\nIncreasing numbers of stakeholders, including the Association of National Advertisers, have expressed concerns over the Copyright in the Delivery of Broadcast and Online Services Directive (DVBOS) and the Icann domain name policy during the first nine months of 2009.\nOn May 31, the General Court of the European Union denied a preliminary injunction against Icann's new domain name policy, thus overturning the rulings of two lower German courts. The domain name policy has continued to cause concern. The European Commission published a review of the DVBOS on September 5.\nOn October 21, a group of 13 advertisers and associations asked Congress to intervene in the domain name policy.\nAdvertisers have been particularly concerned with the Icann policy, which is intended to create a set of procedures that will make domain name registration more transparent. Under current practices, an applicant can \"register\" a domain of any number of existing trademarks.\nUnder the new system, known as the \"Trademark Clearinghouse,\" applicants will apply for trademark registration through a recognised registry using the new \"International Trademark Classification System\" to obtain pre-approval from their trademark owners.\nThe adoption of these policies by Icann and the European Commission was originally expected to proceed forward on a strict timeline, according to reports by industry trade publications the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. The timeline, which reflected the political consensus behind the policies, was set when the policies were first proposed in October 2009.\nThe EU and US policies will provide a blueprint of a broader, global, agreement that should help eliminate the ability of Internet users to register domains based on the names of legitimate trademarks. Currently, Icann does not have the authority to make and enforce new rules on Internet domain names. Instead, Icann and the Internet industry are attempting to make these changes as part of an overall framework agreement, the Icann Improvement Process -- a set of voluntary recommendations from ICANN for improving the accountability and transparency of the Icann administration of the domain names system.\nUnder the Improvement Process, Icann is expected to take five years to complete these changes and put them in place under a transparent, multistakeholder governance process. It also appears that concerns expressed over the past year have added to the length and complexity of the timeline.\nMany people believe that \"ICANN rules on trademarks will affect the rest of the world\" according to the Financial Times.\nAccording to the Icann website, \"the introduction of the 2009 Proposed Initial Bylaw Changes was intended to provide an interim step towards the finalisation of the accountability framework, while in parallel a process was initiated to develop a comprehensive accountability framework that incorporated the 2009 Proposed Initial Bylaw Changes as appropriate\".\nThe Icann site's timetable said that the implementation of the new Icann system would happen first at the domain name registry level, and then the \"ICANN board will use the lessons learned from that initial experience to further develop the broader accountability framework\".\nHowever, in September, some stakeholders called for the implementation of the new rules to be postponed.\nThe Icann Domain Name Policy affects a broader issue than just the registration of domain names and trademarks, and has caused a rift among groups, according to the Financial Times. There are some who believe \"that the new rules might help Icann to develop a framework that ensures more effective governance and accountability for the Icann board in the future\".\nThen there are others who support the changes while also seeking to expand the role of civil society in ICANN meetings. However, there are also others who are concerned about the accountability of the ICANN processes. They argue that \"the new rules do not offer enough protection for trademarkowners concerned about the way that potentially infringing domain names are being handled.\"\nFurthermore, civil society groups argue that \"a lack of accountability could lead to abuses of the system while protecting existing markets from 'cyber-squatting'\".\nAn editorial in the Financial Times described the debate as a \"crucial moment for", "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening of asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors.\nEvidence review.\nA systematic evidence review on the effectiveness of screening for CHD risk factors in asymptomatic adults has not been conducted. The task force reviewed relevant original research, systematic reviews of observational studies (3 studies met inclusion criteria), randomized controlled trials (1 study met inclusion criteria), and evidence reviews of systematic reviews of observational studies and/or randomized controlled trials (2 sources met inclusion criteria).\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is the \"Grade A\" authority for preventive services within the health care industry.\nThe task force reviewed existing research related to preventive services. There was evidence available for coronary heart disease (CHD), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer. The task force found that for CHD, screening asymptomatic adults for CHD risk factors, using lipid levels, was insufficient to conclude a benefit or harm in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The screening test must be an effective predictor of CHD risk and provide clinically important benefit to the population. There is moderate evidence from several trials and from observational studies that screening for CHD risk factors can reduce CHD events. The current standard medical treatment for high-risk adults has been shown to be effective. Evidence-based national guidelines do not recommend screening as a way to decrease risk-factor prevalence.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the best evidence (studies in humans, controlled trials) and rated it low, moderate, or high in quality. The task force assesses the research and rates it according to the strength of the evidence.\nThe task force found that the evidence review is inadequate. However, the task force will continue to monitor the research in this area and update the summary as more evidence becomes available.\nThe task force reviewed all of the available evidence and determined insufficient to provide guidance on the effectiveness of screening for CHD in adults. The task force continues to monitor the research in this area and will update the summary as more evidence becomes available.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen all adults (aged 18 to 85 years) with a history of colorectal cancer for a second neoplasm. There is insufficient evidence that screening adults at increased risk produces any beneficial effects.\nA patient with a history of colorectal cancer is at increased risk for future neoplasms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force examined the evidence related to colorectal cancer from 3 major categories: observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and systematic evidence reviews. Of this evidence, the task force found 3 systematic reviews that evaluated observational studies and 1 randomized controlled trial, but it did not find any evidence reviews. None of the studies examined provided sufficient evidence to estimate the harms or benefits of screening adults for a second neoplasm.\nScreening results in an increased identification of small lesions and polyps that would not have led to malignant disease. The task force reviewed evidence related to the effectiveness of screening patients with a history of colorectal cancer from observational studies, systematic evidence reviews, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline and found insufficient evidence to estimate the benefits or harms of screening adults for a second neoplasm.\nThe results from the observational studies suggest that screening patients with a history of colorectal cancer is not effective in decreasing colorectal cancer incidence (3 studies met the standards for inclusion in quality assessment). Screening patients with a history of colorectal cancer is not effective in decreasing colorectal cancer mortality (2 studies met the standards for inclusion in quality assessment).\nScreening adults with a history of colorectal cancer with annual colonoscopy is effective in the detection and removal of adenomas. (4 studies met the standards for inclusion in quality assessment)\nThe results from the randomized controlled trials show that screening adults with a history of colorectal cancer produces uncertain benefits with more harm than benefit.

The important thing is to provide the best possible information to people seeking it.\nIf you believe that there is a single newsroom strategy to suit all publishers, it\u2019s time to take another look at the world in which we live. If you think that way, then I\u2019d suggest that you look for a few signs of what we are up to right now.\n*  The number of channels through which information gets to us will continue to grow \u2014 as will our need to access them.\n*  The speed of news consumption will continue to increase as the technology to deliver it becomes more readily available.\n*  The need for news will continue to increase as people grow increasingly busy and need their information delivered faster than ever. But their thirst for reliable information and advice remains as strong as ever.\n*  The way in which we will receive the news will change, but not cease to exist as a market for delivery will continue to emerge. For sure, some publishers will be better positioned to take advantage of it than others, but it will exist. But, crucially, it will take shape as a market for a very human need that will never diminish.\n*  Just as each publisher will have its choice of platforms or channels upon which to distribute the news, it will also have a choice of how it will respond to these changes and take advantage of them.\n*  Not all publishers will have the same approach to these changes. Some will be much more cautious than others in choosing to adapt a few aspects of how they deliver content. Others will be more adventurous or more driven and seek to exploit these changes as much as possible. But all will have something in common: they will deliver the news.\nIf we look back in time and see how newspapers have had to respond to other challenges than those of the current year, we see that they were either slow or very fast to react. Often they have responded to these changes by merging, forming syndicates, or closing altogether. But one thing is key: They have all delivered the next bit of news.\nWhatever happens, whatever strategy publishers end up choosing, I can guarantee you that the most important thing remaining will be the delivery of news.\nThe only sure thing in the business of news is that the demand for it will continue to grow, and it will not slow down.\nNews is what is and what was. It has no place to hide.\nBut the way in which people choose to receive it and the platforms over which they access it will change, and the needs of people receiving news will differ, depending on what they have done, what they have to do and also in the time that they have available.\nNot all publishers have to respond in the same way to these changes as it suits them to do so.\nAnd the question with all of these changes will lie in the ability of publishers to provide the information most needed by people as they go about their daily life.\nThe newsroom will be a very different beast in five years time. If you don\u2019t understand this, take a new look at just one of the news channels that is out there now. Look at the user interface and the speed it offers in sourcing and delivering the information you seek.\nNow, think back to the time when you had to call in around 7 a.m. to place an order for the newspaper. Can you imagine taking that same kind of approach if you were a publisher? That it may be necessary to react in this way is not a reason not to do so. The need is there.\nThe need for access to information and the need to get it will always be there. People will always need information about what has happened and what is happening.\nBut we will also continue to have a spectrum of approaches to provide it, and that will be down to the needs of the people seeking it and how they choose to receive it.\nThe challenge as publishers grows in the speed in which people find news, the platforms from which it comes, the speed of delivery and the range of information that those seeking news can have access to as they make a choice.\nTo do this in five years time is more than a significant challenge. To do it effectively is not an option.\nThe speed at which people seek news and the range and breadth of access to it can be provided by a publisher at a click or tap of a mobile device may not lie very far away. All you require to create the strategy that will help ensure this is delivered to you is to contact one or more of the consultants at the Future Media Solutions and we will be happy to point you in the right direction.\nPREV 3 ways your newsroom team can thrive in the digital age NEXT 9 trends that will shape", "If you have ever had a really bad idea, you might have a story that could make you a bundle.\nThere can be no doubt that the financial world is in turmoil.

And it will mean a lot to me if you will keep this a secret until the winners are announced.\u2019 (After that, Ed told me, she was his best friend.)\nMeanwhile, Ed made copies of the notices and taped them to everything he could think of - light switches, doors, windows - and one went on every bottle of beer and other beverages in his house.\nThen, not wanting to do anything that might cause him to be sued (even if it was for bad ideas), he took a bunch of copies of the typewritten notice to the U.S. Post Office.\nHe told them he was a \u2018good samaritan,\u2019 offering his services. The letter-carriers were happy. They found a use for the notices. The ones that got to the letter-carriers became \u2018Fish-Notices.'\nPeople in town - and a few outside - had noticed the bottle in the plastic bag on the refrigerator, and so they dropped off money for Ed all summer long, in the form of tips and gifts, some of it in $25 bill increments and some in $20s, and some from the people whose names didn\u2019t fit on two $20 bills, but who didn\u2019t care.\nAnd when September rolled around, Ed got a call asking him if he wanted any \u2018fish\u2019 that were in the letters and in the bottles that had not been found in the woods or the sea.\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just keep \u2019em. Send me any news paper \u2018fishing\u2019 stories you find.\u2019\nHe didn\u2019t expect to find the notices in the newspapers - but he did, and he got copies of some of them. And they included some things people didn\u2019t believe had anything to do with him.\nJennifer read the article about Ed, and started collecting articles.\nAt the end of July 1995, Ed was contacted by a couple of investigative reporters with the CBC in Winnipeg, who told him they were planning a news show, and they asked him if they could make a film - including him - about the notices.\nA month later, a film crew (with their producer, a lady named Linda) came, interviewed him, looked through all the notices, and shot some film. Ed said he didn\u2019t really feel like a star.\nIn the fall of that year, the reporters who did the story for the CBC were doing one for CBC-TV, and the producer, Linda, called Ed and said they wanted to do a second film, and they would \u2018pay\u2019 him, but it would be hard for him \u2018to spend the money.\u2019", "\"A person with a gun has control of the situation.\"\n(Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 06/04/00, p. 7A).\n\"I just don't know how you can say the right to keep and bear arms is important to our heritage.\" said\nCongressmen Bob Barr of Georgia, a firearms rights supporter. \"I have never supported it.\"", "A local paper's coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign led to a drop in print sales.\nIn August 2008, the New Orleans\nTimes-Picayune was running a major series on all of the\npresidential candidates, and asked that readers participate in the election-year debate.\nTo do this, the newspaper provided an in-depth forum on its Web site\ncalled \"\nProject RACE: Readers Answer Campaign Questions.\n\" During\nthe first \"Project RACE\" event, Times-Picayune readers were able to submit hundreds of questions for presidential candidates John McCain and\nBarack Obama. This question-asking\nparticipation led to a drop in newspaper sales.\nAccording to a report by the Times-Picayune, newspaper\nsales plummeted 18\npercent in the aftermath of the \"Project\nRACE\" online\nforum, and this\ndrop was not due to a lack of advertising in the print publication.\nIn order to gain an inside look at whether or not the \"Project\nRACE\" online\nparticipation affected print sales, the Times-Picayune interviewed 53\ncustomers who stopped by the newspaper's office the next day.\nDuring the project, the newspaper allowed readers to post questions online for a\npolitical candidate, and the participants were divided into \"McCain\" and \"\n\"Project RACE\" did indeed impact print news sales, and the Times-Picayune reported an 18\npercent decrease the day after the newspaper published the online series.\nThere were several factors that contributed to the drop in sales.\nFirst of all, the newspaper noticed that there were\nno new questions posted for Barack Obama on the \"Project RACE\" forum\nthe day following the local\npaper's coverage of the\nObama series. Many readers said that they felt as if they were \"taken\" by the Obama\ncampaign by participating in the online project. As a result, the newspaper reported a 12\npercent drop in Obama sales, along with a 36\npercent drop in all newspaper sales.\nIn addition, some Barack Obama supporters who had\nbeen asked a question by the newspaper were offended by the fact that they were not chosen to\nparticipate in the online debate because they supported\nMcCain. In this regard, a 15\npercent drop in Obama sales and a 25\npercent drop in\nall newspaper sales were attributed to the\noffended supporters.\nAs for print advertisers, a 43 percent drop was seen in local businesses that bought\nadvertising in the newspaper during the \"Project RACE\" period. And national ad buyers\nreportedly purchased fewer print ads to support their campaign. In\naddition, the\nlocal newspaper reported a 27\npercent decrease in\nsales during the 1 month that the New Orleans Times-\nPicayune covered the presidential campaign.\nThe local newspaper stated that these drastic measures\nreflected the fact that fewer individuals were using the\nnewspaper as a method of obtaining information. Rather, readers were relying more on TV, YouTube, web sources, and text messages.\nIn this regard, it was projected that sales would continue to drop, along with an increase in\nadvertising online.\n\"The Times-Picayune, for all of its many shortcomings, remains a\nvalued news source, but fewer people want a newspaper on their doorsteps,\" said John\nMcKenzie, dean of the Manship School of Mass Communication and a former TP reporter and editor. \"This is a trend that is occurring all over\nIn this regard, McKenzie went on to state that \"\nthis trend means that the reputations of TP, and other\nprinted publications, are falling. The only way to remedy the situation is to produce news\nand information that people are seeking and are willing to pay for.\"\nIn the last 2 years, various local newspapers have seen a drop in sales along with the increased use of online\ninformation. By\nadopting a more comprehensive online news format, media companies throughout the US are able to better\nattract younger generations.\nBased on the New Orleans Times-Picayune's study, it appears that there are still consumers who want to\nread a newspaper even though there are many other available options to absorb news.\nThis was shown by the fact that more than 1 00 people stopped by the newspaper office to purchase newspapers the day following the \"Project RACE\" forum.", "A young babysitter comes face-to-face with\nevil when she's called to a home where something\nREVIEW: \"A little girl is growing in my stomach,\" the\nmother tells the young babysitter. \"We don't want her\nto be spoiled. All we want is for her to be happy.\nThat's all we want.\" The babysitter is called on to sit for\nthe little girl, which is a job that suits her just\nfine; until she is given the unfortunate duty of\nlooking after a strange little girl who is the spitting\nimage of the little girl she's babysitting -- although\nshe's much older than the girl and looks as if she's\nin her late 20s or early 30s. Unhappy to leave the other\nyoung child with someone who is so young, the mother\nasks for a favor: since the other baby is a teething\nbaby and is a bit fussy and a bit tired, does the babysitter\nwant to take the other baby with her while watching\nher charge? Now, usually the babysitter would refuse\nthis request, but it's really for the parents -- the babysitter\nwouldn't be able to watch a toddler and an infant\nand, besides, she really appreciates the job. \"A little\nboy is growing in my stomach,\" is the mother's reply,\nthus beginning the horrible, slow build of suspense.\nTHE GIST: When the mother and her young charge go to\nthe store so that the mother can buy items on her list,\nthe babysitter has a chance to settle in. The little girl\nis quite a challenge, making it known that she has to\nhave a bath and that, and then she's hungry (but\ndoesn't want to have to eat until she's had that bath).\nEventually, she's given that bath and is then allowed\nto have cereal for dinner. At bedtime, an old woman of\ngreat height is brought into the home to sit on a chair\nin the other room on nightlight, and this woman says\na few words to the babysitter as she sits on the couch\nclose by. After putting her charge in her crib, the babysitter\nhears the strange little girl crying in the next room,\nbut the mother doesn't sound concerned about it.\nThe strange little girl doesn't stop, and the mother\nis in no rush to comfort her -- she goes back to reading\nher newspaper and only tells her, \"Go to the bathroom,\nHoney, and when you're done, come and get me.\"\nSoon, the babysitter is able to use a book to block the\nsoul from seeing that the strange little girl is coming\nmore and more often, sometimes not leaving because\nthe strange little girl makes it seem that it's easier\nto stay out than to go in. One night, after the strange\nlittle girl refuses to go away, the mother tells her,\n\"You're old enough to stay out here and look after yourself\nafter 11 o'clock now. You're getting bigger and bigger\nevery day.\" In response, the strange little girl lets loose\na shrill \"NO!\" and stands in front of the fireplace\nwith her arms out, one above the other like wings,\nshrieking, eyes white and soulless. On her face is an\nexpression unreadable in its meaning.  For long moments,\nthe strange little girl doesn't move. \"I'll be back in\nthe morning. You can wait up all night if you want.\nGoodnight, Honey.\" The babysitter is so shaken by the strange\nlittle girl that she hurries out of the house with\nthe young baby in tow, not wanting any other evil\nto overtake her.\nThe next day, the baby wakes up in the morning\nas usual and the babysitter goes to try to settle the\nyoung girl, but finds her gone. The mother comes down\nto the kitchen and, when asked about the little girl,\nsays, \"She's in bed. She's tired.

Although the Commission found in its Report and Order\nthat ``[f]or the most part, the industry . . . has been\nreporting and maintaining the information requirements in its\ndatabases [involving MSC-I and MSCII information] for some time,''\nthe Commission's intent is to ensure that information regarding\nrevenue associated with cellular, PCS, and IP telephony (i.e.,\ninterconnected and non-interconnected enhanced specialized mobile\nservice (ESMS)) services continues to be reported in a timely and\nconsistent manner, subject to any new obligations imposed on new\ninformation requirements by this notice. Such information would\ninclude, for example, revenues associated with voice and data\nservices offered on mobile communication devices and revenues\ngenerated using IP telephony service protocols. This proposed\nreporting obligation would be imposed on carriers that, as of June\n30, 2006, were providing enhanced services to subscribers under any of\nthe following circumstances: (1) They are reporting annual\nrevenue information in the Telecommunications Revenue Reporting\nSystem (``TRRS'') pursuant to the commission's biennial reporting\nrequirements described in Telecommunications Revenue Reports\n(Biennial Reports). The annual TRRS reports for voice services must\nindicate whether a subscriber's service bundle or line charge\nincludes voice service; or (2) they are reporting annual revenue\ninformation in the TRRS pursuant to the Commission's annual CPI\nindexing of the biennial TRRS report (for example, to capture\nincreased interstate and international traffic revenue attributable\nto data services).\nThe purpose of the proposed reporting obligation would be to\nassure that the Commission, along with other Federal and State\nagencies, has information needed to measure consumer demand for and\ndemographic attributes associated with these new enhanced\nservices, and to track the growth in revenues derived by carriers\nfrom these services. Data about these services also may be used by\ncompetitors and other interested parties to estimate revenue losses\nthat may have been caused by the presence of these services in\ncompetitors' markets. Such information would enable the Commission\nto assess the impact that new technologies and services, such as\nthose related to cellular, PCS, and IP telephony, have on the\nrevenues that carriers receive from their interstate services.\nAs this proposal envisions the reporting of revenue information\nwith respect to both interstate and intercarrier services,\ncarriers would report information regarding interstate revenues if\nthey are reporting both domestic and international revenues pursuant\nto the Commission's biennial TRRS filing requirement and/or the\nCommission's CPI-indexed biennial TRRS filing requirement under the\nprovision of Sec.  54.313(d). However, if a carrier only is\nrequired to file a biennial domestic traffic data report due to the\ncarrier's status as an information-only telecommunications\ncarrier or an intrastate switch, then the carrier would report, as\npart of a biennial TRRS filing, certain interstate revenue\ninformation and certain information with respect to enhanced\nservices that it is required to provide during the biennial report\nCopies of this notice are available in the Commission's electronic\nfiling system ``ECF'' under Docket No. 07-165.

Additionally, Rohit Malhotra, publisher-in-chief for the global programme, was the first person from the airline industry to be inducted into the prestigious American Society of Magazine Editors Hall of Fame.\nMalhotra has now launched the most ambitious project yet in Delta's history: Delta Magazines International, the first-ever global publication programme for a commercial airline.\nThe project is more significant than it might seem at first glance. Although airlines like United, US Airways, Emirates, Qantas, Virgin Atlantic etc. have produced some incredibly good travel-related publications, no one had ever taken the decision to scale up these airline magazines, and produce a global set of publications. Instead, airlines had focused on just the one magazine or on country specifics. The project was one of the first major efforts from within the airline industry to move away from the norm and challenge the status quo.\nTo execute this venture, Delta Air Lines has established an entirely new business unit to focus solely on its print programme.\nDelta's global print magazine programme has expanded on the editorial quality of its airline's magazine to develop into a global programme that has achieved a higher standard for its readers. By leveraging the existing assets of the original Delta Sky (Delta Air Lines' flagship magazine), Delta has been able to produce in-flight magazines across its 300+ global network with global relevance in just four years.\nDriven by the same uncompromising standards of editorial, creativity and design, Delta Magazines International produces some of the most engaging, unique and entertaining in-flight magazines in the world. They have a distinct look and feel that is unmatched by any other airline's in-flight magazine.\nMoreover, each edition of the magazine is locally relevant and customized for each local market and not merely a global rehash of the same content. As a result, Delta has produced magazines that are distinctively different from those in the aviation and travel space.\nAt the same time, Delta has become a unique in-flight magazine programme because of the diversity of its editorial focus. Its stories are not limited to just travel or food or the typical in-flight magazines fare. Instead, Delta editors cover a wide variety of topics that appeal to a broad demographic and cater strongly to business travellers who want to know about international business, art, culture, economy and more. Delta also covers international entertainment and celebrities who frequently use Delta to travel and, ultimately, become stars in their home countries.\nMost importantly, Delta has achieved incredible global distribution. The company has an in-flight magazine distribution system that outperforms virtually all other commercial airline magazines across the board.\nAs a result, the magazine has reached a staggering global readership of more than 4 million per month since launching in July 2006. With an average of 218 words of editorial per page and an average of 227 advertisements per page, it has achieved an average of more than 15 ad pages per magazine. In fact, Delta Magazines International editions exceed the average number of articles in its advertising pages.\nEditorial Distribution\nA strong distribution system is instrumental to the success of any airline in-flight magazine, particularly when it is targeting an international community on what typically is a once-a-month basis. In its early years, Delta Sky had the highest reach of any commercial airline magazine, in terms of its worldwide distribution. Delta Sky, along with its sister publication Skytrax, was read in more than 140 countries, serving more than 21,000 flights per month.\nNevertheless, D", "The proposed amendments would allow the\nDepartment to recover reasonable and necessary expenses\nthrough surcharges by creating a presumption regarding\nexpenses reimbursable by a surcharge.\nSURVEY OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING AGENCIES\nAgencies listed in the above column propose the\nestablishment, amendment or repeal of rules.

One of the reasons they appear is to be able to  use\nan organ or part thereof for experiments in an attempt to\nproduce the soul with a view to achieving their goal. This is\nan extremely dangerous activity that has been taking place\nsince centuries ago. In order to create the soul they need\nvarious parts including blood, semen, the brain (that can be\nobtained by piercing the back of the skull in that area of the\ntemple), as well as other parts that go along with the whole\nbodily structure of a human being. When the parts have been\nseparated, then the various methods are utilized to attach them\nto a computer. In this manner man\u2019s spirit is recreated and it\nbelongs to the Creator of creation, the Great Creator, the\nGod who created the heavens and the Earth.\nThe experimentations are done in an attempt to obtain\nknowledge, power and money. However the goal is to produce\nthe soul in such a manner that it is an exact copy of an original.\nThen man believes that he has made the soul or has\ncreated it from scratch and he worships and serves himself and it.\nAs far as we know, various organisms are being experimented\non. Also, they are able to do this to all other human beings\nwithout the person knowing it. They do this by placing a\nchip into you without the knowledge of the person as well as by\nusing various techniques to carry out such experimentation. Of\ncourse this is done without the awareness of the person in\nquestion. It is something that is being done right in front of\nyou and you are totally oblivious to it. They believe they are\nable to do this because man has no awareness over himself.\nOne person may do something for a couple of weeks and the next\nman will continue on in doing it and the following one and so on.\nThis is a very common activity among men who are into\noccult studies, ritualism, black magic and witchcraft. Also, it\nis among men whose desire is to achieve enlightenment or to\nenter into a union with God. Also, men are drawn to the occult\nin order to become a god or to gain immortality. They make use\nof the power for their own selfish ends.\nThese are all very dangerous activities and are extremely\ndangerous. However, they will continue to do it as they do not\nbelieve that they will be put in a position of judgment.\nFurthermore, they feel that they will never be judged,\nbecause they feel they can do this for a long time, and they\nwill never be found out and they will never be judged. But no,\nthe Creator knows all their actions. Even they are being\nobserved. They are observed by the ones who are watching over\nthe Earth. As well, they believe in demons, but little know that\nthe demons are no more than fallen angels. They are fallen\nangels who are working for the Great Creator, God.\nThese are not gods but angels. Because they believe in demons\nthey give this belief to us because we are the human beings, but\nin reality it is demons that are doing it. They are demons\ndisguised in human form. Of course, the demons are those who\nare involved in Satanism. Also, these are disguised angels\nwho are working secretly. They are involved in these\noccultic practices. They are involved in witchcraft, magick,\nSatanism and various occultic practices. They are also involved\nin some of the other things that are happening in the world,\nwhich they think will bring them to victory.\nWhat these devils of darkness are doing are various\ndevotional or spiritual practices that are contrary to what the\nCreator has instructed. This is being done so that all the\nvarious kingdoms of darkness are being summoned. All of the\nsouls are being used as the energy required to conduct\nmagick and similar occultic activities. This is all being done\nto acquire magickal power. To obtain magickal power is important.\nAlso when men become enlightened, this is one of the methods\nthat they believe they will gain magickal power of one kind or\nanother and it will make them very powerful.\nThey believe by using blood they will also gain another\nenormous magickal power. They also believe that by combining\nthe two powers, they will be able to make the soul\n(spiritual entity) become complete", "Newspaper.com CEO Fred Morin tells INMA Next he sees \u201ca convergence of online and print\u201d.

According to Forrester Research, magazine readers \"remain loyal to print\nmagazines, with 54% of all magazine readers ages 18 to 54 reading printed magazines, compared\nto only 13% of adults reading digital-only magazines. Magazine readers are more active than\nother types of media consumers.\"\nThis is especially true regarding affluent and upscale consumers. So it's surprising how overlooked such\nreaders are by marketers. According to the Direct Marketing Association, \"Consumers are\n93% more likely visit a store if they have received a printed piece from a brand they like than\nif they have only received a digital message from the same brand. \u2026 In this\nparticular study (and most certainly in others they've done), 80% of respondents\nnever read their mail online.\" MarketingProfs reports that the same is true for\nbill inserts http://bit.ly/sJyKb6, as well as magazines. http://bit.ly/wY9ZC5\nTitle: \"Newspapers' Relevance To Marketers Is Growing\"\nSource: 2009 Winterberry Group Newspaper Fact Pack\nAccording to 2009 Winterberry Group Newspaper Fact Pack survey of advertising buyers, it's no surprise 57% of national newspaper readers spend their advertising money in newspaper print editions. However, as you may imagine, digital and interactive formats continue to experience incredible growth and demand.\nAnd while the growth rate of online newspaper users and their spending has levelled slightly since the recession in 2007, the study reports 68% of newspaper online readers still spend a majority of their ad dollars in print products http://bit.ly/sZaJcJ.\nTitle: \"Newspaper Ads Still Drive Consumer Actions\"\nAs if you need another reason to leverage newspaper media to reach your target audience, a recent Ad Age study of 2,000 American consumers supports this strategy. The research shows newspaper ads are still the most effective channel for triggering consumers to take action, with newspaper ads reaching twice as many consumers as ads placed online.\nAccording to the study, 68% of newspapers' readers will likely buy a product or service based on a newspaper ad.

To address this question we have been working with industry through various\ninitiatives as described under the \"Innovation\" section of the website.\nMany of the participants from these initiatives, which include the Produce\nMarketing Association, the FDA, and industry associations representing specific\ncommodities and processes, are on the Advisory Council panel for this\ndiscussion section, and the Council has been able to bring a wealth of expertise to\nWHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?\nThe people who buy food are many. They include supermarkets and other\nretailers, wholesalers, restaurant managers and workers, schools, childcare\nfacilities, prisons, and nursing homes. We have identified three groups of potential\ncustomers: those working in foodservice, those at risk of ill health, and those in\ncharge of the food we eat, including health care providers, home cooks, and family\nA \"Foodservice\" customer is someone who works in the foodservice industry\n(either directly or in consultancy) who is involved with the purchase of food on behalf\nof an employer, foodservice enterprise, or the food-buying public. Examples\ninclude, chefs, caterers, foodworkers, restaurant managers, and even those who\nbuy raw ingredients and food products to be used in the delivery of food.\nA \"Risk of Ill Health\" customer is someone who, because of lifestyle or personal\nchoice, is at a greater risk of becoming ill. These customers should be\nparticularly aware of food safety risks.\nA \"Food Industry\" customer is someone who works in the food industry, regardless\nof what part this worker or contractor would play in the supply chain. This\ncould be a food safety specialist such as an inspector, a microbiologist or any\nother food safety professional.

This covers the supply side\nof the food industry.\nWHAT IS A FRESH CUT VEGETABLE?\nA \"Fresh Cut\" Vegetable is a harvested crop that is washed, trimmed, sliced\nor diced in a manner similar to fresh produce. Fresh Cut Vegetables can be\ninjurious to persons with cuts or abrasions on their hands because small splits or\ncuts made during their processing are at risk of becoming a portal of entry for\nbacteria. Fresh Cut Vegetables can transmit a number of foodborne diseases such\nas viral hepatitis, Listeriosis, Salmonellosis, and E. colibut they can be safe if they\nare processed correctly by the processor.\nHOW CAN WE IDENTIFY FRESH CUT VEGETABLES?\nThis is not always an easy challenge. Fresh Cut processing varies widely\namong producers. To help in this task there is:\n- A \"Fresh Cut\" Producer Checklist that we have developed to help producers identify whether their operations are fresh cut food.\n- A \"Fresh Cut\" Verification Scheme that helps validate the quality of the washing and trimming processes employed by fresh cut producers.\nThrough the \"Fresh Cut\" Producer Checklist we have found many examples of\nbusinesses who are washing vegetables, cutting and packaging them. We have been\nable to show that these businesses are not fresh cut business, and they have also\npointed us in the direction of others who are. We are hoping that this\ninformation will help with the identification and regulation of fresh cut\n- The \"Fresh Cut\" Verification Scheme, a new independent scheme to audit\nfood safety programmes (such as quality, procedures, cleaning and disinfection)\nin Fresh Cut facilities.\nDO WE TALK ABOUT FRESH CUT INDUSTRY FOR SUPPORT IN A STANDARDIZED\nWashing, peeling, coring and cutting produce, as well as cooking are\nactivities that can generate splashes, spatters, and juice/broth leaks.

The alleged shooter is a 57-year-old woman and her estranged boyfriend is a suspect. She also reportedly threatened to kill police who arrived at the scene. According to witnesses, many people in the clinic barricaded themselves in order to avoid being shot.

Among other activities, the public will be asked to suggest research projects that the CPSC should undertake to improve product safety and strengthen its product safety enforcement program. The CPSC is also requesting comments on the proposed agenda. The agenda has been jointly developed by CPSC staff working with the members of the Strategic Advisory Groups (SAGs) for product safety, product recall, and consumer fire safety. The full agenda is posted to the CPSC website atwww.cpsc.gov.\nThe agenda contains specific topics that the CPSC will consider for further study. The agenda is divided into three sections, focused on improving product safety, strengthening the CPSC's safety enforcement program, and the need for fire safety research.\nSection 1 of the agenda contains 12 topics that relate to the need for additional regulations to improve product safety. These topics have been divided into five categories: chemical hazards, flammability, electrical hazards, mechanical hazards, and other categories. For example, section 1, topic 12, states, ``The Commission should address the regulation of certain flammability hazards, including clothing fabric, bedding pads and covers, and toys.'' In addition, section 1, topic 1 states, ``The Commission should ensure that children's toys comply with the requirements found in the CPSIA to reduce the risk of lead exposure.''\nSection 2 of the agenda identifies six items related to fire safety research needed to address the need for better information on flame retardants, the effects of furniture cords, the effects of wallpaper, the development of new models and methods for testing smoldering combustion, the development of new heat transfer models for children's products, and the development of new models and methods for evaluating the risk factors associated with portable and stationary fireplaces and ranges.\nThe agenda also contains some additional notes in the form of sub-points throughout the 12 topic categories. One example of these sub-points is found in section 1, topic 12, which states,\nWhile bedding is generally self-extinguishing, bedding items can be ignited if improperly used. Thus, while bedding items are often low in flammability, they may still pose significant fire risks.\nThis agenda will help guide the CPSC and others in prioritizing research that needs to be performed to achieve the agency's overall mission, and thereby strengthen the national product safety system.\nSection 3 of the agenda addresses three needs in the areas of safety compliance and enforcement with regard to consumer products. Section 3, topic 9, states, ``The Commission should consider adopting regulations to allow CPSC access to information and records about consumer product safety that is now available through state agencies and from other sources.'' Sub-point 1 states, ``The CPSC should adopt regulations that provide authority to levy civil penalties against responsible entities for failure to report or failure to update reports on injuries and other incidents that are required.'' Sub-point 2 states, ``The CPSC should adopt regulations to make clear which consumers and which consumers' representatives have the right to information under state law through regulations concerning access to investigative information.''\nThe agenda is a joint project of the SAGs for product safety, product recall, and consumer fire safety. The SAGs identified broad topics and provided detailed sub-topics for those topics. Over 50 people attended a workshop on October 17, 2008, to discuss the topics. Participants represented the public at large and included academia, consumer advocates, manufacturers, and staff from NIST, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, FEMA, and NIOSH. These groups were divided up into three teams representing the SAGs product safety, product recall and consumer fire safety. Workshop participants focused on developing specific projects for each of the major sub-topics in each of the major topics.\nAfter the workshop, the three teams began the process of refining the initial workshop results to develop a list of proposals and then to refine these recommendations through a process of consensus in order to develop a prioritized set of research proposals. Some recommendations were subsequently revised as a result of the additional work. The team members agreed that recommendations that were inappropriate for inclusion in the agenda, unclear, not actionable, or outside of the CPSC's statutory responsibilities", "Investors and consumers have a different view than they once did and the media needs to shift its focus to the changing perceptions of brand power. Brands can use these changing perceptions to their advantage if they know how to do so.\nAuthenticity \u2013 Brands Can Build Trust by Being Human\nBy Drew Schutte\nPublished 7/22/15 in Advertising Age Mediaworks\nWhen thinking about your brand, do you think of a personality? Probably not. The perception of our favorite brands has changed over the years. As the worlds of advertising, marketing and media evolve, brands take on a more human-like identity, becoming more personal and authentic.\nSocial media has forced brands to become more authentic and human in order to keep pace. Brands have to be in touch with their consumers and their customers. This is no longer something that is just done on the back end; brands need to be more transparent, more human in order to thrive.\nOne way for brands to develop their personalities is to be more vulnerable and tell personal stories. There are brands who have developed successful marketing campaigns by sharing their vulnerabilities.\nThink of the campaign the Dove soap company launched back in 2006 entitled \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty.\u201d What they did was so revolutionary at the time they are still known for it today. Dove created a webisode called \u201cEvolution\u201d on YouTube where it featured a series of women of different races, sizes and ages comparing their faces to those of supermodels. There was a noticeable difference. This ad encourages people to feel beautiful and confident.\nWhen the soap company was first founded in 1956, Dove\u2019s tagline was \u201cA beauty for all women.\u201d After it became popular, it became more \u201caspirational\u201d according to a recent interview on Ad Age. Now it\u2019s \u201cbeauty.\u201d For the Dove campaign, it has to be.\nDove made a huge shift to be more authentic with their marketing. It was bold, it was risky and it was risky \u2013 it was authentic.\nSome recent campaigns that have employed the power of transparency are the Dominoes Pizza campaign and the Always Super Pad campaign. The reason why these brands did this is because they realized that authenticity was key. In each campaign, they tapped into the humanity behind each message and they have been successful at the cause.\nIn the Dominoes Pizza campaign, the campaign featured an actual chef making their pizza right there, in front of the camera. The authenticity was shown by using real people instead of hiring actors for the campaign. The Dominoes campaign uses these individuals to show just how personal they are.\nThis is a trend that brands should follow. Consumers and brand professionals are in search for more realness, transparency as it relates to the brands they use and consume. Brands need to be authentic and human without any of the gimmicks. This will only result with trust being built and that relationship is critical.\nConsumers are looking for this connection now more so than ever. With the increasing proliferation of social media, consumers are able to see into the lives of these very well-known brands and can see where they are at with their brands and their authenticity.\nThe rise of social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube has made it to the point where brands should be embracing these platforms instead of running or fearing them.\nThis is why brands should be using social media to be more authentic. The more a brand embraces this, the more they will get out of it. They can use these opportunities to tell these stories to build trust. It\u2019s very critical and it\u2019s the reason why brands use these tactics to their advantage.\nThe marketing communications agency FCB San Francisco had a campaign that they were using to their advantage. A commercial that they utilized was for Visa called \u201cThe New Cash.\u201d In the commercial, Visa tells its audience that it is the new cash and that it will never let them down. The spot ended with the statement \u201cIn every moment is a better moment.\u201d After, the spot ends with the logo of a local payments company on a screen.\nWhat did Visa do here? The company realized that transparency was key. Visa was admitting that there have been cases where people have lost their credit cards and have had people taking advantage of them. The commercial was to let the audience know that Visa will never let them down.\nThis commercial was a success. Visa\u2019s reputation went up with this advertisement", "The CBP Information Systems Project Manager (ISPM), will be responsible for oversight of project management activities, including requirements and technical development phases, risk identification, mitigation, communication and reporting.

On August 30, 1994, the Board\nissued a letter (1994-356) to request comment regarding a letter\nfrom an FDIC-insured depository institution, which, among other\nthings, discussed the possible negative effects that certain\nproposed transactions might have on foreign offices and branches\nof U.S. depository institutions.\nFEDERAL REGISTER, Volume 60, Number 226 (Tuesday, November 29, 1995).", "This case addresses whether the Department of Energy\u2019s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) properly prepared an EIS for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Initiative (EERI) as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the regulations implementing that Act. The Department of Energy (DOE) prepared an EIS as part of an application that EERI submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), which seeks to reduce the amount of electric power consumed through increased use of conservation and efficiency measures. DOE concluded that the increased consumption that would result from such measures does not constitute a significant effect and therefore does not require an EIS before OMB approves the application under the PRA. FERC disagrees with this conclusion, finding that the OMB application must be evaluated under the NEPA\u2019s EIS requirements rather than the PRA\u2019s information collection certification requirements. This case is significant because it clarifies whether the process used in developing the EIS and the accompanying EIS Report complied with the requirements of NEPA and the regulations implementing that Act.  FERC\u2019s order also clarifies the requirements of the PRA and the application process required of state commissions.

Additionally, the July 18, 2005, Opinion Order sought clarification of the application process of the PRA, including the scope and scope exception of the PRA, and the requirements of Executive Order 12866, which requires agencies to assess their actions for their effects on the human environment. An April 13, 2005, letter addressed FERC\u2019s March 21, 2005 Opinion Order in this proceeding, which posed the same questions.1\nEIS preparation is required under NEPA when an agency undertakes \u201cmajor federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a74332(2)(C) and (F). An EIS is a comprehensive report describing a proposed project and its potential impacts on the environment. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.4-1(e). The process used in preparing an EIS and any associated issues raised during preparation are required to be addressed in that document. See National Wildlife Federation v. Dept. of Energy, 708 F.2d 1523, 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\nThe EIS serves as the \u201cstatement of decision\u201d regarding the approval of any proposed major federal action significantly affecting the human environment. See 51 Fed. Reg. 19,679, 19,683 (May 27, 1986).

For many banks, the answer lies in applying emerging software as a service (SaaS) automation tools to streamline various processes across the organization.\nAutomating these services can help bank institutions to create consistency across the branch network, improve productivity and customer service, and lower costs. But, the most successful implementations require a clear strategy, which identifies a need for change (or \"gap\" analysis) before automation tools are implemented.    The gap analysis should provide actionable steps the institution can take to improve productivity and service, including assessing the current state, identifying the problem areas, and mapping out a plan to fix them. The result is an automation roadmap that includes process improvements, and the tools and technologies necessary to facilitate those improvements.   This strategy is a key first step to ensure success.\nProcesses that can benefit from these types of initiatives include, but are certainly not limited to, account opening, deposit processing, mortgage applications, credit card applications, and online lending.\nInnovation is a driving force of today's banking industry. Innovative solutions can be a source of competitive advantage for banks that invest the time and resources to develop them. Banks need to be proactive and aggressive when it comes to investing in products that enhance the customer experience and differentiates their institution from the competition.\nToo often, banks find themselves behind the eight ball when it comes to improving their processes and products. By leveraging customer behavior, market trends, and technological innovation, banks should be able to develop solutions that keep them on the cutting edge of customer service. Automation helps make this process smoother and more efficient.\nBanks need to understand the current state of the industry so they can identify the changes they need to make, and then determine how these improvements can be effected across the branch network.\nAn automation roadmap is a strategy that clearly defines the current state of all bank processes, as well as the steps to be taken to improve them. The steps might include: developing business cases, implementing processes, evaluating solutions, creating a deployment plan, and testing and piloting the technology.\nProcess gaps can often be discovered by examining the current processes, technology, and customer experience, and by determining which processes require improvement. Most institutions find it helpful to take stock of every department and its process in order to identify the process gaps. Once the gaps are identified, it's easier to take steps to improve them.\nIdentifying process gaps is only the beginning. Once a process gap has been identified, banks should take steps to improve it. A bank should begin with improving the process; then, they can determine the best tool that will assist them in achieving the goal.\nWhen it comes to automating certain areas within a bank, CIOs should understand how the changes will be leveraged across the institution. Each process has a different set of tools that are best suited to improving it. CIOs know that the best way to evaluate potential solutions is to test them first.\nWhen it comes to evaluating various systems, CIOs should first use their internal systems as the test bed so they can determine in which areas they're performing well and which areas could use improvement. But a bank's \"test\" should not stop by evaluating the effectiveness of these tools from within its institution.\nBanks also need to see how these tools were effective in the industry outside their institutions. Banks that are considering adopting enterprise-scoring software should look at systems that have been deployed successfully and in a way that has been proven effective.\nIt's also important to evaluate potential banking partners within the industry before adopting a solution. This process of due diligence should include assessing the viability, stability, and performance track record of potential banking partners, as well as verifying their technology.\nBut technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. A bank should also be certain that any potential partnership is a good fit for its strategic goals and vision.\nWith these factors in mind, it'", "A young man from a small town in Canada comes to the big city in hopes of getting a job, making good money, and impressing the girl that he is attracted to.\nMEDIUM: 4,000 words\nAUTHOR : Michael G.

To avoid it, Morton suggests that newspapers take action.\nNEWSPAPERS MUST ADOPT AN INTERACTIVE APPROACH\nDALLAS: As the Internet transforms publishing, newspapers must evolve to fit the new reality of the online world because digital publishers will overwhelm newspapers with endless supply of stories, according to John Morton, vice president of interactive strategies for the Media General family of newspapers. In a speech at\nthe Online Publishers Association Forum last week, Morton said newspapers are about to hit a wall of content overload, and will need to adopt an interactive approach to remain relevant in online publishing. \u201cPublishers will need to create content online beyond straight wire-feed news, but that content is not a replacement for\nnewspaper journalism,\u201d Morton said in his speech, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong and What\u2019s Right About Journalism and Why It Matters in the Online World. In the wired world, journalism is the context of information, not the exclusive source of it.\n\u201cOnline publishing opens up vast new possibilities for the content and creation of journalism. It is much more than a simple expansion of print and broadcast models,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its best new media content provides more choices for the consumer, and more opportunities for the marketer. It can create more direct communications and deeper connections among readers, marketers and information providers. In short, online publishing, journalism and media are about to transform dramatically.\u201d In his speech, Morton provided guidance to newspaper publishers to be successful online. He suggested online publishers adopt the following steps and cautioned them about overlooking these important decisions.\n1. The interactive nature of Web media requires publishers to be less reliant on advertising, according to Morton. \u201cOne of the key challenges for online publishers is to create an audience based business model, as opposed to a single event-based advertising based model. In other words, new media needs recurring revenue, and it needs to be earned by establishing an online relationship among the publisher, information providers and the\n\u201cOnline publishing provides much more choices for the consumer, and more opportunities for the marketer. It can create more direct communications and deeper connections among readers, marketers and information providers.\u201d\n2. Evolve from newsmakers to community connectors and make content the center, Morton said. \u201cContent, context and commerce will become the foundation for news and information on the Web. More than a half dozen recent surveys of Web users, according to Morton, reveal user behavior, and reinforces the central role of content among the three elements of online success. Most users are not browsing for information; nearly 80% of visitors spend less than one minute on the average news website. These are staggering statistics given that most online visitors will stay on the site for less than one minute. Most users go to the site with very specific intent; more than 80% of users access the Web to find information about products and services. \u201cWe are entering into the Web information era,\u201d Morton says. \u201cSearch engines are a powerful force in changing the online landscape. Search will become our primary information interface with the increasing popularity of new products like Google News and Yahoo\u2019s News Search. Increased consumer demand for more information on the Web will require newspapers to create and own an authority in a vertical space.\u201d\n3. Develop deep vertical niches and focus on the specific needs of vertical markets. \u201cThink of how you can use these niches to support each other as you develop your site,\u201d Morton says. \u201cThink about how these niches can extend the reach of your existing content, and allow you to offer content that could never be imagined five years ago. Think about new revenue channels, and new ways to target your advertising. How do you become the authority in your niche space?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow does your online presence feed your offline presence?\u201d He believes that most publishers need to decide on what vertical industries they will play in. \u201cEach vertical has unique requirements, but you can also leverage content between verticals. Leverage content by creating a series of \u2018vertical communities\u2019 that can cross between industries, such as healthcare and the financial industry. Consider a \u2018vertical newsdesk,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to grow vertically.\u201d\nMedia General is the second largest newspaper publisher in the United States, publishing 13 daily newspapers, 2 Sunday-only newspapers, 23 weekly news publications, 15 free community publications, 3 free monthly", "The US FDA has been focusing on developing a more scientifically-based system to assess the safety of veterinary drugs.\nEUROPEAN CHICKEN LIVE ARRIVALS: New data from Statistics Denmark shows broiler live arrivals by truck/lorry from the EU-25 decreased compared to the figures for the same period in the previous year.

Or could it be that we believe because that is what made sense to us from when we were very, very young?\nThe Creed of Mankind\nIs it possible someone in a dream was Jesus? Many people are told this, so it is possible.\nIt could happen. It could be true. It could be that you've finally been delivered into a religious awakening. But I doubt it.\nI would like someone to show me and tell me when and how to put my belief in someone that I believe is more than just an imaginary friend, is someone that would or should provide guidance after the death of one of our species that is considered more than just religion. But that does not work. If I am still alive, I will never really know.\nMy mother had cancer during the time when she felt close to Jesus, and he said he would heal her in two weeks. Her friends, and the pastor asked:\nM: Will he heal the cancer?\nJesus: No. It is a big enough battle.\nIf it were cancer and she needed healing, and then you could see cancer cells go away from the person's body (as they should) you would not think \"It's just an illness.\" You would know it worked.\nI never knew Jesus, though God said He was close. He was the father of Christianity.\nI am not talking here about a personal god. I am talking about a God that everyone believes in and has to obey.\nGod gave all of us the Ten Commandments. So that would have to be the most important commandment. How many times have you seen someone that did not obey any of the commandments--that you considered in your mind was the only true God, and yet they did some of the commandments?\nAnd they will tell you, either you are wrong or God knows what he is doing. Neither are true. God knows what he is doing.\nMost people, like me, will never know exactly what God is doing until after they die, and even then, even being with God. God tells you to give it up because you will never know this until you get to the other side of heaven.\nThe next commandment you don't want to disrespect is the Fourth. You might get some strange looks or get into a little trouble if you have something stolen from you.\nThe Third Commandment you need to be careful about is the Sabbath. If you have a problem there--then you would just have to be careful not to make too much work out of it. I have a little trouble--you will know when I am here and when I am gone and you will not get that wrong, I assure you of that.\nThen there are the other nine, and most of them are fairly logical and pretty much common sense. You will know if you will do that and be able to keep that in your mind, or not.\nI am not a preacher, so I don't have to be fair for everyone. I am just stating my personal feelings on this matter.\nYou will know Jesus to the extent you know a child's voice--or a little kid that has a big imagination, and wants to be involved in your life, because it just fits. It is like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle fitting. It seems to go together. It never goes together the first time. I understand this. I don't understand God much better. Sometimes we can put puzzles together in one try, and other times, we have to take it apart in many different ways to see if we can just find the one piece that will make everything fit together again. I know now there are some pieces that only go in one way, and then there are some that will fit in several different ways, and it is just like this puzzle that seems to have more pieces than actually have and it is not just enough pieces to do this one thing, so there are way more. They never seem to stop at one puzzle.\nThat is what it is like growing up in Christianity, knowing that God must be in the entire universe where He is supposed to be (as opposed to the other religion where he is sometimes in the universe on certain days, but the days he is not there, there are no gods), and you have to believe that He is in every single part of that universe, and if you go to heaven, it is everywhere and you don't miss it.\nBut you do start to question things. Even children do. One of the main reasons for that is that it is almost impossible to get a straight answer from anyone that has a good mind. They say yes one moment and no another. They do not understand what they are saying a lot of", "(1) A \"SUPER\" AND \"NON\" SUPER WORLD TRADE CENTER\n(2) COLLABORATING WITH HIDDEN FORCES BEHIND WORLD TRADE CENTER (3) SEPTEMBER 11: AN APRIL FOOL'S DAY EARLY OCTOBER\n( 4) WHO MAY BE TARGETED IN THE FUTURE\n(5) DO NOT ATTACK YOU!\n( 6) ARE YOU AN \"END-TIME\" PROPHET?\n(7) PUTIN'S 11:26 TIME OF ASTUTE\n(8) SHAKE INDUCED SEISMIC EVENTS\n(9) NEW WTC 7 \"SHEFFIELD\" DOCUMENTS LEAKED\n(10) JACKIE GLEASON, JACK RUSSELL\n(11) WTC SURFACE TOP STAGE COVERS\n(12) \"TOP OF THE TUNNEL\" READS 1590 GALS OF OIL RELEASED ON SEPT. 11 - WHICH IS VERY LARGE!\n(14) THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH PROCESS THRESHOLD\n(15) RESEARCH GENERATOR AREA 51\n(16) DO THE MATH: 11 + 11 + 11 = NOT 33 - BUT 33x3\n(17) MUTATION: WTC 7 TOTAL DESTRUCTION ASSESSED\n(18) SECRET MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG GARAGE REPORT\n(19) SECRET STAND-DOWN TAP DANCER BILLY\n(20) SECRET SEVEN OF ISRAEL WHO WANTS THE SECRET SECRET SECRET!\n(21) RESEARCH WILLARD HELDERSLEY STORY IN GERMANY\n(22) WTC 7'S ETHERIC TILT: PUTIN'S 6/29 SIGNATURE OF\n(23) NUCLEAR \"TUNNEL\" OF WTC 7\n(24) TOLLERANT SURVEILLING EGOS FLIR THREE, FOUR OR FIVE?

This is what you\u2019ve been waiting for. Sure, there were many other tablets before the iPad. But for many of you, the iPad was the first \u201creal\u201d tablet. And with the iPad Mini now having a Retina Display, they\u2019ve finally caught up.\nThe iPad Air is thinner, faster, and lighter. It also has a fantastic screen, a really cool camera, lots of storage, the latest in technology, and it\u2019s just a joy to use. Like many tablets, it\u2019s got a touchscreen that\u2019s as sensitive as our fingertips. But it\u2019s also got a lightning connector to connect to your keyboard and accessories, a headphone jack and speaker holes, a rear camera, and a front-facing camera.\nThere\u2019s some bad news about the new iPad Air, of course. It starts with the price. As with the last models, you\u2019ve got 32GB for $615. To add 16GB of storage, you can get 64GB, but this is almost as much as you would pay for a Macbook Pro. It\u2019s a lot to ask for a 128GB tablet and $785 is expensive.\nYou can, however, add 128GB of storage, but that also costs $785. While this may seem expensive, if it\u2019s expensive enough people just won\u2019t buy it, simple as that.\nHowever, it\u2019s not as if they don\u2019t make a cheaper model. Not really. They\u2019ve got both old iPads. There\u2019s the 16GB iPad Air for $485 ($465 for students, but $485 still seems like a lot for a 32GB iPad). It\u2019s smaller, it\u2019s cheaper, but is less appealing. Then there\u2019s the 64GB iPad Mini for $465, and the iPad Mini now has a Retina Display - it\u2019s small and cheaper, but it\u2019s also lower resolution.\nEven with the Retina Display, the iPad Mini can still be a problem for some people. It\u2019s smaller, and it has a lower resolution which means that, while it can be read and seen by most people, it\u2019s not really good for reading or watching shows.\nThey also have the iPad 2 available for $685. The iPad 2\u2019s 16GB is, while a little expensive, better than an extra $30 for the 128GB iPad Air. The new 128GB iPads are about $300; the iPad 2 64GB is $385. The 32GB iPad 2 is $355, but you can get it for $300 if you\u2019re prepared to sell some of your old gold.\nIf you do have some gold, you can sell a few chunks of it (50 grams is perfect) on GoldSilver for around $1000, which, even compared to the low-end iPad Air, is almost two to three times as much as the iPad 2 32GB.\nThe new iPads are thinner, smaller, have Retina displays, are faster, better looking, are more expensive and less appealing.

The Commissioner ordered the State Board of Equalization to examine the financial records of Inglewood Power & Light Company, Incorporated, to determine whether partial reimbursement should be granted in an amount which reflected the actual costs incurred by the City of Inglewood.\n3. The City of Inglewood, through the State Board of Equalization, requested reimbursement for the appraisal period 1962 through 1964 in the amount of $93,960.00.\n4. The City of Inglewood did not timely file its Notice of Completion and Request for Payment. The Request was filed nearly 20 months after the commencement of the hearing. This was done despite the City of Inglewood's knowledge that a Notice of Completion and Payment Request must be filed within 90 days of the issuance of the Notice of Hearing. The Commissioner directed the State Board of Equalization to proceed in the manner outlined in their Order of November 17, 1975, with the result of this direction appearing as Order and Decisions No. 42,026.\n5. The State Board of Equalization determined that the Request for Payment met the requirements of Order No. 8586. Further the State Board of Equalization determined that partial reimbursement should be granted to the City of Inglewood in the amount of $93,960.00.\n6. The Order and Opinion filed on September 8, 1976, set forth the State Board of Equalization's reimbursement recommendation as follows:\n\"Approve the City of Inglewood request for partial reimbursement in the approximate amount of $33,000.00 in accordance with Order of 11/17/75.\"\n7. The Commissioner's power to reimbursement a party for its costs is set forth in Public Utilities Code \u00a7\u00a7 771 and 1000. The statutes provide that the Commissioner \"may reimburse, upon proper request and to the extent of his findings in accordance with law....\"\n8. The State Board of Equalization, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, determines cost for each property and for which reimbursement is requested. The Commissioner's reimbursement order is issued to the party that filed the request for partial reimbursement of costs. The Commissioner's order and decision set forth the party being reimbursed and the amount of costs to be reimbursed. The Commissioner determines the amount to be reimbursed based upon his determination of the proper amount of costs incurred by the party making the request for reimbursement.\n9. The State Board of Equalization has the responsibility of recommending cost to the Commissioner upon the request of a party. Once a party has requested reimbursement the determination of the amount of the award will be at the discretion of the Commissioner. Section 1000, subdivision (a), specifically grants the Commissioner the power to authorize reimbursement upon the application of a party to the Commissioner. The only restriction provided by statute is that reimbursement not be granted to a \"party\" which is defined in the Act as \"including any officer, employee, agent or attorney of a party...whenever so designated by such party in any written application for such reimbursement\" [Public Utilities Code \u00a7 1000(h)]. The requesting", "The paper is reporting on an official from a government agency. He would have the right to privacy which trumps the paper's right of publication\n\"Papers as well as books have a first time publication right that can be extended\" writes attorney Gene Policinski. But there may be an exception.\nThe United States Supreme Court has held that a person's right to privacy takes precedence over the First Amendment. So that means a court might rule one-time publication of an elected official's name is not permitted. As for books, this would only become an issue if the disclosure was made as part of a book deal.\nThe most often quoted case is \"Bunting v. Allen\" (1965) in which the state of California passed the Right to Finish Law of 1965 which allowed a student to return to a school in his or her senior year after dropping out for one of several allowed causes. But, if asked, the student had to explain the \"good cause\" for dropping out. This violated the student's privacy.\nThe Supreme Court found this violated privacy in this case, although it was overturned during an earlier decision. The Court of Appeals did not.\nMost state Supreme Courts have upheld the privacy right -- although there was some debate because the state legislature had passed a law restricting newspaper advertising of this information, and newspapers wanted this to be used as a precedent to also restrict the information available from public records.\nThe state High Court in New York ruled in 1994 that \"the right to privacy includes a right of reputational seclusion\" in a state \"statute that prohibits a newspaper from publishing certain information taken from the New York state public records database.\"\nThe Supreme Court has also held in a 1979 decision that \"right to privacy in the workplace\" was not upheld.\nThat is a \"mistake\" by the Court, said Policinski, \"there is a privacy law in the workplace but it was not used.\"\nIn a 1997 decision, the Supreme Court overturned a decision by the state of New York not to release certain data taken from state public records. The court found the state of New York had violated a state citizen's right to privacy.\nA state court ruled this week that \"a court may consider the First Amendment right of the press to publish information in the public record when weighing whether to compel disclosure of nonpublic information contained in the public record\" to the news media.\nWhether this would apply universally hasn't been upheld, and would be argued if needed in court.\nThe other issue here is newspapers. If an individual sued a newspaper, a court might decide not to allow an individual who was the subject of a one-time news article to sue a newspaper.\nIn a 1995 case, a high school headmaster sued \"the New York Times over a column which he claimed disclosed confidential information and tarnished his reputation.\" The court ruled \"a high school headmaster whose name was used in a published New York Times article about a controversy at the school had a 'substantive privacy interest in preventing disclosure of his name' but the paper's interests in publishing the work outweighed the principal's.\"\nThe court ruled the headmaster could not sue the newspaper.\nSo, in short, privacy laws may trump the First Amendment in situations where there is a disclosure of a one time disclosure of a person's name.", "In the spring of 1993, a 28-year-old German man went to a doctor to show him a strange lump in his right testicle. He had seen other Germans in the hospital with other lumps and had not really thought much of it until he realized that it was still enlarging. The doctor immediately sent him for biopsy. A month later, the test result came back: He had testicular cancer. The man was lucky enough to have not had cancer spread to his lymph glands or the rest of his body, but the cancer still grew so fast that doctors removed his right testicle right away. The cancer had already grown so fast that the lymph glands in his left side were now swollen. So doctors removed his left testicle shortly after that, and also his prostate and the area around the prostate. About two years later, even though the cancer was not really gone, doctors said that he was cancer-free. The doctors decided that he did not need any more treatment because there were no signs of cancer, and besides, doctors now knew that he had a strong chance of surviving more treatment. When doctors did a follow-up test after the cancer went away, they found out that the cancer had come back (recurred) a second time. They felt that they got it all the first time around, and the cancer had never spread to the lymph glands or his body, so doctors decided to try a third time. This time the cancer came back in the very same place on the right side (right testicle) of his stomach (abdomen). They performed surgery right away and decided that the man was cancer free for the third time, and that they would let his immune system do the rest. They did not give him any more treatment, and he stayed that way for almost two years. The cancer had not spread and he had no signs of cancer anywhere else. The cancer came back one more time after this, however. Doctors felt that they got it all the last time around, and that the tumors would stay small and not spread, so they decided not to do more treatment. The man is still cancer-fee. The cancer in his testicles was very aggressive but luckily had not spread to the rest of his body. It was lucky that doctors discovered it before it had spread. In about five years there were no sign of cancer, but the cancer eventually came back again. It is possible that it came back because treatment has not erased the cancer, but maybe it could have come back anytime after treatment, like when a person feels a lump after cancer treatment and is told it's another tumor. Testicular cancer may take years to come back unless it is very aggressive as in this case, but it probably will. There is always that possibility, no matter what cancer. As for his testosterone/estrogen level, doctors said he may have a low level of testosterone, because his left testicle made very little testosterone, and maybe because of the cancer and the radiation treatment to the groin and abdomen. If his level was really low, it could cause fatigue, but also decrease sex drive (libido). Testosterone is considered the basic sex hormone in males and is needed for a man to be masculine and physically and sexually attractive to the opposite gender. If a person has low testosterone, he can still have sex, but a man should not worry that it will stop production of testosterone. That's not the case. There are also creams out that help with the same problem. Testosterone could cause a sudden increase of hair growth in certain areas, or it could decrease sexual desire. In the case of the man, he did not feel anything was wrong, and he was still functioning well in other ways. So testosterone probably does need to be tested, and doctors also said he does not necessarily need treatment. As for the fatigue, he seems to be okay with treatment, but he might get tired some time from the treatment because it uses a lot of energy, maybe, but that might change in the future. As for his sex hormones, since his level was normal, and doctors did not think it should be changed, he did not need any treatment and would be fine. He might have low testosterone because he was weak, but it did not appear to be that way, and there is no need for treatment except for the fatigue they say is caused by the radiation. As for his libido (sex drive), perhaps he was not excited by this problem and he was fine. There is no need to treat him for this problem, except he is on steroid, which is the opposite of testosterone, and since", "Fuel Prices Flat\nThe Energy Policy Act of 1992 created a new federal diesel tax rate of\n10c/gal for vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances.  This\nincrease in diesel tax rates was not designed to raise revenue, however,\nbut to increase the use of cleaner burning diesel fuels in an effort to\nreduce air pollution and improve the quality of life.  Since its inception\nabout two years ago, the federal tax exemption has only raised approximately\n$1.8 million in new diesel tax revenues nationwide, resulting from a\ncomparatively small number of new federal tax exemption permits issued.\nThose dollars have been used to fund state diesel emission reduction\nprograms and offset diesel emissions from local and state fleets which\nreceived waivers or used federal and state grants to convert to alternative\nThe Internal Revenue Service believes that the federal tax exemption\nhas contributed to the recent rise in the use of diesel fuel in\nfirefighting and local government vehicles, as well as in new\ndemands for federal tax exemptions, particularly in California.  As\npart of a new effort to curb this growth in demand, the I.R.S. has ordered\nthe states to collect a 3% user fee for state diesel fuel taxes, which\nwill be used solely for diesel emission reduction programs.\nIronically, fuel prices have remained relatively flat this summer,\nwith the exception of the West Coast and some parts of the Northeast.\nFuel retailers on the West Coast are struggling to keep pace with the\nhighest record diesel prices ever. California diesel has risen above 78c\nper gallon recently in parts of the state.  In addition to the taxes that\nmust be paid, in some parts of the country diesel could run anywhere from\n65 to 75c.  California's demand for diesel fuel continues to climb as\nsevere fires destroy several thousand acres of forests every hour.\nFirefighting and local governments use between 400 and 500 million\ngallons of diesel per year, and fuel costs the California Department of\nFire & Forestry about $26 million in fuel annually.  With the exception\nof some areas of the West Coast, most other locations are suffering from\nslightly lower prices, but in some parts of the Northeast prices can\nhover in excess of 70c per gallon. The New England states have become\nmajor users of E10, in part because of rising demand for ethanol fuel,\nbut primarily as a result of the region's higher than usual fuel prices.\nA new law was passed earlier in the month which has been designed to\nenhance motor fuel quality by reducing contamination.  The law, which\nshould become effective in the spring of 1995, will establish\nperformance and purity specifications for highway diesel fuels, while\nencouraging the introduction of reformulated gasoline nationwide.\nThe Energy Policy Act of 1992 also called for federal research to\ndevelop diesel gasolines with 20% and 25% biodiesel blends by the\nsummer of 1995.  The U.S. Army, in tandem with the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, and several academic institutions (Cornell and Oregon State), have\nbeen researching these blends and have been studying engine power,\ntorque and performance characteristics of these blends.  The U.S.\nDepartment of Defense is investigating the use of 100% biodiesel blends\nin the Department's military diesel engines.", "The CCC 1987 Recommendations state that physiotherapists will be\nresponsible for ensuring quality of life rather than its extension.\nPROMOTING HEALTH AND ENHANCING PATIENT QUALITY OF LIFE\nPhysiotherapists will take a leadership role with other health care\nprofessionals and patients in promoting health and enhancing patient quality\nof life.

For years, Cox Media Group (CMG) has led the news industry in its use of mobile and social technologies to help our newspapers, Radio, and CMG Direct, our media sales division, reach and engage customers, readers, viewers, and listeners to meet ever shifting marketing needs. It\u2019s no wonder we have more than 12,000 apps \u2014 30 apps in the Top 100 overall and 25 in the Top 50 \u2014 covering news, sports, lifestyle, weather, traffic, and more for our local markets.\nCMG\u2019s flagship publication, Atlanta\u2019s the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) \u2014 which has an extensive suite of mobile and social technology applications \u2014 launched its first tablet edition more than a year ago. Although tablets are a relatively recent development, the mobile industry has always been at the vanguard, and the AJC saw this as the next logical step. A tablet edition would create an experience that went far beyond what a mobile app can offer, allowing subscribers and/or advertisers to see rich, interactive news on the device, without the necessity of an Internet connection.\nThe AJC\u2019s tablet edition is an innovative, high-quality digital product that keeps its subscriber and advertiser bases at the forefront with the most advanced products and services in the marketplace. Our tablet product also meets CMG\u2019s commitment to deliver news and engaging content to consumers in whatever form best fits the audience. We can now deliver all of the \u201cnews you can use\u201d to tablet users: national, local, sports, business, entertainment, and the weather at their fingertips for the best reading experience on a screen.\nWe knew that creating an AJC tablet edition would require a coordinated, dedicated effort between all facets of CMG in order to meet every stage of the process, and that launching a tablet edition would be an even longer journey than a typical app. We developed a tablet edition \u201croadmap\u201d that involved all phases of the planning, development, and post-launch monitoring and improvement that are essential to executing a tablet edition with success.\nRoadmap for a tablet edition\nPlanning: 2-Month Process\nConduct initial meetings with key stakeholders to determine the project\u2019s scope. Decide whether the tablet edition would be a paid or free offering, whether it will be offered on the app store, or whether it will live on a microsite outside of the app store. Discuss how the tablet edition complements CMG\u2019s efforts in the existing digital space.\nWork with CMG and AJC digital teams to set expectations for the tablet edition\u2019s lifespan and features. This includes building an interactive prototype to start establishing a design, user interfaces, workflow, features, and functionality.\nRepresentatives from CMG, AJC Product Development, Design, and Editorial departments, in conjunction with CMG Digital, must finalise the project roadmap, and determine key milestones related to both development and user testing.\nOnce a tablet edition is approved, the roadmap becomes an official project plan. It outlines all of the key milestones and activities. The milestones must be followed and all associated work must be completed \u2014 or at minimum, communicated clearly ahead and behind the schedule \u2014 to ensure the highest level of success for the project. This includes how and when milestones will be completed (or if milestones need to be completed at all). As with any development, you may end up dropping features, deadlines, and resources in an effort to meet the target launch date.\nDevelopment: 3-Month Process\nDevelopment is where the bulk of the effort will be spent on the tablet edition project. CMG and AJC developers build the tablet edition, but as with all tablet apps, they must be built natively. Therefore, there are a few factors that become critical:\nEnsure all of the apps will run on all devices that can be envisioned in advance \u2014 including what might not yet be commercially available on the market \u2014 in case", "The Board proposes to exempt the\ntelecommunications services of a carrier providing\ntelephone service subject, among other things,\nto compliance with the rules prescribed by the\nFederal Communications Commission.

He also appeared to have been talking to someone called 'Hitler' about how he was going to kill foreigners and send them to 'Hell'.\nThe suspect appeared to have been shouting that he hated Islam. That was before we arrested him.\nHe was wearing a waffle shirt.\nHe was carrying a rucksack of nails and a tube of petroleum jelly.\nHe had also been talking to someone called Jesus.\nAsked if he was religious, he said, 'God was made out of wood'.\nWe have to admit he took us by surprise.\n'I didn't know we'd be talking to a Christian this morning,' we said.\n'No one told me that Christians were still allowed to do anything in this country,' he said.\n'Them as don't like Islam are called 'Nazis' and 'Fascists'.'\nWe apologised to him and offered him a prayer. He said he didn't like prayer. His favourite place was the Arms Fair.\nWe apologised and said all faiths would be treated fairly and that he would be safe in this country.  He said America is more safe than that.   He wasn't even American.\nAsked about his name we got his address wrong and had to apologise and then ask him again.\n'Don't worry,' he said, 'It's me I've apologised to. I've never apologised before.' He shook hands with all our officers.  I said, 'We'd like to take down your statement, but you're not under any arrest,' and he said, 'Well, my arrest is my statement.'\nThe London Mayor later said he didn't think the suspect should be taken seriously, adding, 'I think that those people who are coming into my city and say they are going to set off a bomb are often disgruntled types who have problems and feel that they have been mistreated \u2013 and probably feel let down by some kind of society.' I don't know exactly what he meant but I thought it sounded reasonable.\nSoon after our arrest of the suspect the London Underground was resuming normal service.\nWe would like to inform you that we have arrested a man near Downing Street and have searched him for an improvised explosive device that may be about to explode.\nWould you like to know more?\nHe also had some nails, a large amount of petroleum jelly and a rucksack stuffed with nails.

So far there is no information on whether any others may be involved in this bomb plot, as the suspect appears to be a  single-minded man. There is no evidence of a wider network at this stage.

The campaign, a first of several to come during the upcoming Gulf oil spill cleanup, was designed to help ease public fears--with a tinge of humor--as \"the country came together to deal with a disaster.\"\nTHE BATTLE: In the 10 days leading up to Father's Day, BP ran the online BP Dagger campaign that featured a video promoting the brand's commitment to clean up the Gulf, along with a glowing red sword embedded in the sand that viewers could spin. The first BP Dagger video was so well received that BP created eight additional spots, including one designed to generate social media enthusiasm with a free-for-all tagline-writing contest and another for its charitable foundation, both housed under the \"Clean it up. Pay for it\" brand mantra. BP also gave away a \"real\" BP Dagger used in the campaign to the campaign's \"Fan of the Day.\" In its first week, the campaign racked up 3.2 million unique visitors and more than 700 million impressions, helping to bring \"a lot of positive feedback from the public,\" said Andrew G. Meggs, BP's VP and managing director.\nThe social buzz was significant. \"It far exceeded everyone's expectations. It went from a small effort to a massive effort in a few days,\" Meggs said. The campaign earned $8 million in ad spend, an uptick that exceeded BP's expectations. BP also saw a spike in new customers, but for the sake of confidentiality will not reveal more than that it was \"significant enough that we did not just dismiss it as noise.\" The campaign is planned to air on cable TV through August, and other elements will continue to hit the social media landscape through June and July.\nTHE VIDEO: BP's first effort, \"Clean it up. Pay for it,\" featured three women sitting in white beach chairs on a crowded Louisiana beach watching a giant sword plunge through the sand, leaving a halo of red, as if it had just been pulled out of the Gulf. They continued to sit under the sword, unperturbed by it, despite their friends' screaming and rushing for cover or their cell phones. There were three versions of the video that featured the three women in different situations ranging from a couple watching baseball on TV to \"Golf Girls.\" The golfers are shown getting their photo taken in front of the BP Dagger when suddenly an envelope falls out of one golf bag. The three women quickly run over to the envelope to see if there's any money or more golf balls on the grass. Then the third golf girl says, \"Maybe we should check under the Gulf of Mexico.\" The golfers all look at a giant sword plunging into the sand and a bright red halo hovering above it. The women quickly recoil before the golfers run over to take photos with the BP Dagger.\nWHO DID WHAT: The campaign was created by BP and WPP Group's ad and data insights agency, GroupM, with Mediacom, GroupM's media buying unit, serving as agency of record. WPP's 24/7 Real Media and Blue State Digital provided online ad buying services for BP.\nWHY IT'S A WIN: BP spokespeople said the campaign was designed to address the negative headlines about BP, reassuring consumers with BP's commitment to clean up the Gulf in the face of a disaster. Meggs said the first few days of BP Dagger yielded a \"respectable\" increase in BP's Twitter followers and the YouTube page posted the top 20 views, including 16 that were \"gold\"--meaning they were the 20 most popular clips during the campaign--one silver, two bronze; the top three were the \"Clean it Up\" effort, the \"Golf Girls\" effort and the \"Mom's House\" effort involving kids talking about their safety at home with Mom. Those top three efforts had a total of about 1.8 million hits, Meggs said.\nMETHOD: Campaign began with BPDagger.com, a site created for the campaign. The site includes an email address, BP", "From the moment it was published a month after the attacks, The New York Times has been providing news and information about the terrorist assaults. These are some of the stories. Readers who are looking for news and information specifically about how the terrorists attacked the United States on Sept. 11, or who want background information about the al Qaeda organization, might be interested in the \"Terrorism\" section of the Times Web site at www.nytimes.com/top/news/special/terrorism/.\nOVERVIEW: A great deal has emerged in the past month about the terrorist attacks, including details about their planning and execution, which are still coming to light. The Times will be bringing these stories to readers in the months ahead. Here are some of the highlights as of Sept. 21:\nDetainee Describes Attack by Pilots\nSept. 15, 2001: A detainee from Algeria at a U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, said he knew one of the suspected hijackers, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and was present when several of the attacks were planned. He described Mohammed as a \"leader,\" and offered a description of the flight training of at least two of the pilots involved in the attack.\nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed.\nSept. 11 Plotters Sought to Escape U.S.\nSept. 13, 2001: Some of those accused of mounting the attacks are suspected of plotting to hijack other planes or to enter the United States afterward in an effort to elude justice, and then perhaps go to a new location where they thought they would escape detection.\nOne pilot, Marwan Al-Shehhi, who was a member of the group that apparently hijacked the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, took a pilot training course in Florida with two of those later accused in the attacks, and he is believed to have had extensive familiarity with that state. Another attacker, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who has been accused in the bombings of two embassies in Africa, bought a plane ticket through a travel agency in South Florida that also booked flights that one of the hijackers used to travel in the United States, and an agency in Florida may also have booked tickets for another attacker after the attacks.\nDetails Released on Hijacked Flights\nSept. 17, 2001: The cockpit voice recorder contained on United Airlines Flight 93 captured the last words of pilots CeeCee Lyles and Jason Dahl. A recorder aboard American Airlines Flight 77 recorded a conversation between three of the terrorists just before the plane was deliberately crashed. The voice recorder of United Flight 175 that crashed into the South Tower contains a recording of a flight attendant explaining that there was an emergency.\nSept. 17, 2001: The Bush administration released a transcript of a 20-minute telephone conversation between Osama bin Laden and members of al Qaeda, in which the terrorist leader expressed satisfaction with the attacks and called on them to \"do good.\"\nSept. 17, 2001: In a message distributed online, Khalid Shaikh Mohamed referred to the attacks as \"the final stage of a series of blows\" against President Bush and predicted that \"more terror,\" including poison gas attacks on the United States, was \"coming.\"\nSept. 18, 2001: As President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell were leaving the United Nations compound after an address to the General Assembly, a man appeared on a rooftop outside and shouted, \"Bush kills children.\" It was unclear if the man was part of a demonstration or just an anti-American.\nSept. 18, 2001: Members of a support club for one of the accused in the terrorist attacks said their former colleague and his family disappeared after Sept. 11 and they had not heard from him since. They said they feared that he might have \"gone on a mission.\"\nSept. 19, 2001: Bin Laden's videotaped address praised the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and declared jihad, an Islamic holy war, against the United States and Israel for the next century.\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed.\nSept. 19, 2001: Asserting", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing a public meeting entitled, \u201cFDA Oversight and the Development and Regulation of Generic Drugs.\u201d The objective of this meeting will be to discuss challenges, opportunities, and priorities for generic drug development and quality oversight to improve patient access, competition, and affordability.

Born during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, they came of age in the most volatile economic environment the United States (US) and Europe have ever experienced.\nAs a result, they have been weaned on an environment of instantaneous gratification of material needs, whether by means of financial capital, virtual credit, or information. They are at least as accustomed to receiving goods and services whenever they want them as they are to being instantly connected to one another by digital technology. Their very nature is interactive, and they are conditioned to participate in processes they find interesting, exciting, or both.\nThis is not, of course, a new phenomenon. In the early 1990s, the New York Times (NYT) took the first steps in recognising the importance of the \u201cnature versus nurture\u201d distinction in establishing digital native habits within the newspaper industry. Its introduction of a weekly column discussing personal computers and the internet in general created a space where digital technology became \u201cnot just an add-on to the journalism, but rather a central part of it,\u201d according to media analysts Andrew Lih and Andrew Presotto. This is not to say the early columns that evolved into \u201cWhat the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains\u201d became popular overnight. It was well into the second year of the column \u2014 and with an increase in columnists to keep daily, weekly, and monthly blogs going \u2014 that the \u201cWhat Web 2.0 Will Mean\u201d columns became best sellers.\nThe lesson for the newspaper industry to take from this shift? That providing opportunities for active participation, be it through commenting on blogs or through sharing online, makes for more engaged users.\nThis, of course, is the crux of the modern news experience in the Age of the Digital Native. Users must see a need for interaction in the context of their news experience.\nNews organisations that do not recognise this in the future must prepare for disappointing traffic numbers, particularly among young, web-savvy users.\nConsider, for example, the \u201cNYTimes.com\u201d and \u201cWashPost.com\u201d websites. While the papers are well-known and have large reader bases, their websites tend to be heavily reliant on content for which traditional media organisations hold exclusive rights (as in the case of the New York Times, which is a highly profitable news organisation that also benefits from an online paywall). Yet, they do not place a great value on user interaction when it comes to their web properties.\nAt the same time, Google News, a search engine that compiles news from multiple media sources, has evolved from a source for raw news to a place where visitors can engage with the news through conversations and comments. While this is not a space Google owns, it is a strong example of how user interaction can make a company\u2019s resources go farther. Google is using the web to give its search engine a competitive advantage, wherein users are giving Google more information about their preferences that Google then uses to provide more relevant and timely search results.\nThis shift is particularly noteworthy because news organisations often use the term \u201cnews\u201d as though it is synonymous with the term \u201csyndication\u201d (the distribution of content to third-parties). They do so in part because the former is a buzzword-heavy term that provides a certain level of prestige. \u201cNews\u201d is what sets the New York Times apart from the NYPost, and the Washington Post above HuffPost. News organisations have tapped into this for years to sell the message to both internal stakeholders and external readers that a more news-rich content stream is a more engaging experience.\nToday, however, audiences are changing. They know a great deal about the tools to get the information they need when they need it, but they are less willing to be passive recipients of information. This is especially true of younger digital natives who expect a greater range of interactive opportunities when they come for their news. This is, in part, because the experience is no longer simply about what news they access. The expectations are just as strong for how that news is presented, and in some cases, the ability to influence what that news looks like.\nBoth the Times and the Washington Post, for instance, recognise that their audiences tend to share their work directly online.

It certainly increases the likelihood of engagement. But when it comes to \u201cthe experience,\u201d personalisation may be the easy part, as long as you use the right strategy to start with.\n\u201cPersonalisation\u201d is the art of tailoring and optimising your content or offerings for individual targets based on a predictive understanding around their specific needs, interests, objectives or context.\n\u201cPersonalised\u201d is the outcome, with its focus on an individual target\u2019s needs, objectives, interests or context.\nThe problem with a purely tactical approach to personalisation, however, is that it can overlook the key purpose it exists for \u2014 to optimise customer experience.\nCustomer experience (CX) is, quite simply, the experience a customer has with your brand.\nIt\u2019s the collection of interactions a customer has with your organisation at every touch point \u2014 and this has to work together seamlessly with brand values, services, and value proposition.\nIn short, it is about delivering a brand promise that ensures customers are always treated to high standards in service. (To read the full definition of customer experience, click here.)\nSo, how do you create a seamless customer experience?\nAt GMAC, we\u2019re always looking at ways our clients can improve the CX they offer customers: to do this, we always look for better ways of identifying customers\u2019 needs, more efficient ways of servicing them, better ways of anticipating and reacting to the needs of the customer and, finally, better ways of understanding the customer\u2019s lifetime value proposition to our clients.\nWhat is the value of the customer?\nTo understand a customer you need to start at the beginning. Understand what the customer needs, when they need it and what benefits this will give them.\nAt GMAC, this has resulted in the creation of a customer scoring system that, once implemented, gives us a strong start on determining how to best serve the customer\u2019s needs based on the value they bring to the marketing agency.\nBut to understand any customer is not as simple as scoring them. CX is not just about knowing how good a person could be \u2014 you also need to know what they actually are.\nCustomer data analysis is about understanding the value of the customer.\nIt is looking at the behavioural data to build customer scorecards, which are then used to segment the customers to get a more accurate perspective of what the customer is really worth.\nData can be used to map how often and how many purchases a customer uses the service for and what value the customer brings to the organisation.\nThen you start to get a fuller understanding of the customer\u2019s value.\nOne example is a media agency that has been able to better manage its customer data to understand individual customers and their value.\nBefore, the agency was relying on the traditional way of determining its customer\u2019s value which is based on a customer acquisition cost (CAC) for new customers and a cross-media CPM and CPE.\nBut these methods are outdated and lack any real understanding of a customer\u2019s lifetime value (LTV).\nBy collecting and analysing the data, the company was better able to understand who the customer was, how it generated revenue, and when it spent money.\nIn short, we were able to understand the following:\nHow many new customer acquisitions the marketing agency required to deliver the service level it was offering.\nWhat the customer value is for customers with both low acquisition levels and high acquisition levels.\nWhat the LTV is for the full customer base with the marketing agency having a better understanding of how much profit it was generating.\nWho is driving the value and who is not driving the value.\nWho the key influencers were within the customer base.\nBy working out what works and", "The Commission provides guidance, based on the record before it, on the application of the Commission\u2019s rules in the area of political advertising.

On 7 July, I travelled to Nairobi and the first person I met personally was Mr Ndung'u Ngugi, Director General, NMK. He personally received me and we discussed the future, a future where e-learning is just about to hit Kenya. Mr Ngugi is convinced e-learning will save the country 3-5 % of its GDP (KSh 1,5-2,5 Bill.) and, as such, Mr Ngugi has asked me to help him to put together a strategy for e-business in Kenya.\nNext, I had lunch with Mr Cyrus Njonjo (Minister of Higher Education) and the Director of the new e-learning centre in the University of Nairobi. What could be more amazing than that!? I was not quite prepared for the impact of those two wonderful, intelligent and enthusiastic persons and our conversation got me thinking: \"What can we do to help the Minister and the director in getting their project funded? In getting the e-learning centre (and e-Africa) in the country in troubled times? In securing support from donors? What can we do? After lunch, the discussion continued with the director of the e-Africa project and it appeared my visit to Nairobi could not have been more of a success on the first day.\nMr David Okemwa, General Manager at Telkom Kenya also called me personally at noon, which was an honor. He explained that he had worked for Microsoft for 8 years and was just a little curious about my initiative. After the first few minutes of friendly chatting, Mr Okemwa offered to put the Telkom-Africa Project on the back burner for 3-6 months to focus on e-business in Kenya and \"how to bring you on board\". I told Mr Okemwa that the Telkom team is welcome to join us whenever they are ready to and that Telkom could also be a donor to the project.\nAll the parties with whom I personally met were eager for e-learning to become a reality in Kenya and we agreed to meet again in a few days' time and finalize a plan of action and strategy for the project. This will include an action plan for promoting e-business and supporting the Ministry's e-learning project, both of which I had already laid out in a few previous discussions with Mr Ndung'u Ngugi (Director General of the Ministry of Education) and Mr Njonjo (Minister of Higher Education).\nNow it is up to us to pull everything together, come up with concrete action plans and strategies, and most importantly, to bring everything into practice.

Digital should be a consideration for every strategic decision the company makes or the business unit makes. The reality is, we don\u2019t know how to do it yet. We\u2019re not sure if it has an ROI.\nSome executives think it\u2019s all about doing a transaction and charging by the minute. The other side thinks it\u2019s all about a digital experience or creating a better customer experience. Sometimes, you get the headache of both.\nThe digital strategy of a company needs to be made explicit. Then the digital strategy for each business unit needs to be made explicit as well.\nThe CIO needs to make sure they understand the digital strategy for that business unit and for that business. To put it in simple terminology, the business unit wants to charge by the minute. Is that a service or product strategy?\nCIOs need to have more clarity about their business strategy and the digital strategy that can be accomplished from it. Otherwise, the CIO will have a lot of different digital strategies at a different level of maturity. In 10 years, we\u2019re going to have the same problems in digital as we had at the start of the technology industry.\nWhat do you want to accomplish in the next two or three years?

P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos as their inspiration. The Mythos was a shared universe in the pulp magazine universe.\nThe setting is post-Atlantean, a world in which the sunken supercontinent of Mu was once connected to the lost continent of Atlantis, separated from it by the Atlantic Ocean.\nNumerous extraterrestrial beings interact in the Mythos, often in conflict with humans, and include the Azathoth, the Dweller in the Gulf, and the Outer Gods. The human-level beings of the Mythos are called Great Old Ones. It has been suggested that they are gods. A group of similar entities called the Outer Gods, or Deep Ones, have also been considered part of the Cthulhu Mythos, but they are mostly associated with Lovecraft's horror cycle.\nMany of the themes explored in the Mythos, such as otherness, existentialism and the inherent madness of the universe, are shared with Lovecraft's own fictional mythos. Because Lovecraft wrote horror stories, some scholars and fans often call the Cthulhu Mythos an extended Lovecraftian universe or Lovecraft mythos.\n1  THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 12/1/12\n2  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 1: AT 12/1/12\n3  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 2: HISTORY OF ATLANTIS 12/9/12\n4  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 3: PHYSICAL TRAIT 1/7/13\n5  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 4: BENEVOLENT ELEMENTALS 1/14/13\n6  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 5: SACRIFICIAL PRACTICES 1/21/13\n7  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 6: ATLANTIS AS A DYING WORLD 1/28/13\n8  ATLANTIAN MYTHOLOGY 7: SURVIVAL OF LUNA 1/28/13\n9  ELEMENTALS 1 2/4/13\n10  ELEMENTALS 3 2/11/13\n11  REPTILIANS IN THE SERPENT CULT 2/18/13\n12  REPTILIANS IN THE SERPENT CULT PART II 2/24/13\n13 SUMMARY 2/11/13\n14 CONCLUSION 3/4/13", "A 12-year review of the history of the Journal of Medical\nConsider, for example, the following 250-word query from a 2005\nJournal of Medical Economics article, \"Does Cognitive Enhancement by\nDeliberate Practice Improve Clinical Performance?\" by authors\nJordi Monard and Jaume Mestre, both physicians who practice in\nBarcelona: \"We evaluated the association between delibrate\npractice (i.e., performing medical acts in a focused,\nmethodical, and repetitive way), as measured by the\nToronto Cognitive Assessment score and the performance of 4th-year\nmedical residents during the clinical-practice sessions.

And it pays to advertise digitally.\nNewspapers generate leads and business with paid digital advertising\nLead generation for B2B audiences isn\u2019t the exclusive purview of the business press. Newspapers can do more than just generate readers \u2013 they can also be a great place for advertisers to generate sales leads.\nThese days, most B2B buyers start their process online, then turn to other channels, such as colleagues and salespeople, to close the deal. But most leads start with an online search, the most effective tactic for finding information about your target audience.\nToday\u2019s B2B decision-makers aren\u2019t just looking for information in their news feed \u2013 they are also looking for advertising that gets them closer to making a purchase.\nOne of our clients, an advertising agency called Weber Marketing Group, is looking to grow its digital lead generation efforts among two segments \u2013 small to midsize businesses, and the small business lending industry. So we\u2019ve started generating leads for Weber among our network of more than 1,000 North American newspapers.\nIn addition, Weber launched online media buys that included a national display campaign on NDN\u2019s network of regional B2B news sites, as well as local targeting on the same sites. Weber\u2019s new program started generating its first lead the same day it launched.\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that the Internet has opened the door for B2B marketing and sales: it\u2019s now one of the main channels of lead generation. But the Internet isn\u2019t the only game in town when it comes to generating leads.\nThe Internet is most useful for driving people to a website or to a landing page. It\u2019s not so effective for driving the actual lead-generation process (though some B2B companies use digital methods). Companies will usually follow Internet leads up with \u201ctraditional\u201d methods, such as phone, email, or in-person appointment.\nBut when you think about it, why shouldn\u2019t the person who clicks on an online display ad also complete the process online?\nIn a recent survey by research firm J.D. Power, 54% of buyers said they wanted to initiate the sales process online. Many companies still want to deal with people in \u201creal life\u201d rather than in cyberspace, but these days, most business is done digitally. It isn\u2019t just buyers who\u2019d rather \u201cspeak\u201d over the phone than over email, either \u2013 52% of decision-makers in the same survey would rather have a live conversation over the phone.\nSo why stop the sales process when you\u2019re two-thirds of the way there? A lead is a lead, regardless of how it was generated.\nThis year, the Internet is expected to continue to play the main role in making B2B purchases \u2013 up to 36% of the way in the buying process, according to the International Data Corporation. Newspapers can keep this cycle going by making our display ads actionable and \u201ctalkable\u201d \u2013 the things buyers actually want.\nFor example, for one newspaper client, NDN placed a display ad that featured a digital version of the newspaper\u2019s classified page, along with multiple calls-to-action such as \u201cread more,\u201d \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201csave,\u201d and \u201ccontact.\u201d As a result, the newspaper saw a 382% increase in unique users, a 56% increase in average time spent on a page, and an increase in its cost per lead from $151 to $34.\nWith a B2B audience, a sale isn\u2019t final until a vendor signs a contract, so we\u2019ve found success with a campaign that follows internet leads and encourages them to complete the sales process by calling or messaging a Weber representative. Using this process, Weber is already on pace to match \u2014 and potentially exceed \u2014 its sales goals for the entire first half of the year in the first few weeks of its 2017 campaign.\nWhile Weber was already investing in online display ads, that investment is now paying off with significant improvements not just in ad recall, but also in lead quality, conversion rate, and sales efficiency. Weber is set to exceed its 2017 goals for online lead generation with this campaign.\nIn fact, this kind of successful digital lead generation can translate to other verticals, in addition to B2B. We\u2019ve had similar success with other B2C clients, such as auto dealerships, who saw increased conversions.\nThere\u2019s also some evidence that digital advertising may be more", "When the world needs to get the message out about some cause or crusade, no one does it better than the media. That's what P&G discovered when Ariel put a call for entries out to the media. The campaign ended up as Cannes Lions' Media Strategy of the Year.\nThe Ariel Dream Big campaign was, by all accounts, a huge success. The #DreamBigPads initiative earned Ariel the Most Creative Media Launch at Cannes Media Lions 2015, as well as the Grand Prix for Media Strategy at Cannes Creative Lions 2015. It was the second time that Ariel made a splash at the Media Lions for its efforts to do good. This year, Ariel was even more successful with #SmallThings in 2014.\nAriel launched #DreamBigPads with a call to young people to help make the world a better place by sharing their ideas, dreams and projects. For this, Ariel set out on a media strategy campaign that engaged both established and emerging media partners to create a \"platform for sharing.\"\nAt the core of this platform was a media mix that included a blog, a microsite where young people could upload photos and ideas, and on-air executions across TV and radio.\nThe media also made the social media campaign more efficient by hosting a central page for content generated across various digital mediums such as blogs, websites and social media.\nTo achieve our objectives, we needed to leverage a broad media strategy that would allow us to reach our target segment on multiple touch points. We needed to be able to create a platform for sharing, one that would both serve as a hub for this sharing and leverage our brand's positioning as a trustworthy platform for good.\nOur goal was three-fold: drive engagement for our content, brand awareness and market share for Ariel, as a leader in the detergent segment, and get more people excited about the project.\nTo make all that happen, we relied on a multifaceted media strategy that included TV and radio, online and mobile, print and outdoors. We executed different campaigns with different media partners, all to come together into one campaign that created a unique and memorable brand experience, from start to finish.\nTo connect all the touch points, we hosted our campaign at Ariel.com/dreambigpads. There we put all the digital and offline content that we ran in one place where consumers could enter to win a project grant. We also leveraged the platform from a corporate level, integrating it into different online and offline campaigns.\nOn top of that, we launched the same campaign with multiple media partners. The blog, for example, hosted by Ariel.com/dreambigpads, was the primary hub for all generated content, and we encouraged media partners to host the blog in their sites as well.\nWe then ran a social media and a mobile campaign, the blog also allowing readers access via their mobile devices.\nAnother campaign leveraged the microsite for consumers to generate content. All these campaigns converged at the hub of the Ariel website and blog. Everything tied into what was being experienced on the microsite and blog. We knew this would create a memorable experience for consumers.\nFinally, to bring all the media partners' executions to life, we focused on what was at the core of the campaign by hosting on-air executions and promotions across all partners that connected to each other, which created even more value for consumers.\nA strong campaign that generates an overreaching \"buzz\" will be considered a success, no matter which metrics we track. But we had the extra pressure of also trying to prove the advertising effectiveness of our campaign to our clients who want to know exactly what the return on investment for each advertising dollar spent is.\nThat made it vitally important for us to track engagement rates as an indicator of success. And it also made it important that we leverage media partners so that they could serve as extensions of our campaign, meaning that every one of our executions would be tracked as part of the campaign.\nWe tracked engagement metrics by looking at how many visitors engaged with our campaign (whether they shared ideas, videos and photos, and what other actions they took that demonstrated meaningful engagement).\nWe also looked at how many people went to the microsite, how many people shared ideas there, how many people filled out forms, how many participants submitted blogs, how many people watched the short film and how many people watched the video contest entry. And how each of these metrics were different for each partner.\nIf we wanted to know how many people went", "After a brief detour into the 18th century, I\u2019m now back at my desk for a bit about a famous book review, the one by John Updike that led the nation to ask: Is it a good thing that a famous book reviewer also writes books? (Yes.)\nA new week, and a new book: The New York of John Updike by Lillian Faderman (University of Wisconsin Pr, $40; 349 pages). This isn\u2019t a review or even a book report. It\u2019s a commentary on one of my favorite Updike reviews: the 1982 Updike review of the last volume in Gore Vidal\u2019s historical Burr trilogy, Lincoln. I haven\u2019t read Vidal or Updike, but this review by Updike is a thing of beauty, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone. (Which is all to say: read it for yourself!)\n1. What is the genre of fiction that most frequently involves historical characters?\n2. If Updike had not reviewed Lincoln, do you think it would\u2019ve been noticed much at all? If so, would you say the book would have been more widely reviewed in the press? Or do you think that Vidal\u2019s standing as a well-known figure might have helped it achieve some sort of breakout success?\n3. Do you think a big book (or a big movie or a big opera, etc.) needs a critic of its author\u2019s status to give it a fair shake? Or do you think that a really good novel or movie or whatever will stand on its own? I ask because one of the interesting things about this review is that Updike wrote it before there was a book, it just happened to be Vidal\u2019s book. If there had been no Lincoln novel for him to review, do you think there would have been a review?\n4. Was there any kind of downside to this review? Vidal is obviously a great figure to review against, and he has a lot of enemies who would probably love for their opinions to be aired on this subject. Do you suppose Updike took more shit than usual, given that he was writing public opinion about a friend?\n5. I find the first paragraph of the book so beautiful-- the images that are evoked, the way it\u2019s put together, the way it seems to unfold in one\u2019s head like a movie. It\u2019s so evocative of New York, and seems to set up a tone for the review, and the city itself. Do you like that first paragraph? Do you think it would have worked on the page?\n6. This review is so long (the book is 980 pages, or 700,000 words, or 140 pages longer than Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace) and dense and full of quotes from the book itself. Do you find a lot of reviews of new fiction this lengthy and full of quotes? Do you find these kinds of reviews helpful, at all, in making a decision whether to read something or not? If you had read or seen Lincoln before, what effect do you think this review would have had on you?\n7. I\u2019m going to finish my comments with this from the very end of the review: \u201cIn effect, any reader will want to begin Lincoln with this review by Updike, an account so generous and sympathetic as not to be so much a review of Vidal\u2019s book as of Vidal himself.\u201d\nIt seems to me that the writer of this review wanted it to both do the work of reviewing Lincoln, but also to tell you to read Lincoln-- which made for a very unusual piece of writing. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts.\nHere\u2019s that first paragraphs, and it was also included in my post on Updike\u2019s review of the 1981 book of poetry \u201cAn Irish Airman Foresees His Death\u201d by Seamus Heaney.\n\u201cNew York (of all places) at a quarter to ten on a Sunday night in November 1969. That was when the movie \u2018Patton\u2019 opened at Loew\u2019s 86th Street Theater. On West Broadway, the crowd spilled out onto the sidewalk, and in a store window on Eighty-Eighth Street, Lincoln loomed. In his beard and his cobwebs he looked a lot like the old men who stand on the street corners, like the men who sit on the steps outside the churches, or even like the one who works at the newsstand and says \u2018Happy Veteran\u2019s Day\u2019. These are the men who look at the young with wonder and alarm, as if to say", "A newspaper\u2019s efforts to establish a dialogue with younger readers have resulted in hundreds of e-mails, comments, and suggestions for stories, making youth engagement a worthwhile investment of time and energy.\nBy Jeffrey R. Young, Editor\nThe Christian Century, an evangelical 97-year-old\nmonthly magazine, was one of the early adopters of\na youth blog focused on Christian young people\nliving an adult life. It debuted in June 2005,\njust after graduation for most students in the\naudience, and the focus is on stories about\nyoung adults in and outside the church.\nIn a recent issue (August 22), the issue\neditor sent an e-mail to 5,000\nsubscribers, asking readers to help create\nnominations for the Christian Century\n\u2018Best of\u2019 list. (The nomination system\nremains in effect, and the \u201906 list remains\npending.)\nThe e-mail was written in the second\nperson, as if a friend was asking for\nhelp: \u201cI need your help. I am making a\ntop-10 list of people, places, things and\noccasions who are cool as hell. Think about all the\nthings young people do every day, good and bad,\nimportant and not, and add those of yours for the\nlist.\u201d Readers were asked to send along\ntheir own nominations by the following day.\nOn the last day of the nomination period, by\n8 am the next morning, the issue editor had already compiled a list of nearly 250 personal nomination ideas.\nAll e-mails and e-mail attachments\npraising the young editor were\nthrown into the same folder, as\nthe editor\u2019s plan was to share a list\nwith readers, editors, and advertisers. The first\ntopic to be considered, however, was this one.\nWhen the editor shared the early list of about 500 e-mail\nnominations, one of the first editors asked, \u201cIs it 500 people? Should I be nominated?\u201d\nThe issue editor joked, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get\nout of this personal mode. Let\u2019s re-cast this.\nWe\u2019ll be glad to have you and your staff nominated.\nThere are a whole bunch of us who really enjoy this.\u201d\nBurnt out: The \u2018youth\u2019 is quickly burned out on \u2018young adult\u2019 stories\u2014\n\u201cNo-Wai, there has got to be more interesting things going on out there.\u201d\nThe editor quickly discovered that it was very hard to get adults to focus on youth issues\u2014and it was\nmuch harder to solicit nominations. He had to explain to editors the idea of the list, to talk about\nthis as though it were not a \u201cstaff\u201d issue. If he had not known the nominations were coming from\nthose outside the organization, he never would have figured out the way to get ideas.\nFacing reality: The young editor was\nthe \u201cnew technology\u201d in Christian\nCentury. He started writing about technology in 2002, and he used his first blog, a \u2018Jay Rosen-style\u2019\nblogs in November 2002, to discuss blogging in the world in terms of media and marketing. In\nJune 2005, he began the blog for the magazine, \u2018Being Young.\u2019\nWhen the editor began the Christian Century blog, he was among the first editorial bloggers in American journalism. He knew all the best practices. And\nstill, he had problems getting adult co-workers to participate.\nThe editor knew that he had to\nmake this a shared problem, that weaving youth and older voices into the youth section\nof the magazine would help all readers to feel they were part of the magazine. One of\nthe main ideas behind the magazine\u2019s youth blog was community building.\nMost adults assumed readers of the magazine were older, and that\u2019s a valid assumption, because\nthe average magazine reader is 59 years old, and the average Christian Century reader is about\n63 on average. When we ran a survey about age on the blog, we got hundreds of comments by\npeople who did not fit the average.\nAs of August this year, the magazine had\n75 readers\u2019 letters posted. The youth blog had had 288 posts at that time, and we\nreceived about 200 comments on our blog.\nMost people under the age of 40\nin the US are uncategorised by\ndemographers, but it\u2019s clear from the\ncomment rate", "The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\nestablishes a new permanent regulatory (permanent regulatory\nstandard), and expands, through amendment, an existing \"temporary\"\nregulatory (temporary regulatory standard) regarding requirements\nfor occupational exposure to cotton dust.\nSUMMARY OF THE STANDARDS:  The purpose of the temporary regulation is\nto reduce the maximum permissible airborne concentrations of cotton\ndust to 0.5 milligrams (mg) of cotton fibers per cubic meter\n(m(3)) of air (0.05 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of air) to \"reduce\nthe risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases from\nexcessive cotton plant dust exposure.\" The maximum permissible airborne\nconcentration of cotton dust is increased to 2.0 m(3) (2.0 mg/L)\nunder the following conditions:  (i) cotton dust is controlled and\nfiltered to a level substantially below the permanent standard prior\nto the inhalation or contact of such dust with the face, lungs, eyes, or\nskin; (ii) the employer identifies a need for the higher level prior\nto utilizing the higher level; (iii) the employer demonstrates, to the\nsatisfaction of the Assistant Secretary, that the employer has: (a)\nconducted air sampling or similar assessments (as OSHA determines to\nbe appropriate) to support the need for the higher level; (b) used\nthe higher level in a manner that is at least as protective of employees\nas the lower level; and (c) developed a respiratory protection program\nwith a properly fitted respirator or other adequate protective\nmeasure appropriate to each type of hazardous substance present.\nOSHA also reestablished a permanent standard of 2.0 m(3) (2.0 mg/L)\nby amending the permanent standard to reduce the airborne\nconcentration of cotton dust from 5.0 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L.  The permanent\nstandard applies to all occupational exposures to cotton dust\nregardless of whether the exposure was to the employer's own raw fiber\nor the employer's own spun cotton or a finished product of the\nspun cotton (excluding yarns, carded gray goods, uncombined lengths,\nor cut or woven fabrics, or textile fabrics made from such yarns,\ngauges, or finished fabrics).  For cotton manufacturing operations which\nmanufacture only finished products or textile goods or yarns, we\ndetermined that adequate protection is afforded to workers by the\nexisting permanent 2.0 mg/L standard.\nOSHA's decision to eliminate the 2.0 mg/L standard for cotton\nmanufacturing facilities manufacturing only finished goods or yarns\nwas based on (i) our finding that the final rule does not specify how\nto reduce this level to 2.0 mg/L when airborne concentrations exceed 2.0\nmg/L, (ii) our finding that this standard is difficult to enforce because\nthe finished goods and yarn industry uses an incredible number of\ndifferent processes and, therefore, different exposure assessment\ntechniques, (iii) our finding that this standard does not ensure that\nworkers receive a minimum level of protection (because, by using very\nnarrow sampling techniques, and using only those materials that may\npossess a relatively high cotton dust content, the sampling results\ncould, in some cases, be extremely limited) while ensuring that the risk\nto workers is minimized, (iv) our finding that exposure assessment\ntechniques do not consistently identify exposure problems in\nexisting facilities, (v) our findings that the cost of implementing\nthe new 2.0 mg/L standard is very high compared with the benefit it\nprovides, and (vi) our finding that the risk of worker\nhypersensitivity to cotton dust under the 5.0 mg/L standard is\nacceptably low.  The final rule also eliminates the 5.0 mg/L standard\nfor cotton dust as an occupational exposure for cotton dust in the\nother processes of textile manufacturing and specified that this\nstandard be used as", "What is a business model? What are the different types of business models available on the World Wide Web? What are the elements contained in each business model? Which one is best for your company?\nBefore we discuss specific business models, let's make sure we have a common definition of business model in common to help you to better understand the terminology.\nBusiness model is a concept of describing an organization's business, operation, management, and/or strategy. Business model usually refers to a system that a corporation or individual operates or a way of generating value. It is sometimes referred to as a method of delivering value to stakeholders.\nWithin Internet business, business model is a term that designates the method by which companies and other organizations build and sustain profitability. It describes the company's products and services, marketing and sales operations, and technical issues.\nA company's business model is the central factor in its ability to gain market share and achieve competitive advantage in the marketplace, and its changes will have a significant impact on business success. Changes to the business model will also have a direct impact on a company's ability to reach its long-range financial goals.\nThere are actually four different business models available on the World Wide Web. Each is distinguished by particular characteristics and strengths. They are not mutually exclusive. Companies typically adopt more than one model. A company may also adopt a hybrid model, which includes characteristics from several of the models.\nIn order to clarify these distinctions, we categorize six different business models we see on the World Wide Web:\n1. Retail business model\nThese sites sell to consumers and collect payments from the buyers. They typically do not sell products produced in house. Most of their sales are made by distributors and dealers. The following companies are examples of businesses following retail model: Amazon, Barnes & Nobles, Buy.com, and E-Bay.\n2. Retail business model with manufacturing and/or direct sales (Do-it-all-yourself business model)\nThese companies create and sell their products in house directly to the final customer and usually to the wholesale customer. They are typically small online businesses. These types of companies often offer free shipping. The following companies are examples of businesses following manufacturing and/or direct sales model: Cyberian Outpost, CDNow, and MusicMax.\n3. Direct sales and service business model\nThese businesses act as agents, providing the customers with a one-stop shopping service. They typically function as a clearing house, where buyers can buy a product from different suppliers and have it delivered to them. They are responsible for handling all the payments from the buyers. Most of the direct sales companies are smaller in size. The following companies are examples of businesses following direct sales and service model: Dell Computers, Intelligent Agent, and Staples.\n4. Services that sell to a small number of high-paying clients\nMany companies use this type of business model to make profit from the services they provided. The clients include enterprises of all sizes in any business sector from Fortune 500 companies to non-profit companies to government enterprises. Some of the examples of businesses following the services that sell to a small number of high-paying clients model are: Computer Professional Services, Ernst & Young, and Protiviti.\n5. Lead generation / Business-to-Business market maker\nCompanies in this type of business model are also involved in helping other companies to sell their products and services directly to the consumer. With this service, companies do not sell their own products or services, but help other companies to reach their target markets. The following examples can be cited in this model: The Wall Street Journal, Yellow Book, and the Better Business Bureau.\n6. Advertising model\nThis kind of businesses make profit from placing advertisements on their own sites and/or other sites. In general, this kind of businesses has no products or technology to be sold. The following examples can be cited in the advertising model: DoubleClick, InfoSpace, and AdKnowledge.\nAfter identifying various business models, now it's time for you to have an assessment on which kind of business model and which type of business model your business model can be categorized into.", "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is making changes to the regulatory status of the CREST electronic settlement service (CREST/Net).

This integration can take many forms, including:\n* Providing a seamless and consistent advertising experience across time and\n* Having a single brand voice across multiple platforms, keeping the brand\nconstant but allowing it to change in meaning.\n* Creating branded experiences that draw members into the brand itself.\n* Maintaining a consistent look in all aspects (i.e. packaging, Web site, and\n* Maintaining a consistent tone of voice in all aspects (i.e. all elements of\n* Allowing the brand to evolve over time by creating an element that can grow\nand develop.\nThe following sections will address these elements\u2014and others\u2014of brand experience integration.\nTaking a Look at the Digital Media Brand Landscape\nThroughout the past few years, there have been a number of interesting\ndevelopments pertaining to brands. In fact, I would venture a guess that our lives have been turned upside-down with the changing landscape of how brands relate\nto and interact with their customers. This changing landscape has brought\nabout some of the biggest challenges, as well as some of the biggest\naccomplishments, brands have ever had to face. The digital media landscape offers enormous opportunities for brands to interact with potential and current customers, clients, and users in much more direct and ongoing ways. But just because the digital media landscape may offer these opportunities, it does not mean that brands are able\nto take advantage of all of them.\nFor example, take the recent release of the iPhone. This iPhone thing has created all kinds of brands\u2014and brand experiences\u2014beyond the iPhone itself\n(that will be a different article on its own). But what has this iPhone\nthing created? It has created AT&T, the wireless carrier of the iPhone.\nIt has created the App Store, and now it has created the App Developers\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122; Association. And that is without even naming all the other brands that were created in the mobile space alone. All of this is possible\u2014and, in reality, necessary\u2014thanks to the increasingly ubiquitous and convenient mobile platforms out there. Now, however, brands are faced with a problem: the increasing number of channels available.\nIn fact, the increasing number of available brand channels has led to the development of marketing 1.0 to 4.0 theories. In its simplest description, marketing 1.0 is the classic push and pull methodology of marketing (with push and pull representing a brand\u2019s efforts to attract consumers via traditional advertising and sales strategies respectively).\nMarketing 1.0\nMarketing 1.0 has existed for several decades; it can be seen in\nclassic advertising that has focused on the product, the product\u2019s\nbrand, or the brand\u2019s value proposition. The purpose of this traditional marketing is to draw consumers into a brand. Marketers of this branding period have been rewarded with traditional marketing and brand measurement successes (e.g., ROI). While this type of marketing has had its share of successes, it has also had its share of challenges; one of the biggest challenges being that consumers are constantly demanding more. With each new product development, with each new channel, and with each new communication vehicle, consumers continually develop brand preferences and expectations. As the marketplace grew and consumers became increasingly adept brand users, they began to place more and more value on the \u201cexperience\u201d of a brand. This shift has been referred to today as the experience economy, in which the customer experience is everything.\nMarketing 2.0 Today, marketing 2.0 is in full force.  Marketing 2.0 focuses on building a brand experience by communicating with consumers through any and all channels that exist in the digital media landscape. These communications with consumers are focused\non building intimate brand relationships.  This means creating experiences that allow consumers to feel connected to a brand and the other brands associated with it. Some of the most successful marketing 2.0 brands are the brands that are already ubiquitous. Starbucks is a great example of this type of marketing 2.0 relationship. When consumers walk in the door of a Starbucks, they are transported into Starbucks-branded\nexperiences\u2014whether the consumer is ordering a cup of coffee, choosing  the   next   CD   they   want   to   purchase,   or downloading a new app, Starbucks maintains control of the", "A 12-year-old girl who has had a total of\nseven breast growths has not started menstruating at all yet, although she\nbegan menstruating only eight to ten weeks after the age of 12!

When using the traditional editorial methods, this content could be found in many locations and without the correct categorisation it can be a struggle to categorise the information correctly, particularly if it is syndicated through a syndication API.\nNewspaper systems often have a flat-file approach to content management where all of the news is stored in content database as XML. Each piece of content can then easily be re-used across systems in the content management process. However, without structure to the content files, it is difficult to categorise the data in a content management system.\nCategories and Categorization\nOne feature of content management systems, is the ability to organise information into hierarchical categories and subcategories. These are often referred to as \u201cmetastores\u201d in enterprise content management (ECM) and similar terms are used throughout the industry. For example, in terms of document management, a Document Metamodel (DMM) is used to develop a hierarchy of taxonomy.\nA DMM is defined in ISO 12006 as: \u201cA way to classify and describe documents as a set of hierarchical categories, attributes, relationships and values.\u201d The term \u201cmetamodel\u201d describes a model that extends other pre-existing models and provides additional information.\nWith a good enterprise content management system, we can create these categories as we wish and provide a structure that suits the needs of news organisations: such as the Newsroom -> World -> Country -> Local -> News \u2013 to represent, as an example, the hierarchy of news articles.\nFigure 1: Typical structure of a Newsroom -> World -> Country -> Local -> News\nFigure 2: Typical structure of a Newsroom -> World -> Country -> Local -> News \u2013 as it may appear in a CMS\nOnce the categories and subcategories have been established the first objective of the newsroom editor is to map each of the pieces of content to a category. In Figure 3 below we can see a map of where an article has been placed based on the type of content. The figure shows a mapping of articles to categories and provides an overview of where content has been placed in relation to the taxonomic tree.\nFigure 3: A mapping of news content to category.\nBy creating a tree in the CMS, the editor can place information and automatically categorise each item so that all categories in the model have a set number of subcategories. A tree map can also provide a summary view to the editor of how each content category is performing, allowing the editor to gain an instant overview of how well a site is performing in relation to the newsroom\u2019s editorial goals.\nFigure 4: A snapshot of the taxonomy tree, with the news editor being able view how each category is performing.\nThe benefit of this structure in a newspaper is the ability of creating and applying categories once, and then, having the ability to automatically place every piece of content to its appropriate category when uploaded through the site. This enables the editorial process to be faster and more efficient, reducing the time spent categorising. It also gives the opportunity to re-use the same content again.\nFor example, if a news organisation has a story about a particular political figure, whether he is a member of the ruling coalition, main opposition party, or a smaller political party, the CMS should automatically map the content to the correct hierarchic categorisation, by category and subcategory. This content can then be repurposed in the future, if needed, for a variety of platforms, without the time intensive and laborious exercise of re-categorising the content.\nThis content can also be used in various other news formats, such as breaking news updates, blog posts, social media posts or RSS feeds. When the content is initially placed in the", "As the summer of 2008 drew to a close, a team of 6 reporters worked together to craft a 32,000-word story that gave the newspaper a chance to celebrate the people and stories that are the strength of the community \u2013 the good citizens and the good community events that hold it together.

In a market that is home to three major broadcast television stations, a National Public Radio station, and a major broadcast radio network, The News stands for a different kind of media that has been embraced by the community to which it is dedicated. It has built up a reputation for being known as \u201cthe paper of record\u201d by providing in-depth reporting and thoughtful perspectives that are essential to the region.\nThe News is proud of the community support it has garnered through the years. The staff goes to every length to deliver the best product it can offer. It has seen success with long-form feature storytelling like this one about an African drumming show at a retirement home, and they understand how it enhances that community feeling.\nThe News celebrates life with this annual feature story, which offers a snapshot of who is living in the area and how they are making it all possible \u2013 not just with financial support, but with emotional dedication.\nLife, Love and Leaping captures the essence of the region through a feature story of community events, people and spirit. It honors not just the people who dedicate their lives to the newspaper but those whose lives The News and the region touch every day.\nThe story honors the spirit of the region while showcasing the people and events that make life good for everyone.\nThe story is written and designed to show the community not just how they are, but what they have accomplished as a unit, all coming together to make life good.\nFrom beginning to end, the story flows like a conversation.

What other developments are around the corner?\nNews Subscriptions for Publishers: \u201cIt Seems Certain That\u2026 It Will Be a Big Hit\u201d \u2014 An interview with Bord Bia, the Irish food board, found that online news services are not a big hit yet in the country, but the opportunity for subscription-based food news is big. For example, some Irish newspapers offer online subscriptions in countries such as India.\nSometimes a subscriber package can benefit from a big splash \u2014 a major book publisher is testing \u201can annual digital subscription [with] unlimited access to The New York Times with a deep discount relative to the cost of the two most popular digital subscription packages\u201d to test demand for the premium product, noted the head of the company, according to a report.\nThe package will also allow members to have the printed paper delivered to their home each day.\nDaily editions for books and music.\nInnovation has to start at the bottom, and what better way to do that than experimenting with package deals.\nA big-box retailer is pushing its print-focused customers by offering a subscription package of daily editions of its national newspaper.\nThe idea, which will be tested first at 25 stores, will give daily editions for just $1.25 a week or $4.62 a month for print and digital.\nThe Newspaper Association of America sees the opportunity for growth in this model. In fact, the idea may be worth $5 billion.\nThe major print-focused retailer is testing a package that will offer several copies of The New York Times in print and digital editions for just $1.25 a week. According to NAA, the idea is not just a novelty, but a solid investment in the future of print. (Source: The New York Times Digital Subscriptions.)\nGrowing interest, the need for experimenting.\nAs retailers continue to fight for customers\u2019 attention, the idea of offering multiple products might be attractive. With the number of subscription-based products in the retail industry growing steadily, the idea is not a surprise for many.\nHowever, the major question is what the next step might be?\nWhat do consumers expect?\nDo they want the opportunity to create their own packages? Or will there be big packages with specific news outlets or industries? Or perhaps a combination of both?\nRetailers will have to be very careful with the design of their subscription program, as it cannot be just another idea on a page but rather something that keeps consumer excitement levels high.\nIn a related story, a major print-focused retailer is testing a subscription package of daily editions of its national newspaper, a move that is sure to raise some interesting questions.\nTo be sure, this is not the first time we have seen the idea of weekly editions being offered to consumers in one location.\nSeveral months ago, for example, the world was introduced to The Newsstand Magazine Box that allowed consumers to subscribe to the best magazines as they stepped into the mall for a day of shopping.\nBut the idea of a retail store offering daily editions of a paper has been almost untouched by mainstream retailers. As a result, The Wall Street Journal experimented first, with a program being offered at one of the more upscale retail stores in New York.\nAnd now that experiment is spreading and being tested in other retail formats \u2014 especially as publishers and retail executives discuss the need for subscription-based packages that keep readers coming to local papers.\nWith the newsstand sales of major dailies plummeting, the idea of offering subscribers special packages of daily editions of papers might very well be the answer.\nThose dailies that cannot make such a move on their own have created different packages of newspapers to offer such readers who want to get the best of both worlds. For example, the Sunday New York Times or The Wall Street Journal or The Washington Post are being offered at the Times, the Post and many other retailers in an effort to bring subscribers into stores.\nAnd now, with the test of a big box retailer in the books, the discussion among big retail executives is gaining strength.\n\u201cIt seems inevitable the model will be extended to other publishers as well,\u201d", "The Department proposes amendments to the\nregulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that\nwould change the requirement for tax-free distributions to\nparticipants who are age 55 to age 70 1/2, simplify the\ndistribution rules for the minimum required distribution\nregulations relating to the definition of a required\ndistribution period, and would generally simplify the\nprovision requiring information reporting about certain\nretirement plan distributions.\nDATES:   Written comments and requests for a public\nhearing (by 5 p.m., CST, March 27, 1992) must be submitted\nthe Internal Revenue Service, CC:PA:LPD:PR (REG-134473-\n89), Room 5205, PO Box 8131, Internal Revenue Service,\nWashington, DC 20044.

Title I amended the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1954 (now called Title 26 of the United\nStates Code). Title I also amended and redesignated sections\n23, 403, 411, 412 and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. The\nrules under Titles I and IV, however, are administered by the\nDepartment. The 1978 amendments (codified into Subchapter\nE of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended) are\nknown as the \"Tax Reform Act of 1978.\"\nAlthough the 1978 amendments were designed to provide more\ntax benefits for participation in qualified retirement\nplans, they also imposed additional recordkeeping\nrequirements, changed distribution rules, and increased\ninformation reporting required from sponsors and participants.\nIn addition, the 1978 amendments required that a number of\nchanges be made in a subsequent statute.

The reason local TV news\nhas survived all the threats from the networks to\ndominate -- threats the networks never fully\naccomplished in the first place -- is because of\ntheir role in keeping the public aware of and\ncommenting on local news.  Now they face a new\nthreat that may undermine that role, and in the\nprocess, undermine their own role.\nLocal TV news in America is currently watched\nby 250 million people, according to Pew.  They\nconstitute the primary news gatherers at the local\nlevel.  But with the advent of a more robust\nonline news video infrastructure, newspapers are\nexpected to play a much bigger role in providing\nthis same service at the local level.\nWith print newspapers, one can argue, there's\na basic separation that prevents too much coziness\nwith local governments and businesses.  A local\nnewspaper is run independently from local business\nand government.  Not so with online local video.\nThis is where we begin to see a clash between\nthe interests of the cable TV companies and those\nwho are pushing online video.  One of the\ngreater concerns over online journalism in\nAmerica has been the potential role that\ncable companies could play.  If cable is an\ninformation and news conduit, they could be the\none that controls this news traffic.  While they\ncould potentially undermine the independence of\nprint newspapers, the cable companies may also\nrepresent the greatest potential for online\nThe cable companies will argue that they're not\nlooking to insert themselves into this new\nmarket.  \"The market for news is huge,\" says\nTom Johnson, president and CEO of RCN, which\ncarries local news channels from 11 TV markets\nin six states. \"It is an untapped marketplace.\nWe're in the business of distribution of broadband\nservices; we are not in the business of content.\"\nBut even if that is true now, it probably won't\nbe true in five years, when they could become\nmajor providers of local news, something they\nwouldn't dare do with print newspapers, something\nthey can now do with online local video.\nIf newspapers and online video sites are able\nto maintain their independence from local\ngovernments, then it puts them at loggerheads\nwith the cable companies.  This is why I've said\nthat newspapers are in uncharted territory.  There\nare a lot of people out there looking to grab a\nshare of this pie, and it is in all our best\ninterests to keep it fairly.  It is not in the\nbest interests of the cable companies or the\nlocal government to have a newspaper take on the\nrole of the local monopoly broadcaster.  One\nway to do this would be to open up a truly\nindependent online source of local news, and it\nsounds like you could fund it with some of the\nextra local news profits made by local TV news.\nThat may sound hard, but we do it all the time\nwith print profits.  And with the explosion of\ndigital media in the past 15 years, it would\nbecome even easier to do.  You no longer have to\nsell a print version, you just have to put it\nonline, and to do that, you just have to hire a\ncouple of tech types and you're off to the races.\nWhen I mention this idea, some people see it as\na great plan to provide a viable alternative to\nthe local TV networks.  Local newspapers could\nprovide this more independent outlet for city\ngovernment news, and people would feel better\nabout reading about their local government on a\nnewspaper website.  I believe that this could\nwork in the sense that it would be a much\nmore balanced and evenhanded news source than\nyou get from the local broadcaster.  And it would\nbe good for local officials if they didn't need\nso much from the local TV station to get their\nmessage across, and more were likely to rely on\nindependent or web sources.  As you may know,\nthis has been a great dilemma in local politics,", "On this day in 1927, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity was verified for the first time with an experiment using a star of the first magnitude called 61 Cygni. The observation was performed with a specialized interferometer (an optical device), so to test the theory, scientists had to make a special calculation which could only have been done beforehand and the observation of the star could have been made before any of the results of the calculation were known. Einstein's theory is based upon the idea that anything can be viewed as a mass moving as if at the extreme of one of the velocity arcs of a light cone, and that mass can be considered as having such velocity; thus, according to Einstein's theory, light is also a mass. The light cone itself can be used as a basis for building an optical device which, when properly calibrated, can measure the diameter of any massive celestial object. The results of this first test of the theory are so precise and agree so well with theory that the observed velocity of light and the value of the constant that multiplies it in Einstein's theory have been accepted as the real speed of light for measuring all masses and for the measurement of distances to be used to construct the size of any star. Einstein's constant, which is now termed \"c,\" has been found equal to 299,792,458. This information, when related to the other factors, makes it possible to calculate the size of any star from a knowledge of its mass. This has made possible a method of determining the absolute size of distant celestial objects with greater precision and reliability than was possible by measuring the apparent radii of those objects through their visual appearance when a planetary disk is present, as in the case of planets, or when light from the object in question has previously reached the Earth and been transmitted to the telescope as a photon, as in the case of stars and other objects not too close to the Earth. This method of measurement of large celestial objects is now possible by using Einstein's constant, \"c,\" which he derived in his \"special\" theory of relativity based upon a mass having the velocity of light. The calculation of \"c\" was a lengthy and complex process and took two years, which is why the results were not available prior to a test of the theory. This first \"special\" experiment was performed by the California Institute of Technology, which has a specialized interferometer. Other observatories in the U.S. participate in international studies of other objects to increase their accuracy. This is the first step in the creation of a new science based on the principles of Einstein's three great theories: the special theory of relativity of 1905, the general theory of relativity of 1915, and the theory of quantization of 1964. Einstein's most important work was the unified field theory, which describes everything in the Universe in terms of the three fields, the gravitational field, the electromagnetic field, and the ether-like quantum field. All three of these theories can be summed up in a word: \"Unity,\" as they describe a system based upon the fact, as expressed by Einstein, that \"all of Nature is only the movement of Energy, and the force of a system is its movement.\"", "The problem of \"selling\" your book through social media is that you can't\nsell it because you don't own the platform. Therefore, don't sell anything\nthrough your social media. Instead, try to encourage people to purchase it\nfrom its proper online distribution channel. Try to develop a strategy that\nincorporates several strategies and, if done correctly (which means if the\naudience has a need, the right context, and the right moment to see your\ncontent), create marketing opportunities that will make people want to\npurchase your product, as opposed to just hearing about it.\n_CREDITS:_\nDirector: Ben Waggoner, Ben Waggoner, LLC.\nEditor: Katherine Mintz, Ben Waggoner, Ben Waggoner, LLC.\nDirector of Photography: Ben Waggoner.\nSound Mixer: Brad Whitehead.\nMusic: C.P.

My wife, the great Debra, was out of town, in Spain for a couple of weeks. She was at some spa or yoga retreat with her mother, or else it was a yoga cruise or something with her yoga cronies, and my son\u2014our son\u2014Hawaiian, with the surfboard and the Hawaiian language (I just wish I knew a little more) and the kites, of course; he flew kites with his father before we all turned to smoke\u2014was at his dad's house on the coast for a couple of weeks, with his grandfather. I'd given him a key (I was worried, with all the things that were happening in society) and a lot of instructions, and he was supposed to be in and out.\nWell, so, one day I am having lunch with my girlfriend, Karla, and the subject of Hawaii, and of the father-son relationship comes up, and I look over and there she is, sitting at the other table with a very pretty little girl. And this is the only time that I've ever seen that girl, and that will be it, because it was a beautiful thing, my relationship with Hawaiian. Well, the beautiful thing was that she had just come out of my bed, I'm not kidding you, and, well, that was the end of _that_ and the end of _her!_ But there I was this beautiful June day in Santa Monica, the sun is shining, and here was Hawaiian\u2014this fine young woman, as I said\u2014and I couldn't get past her being Hawaiian. I was too drunk to remember how much I'd had to drink. I was still too drunk to remember that I was having my monthly drink of tequila\u2014which was a terrible mistake. I mean, she knew my thing was tequila, but still\u2014I'd had a lot of tequila\u2014and she looked just like the surfer dudes up here, and I was like: this is my girlfriend's daughter? Is she, like\u2014Is this some sort of family thing here? You know, she looked like her father with glasses, but\u2014But Hawaiian was wearing glasses, which I remember with her, so\u2014So what was I supposed to think? And you know\u2014I think my mind was going like, oh, what do young women do over the summer? You know, go to spas or something. So I'll never see her again\u2014which, she was gone\u2014I'll never see her again, and it was really great, and then the next month was even better, and then, of course\u2014as I say, she just disappeared, and it was an enormous loss to me and to the world\u2014because she became a really successful singer, and she was such a good friend, actually. Just an all-around fantastic woman. She was always up on some cause or another. And, yes, I said all that. She was quite a woman. She used to come talk to me all the time about being famous; she was really worried about her privacy when she was\u2014when she had to turn it on. You know, you get so full of yourself, you think that everyone should be in awe of you. She really fretted about what it was going to be like. The craziest thing", "It seems like a good time to look back on 40 years of newspapers. Since, when most people look back on history, they tend to look at the past two or three hundred years, at our 40th Anniversary, our focus has naturally been directed in the direction of a time period which most people are far more familiar with - the newspaper industry as it was in 1864. So it seems reasonable to start with a description of the physical newspaper industry which at that time consisted of the 1811 daily papers, the 30 London evening papers, the 45 provincial regional evening and weekly papers, the 593 papers published by provincial provincial weeklies. The industry as a whole was not only much more modest in scale than it is today, but it was not much involved with the production of books. While the newspapers were more widely read (80,000,000 people read at least one newspaper at least once a day), there was far less of a market in books than at the present time. In 1864 the United Kingdom had a population of over 22 million. The British public would probably not have bought many newspapers or books if they had been priced at the rates of other media today.\nOn the other hand, the British industry was the predominant supplier of information to a population that was less than 1,000 years old and 25 to 30 times larger than today - 311,000,000. The industry as a whole published 10,700 books and 7,100 periodicals during the same year (average of 26,000 books and 7,000 periodicals). This output is about double in numbers of total books and more than twice in numbers of periodicals. In other words, there had been considerable growth since 1811 in both book production and periodical production. It's not hard to imagine that this kind of rapid growth in production would not be sustainable for long.\nAt the beginning of 1864, with a population that was almost five times as large as the population of 2011, it is fair to say that in the United Kingdom, there was a great deal of information available for the British readership. What would the world have been like if the newspaper industry had also been as large as the book publishing industry today? It's hard to really say: but for what it's worth, we can say that if newspapers had grown as fast as books, we wouldn't have to deal with 37,000 newspapers today with 65% of the entire population of the world in the United Kingdom. Of course there is no telling what we would call these 37,000 newspapers to avoid confusion. Perhaps each could have had the name of its chief district or town in which it was published. Or each could have been called \"The London Evening Daily\". At least they would have all been called \"The London Evening Daily\".\nWHO OWNED NEWSPAPERS IN 1864?\nBy 1864, when people talked about newspapers in Great Britain, they were almost always talking about daily newspapers, because the daily newspapers in 1864 controlled more than 80% of the sales. While the number of national, provincial, regional, city and town, daily or weekly newspapers increased, it was at a rate which was only half the rate of increase for weeklies and a sixth the rate of increase for dailies. By 1864 only the London Evening Daily was being published weekdays. In England, and in certain provincial cities, there were a few evening newspapers being published three or four times per week, with the same content and length as the daily newspapers. With the exception of London, these evening papers were being used as adjuncts to the daily papers and were part of the same paper. The content was the same in London as in all the other provincial evening papers and most other newspapers in addition to the evening edition of the London Evening Daily.\nThe reason there were so few regional newspapers was not that no one wanted them - as is well understood today, a regional newspaper had an audience in a community which it served or would like to serve. The readership of newspapers was not large (4.6 million in 1864). If they had been a little larger, it would have been easy for a publisher to have several regional newspapers going at the same time. The problem was one of scale. The printing press with which most newspapers were printed was too expensive to buy enough copies to sell at a price which made it worthwhile", "News media face greater uncertainty and change than ever before\nas technology impacts the creation, distribution and consumption of news.\nHowever, the industry remains optimistic and will continue to reinvent itself\nif it can make the transition faster.\n-  The role of media companies is evolving as their audiences continue to\n-  The consumer becomes increasingly savvy as the demand for content grows.\nHow news media companies are adapting to these shifting dynamics will\ndetermine their success and survival.\n-  The convergence of platforms creates new opportunities as well as new\nchallenges, but the winners will be the media companies that create\nunique and engaging cross-platform content for the emerging multi-\nscreen generation.\nMEDIA & MERCEDES STUDY -\nToday, we are in a period unlike any previous time.

However, despite these changes and\nopportunities, many questions remain, such as how will news media\ncompanies redefine themselves?  How do news media companies need to\nre-engineer their organizational structures to accommodate these\nnewly emergent dynamics?  How do consumers' preferences now drive\nnewspapers' decisions as to which platform they want to invest in,\nsuch as tablets or smartphones?  As platforms continue to migrate from\nprint to digital realms, who are the winners and who are the losers?\nAnd, finally, how will news media companies be able to monetize the\nnew products?\nThe above questions are some of the key challenges confronted by\nnews media firms in this ever-changing and dynamic landscape.

This study's objectives were to\nunderstand what role new platforms like the Internet play in\naudiences' consumption habits, and the resulting impacts on\nnews media organizations' revenues and profitability.\nThe Mercedes-Benz study, \"News Media:  Digital or Ink?,\" surveyed\nmore than 3,600 people in September-October, 2010.  Eighty-three\npercent of the participants indicated that news consumption is\nbecoming multidimensional, with many consumers now relying on a\nbroad range of new platforms, such as tablets, laptops and other\nhandheld devices.\nThe average respondent, age 34-plus, spends nearly two hours a\nday reading news content.  This includes newspapers, magazines,\nradio and television news coverage.  It breaks down, however,\ndepending on the country.  In Australia and Canada, reading news\ncontent takes the least amount of time with an average of less\nthan 30 minutes a day.  In the other six countries, Japan,\nFrance, Germany, South Korea, Mexico and the United Kingdom,\nindividuals spend an average of approximately two hours a day\nreading news online or offline.\nWhen we look at the various media platforms that the\nrespondents use, newspapers, magazines, radio and television\nnews all have their place.  For reading the news, newspapers and\nmagazines dominate with nearly 80% penetration.  However, with\ntheir availability on mobile apps, this penetration may be much\nhigher.

The NASDC hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., eastern standard time, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.\nOn January 14, 2005, Horizon Air applied to the FAA for an AOC to operate Boeing Model 737CL (MD-80, series 200) aircraft under Sec. 21.164(b) of the Federal Aviation Rule (14 CFR 21.164(b)) for domestic operations. The regulations authorize the Administrator to issue an AOC to an air carrier that meets the requirements of all applicable regulations, including the applicable Air Carrier Operations specification, and that has filed written application on FAA Form 119, ``Application for Air Carrier Certificate or Amendment of the Air Carrier's Operating Certificate.'' In May 2005, the FAA issued an AOC that provided for operations of DC-9 aircraft to be conducted under 14 CFR 21.115.\nThe FAA subsequently found that Horizon Air operated Boeing Model 737CL (MD-80 series 200) aircraft, while still waiting for DOT certification (14 CFR 21.164(b)) for model specific Boeing Model 737-700 aircraft. This action resulted in the FAA conducting a detailed review of Horizon Air's application and the air carrier's operational and maintenance data. This review revealed that Horizon Air's previous DC-9 type rating as an airline operator is now superseded by a McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9 specific type rating as a Part 121 air carrier, and consequently, by amending Horizon Air's AOC and operations specifications.\nThe FAA has reviewed Horizon Air's data and has found that Horizon Air meets the requirements of Sec. 21.164(b) and the relevant part 121 air carrier AOC/operations specifications. An FAA principal operations inspector (POI-192A) has also inspected Horizon Air's operations bases and verified that the air carrier meets the applicable requirements of Sec. 21.187 and 21.120(h). Accordingly, the FAA has determined that it is appropriate to revise Horizon Air's AOC at 14 CFR 21.164(b) to include type ratings and operations for McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9 aircraft (with Series 30 engines), and appropriate to amend Horizon Air's operations specifications at 14 CFR 21.120(h) to include this change.\nThe FAA has examined the application, pertinent operating information, and the air carrier's inspection results and finds that each operation complies with the applicable operational statutes, regulations, standards, and orders. This determination is made in accordance with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR 21.163(f).\nPART 21--CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES", "In this issue of the Bulletin, the U. S.

The first two are concerns about the frequency assignment and the final one is whether the Commission should revoke or modify the grant of this experimental license.\nThis matter involves the assignment of RCA's antenna site in Brownsville, Texas. Under the proposed rulemaking, the Commission would grant the application of Tejas Productions, doing business as Radio Broadcasting Service (\u201cRadio Broadcasting Service\u201d), d/b/a La Posada FM-FM Translator Licensee (DBA LP-FM), Laredo, Texas. The grant would involve the assignment from Radio Broadcasting Service to LP-FM of the station's assigned broadcast facilities in Brownsville, Texas. The proposed assignment would be to assign LPF-FM's antenna site as identified by a reference number contained in the administrative review. The reference number for this assignment is RCA Brownsville, Texas, TV/FM station antenna site E-1, in accordance with an application to increase its power and change its community of license to Laredo, Texas, which was filed August 26, 1991 and granted May 10, 1993 (FCC Decision No. 93-97, MM Docket No. 90-228).

In this case, its opinion posing as \"reporting\" and, of course, the worst kind of the opinion.\nThis week, I'm working on Monday's topic, which is a review of how the media cover climate change--not to the great detail which I'd wish to have.  But I came across something in the middle of my rambling, and this will be a separate note.\nI was going through some research on the Australian Herald Sun newspaper--which is not the best newspaper in Australia, nor perhaps even in\nSydney, given its competition with the News Corp.-owned, right-wing Sydney Morning Herald, and the relatively new Fairfax-owned, progressive The Age of Melbourne--to see what kind of coverage it has on climate issues. (Because of its coverage, I've stopped buying it, which I admit is a small personal note.)\nI came across a story on \"Global Warming\", and wanted to see if\nit had been mentioned in the US media. To my surprise, the US media almost completely missed it, even though it was picked up by numerous Australian newspapers.  The Herald Sun has a \"story\" up which I'll\nsummarize, which is: the Australian Senate is investigating a book that was banned. But only the banning is part of the story, not the issue of global warming denial. The book is titled \"The Madness of Global Warming -\nFlawed Science and Firm Political Conclusions\", and here's the crux of what the Herald Sun claims:\nAustralian Senate committee investigating book banned because it \"endangers\" future generations\n\"A NEW book which claims the theory of global warming is the biggest scientific fraud since the Earth was flat has sparked another international row about the issue \ufffd despite being banned in Australia. It was the controversy about the book, The Madness of Global Warming \ufffd\nFlawed Science and Firm Political Conclusions, that triggered an inquiry by the Senate Environment Committee into the book, banned by both state governments in the country.\"\nThis banning is described in detail, and it did go through an international row, although the Australian government does not ban books (see, for example, this). The author of the book is Ian Plimer.\nNote that the Australian government did not ban the book, nor did the Herald Sun acknowledge the banning: the author can sell them as he pleases. He wrote: \"A UN report on climate change exaggerates natural changes in climate and minimizes human emissions of greenhouse gases. The report and the global warming problem are based on unproven computer models not on evidence and experiments in the Earth's climate.\"\nSo the Australian government did not ban the book, but the Herald Sun claims that the Australian Senate did investigate it, in \"a new round of political rowing\" (their term, not mine) \"over the issue of climate change\".  The\nHerald Sun reports that it was banned because it is a dangerous book, because \"it 'endangers' the lives of future generations\", \"because it calls scientific consensus into the question\", and \"could undermine the scientific\nconsensus'\".\nHow?  Well, \"climate change\" has become a very broad term, and the Herald Sun reports that the book is a \"denial\" book, and that some people believe that \"it could undermine scientific consensus that humans are causing an increase in dangerous global temperature rises by releasing the gases that trap heat.\"  The Herald Sun cites Senator Steve Fielding, who has previously raised some of the issues in the book, along with an anti-whaling author, John Frawley, both of whom apparently believe the \"dangerous book\".\nNote here that we have no evidence or quotes supporting that belief, or even that the bans mean anything--other nations have banned books when they wished to, without any real evidence that the book was dangerous.  Also note that the\nHerald Sun article focuses on the banning of the book, and on the anti-whaling author (more on him), and a Senator (who is actually pro-whaling, despite the fact that the Herald Sun cites him) who opposes a carbon taxation scheme (and doesn't\nwish tax reduction on those with larger emissions and larger costs).  But the Herald Sun article does not discuss, nor even report on, the claims of the book, nor any of the specific facts on which it is made. The\nSenate inquiry has begun, so perhaps, at some point, the Senate will hear from the author", "How do publishers in India manage the risk of being scammers and reassuring advertisers that they won't have their ads placed on fraudulent sites?\nPublishers will need to convince advertisers they\u2019re not about to click fraud\nIN MAY 2018, a news headline screamed, \u201cFake news is fake because it\u2019s not news,\u201d and pointed out that many publishers today have scam tactics on websites that misrepresented their content and fraudulent ad placement.\nFake news is the news that, as the name signifies, isn\u2019t true. The news headlines of the internet have seen a dramatic increase in fake articles that lead to an inaccurate and untrue news story, sometimes even on fake websites. These websites sometimes create content on other websites to get clicks, or place fraudulent ads on their platforms.\n\u201cFake is also about the trust of a brand and how a publisher can earn it back,\u201d said Adobe\u2019s Ruchi Bhatia, speaking at the World Retail Congress in Barcelona.\nWhether you\u2019re from an established media house or a startup, all publishers need to ensure that everything they produce is relevant, compelling, accurate, reliable, reliable, and relevant. If you publish fake news, you may damage the entire industry and may have to work even harder to convince the world that you do what you do, and do it well.\n\u201cFake news is no less than a digital poison. It can be a potential threat not only to our society, but also our business,\u201d said Ms. Bhatia.\nOne of the largest problems in the media industry is fake news stories that seem to have no factual basis. Publishers have their own scam sites, and sometimes create stories or ads that are clearly fraudulent, even though publishers may claim that their sites are free from such fraudulent activities.\nThe truth is that many websites, large or small, are being used by publishers to generate fake traffic to meet their revenue goals.\nFake publishers need to stop using deception, scam tactics, and deceptive marketing to make their website seem credible.\nBut what can publishers do to ensure that they can maintain their trustworthiness with ad buyers and win their trust back? Adobe\u2019s Ruchi said: \u201cThe digital transformation journey isn\u2019t a straight, easy journey. We need to build a culture of trust\u2014a shared trust between brands and publishers. We have to earn, not assume, that trust.\u201d\nOne thing is for sure, publishers who have scam tactics on their platforms will never be able to regain that trust to the same degree as any other publisher in the future.\nIn addition, if you choose to work as an affiliate, you must inform your advertisers that will be a scam tactic used on these platforms.\nPublishers will lose advertisers\u2019 budgets if they don\u2019t earn a strong relationship with them. The best action publishers can take to regain that trust is to build a secure, trusted environment while creating authentic, high-quality content that audiences can easily access on different mobile platforms. \u201cDigital trust is built over time \u2026 [publishers need to] prove that they are a good bet for their advertiser partner,\u201d said Ms. Bhatia.\nIn an interview with Publish, Dianne Beaudoin, head of programmatic for the Americas for Essence, said:\u201cThere are multiple layers of trust that our clients hold, not just for who they\u2019re buying from, but also what they\u2019re buying. Fraud, transparency and brand safety are all parts of that trust. As clients have continued to ask for more, we\u2019ve needed to build trust to give them what they need. When you take advantage of brand, you hurt them as a client.\u201d\nAnother major challenge in the digital advertising industry is brand safety. Even though digital advertisements need to get the brand message across, fraudulent publishers are taking advantage of these incentives and publishing fraudulent ads with misleading and false content.\nAs trust becomes a crucial part of an advertisers\u2019 relationship with brands, publishers need to be certain that the content they serve to users is authentic and safe for companies to advertise on.\nTo keep your advertisers, you need to make sure that the content you are displaying to end-users is trustworthy and safe\u2014this includes publisher websites and mobile apps as well. Publishers and advertising agencies that are working to create a trusted ecosystem with their clients will need to invest", "In the early part of the 20th century, Americans from varied backgrounds started a discussion on the topic of racial equality, and the end of racism. They discussed the importance of freedom, and the need to eliminate slavery, discrimination in jobs, and opportunities for social advancement for the African American race. During the late 1900s, the focus of discussion on civil rights shifted toward the plight of female Americans.\nThroughout the country, women were not given equal pay to their male counterparts, and were not allowed to serve on juries, and had limited access to birth control, and to a divorce. The Women's Rights Movement, however, was not exclusively confined to the country, but also a part of the global discussion on the topic of racial equality, and the end of racism.\nThe National Women's Party was dedicated to educating the public on the need for equal pay and the vote, and they believed that women could only achieve all of the rights and responsibilities of a full citizen when these demands were accomplished. The National Women's Party was supported by suffragettes such as Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, and became a prominent organization in the struggle for women's suffrage rights.\nAfter the National Women's Party established the Equal Rights Amendment, the group also began an offshoot campaign on the subject of racial equality, and the complete elimination of racism from all societies throughout the world. In 1956, the ERA Campaign was founded with the aim of expanding its original program to include all aspects of racism and inequality, and to bring the plight of African Americans to the attention of the people of the United States.\nThe ERA Campaign held events and symposiums, and printed bulletin issues that discussed civil rights and racial equality in an effort to increase public awareness of this subject. ERA pamphlets and bulletin issues were sent to congresspeople and state legislators, and women's rights activists in the name of the women of the ERA Campaign, and the women of America. The ERA Campaign also conducted educational tours for women's rights activists, and the group created a program directed at increasing the voter turnout of women on election days. ERA Campaign activists also participated in demonstrations and marched for the suffrage rights of women and the end of racism in the United States.\nEven when the group's mission went beyond the original goals of the ERA Campaign, and women were granted the right to vote in 1920, the organization continued with its efforts to end racism throughout society, and to bring awareness to the need to eliminate this subject in other countries as well.\nThe ERA Campaign has a long and storied history of promoting and protecting the rights of women, and to eliminate racial inequality and discrimination. During the 20th century, the ERA Campaign participated in, and led a number of social justice movements. The group's work still continues today.\nTHE ERA CAMPAIGN: FIGHTING WITHOUT ARMS\nBY NANCY WALDSTEIN\nThe ERA Campaign was founded in 1956 in part to make sure that African Americans obtained their rightful share of the benefits of social programs. These benefits included education, housing, better health care facilities, and fair wages and working conditions. In the 1950s and 1960s, racist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, acted through terrorism, burning crosses, and intimidation, and killed African Americans, who were fighting for their rights in the United States.\nThe ERA Campaign conducted educational tours abroad, and sent letters and pamphlets to lawmakers in order to increase awareness of the need for the organization, and of the need to eliminate racism not only in the United States, but also throughout the world. The ERA Campaign, and its members, continued to send out these articles during the early part of the twenty-first century. The ERA Campaign's purpose, and its mission, is a continued focus on racial equality and the need to eliminate racism.\nThe ERA Campaign's educational symposiums and presentations covered a range of subjects. The ERA Campaign addressed issues such as racial prejudice, and racism both in the United States, and globally. The ERA Campaign's work extends into foreign countries, and the group continues to educate Americans and foreign citizens alike.\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, the ERA Campaign's leaders included Susan Witt", "Would the world be a better place\n if women and men were more equal?\n#  **A PRIMER ON GENDER EQUALITY**\n**The gender gap** represents the difference between the level of achievement open to each sex and how much they actually achieve.\n**It is a fundamental human rights issue** and a development challenge. The problem is worldwide, and varies from region to region.\n**It is a concern of development, peace, security, well-being, and stability:** Each gender faces constraints and disparities that interfere with achieving their full potential and their ability to contribute fully to society. When these constraints and disparities are significantly larger than they need to be, they result in greater risks of conflict, greater economic costs, and greater human suffering.\n**Men and women are more alike than different, and the problem is not that women and men are not equal, but rather that they are not allowed to be equal.** The gender gap is not a consequence of innate psychological or social differences between men and women, but rather a consequence of unfair and unequal policies, norms, and practices in society.\n**It cuts across development issues** and intervention priorities. Improving gender equality is a prerequisite for poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. But even where gender equality is achieved, improving men's and women's roles and relationships, and integrating them, will also be necessary to ensure greater well-being and sustainability for the next generation of both women and men.\n**Today, gender equality is as important as political stability:** It is as relevant to development and peace as it is to human rights and national security. Yet it is often neglected or overlooked. Recognition of the many ways it is central to a wide range of global concerns is slowly growing. More and more countries include gender equality in their official development cooperation objectives. The United Nations recently agreed to put gender equality at the center of the work of its Peacebuilding Commission. Many institutions, including the UN, have also made a strong commitment to addressing the global phenomenon of violence against women.\n**Equality is about much more than equal economic opportunities** and much more than just a measure of equality. Gender equality means giving women and men equal voice and equal ability to be actively engaged in building their own future, and in contributing to building the future of their societies.\n**Equalities matter in and of themselves** regardless of whether or not they make a difference to outcomes. But many of the best practices shown to improve well-being and achieve development results are found where gender inequalities are being addressed directly.\nI hope this book will help provide the arguments for why you should care about gender equality, why you should help improve it, and why you should not settle for being less than you could be.\nChapter 1 focuses on the need for gender equality, explains why progress toward it matters _a lot_ , and sets out the broad definition of gender equality we will be using.\nChapters 2 and 3 start to get to the nitty-gritty of what achieving gender equality would look like and would mean, why it is a challenge to achieve, and what it will require of us individually, socially, and collectively to bring about.\nChapters 4\u20138 explore a series of specific areas, starting with how gender equality and well-being are intrinsically related and what that means, and then moving on to key areas and questions, showing how gender equality is relevant to a wide range of concerns of concern to everyone from gender specialists to generalists who are concerned with peace, conflict, development, the environment, and human rights.\nChapter 9 concludes the book with reflections on the need for _levers_ and _bridges_ that can help bring about the needed changes in policies and programs in key areas. It also includes a series of quick tips and ideas, including two questions to help you consider your own responsibilities, a list of six basic values to guide our actions, a list of seven key actions to take, as well as a long list of further resources at the end.\nA book about gender equality needs to be gender equal, not just in the content, but also in the production. I would particularly like to thank my friend and colleague Kristen Boye, a gender specialist herself, who was a major contributor to this book, which was written _and_ proofread by her. Together we have a better understanding of what is required to make gender equality a reality, and that understanding and the book you are reading is a joint male-female accomplishment, and just like all of our other joint male-female efforts, this one", "An executive brief detailing the main findings from a recent consumer survey on digital media consumption habits.\nDATE CREATED: 20 March 2014\nDATE MODIFIED: 21 March 2014\nDATE MODIFIED TWICE: 1 April 2014, 9 April 2014\nDATE MODIFIED THRICE: 8 May 2014, 20 May 2014, 10 June 2014\nDATE MODIFIED FOUR TIMES: 27 June 2014, 24 July 2014, 8 August 2014, 22 August 2014\nDATE MODIFIED FIVE TIMES: 20 September 2014, 7 October 2014, 4 November 2014, 8 November 2014, 26 November 2014\nDATE MODIFIED SIX TIMES: 11 January 2015, 22 February 2015, 26 March 2015, 25 April 2015, 29 May 2015, 4 June 2015\nDATE MODIFIED SEVEN TIMES: 2 July 2015, 7 August 2015, 31 August 2015, 24 September 2015, 4 October 2015, 9 November 2015, 1 December 2015\nDATE MODIFIED TWENTY-THREE TIMES: 5 January 2016, 17 January 2016, 3 February 2016, 24 February 2016, 29 February 2016, 24 March 2016, 27 April 2016, 4 May 2016, 15 May 2016, 19 June 2016, 28 June 2016, 19 July 2016, 26 July 2016, 2 August 2016, 16 August 2016, 21 September 2016, 14 October 2016, 4 November 2016, 15 December 2016, 28 January 2017, 14 February 2017, 4 March 2017, 27 March 2017, 17 April 2017, 8 May 2017, 1 June 2017, 28 June 2017, 11 December 2017, 5 February 2018", "Since a person can create his own blog and  post  to  it using any browser,  one  should  not  be  limited  by  the  capabilities  of  a  given  operating  system or web browser.\nWe are proud that we made our web sites available to virtually anyone using  virtually  any  browser.  We  were  using  Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0  when  our  first  web  site  went  public on the Internet.\nAs we started upgrading our server, the Webmaster had more difficulty loading the pages on Internet Explorer because more and more Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0  users  kept  upgrading  their  Microsoft  Internet  Explorer  while  we  were  trying to upgrade our server to support higher versions of MSIE 2.0  (which were  incompatible  with  MSIE1.0, and  which  would not work with anything above Microsoft Internet  Explorer 2.0).\nAs we started upgrading our server, the Webmaster was using Netscape Navigator 6 (build  51  with  Java  enabled).  However, Java  is  no  longer  considered  secure,  as  of  July  26,  2006.  So, we had to disable Java in our Internet Explorer and Opera browsers.  Also, Netscape Navigator is not available any more.\nAs a result, the Webmaster became a Firefox user.  We started using Firefox  on  July  25,  2006.\nWe did not have a Linux box, but someone suggested that Ubuntu Linux  would  be  a good choice.  Ubuntu Linux is derived from Debian Linux.\nSo, the Webmaster decided to try Ubuntu Linux and to see if it would allow us to continue to have the same level  of  online  freedom  with which we are accustomed  to  have  since  our  first  web  site in 1999. The Ubuntu Linux Web site states:\nUbuntu is a community developed, Debian-based Linux distribution designed  for  the  average  user.  It  is  very easy to install and it works straight from the CD. Ubuntu is for everyone.\nInstalling Ubuntu Linux from the Disc and Installing it onto our Computer\nUbuntu Linux ships on a dual-layer CD but we did not have one of those, so the CD  shipped to us was of only a single layer.  So, the Webmaster decided to install Ubuntu Linux onto our  computer  from  the compact disc we had. We removed the compact disc that came with our first computer -- a Dell Dimension computer -- which was 10 years old and which we no longer used.  Then,  we  used  the  computer's DVD-Rom drive in order to install Ubuntu Linux.\nWe downloaded the 64-bit version of the Ubuntu Linux distribution and ran the Ubuntu-64-disk.img iso image file which came with it from  http://cd.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-amd64-1.iso. The Webmaster chose the 64-bit version because some of the older 32-bit applications that this person was using would not work with the Ubuntu Linux 32-bit version.\nWe copied the cdimage to the computer's hard drive using the Ubuntu Linux installation iso image file, a 500-mb CD burner, and cdcdeburn. However, we were having too much difficulty copying the installation source CD iso image to the computer's hard drive using cdcdeburn (see http://tangentsoft.net/cd/ for assistance).  Therefore, we used dd to copy the Ubuntu Linux installation source CD iso image source file to the computer's hard  drive  (see http://tangentsoft.net/computer-how-to-/427-how-do-i-create-a-ubuntu-linux-cd-image-from-scratch).\nTo test the operating system, the Webmaster booted off the Ubuntu Linux CD and chose the Ubuntu Linux 64-bit Edition option on the operating system installer menu. Then, the installer created the /boot, /home and /media/cdrom partitions.\nWhen the installer booted off the Ubuntu Linux CD, it put the Ubuntu Linux Operating System onto  the  second  hard  drive  (/dev/sdb).

She waited till the postman had opened the box and took the mail out.\n\"What have you got there?\"\nShe watched him take out the mail he had for her.

They post about topics such as flu shots, tips to keep your kids healthy, or what types of things the staffers are working to implement at the hospital. They've found that the site generates between 5000 and 10,000 unique visits per month.\nIt's hard to fathom why health-care providers would turn away their potential customers, especially during such a competitive season.\nAccording to a study by Deloitte & Touche LLP, 80% of people said they are likely to choose a hospital based on its \"quality care.\"\nGiven that most consumers are very interested in good health outcomes based on their research, and that 38% of patients seek hospital and clinic information on the Web when they are considering health-care options, I thought it would be interesting to interview some health-care providers about how they use online tools to engage their target audience.\nIn our interview with the team at Piedmont Columbus Regional Healthcare in Georgia, we heard about how a small group of employees managed to create a brand-new website about a hospital that's only been opened since the fall of 2009. By making small changes, the team found online success without much marketing overhead.\nThe team also explained why they were motivated to start blogging, how they measure their success and what they hope to accomplish with their sites.\nTheir results were impressive -- especially since Piedmont's first blog focused on hospital openings. But they also have a blog focused mostly on topics such as holiday flu shots, tips to keep your kids healthy, and what they're working to implement at the hospital, among other topics.\nWith all the social networking tools at our disposal, people are looking for information that is credible, timely, and easily found.\nThis was an impressive achievement given the small size of their team.\nWe found that Piedmont's content is valuable and people are able to get specific answers to their health-care concerns. We also learned that they aren't afraid to take chances on engagement tools.\nWe interviewed several people on the Piedmont team for this article -- starting first with Mark Woodward, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, and moving on to Jennifer McIntosh, Vice President, Public Relations, and John Jones, Vice President for Community Health and the Piedmont Community Paramedic program.\nAnd next we interviewed Laura Puckett, a registered nurse on the Critical Care team at Piedmont, who was the impetus behind the creation of the original blog. Puckett is also a member of the hospital's Beta Team, an employee focus group for healthcare quality initiatives.\nBelow are snippets from our questions. For more details, here's how to download the complete transcript.\nAlicia and Sarah then took a series of questions regarding the success of social media within their organization and how it has helped their patients:\nQ6. For you, what is the most helpful feature of the social media in your organization?\nA: Mark: It is the speed of communication. It is very important that patients and staff are able to ask their questions and receive answers very quickly.\nSarah: That's how people feel most comfortable getting their information. As I am telling them this, they don't think I am selling them something. They can ask me a question right now and get their answers right then. If you tell them right then and there, they have already asked the question, and they did not have to wait.\nLaura: I agree with Sarah. I think she put it the best. Because people don't want to be told a company line, they want the information that works in their lives, and they need it when they need it.\nQ7. Have you considered social media in different departments within your organization?\nA: Mark: Yes we have. In fact, the marketing department was one of the first departments to join our efforts by establishing our first Twitter account.\nAlong with that, we have seen other departments like IT, our volunteer coordinator and others using the online capabilities to great lengths. For social media there is no right or wrong. Every time we have approached a project, we said we want to know what will work for our patients and our employees and then asked them to participate and help build that solution.\nSarah: Yes, it started with me. They said, you know, we need to start a blog to help people come to the site and to help them know more about our hospital and what we do", "In this chapter, the reader learns of a murderer who has not committed a crime, but who in some mysteries of circumstance, finds himself caught in the web woven by the very powers that would destroy him. Through this web he is bound by the ties of blood and marriage, and even by the bonds of circumstance, despite his innocence. A plot to take his life is begun in Paris, France, but a strange twist of events sends him into further exile in the island nation of St. Thomas, a small place of unimaginative beauty, and the scene of his childhood, where he seeks to rediscover the love of his youth, a love now long lost, as well as his connection to his own life. An old friend, who seems to understand all, is waiting for him there, a man who carries the promise of both salvation and doom.\nPART I\nChapter\n1\nThomas\nTHOMAS AMES LIVED ALONE IN his apartment in the Village, on East 17th Street by Washington Square, but on a particular day Thomas was alone in a different way: He was alone, and he was also dead. The morning sun made its way over Fifth Avenue, casting shadows that flickered under the leaves of the giant trees that lined East 17th Street. Thomas, who watched the sunrise from a bench inside of Washington Square, was also watching the sun go down. And when it did, his eyes shut for the last time. Thomas was no stranger to death. As a CIA officer, he had witnessed death in the form of torture and imprisonment, and even as a tourist now, he was able to see it in new ways. Thomas could feel he owed the world his death. Perhaps his was paying it off, perhaps it was a debt he would happily pay off with the last of his life, but he was able only to pay it off in full. Though Thomas did not realize it, his was a fate that suited him well. After all, he had been murdered before. At the rate that he had been living his life since his arrival in New York, he was sure he would be a murderer once more, soon enough.\nThis was not a dream, Thomas thought to himself, and it would surely continue to be a strange dream if it weren't. The last several months' of his life had played out like a dream, at times. Thomas felt himself a child, standing on the shore of a sea of possibilities. He was afraid that one of the many waves of his life would suddenly crash into him, and drown him, without a trace. He was not prepared, and even had he been, there was no telling what such a wave might do to him.\nThomas was not a very tall man; rather, on good days, he was considered handsome, at least by the standards of St. Thomas, where it was not good form to be overtly tall. He had a long face, thin eyebrows, and soft eyes. His skin was dark and glowed at night when the moon came out, but it could seem pale in a boring light. Thomas's hair was the same color as his skin, and though he let it grow as long as he could, it was cut regularly by a barber in Union Square\u2014a barber who knew that Thomas had been to St. Thomas in his youth, and that Thomas felt his hair would not be complete until the two pieces of his life met again.\nThomas was an American born in 1943 to middle-class parents who lived in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. His father owned and leased a car for the wealthy of Manhattan Beach and Los Angeles, and on weekends his parents took Thomas and his sisters along for excursions, usually in the city, and when they were in Los Angeles, at the beach, the pool, Disneyland, and the movies. Thomas and his sisters were raised among well-to-do and well-loved parents who taught them how to please their environment and live well under any circumstance. Like the others in his family, Thomas was a good student, respectful, kind, well-liked, and unpretentious, though not particularly modest. Thomas was a favorite among the girlfriends and wives of his parents' friends and associates. They all admired him for his generosity and his good nature; it was clear that he would grow up to be a good man, and that he might one day be able to provide for his own family, a family in which he would be a good husband.\nThomas was well liked by his teachers as well, who saw him not only as an intelligent kid,", "FY 2012 ENGINEERING\nThe following information is a summary of the findings and recommendations\ncontained in the ENGINEERING section of the report.

The publisher recommends a three-step strategy that starts with finding and working with local advertisers for display, online, and print opportunities.\nHearst white paper lays out a path for publishers\nThe Hearst Corp.\u2019s LocalEdge business unit this week released a white paper to lay out a comprehensive path for local newspapers in the digital age.\n\u201cLocalEdge\u2019s three-part white paper outlines a strategy for helping media companies build strong local brands that are critical to generating revenue in a diverse and rapidly changing media environment,\u201d LocalEdge President Mark Campbell said in a statement.\nThe white paper offers advice on three related aspects of advertising, content, and the consumer. The authors lay out some of the choices each newspaper organization has regarding how to make its content work for it, and how to engage consumers.\nAt the center of the discussion is LocalEdge\u2019s mantra that local is what drives the company\u2019s business.\nIn terms of the consumer, LocalEdge sees a change in the way people are consuming news and information. People are increasingly interested in digital content and mobile devices, and they want local news to be part of that equation.\nOne of the recommendations is to offer a more user-friendly mobile experience \u2014 one that mirrors the mobile sites and apps that readers are accustomed to seeing throughout the Web.\n\u201cToday\u2019s reader consumes news in varied ways, accessing the content through desktop, phone, tablet, and now Google Glass devices. The media company with the best mobile experience will be the most successful,\u201d LocalEdge says.\nBut all that technology must be matched by a quality strategy when it comes to marketing and content. LocalEdge provides some guidance on how to do that, too.\nAmong its content suggestions are:\nBe where the consumer wants to be, or at least where most of his friends already are: LocalEdge says it is critical that you know the right place to be when content meets consumption. The company also recommends identifying which social networks (and networks of networks) the readers are hanging out in, and joining those discussions from the start. But don\u2019t forget to engage with consumers on blogs, and let them know about the other content you\u2019re producing that is worth engaging with.\nCreate a great mobile experience: LocalEdge suggests that media companies need to get used to having to create great mobile experiences because that\u2019s where all the growth is today. The white paper advises taking into account speed, ease of use, and simplicity, when building for the mobile experience.\nBecome an aggregator: While some news organizations have grown uncomfortable with the use of social news reading tools such as Flipboard and Zite, LocalEdge says that publishers need to embrace those tools because today\u2019s consumer is more likely to choose a platform, such as Flipboard, where news is aggregated than to wade through the noise of your own company\u2019s content.\nIn terms of advertising, LocalEdge says that creating great content will inevitably lead to more opportunities for local advertisers.\nThe company says that the market for digital advertising dollars is changing. \u201cLocalEdge sees both challenges and opportunities for publishers in the digital space,\u201d the white paper says. \u201cThe challenges lie with the shifting advertising landscape and the resulting reduced demand for national digital ad inventory. In addition, many publishers struggle with attracting quality local advertisers. The opportunities for publishers are that those same advertising trends lead to increased demand for local digital ad inventory and, consequently, to better alignment with local advertisers.\u201d\nThe opportunity is for media organizations to partner more closely with local advertisers, and to work more quickly to convert print relationships into digital ones. LocalEdge says that working with local advertisers not only will help improve the local advertising supply, but also will make for a higher quality audience for advertisers.\nHearst\u2019s advice for local newspapers is that there are many different business models that are working. The white paper explains, \u201cThe local media ecosystem has evolved from a local sales model to one dominated by national companies. The result has been a loss of control and local advertising spend. LocalEdge believes that a great deal of local advertising money will return to local media companies. To capture greater share of local advertising and increase advertiser satisfaction, LocalEdge recommends the development of successful local advertising sales models.\u201d\nIn terms of revenue generation, Hearst says that publishers should partner with local advertisers and begin to capture at least", "ENGAGEMENT DECISION\nANNOUNCEMENT.\nDear Mr. Secretary: I have the honor to refer to my cable\nnumber 33786 of December 21, as my report on the results of my discussions\nwith the Prime Minister which we pursued on his arrival in Washington\non the 20, following our meeting at the United Nations of December\n18. The Secretary's attention may be invited to the general results\nof the Prime Minister's engagements throughout our extensive discussions and\nthe views he expressed through the medium of my personal communications,\nthe transcripts of which were forwarded, as requested Secretary's previous\ncable number 33776 of December 20. The Secretary may also, should it\nbe desirable, be invited to read the full text of these messages. However,\nI shall now summarise their essentials briefly.\nI expressed to the Prime Minister our gratification that he\nwas in agreement with our conclusion that it would be important not to\nplace too much emphasis upon the differences between us which might\nencourage Communist efforts at propaganda directed toward the\npeople of India, but equally that we should do everything in our power\nto demonstrate to the Indians that our efforts had not been vitiated\nby those differences.\nI assured the Prime Minister that it was not our intention to\nbring the discussions of the United States-British Combined Chiefs\nof Staff to an end or to alter their character. I pointed out that\nit was our purpose, as we had previously arranged, to report\nthrough the Combined Chiefs any views which came to maturity during\ntheir discussions on the military situation and to request the advice\nof the Combined Chiefs on specific questions. To that end I had received\nfrom the Secretary the copy of the Combined Chiefs message to\nme, dated December 20, and which I had transmitted to the Prime\nMinister's Office.\nThe Prime Minister then stated that he wished to submit the\nquestion of Indian participation in the Combined Chiefs of Staff\nconferences to our Combined Chiefs of Staff, and that he agreed that\nthese views should be conveyed promptly through his Ambassador\nGeneral at Washington to be submitted with his own views and the\nresulting report.\nThe Prime Minister stated that, in the event the matter came\nup for consideration at the forthcoming meeting of the Combined\nChiefs of Staff, his representative would submit his views on the\nrelative importance to be attached to the Indian position (in\nrelation to the joint interest of our countries) and ask the advice\nof the Combined Chiefs of Staff upon our respective arguments in\nrelation to it. With regard to the British policy he expressed the\nview that they should not hesitate to put it on record that when\nIndia took over the question of the future of Burma she was entering\na new sphere of international affairs and that it was therefore inevitably\nfor the future of India, and possibly also for the security of the\nBurmese border regions, that Burma's status must depend largely in\nthe hands of the Indian Government.\nI remarked that we should find it of the greatest value if\nthey took with them a similar statement to that which we had\nproduced in our Combined Chiefs of Staff message on the British-American-Indian\nAgreement referred at my previous message.\nThe Prime Minister approved of this approach and said that\nhe would ensure that his representative would include this point.\nI stated that we had not overlooked the fact that any\nimproved Indian position in regard to South-east Asia was likely\nto have a significant effect on British interests in India and that we\nwould therefore need full consultation about the lines of Indian\naction which Britain might be called upon to support.\nI pointed out that the Indian Government were now at work on\nthe preparation of the final drafts of their defence programme\nand that before they proceeded far we would want to be in a\nposition to know what were to be India's final military requirements.\nIn connection with this, I said we should like to be assured\nthat they would agree to give most effectual consideration to\nany views which the United States Government might wish to express\nduring the revision of their programme. I mentioned also the hope\nthat India would take note of the point of view that we have\nexpressed to them on several occasions that their defence programme\nwill not be sufficiently strengthened unless their defence\nestimates were increased and also increased provision made\nfor the employment of additional British troops within India.\nThe Prime Minister responded that the Indian Government would\nnot", "The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced that it\nhas submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to extend to January 6, 2018, without\nrevision, the following information collection(s):\n(1) Approval and Management of Charity Patent Licenses (OMB Control Number 3060-\n0095) and\n(2) Registration of Trademarks (OMB Control Number 3060-0085).\nDATES: Written comments should be submitted on or before December 5th, 2017.\nADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Elizabeth Klem, OMB Desk Officer, Office of\nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office\nBuilding, Room 10235, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503; telephone (202) 395-3897;\nemail [email\u00a0protected] .

The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which holds its first-ever national poll later this month, will probably see an upgrade in terms of media laws and the print media will be opening up to foreign ownership.\nThe Newspaper Regulatory Agency announced in March that it will begin to implement a ban on advertising from tobacco products starting from July 2009. The ban is intended to support healthy lifestyle habits in the UAE and it comes in the wake of a global ban on tobacco advertising.\nIn the run-up to the UAE\u2019s first-ever national elections, UAE\u2019s federal government increased its print media advertising budget by 80% from AED70 million ($19 million) to AED124 million ($33.2 million), according to The National newspaper. This represents 68% of the total budget for 2009 (AED180 million), compared to 54% last year. The UAE will start electing 20 members of the Federal National Council in October 2009 and local media has stepped up its criticism of the country\u2019s current voting system.\nThe UAE\u2019s two major print media have also ramped up their spending with the Gulf News increasing the budget of its print publications by 38% from AED96 million ($26.4 million) this year to AED134 million ($35.6 million) next year.\nThe National has also budgeted AED134 million ($35.6 million) in 2009, compared to AED100 million ($27.6 million) this year.\nThese two print media are facing each other closely in terms of new projects with the Daily newspaper expanding its regional outreach to cover the new GCC and Iraqi markets over the next three years with 200 titles worldwide. The Gulf News on the other hand has launched the first edition of Satr, a magazine that will cater to the young Arab male readership for the Gulf region. It will be available initially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia and in English. A new Chinese magazine and a Hindi news section is also in the cards for 2010.\nIn an effort to boost readership and get closer to its loyal readers, the Gulf News has been running regular surveys to learn more about the preferences of its readers.\nIn 2008 The National newspaper, the main English-language newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, decided to launch an advertising campaign to get to know its readers and give them a sense of importance: \u201cThe Times of Your Life\u201d campaign aimed at bringing readers and advertisers closer to the newspaper. The campaign included a series of polls and surveys, and readers were presented with an interactive website where they could give their ideas for what the newspaper should be about. The newspaper\u2019s objective was to \u201cestablish a closer bond with its readers, provide better coverage of themes relevant to Abu Dhabi residents and give them the feeling that the paper\u2019s coverage of their lives is more relevant.\u201d\nThe newspaper then started running advertising campaigns with different tag lines, some with a local touch and others targeting expatriates. Two years from the first edition, the newspaper has grown its pages from 16 to 84, with a growing emphasis on lifestyle and community coverage.\nWhen the Gulf News launched the \u201cThe Times of Your LIfe\u201d campaign at the end of 2008, the main theme was to create a newspaper that focused on what was happening in the life of Abu Dhabi residents. One of the objectives was to \u201craise the profile of the media amongst our readers, particularly Emiratis.\u201d\nThe newspaper did not stop there. It then decided to go a little further and invite the residents of Abu Dhabi to \u201cbe part of the newspaper\u2026 the readers and customers.\u201d\nThe survey was launched to find out what they liked, what they did not like, what they thought was missing in the newspaper\u2026 What should the newspaper be about? What topics do they want on the newspaper? What should they cover about them? What do they want to know? It was an initiative that gave readers and advertisers a voice, and in the process also raised customer expectations from the media and brought the media closer to the public.\nThe newspaper has succeeded in becoming more personal and the survey clearly showed that the way people communicate with the media has changed. They want the newspaper to be closer to them rather than delivering the news. The survey was an", "The Board reiterated that it does not consider a single complaint alone without any other information to be sufficient in and of itself to show that a particular individual was harmed or a particular company was injured by the publication of false material; that a \u201cpublic record\u201d consists of information that has actually been verified; and that a company or individual that has been sued and has been held liable but has not yet paid any related judgments likely is at risk of being found in contempt.\nCONCLUSION: The Board will review a complaint to determine\nwhether it states a prima facie case of harm to a company or\nany individual. In most of these cases, the Board will order\nthe production of information about an aggrieved company, so that it can determine who will be injured if the publication of the information is found to be harmful. In that manner, the aggrieved company is able to provide the Board with information about itself. The Board also will seek\ninformation with respect to any individual, to determine whether\nhe or she has been \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act. This will provide the Board a means to determine the merit of any argument that an individual was injured or harmed by the publication of the challenged statement.", "This document sets forth a negotiated agreement between the United States of America and Switzerland arising out of the United States' request to the United Nations pursuant to Article 17.1 of the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, entered into force on October 15, 2000 (see Note 1). In addition, the Agreement is based on Articles 25, 26, 27 and 29 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. This Agreement supplements the existing double taxation treaty between Switzerland and the United States, signed at Basel on September 5, 1990, and supplements existing bilateral double taxation treaties to avoid double taxation regarding capital income, business profits, and remuneration from service of employees or officeholders with respect to private pensions, capital gains, and royalties.\nPOLICY: An intergovernmental consultation was held between the United States and Switzerland to prepare the discussions and negotiations for the signing of the Agreement. The Joint Plenary of the Economic Policy and Tax Affairs Committee and the Economic Cooperation Committee of the OECD Council was held as a part of the consultation process to prepare for these negotiations.\nThis Agreement is intended to have the force of law and provide taxing certainty in a bilateral relation between the United States and Switzerland. The Government of Switzerland expressed that the Agreement is an innovative treaty for the international tax world. The Swiss authorities noted the agreement is similar to a 2006 Swiss-U.S. model agreement. The Swiss Government has expressed interest in the implementation of this agreement and a desire to continue working with the United States on the further development of such bilateral double taxation treaties.\nOn June 19, 2012, the United States and Switzerland concluded the negotiations about this Agreement. Following the approval of both countries, the exchange of the letters of approval to the treaty took place June 25, 2012 in Bern, Switzerland. Both countries published in their official gazettes a Protocol accompanying the Agreement, which was signed in Bern on June 25, 2012, specifying certain provisions that could in no way be interpreted as reflecting the laws already in force. The Agreement, however, was published by both parties in the Federal Register as a document with no legal effect.\nOn December 12, 2012, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the protocol accompanying the Agreement.\nAUTHORIZITY: The President's determination regarding this Agreement was contained in a diplomatic note of September 12, 2013. Treaty Document Number 113-6.\nThis Agreement was concluded pursuant to chapter 17 of the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital (the \"Double Taxation Convention\"), signed at Washington on April 3, 1995 (see Note 2).\nThis Agreement entered into force on February 11, 2016.\nNotes: 1. The Double Taxation Convention entered into force October 16, 2002. The treaty resulted from bilateral discussions between the United States and Switzerland and the consultations of the Joint Committee that had been set up pursuant to the Double Taxation Convention. The existing Treaty has been amended several times.\n2. Switzerland is currently a party of 28 U.S. Double Taxation Agreements. Switzerland has previously concluded three Double Taxation Agreements that are not still in force, including a treaty with Sweden (1965-1995, see Note 2); a protocol to the treaty with South Africa (1986-1991, see Note 4); and a protocol to the treaty with Portugal (1983-1990). The protocol with Portugal has, however, never entered into force. The protocols with Sweden and South Africa were concluded for the purpose of avoiding double taxation on taxes on passive income and capital taxes.", "SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1932\nOur club is fortunate, that the visit of His Grace, the Most Reverend J.

I took care of a very sick\npatient with pneumonia. He was an elderly man with a deep\nwound in his back that was in the early stages of healing.\nHe was also infected with a bad strain of pneumonia. His\nblood pressure and pulse were low and his skin had taken on a\nyellowish hue. He was under oxygen, morphine drips, and I\nsometimes used an IV with his other hand because the one he was\ncurrently using had an IV catheter installed.\nThe doctor and I made several attempts at changing the IV\nsite but we never could get his IV to work. I began\nremoving the blood from it. It was very hard to do that\nwithout hurting him. He could not move very much. I was\ngently touching his hip with my right hand, when all of a sudden\nI felt a tugging sensation at my hand. My wrist was caught\nbetween his bones. I pulled my wrist and was stung by a great\npain. My hand began to bleed profusely as we moved the IV\nsite and removed the last of the blood clots. I went next door\nfor several gauzes and to clean and bandage the wound. When I\nreturned he was completely alert and the color was returning\nto his face. With a wry smile he said to me, \"You've got\nanother one, don't you?\"\nI told him I did indeed.\nMost people probably do not know that the heart has its own\npacemaker, which regulates the heartbeat.  This means that\nthe individual has three hearts.  The heart is on the left side\nof the chest. On the right side is the stomach.  The top of the\nheart lies where the navel is, and the bottom of the heart lies\nwhere the sternum would be.\nWithout getting too technical the pulmonary veins take\nblood from the lungs and the capillaries take blood from the\nheart to the arteries.\nAll of the blood from the body is diverted away from these\ntwo areas in order to avoid the heart and lungs. Blood from\nthe lungs is diverted to the inferior vena cava (IVC).  From\nthere, the heart pumps the blood back into the right atrium of\nthe heart.  Then it passes (through the tricuspid valve) into\nthe right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle pumps\nthe blood under high pressure into the largest artery, which is\ncalled the aorta.\nBlood pumped from the aorta returns to the left side of the\nheart through the coronary arteries, where it is oxygenated\n(through the pulmonary veins) and sent to the muscles of the\nbody. Blood returns from the body to the heart through either\nthe superior vena cava or the inferior vena cava, both of which\nlead to the right atrium of the heart. Because of this, the\nbody \"uses\" only the left side of the heart, and the right\nside only pumps blood to the lungs.\nNow, get ready for the heart of this story.\nThe body is designed so that every few pulses from the\npacemaker at the top of the heart send a pulse of electrical\nenergy down the conduction system to the AV node at the bottom\nof the heart, which is the first place where the impulse hits\nthe wall of the heart.  This sets up the electrical impulse that\nleaves the heart and returns through the great arteries, which\nis how blood pressure is created.\nWhat causes the pacemaker's electrical impulses to travel \"up\"\ninstead of \"down?\"  The reason is that there are two major\nveins which return blood from the body to the heart. One is\ncalled the right superior vena cava, and the other is\ncalled the left, or the inferior, vena cava.

For most employers, the initial deadline to furnish 2018 Forms 1095-B and 1095-C (\u201c2018 reporting\u201d) was March 4, 2019, if filing electronically or April 1, 2019, if filing on paper.\nThe IRS extended the Form 1095-B and 1095-C deadlines for filing for those ALEs that can show they can furnish the correct and completeForms 1095-B and 1095-C to their employees on or before the extended filing deadlines. If the IRS receives a Form 12959 , Application for Extension of Time for Good Faith Reporting Relief for the 2018 Returns, ALEs with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees generally can continue to receive an additional 30 days to furnish Forms 1095-B and 1095-C to individuals. For ALEs with fewer than 51 FTE employees but that have been granted an extension and report on paper, IRS has extended the filing deadline for Forms 1095-B, 1094-B, 1095-C, 1094-C and transmittal Form 1096 by an additional 30 days - until August 31, 2019 - to avoid penalties.\nThe good faith reporting relief was extended to July 31 for employers with fewer than 50 FTE employees in 2018.

Is there any way I might find out what's going on?\nI ask my wife about this woman and don't hear back until a few hours later, when she explains that she, too, did not know this woman.  I learn the woman had left town a few months ago.\nIt wasn't very clear what was going on.  Was this woman talking about work or about something she wanted to launch?  I can't be sure which of the stories was the real story.\nMy wife also mentioned that the woman did the right thing, not jumping to the conclusion that she would be hearing some \"great news.\"  She was able to wait and see what turned out to be great news, as my wife and I had also done regarding her.\nI could also see how this situation might have been confused.  Both of these women were thinking about the same time period, which had the same name as the period in which they were living.  It seems to me they should have used different dates.\nSo, we have the situation in which they were talking about the same event, the same period of time, yet were not exactly in sync.  They did, however, share a common belief that the period (2002) might bring some significant change in their lives.  I also feel it is very possible that they were on a par with each other in other areas which are not as evident to us; as a result, they may have been on the same page.\nIf there were to be another woman who felt some kind of kinship with the other woman, or was of a similar nature, and was trying to make contact with her, she might have felt that she might also be getting in touch with the other woman.\n\"Monday, May 26, 2019, 1:51 PM:\nIn the middle of June (which is next month), a significant event was going to occur in which something new appeared for me.  I can see it took place this month (May).\nThis is not a very clear situation here either. What did Sharon think was supposed to happen during the middle of June?  The woman she knows (whose full name I do not have) may have been thinking the same thing.  She may have been expecting a significant event to happen around the same time period, or she may have been anticipating getting some money.\nIn either case, it appears the woman didn't receive that kind of outcome, and had to be aware that another kind of ending was possible.  She appeared to understand that any kind of good thing at this time period wasn't going to happen, but hoped something good may still happen for her.  It doesn't seem that she was hoping for a particular job or career goal to happen, but was hoping something good might appear for her.\nI guess we need to assume in this case that we might have a few discrepancies here in that the woman did have a hope or two around this time period, and that the dreams she had were not as \"clean\" as we might have made them out at the time.  It looks like she did have some thoughts of a positive nature around the time period, and she wasn't expecting the end of the world.  She was hoping, to some extent, for a good outcome to take place, but wasn't assuming it would go any particular way.\nEvidently Sharon had given this young woman no particular insight into how things may have shaped up.  The fact that this young woman had this dream and some hopeful feelings around it indicated that she was on the right track.  On the other hand, the woman hadn't really received any kind of \"good news.\"\nWhen we do the \"Forecast\" at the beginning of the month, we don't know how the month", "Salem Newspapers, which owns The Daily Astorian in Astoria, Or, will launch a paid home delivery test in that market beginning March 1.\nTCPL Announces Paid Test\nof Newspaper Delivery in Astoria, Ore.\nAstoria, Ore.\ufffd Salem Newspapers, Inc.

The\nA", "Newspapers used to be the most trusted institutions in the world. We had the opportunity to deliver our news in a manner that enhanced trust by delivering unbiased, accurate news and a great user experience in addition to high-quality journalism and local content. And now trust is in question. People believe information disseminated from the government and traditional media less than ever. We need to focus on trust-building if we want to be the go-to source for our audiences. How do we do this?\nToo often, trust comes hand in hand with skepticism. In today's information-saturated, oversharing society, it's nearly impossible to find anyone who feels that he is getting the full story from traditional media. To combat this crisis of trust, you must give your readers a reason to trust you by giving them a great user experience, high-quality journalism, and the local news they crave right now in a format that fits their lives.\nThe need to build trust within our audiences today is not simply an editorial challenge. The newsroom that strives to deliver trust to its readers is one that is open with the public and transparent with its audience.\nJournalistic transparency should be an editorial and cultural cornerstone for newspapers today. Newsrooms that seek to build trust by being open and sharing processes, results, sources, and methodology with their readers can be seen as a true community resource with the power to truly connect them to their readers.\nFor the next ten minutes, I want you to think about one word: trust.\nI believe that a critical part of the job of newsroom leaders is to find out what their readers are thinking, what they're scanning, what they're scared of, and take it all in their consideration of what trust and transparency would like like in a modern reader.\nWhat they're thinking about trust and the future of journalism. Trust is on the minds of all of us today. Our audiences' trust in journalism is eroding and it needs to be repaired. We need to reearn their trust. And that process needs to start with the newsroom. We're not going to win the trust of our readers if we don't have their trust. So, we have some serious work to do inside the newsroom. We need to earn back the trust of our readers.\nEven in these challenging times, readers want their local news and we can help deliver that to them by making them part of and giving them a voice in our journalistic process. That is transparency and journalism with soul. We've been entrusted to deliver their news and they have the right to see what goes in the newsroom and how we put the news together. That's why journalists need to understand that we're all in this together.\nWe are in the trust business, and journalists are still the trusted gatekeepers to that information. So if journalists are the gatekeepers, then journalists must actively fight to be trusted. Otherwise, they will be cast out and replaced. We've got to build trust, it's the only way to keep readers coming back to a free, local news source.\nFor local news to survive into the future in a profitable way, we need to continue to build trust with our readers every day. Trust is the currency of news. Everyone, everywhere gets news, but why do some readers stop at scanning the headlines of the day and others read a full news story?\nThe answer is trust. People trust that a story is fair and accurate. News isn't just a product of a journalist's craft, it's also a product of trust. Why do you share the news you share? The answer is trust. If we're open about our process, the results become transparent. What is the process of a story? What were the results?\nThat trust can be lost in a heartbeat and rebuilt in a second, so the newsroom leader needs to have a finger on the pulse of their audience. We must lead our readers to trust us or they will find another source that they do trust. We need to build trust in whatever way it takes to be reinstalled and reestablished in this audience every single day.\nYounger generations grew up on mobile and social media. Newspapers were once the most trusted organizations in the world. Today, new and alternative media, led by social media, are dominating the attention of young people around the globe. This phenomenon inevitably affects young readers' and viewers' trust in the media and their local newspaper in particular.\nNew and alternative media, especially social media and user-generated online content, have contributed to a growing lack of trust", "The Committee recommended approval of a request by RL Systems, Inc., for a new radio station at Alston, Georgia, to commence operation pursuant to Section 73.500(b) of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. The Committee noted that the only comment filed on the application in conjunction with the grant of a Construction Permit (CP) for this station was from WAOK-FM in response to the public notice. The Committee expressed to WAOK the sense that the proposed radio station's coverage area will overlap with that of WAOK's; however, the Committee noted that WAOK stated in its comment that it had broadcasted on an experimental basis in the Alston area. The Committee further noted that no one in the area could recall any prior radio service having served Alston, which in the Committee's judgment suggested that no other radio signal could have served the area previously. The Committee stated that WAOK stated in its comment that it had broadcasted on an experimental basis in the Alston area; however, it further noted that no one in the area could recall any prior radio service having served Alston, which in the Committee's judgment suggested that no other radio service could have served the area previously.

In support of its application, the licensee stated that it intended to operate the proposed station with an effective radiated power of 10,000 Watts. WAOK requested a delay in the filing date of February 1, 1986, to a future date. The Commission approved the delay and the time period set forth in the request. WAOK also requested that a copy of the application for CP-86-062 be sent to it.\nWAOK then commented on the CP application proposing that the construction permit authorize operation of the station with an effective radiated power of 1,000 Watts. WAOK alleged that approval of the request for such an inadequate power level would have a direct effect on WAOK's ability to successfully compete in the Alston area; and that such a decision was beyond the Committee's authority and should be deferred to a full Commission hearing.\nOn April 13, 1987, the Commission granted CP application 86-062 with an effective radiated power of 10,000 Watts.", "The Department of Commerce (the Department)\nannounces the affirmative preliminary determination of\nantidumping duty (AD) investigations on certain corrosion-\nresistant carbon steel flanges from Korea,\nrepublic of (Korea) and Turkey.\nDATES: Because of the preliminary determination, we are\nextending the provisional measures imposed on November 19,\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Hearne or John\nAbrams, AD/CVD Operations, Office I, Enforcement and Compliance,\nIron and Steel Bar from Korea\nOn April 12, 2010, the Department published a notice of\ninitiation of this AD investigation.\\1\\ On June 28, 2010, the\nKorean Federation of Construction Industries (KFCI) filed a\npetition alleging that imports of certain corrosion-resistant\ncarbon steel flanges from Korea are being sold in the United\nStates at less than fair value (LTFV).\\2\\ A complete\ndescription of the events which followed the Department's\ninitiation of this investigation, and which form the basis for\nthis preliminary determination, is set forth in the AD\npreliminary determination memorandum dated September 8, 2010,\nwhich is a public document and is on file during normal business\nhours in the main Commerce Building and at the Office of the\nSecretary, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and\nConstitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20230 (``AC's file\nlocation''), and also may be inspected at the Department's\nInternet address at http://edis.usitc.gov.

What does that mean? How does Russia\u2019s only Russian Financial News Agency do it?\nThe transformation isn\u2019t without difficulties, but it has taken on a life of its own.\nINDUSTRY NEWS: Recommendations from the World Press Trends Report of 2012", "A few years ago, newspapers were losing millions of dollars and some thought this could not go on ad infinitum. Today, newspapers are coming up with more innovative ways -- such as partnerships with radio and TV stations -- to deliver the most compelling content that readers want.\n\"This is my most important job\"\nAs the chief executive officer of the Daily Hampshire Gazette in Amherst, Massachusetts, I am accountable for making sure that we are fulfilling our mission. This means that this job is the most important thing in my life.\nOver three years ago, like many newspapers at that time, we faced a daunting crisis that threatened the viability of our business. In fact, the newspapers were losing millions of dollars per year.\nSome thought this could not be kept up, this could never go on ad infinitum, or ever change.\nIt caused newspapers to react in different ways. Some reacted by shutting down and selling to others, such as our sister company, the Telegram & Gazette in Worcester, which has remained in its community as a newspaper, as well as our sister company, the Valley Breeze in Westfield, which became independent.\nAt the Gazette, we decided against doing what other newspapers did at that time \ufffd close. We instead tried to work out of a new paradigm that recognised the realities of our time. And we did this despite losing hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to the Gazette and Telegram & Gazette in Worcester.\nWe also looked at our competition and asked ourselves what they were doing right?\nThe first thing we looked at was how these companies were putting themselves on the local level in a way that the Amherst daily newspaper used to do.\nThis was most apparent at the Amherst Bee newspaper, which was a free paper -- circulation 15,000 -- printed once a week on newsprint and full of advertising.\nI realised it was a local newspaper with a local editor in one of the most expensive communities in the United States.\nIt was a small, one-person-run operation that did a very good job of delivering a newspaper full of content on one day a week and being profitable doing so even with very little revenues due to the small circulation. It was then that I realised we could do something very similar.\nThe second thing we looked at was how these companies were providing content that no other outlet could.\nThese companies were using the resources that they had and figuring out how to use them to the best advantage. For example, some have built web sites with huge amounts of information which was used to the fullest extent possible.\nAnother example was how radio and television stations used these newspapers to broadcast information that the readers might not have time to read in the paper.\nThirdly, we looked at how other newspapers were making money that our newspaper had not been making and how to make them in our market.\nOverall, it became a question of how we could best use our newsroom staff and the resources we had to put out a paper 24 hours a day all week that would be successful. The first thing was to print a daily newspaper. The second thing was to print seven days a week. The third was to figure out how to make money off the internet.\nWe also looked at how we could keep as many jobs at the Amherst Gazette as possible. In the beginning this meant looking to print partnerships with other printers to meet our needs.\nWe now have five print centres for our paper. But some believe this was risky to print more than the New York Times, which now has over 40 print printers. We believe that we are more innovative than the New York Times, and that having a lot of print partners in our circulation area will better enable us to make sure our readers get the information that they want. Our strategy has also enabled us to keep staff intact.\nOur newest approach is to start another paper with the Telegram & Gazette in Worcester at 255 Franklin Street, and it will begin in November 2004 with a circulation of 20,000. We call it the Home News Tribune. Our focus will be the local community of Franklin County.

The United States argues that the\nplaintiff, Richard E.

These  funds will  be used  for state  government\ndepartments in  areas such as  education, natural  resources and  public safety.\nTHE VLCC PROGRAM\nSENATOR  THOMPSON  introduced  the bill's  sponsor,  David  Toll-\nmann, who gave his presentation.   Mr. Tollmann stated that  the federal govern\nment has decided  that the cost  of operating the  VPRA program has  exceeded\nthe  cost  of  other  government programs.  He  noted  that  the  VLCC  program has\nincreased by 30 percent since  the passage  of SB 21  during  the 1994 session.\nWith  Alaska's oil  tax not  increasing, and  with Alaska  facing the  prospect\nof lower oil  prices in the  future, the federal government  will expect more\nmoney from Alaska.   He added there are  also other pressures on  Alaska, such\nas the VHSR program  where the federal government  will not allow  Alaska to go\noff  the  federal program  without  the federal  government agreeing  to  take\nresponsibility  for the money it  will be spending on  Alaska's behalf.   Also\nin this area,  the federal government  will not allow  Alaska to opt  out  of\nfederal programs  such as VLCC and  VRAP [Vital Pulp  Amendment Program, which\nprovides funds for  a forest management plan for  the Tongass National Forest]\nwithout a significant commitment from the federal government.\nMr. Tollmann stated  that the purpose of the  VLCC program  is to\nkeep the  forest healthy and  productive so that  the Alaska  industry and  the\nfederal government  can access timber  on a continuing  basis.   VLCC funds  are\nalso  used  for maintaining  the  health and  productivity of  national  forest\nsystem  lands by  conducting  hazardous fuels  management [brush  cleanups, a\nmain part of  the VLCC program].   VLCC funds  have also  supported other  AFS\nprograms  like  the  National  Preservation  Area  and  the  Tongass  National\nForest  Plan process.    In  the  State  of  Alaska's  view,  the  current  state\nbudget situation is too bad to allow  the state forestry office to go  to such\na major  reduction in staff.   He referred  to FASFA's [Forest  Assessment  and\nResource  Review]  study  and  stated  that the  average  level of  state  forest\nexpenditures  has  been  about  7 percent,  and  there  has  always  been  some\ndecrease  in  total    expenditures  as   a  natural   cycle  in  forest  work.\nHowever,  in the  past two  years, the  state has seen  more than 20 percent,\nmore   than  25  percent   decrease   in  total   state   expenditures   for   the\nforestry program.\nMEDICARE  REIMBURSEMENTS\nMR. TOLLMANN  referred to the letter  on federal reimbursement  from\nthe Governor's Council on  Medicaid Reform dated March 9, 1994,  and added that\nalthough the federal  government has not been reimbursing  the state for  the\ncost of inpatient hospital care since 1972, the state has still had to  provide\nthe care.  He  stated that to cover  the costs at  hospitals, the  legislature\nhas passed bills that result in  a permanent levy on private non-subsidized\nhospital   receipts.

The result was a project that has taken root into a new generation of recycling.\nWhat if the young people who really get things done had access to the skills they need to find an authentic and rewarding project as a community or globally in a way that had real impact?\nIn 2006, at age 11, Mariela Monterrosa was diagnosed with Crohns disease, a chronic ulcerative inflammation disorder characterized by inflammation of the small intestine.\nHer family learned to cook differently, and while searching through the garbage for the recycling receptacle, the garbage trucks came so often they put those 2 together. She realized how much garbage was being generated that was sent to landfills, and how little was being recycled. In the summer of 2013, 4 years later, after several unsuccessful job interviews, the San Antonio Express News published a story on the trash situation.\nMariela thought \u2013 I wonder how much of their trash is recycled. She did some research and found the answer was zero percent, and recycling would reduce 75 percent of their garbage.\nThe girl in her 385-square-foot room worked 6 hours a day figuring out how much the city was wasting, making a video, and approaching The San Antonio Express News again to get their public information officer to assist in getting her message out to the parents so their kids wouldn\u2019t be throwing in the recycling bin.\nThe Express News agreed to publish the results of her study with the assistance of the city\u2019s public information officer and the mayor. The story ran in 2006. Then Mariela took things into her own hands.\nA little bit of research online led Mari to the company Terracycle, which recycles unusual things like diapers and medicine bottles.\nShe started a website called Terracycle Heroes where people can sign up and start their own campaigns. They can become a \u2018hero\u2019, sign up recycling programs, and earn money (to further a project) in return.\nShe also had a local campaign called TerraCycle in your Backyard. People can sign up, recycle and join a team that collects trash around their neighbourhoods. The trash collected can be turned into the company\u2019s green products.\nMari also got involved with the \u201cDonate for a Dollar\u201d campaign with the goal of cleaning up a 50 square mile area of San Antonio. She raised money through the website Terracycle Heroes.\nShe has also raised money for a 7-acre plot of land along the river called \u201cTreebend Farm\u201d in Austin, which, once purchased will be used to help people with Crohn\u2019s disease like herself. The farm will have areas for people to learn skills such as photography, painting and sculpting along with a community garden.\nWhat\u2019s happening with Mari now?\nShe got a free plane ticket to Los Angeles by being involved with the city\u2019s \u201cRecycle Your Shoes\u201d campaign. She went with a group of San Antonio-based volunteers to California to meet Michael Jackson before they went out and worked for days at a shoe store collecting old tennis shoes and gifting them to kids in Africa.\nShe works on San Antonio\u2019s Sustainable Recycling project which includes recycling everything from office equipment and packaging to construction debris and e-waste to meet Zero Waste goals.\nShe has also gone to DC to meet her Congressional representatives.\nLast year, she spoke at TedX San Antonio to talk about creating a world that values the environment.\nShe is an honor student in 7th grade and her biggest challenge right now is to convince her parents that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t need to go to school.\u201d Her goal is to be in the US Army, then run for Mayor of San Antonio in 25 years.\nMariela has been featured on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d, NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d, CNN, and Discovery and was the 2012 BMW Ultimate Drive winner and a 2014 Walt Disney World Resort \u201cBig Dreamer\u201d award winner at Dreamer\u2019s Gala ceremony.\nWhat Mari has accomplished is remarkable, but more impressive is her drive and determination along with her willingness to learn what she didn\u2019t already know. In doing so, she took initiative, collaborated with adults", "A case study on how the publishers have begun to create native ads through the editorial process.\nEditorial teams are at the center of new-look ads\nBy Caitlin Rantala\nNewspaper advertising is rapidly going digital, but even as online ad revenue soars, many newspapers are still printing billions of paper a year. And native advertising has been one of the top new initiatives in the newspaper industry\u2019s digital reinvention.\nNative advertising is a new-look approach to paid advertising by aligning it with editorial content by its look, feel, and format. Through an increase in video, social media integrations, and new-look visuals and headlines, native ads seamlessly blend into editorial content.\nThe Washington Post has developed an ad product called \u201cLocal Stories.\u201d Through Local Stories, the publisher creates custom newsletter ad products with advertisers to help them better connect with Washington Post readers.\nThe Washington Post has created two advertising products with customized editorial and design elements, as outlined in the publisher\u2019s digital \u201cPlaybook\u201d for clients: \u201cLocal Stories\u201d and \u201cBranded Storycards.\u201d \u201cLocal Stories\u201d are email newsletters with custom ads that mimic the newsletters\u2019 layout and editorial style. \u201cBranded Storycards\u201d are advertorials on WashingtonPost.com that blend the editorial team\u2019s vision with the content advertisers request while adding Washington Post\u2019s design team\u2019s creative flair.\n\u201cWe have about 20 different formats, but for most, the editorial team does a lot of the work,\u201d said Danny Goodwin, managing director of advertising products at The Washington Post.\nThe Washington Post also uses a tool called \u201cCustom Content Studio\u201d as part of its new-look ad creation, said Dan Petty, vice president of advertising products at The Washington Post. The tool is used by The Washington Post to help develop branded content with advertisers.\nTo help create native advertising with editorial teams, \u201cWe make some custom forms, templates, copy, and all sorts of documents that help us communicate with the advertisers in an easy way,\u201d said Petty.\nWith the new tools, The Washington Post\u2019s editorial and ad teams have been able to use the design and look of editorial native ads in print newspaper. Before, The Washington Post would not have been able to take its print ads online and create native ads.\n\u201cOur staff is creating the advertorials as part of their daily jobs,\u201d said Goodwin. \u201cWe have a separate native team in the marketing department, and it was really difficult for them to do their heavy content work. That is why we moved a lot of that over to the editorial team.\u201d\nCreating native ads with editorial teams requires more time and collaboration between different departments. However, the added work has led to more engagement with advertisers in a digital platform.\n\u201cIt is a real evolution for us. I think it is more natural to the staff,\u201d said Petty. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are doing more journalism work for our advertisers.\u201d\nBut the team believes the hard work of building a digital publishing capability ultimately pays dividends for the publisher.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to work with third-party contractors. We have built up the ability and the capability to do this work on an ongoing basis within our organization to make it more efficient,\u201d said Petty.\nThe Washington Post has seen an 8 percent increase in sponsorship and a 40 percent increase in sponsorships since using editorial teams to create the new-look native ads. The publisher has also seen a 31 percent increase in engagement rates, according to the \u201cPlaybook.\u201d The tool\u2019s goal is to provide a consistent way for The Washington Post\u2019s editorial team and the marketing team to communicate with advertisers during the native ad creation process.\n\u201cWe want to ensure we have the same level of communication with our advertisers as we do for editorial content across platforms,\u201d said Petty.\nFor now, the Washington Post\u2019s focus is integrating new-look ads into its print publications, but it is also taking its approach and incorporating it into digital advertising.\n\u201cWe are also building custom digital native ads and creating those as part of that product,\u201d said Goodwin.\nPREV OMG launches \u2018digital first\u2019 for The Times NEXT BuzzFeed, MediaLab, and the FT: Publishers find ways to build better, faster, more personalized products", "The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) in Fort Campbell, Kentucky had three media companies providing news for 28 military sites, but with the advent of new technology that number is growing.\nNews distribution for a military base\nThe Army, Air Force, and Navy have large newspaper operations for their respective troops, and the Postal Service carries information throughout the country. The Army, Air Force, and Navy\u2019s newspapers are known as Stars & Stripes, USA Today and the Air Force Times. The most interesting development came when Stars & Stripes took the entire newspaper online, a print-only audience is no longer possible in today\u2019s environment. The Postal Service has established a partnership in the past with the newspaper company, and now many bases have media outlets available for the Internet.\nIt\u2019s a new era for media companies on military bases, and that\u2019s where the competition begins and where you can find the most interesting news stories and the more unbiased information.\nUSA Today is the largest news provider for the US Army. Most media people at these bases do not understand the logistics of operating a large newspaper and they can only cover their post or military city. On paper, the Army, Air Force Times, and other news providers give a general news overview because they cover the entire post or city, and USA Today will report the stories from Fort Campbell that have national interest or a story that appeals to a national audience. USA Today has about 40 to 50 military bases that they cover, and the military is one of their largest markets.\nIt\u2019s a common practice for the press to release news for the entire Army post regardless of size or location. The Army also operates its own print, television, and radio station, but 80 percent of the information that\u2019s reported on the radio or in print can be found in Stars & Stripes\u2019 online news site.\nThe paper is about 12 pages long, but it can take as much as eight hours to print and deliver the paper to all the military sites on Fort Campbell. In the past, the newspaper came out on Thursday, but about three years ago, they decided that they didn\u2019t want to have the competition in their backyard so they started their printing operations on Wednesdays.\nThis has caused an enormous amount of traffic and a very large distribution network. The media company has a list of people who pick up the paper each day at the various posts across the Fort, as well as off base. Each morning there is a designated hour that the paper is distributed and that\u2019s usually between 5 and 6 in the morning, the paper is distributed the same way every day.\nIt\u2019s a very interesting situation and some of the journalists really have a strong attachment to their readers. Because they don\u2019t have the competition in their own backyard, they have a lot of freedom and many feel that if they can\u2019t be a writer in Manhattan, they can work at Fort Campbell in Kentucky which has its own benefits too.\nThe 101st Airborne Division is in the process of transitioning to a 24 hour news operation, and this is an exciting development for those in the media industry in the military.\nPREV News Media Company, The Next Company Up NEXT", "Newspaper publishers must be committed to innovation. Innovation, with or without the help of Silicon Valley, can remake a newspaper.\nIt\u2019s about the people. It\u2019s about embarking on a\nnew journey.\nWe see some of the world\u2019s best journalists, many of them award winners, reporting on the front lines, delivering\ninvestigative journalism.\nAnd we talk about the future. A lot. Because we have to. Because there is no other way.\nInnovation. Innovation is what keeps a company relevant.\nNewspaper publishers must be committed to innovation\u2014innovation, with or without the help of Silicon Valley, can remake a newspaper.\nWe all know that the best way to learn about something is to experience it. So over the past few weeks I have been visiting newspapers and newsrooms all over the world. A recent trip took me through Europe\nand to the Middle East; later this week, it\u2019s on to Russia and Pakistan. And it\u2019s these trips that truly keep me enthusiastic and hungry for more, just like I was as a journalist.\nVisiting newspapers is always a bit of a time warp. You walk into a newsroom or newsroom, and all of the sudden, it feels like it is 1985 again. That\u2019s when most of\nthe infrastructure you see in the newsroom of today was first being introduced\u2014that\u2019s also when 80 percent of newspaper readers had never visited a website.\nInnovation is a topic I talk about all the time, which is why it\u2019s so difficult to explain why we\u2019re investing so much in it today.\nI see innovation as what keeps a company relevant.\nRelevance leads to impact.\nTo get a feeling for this topic in a new way, let\u2019s start with the basics. Every industry goes through several stages to evolve and to stay relevant.\nThe initial stage starts with something simple, such as the printing press, and it takes several hundred years to evolve to what we now call the \u201cInternet.\u201d\nInnovation is critical to making this transition.\nNewspapers that ignore this stage and try to stay relevant in the second stage of evolution tend to suffer long-term irrelevance.\nIn stage one, there is an industry (the printing press). Then\nthere is an innovation (newspapers) that evolves the\nindustry to reach the next stage of evolution, whereby the innovations become common (Internet).\nIn many ways, it\u2019s like the evolution of the automobile, when the main innovation evolved. In stage two, cars began to make sense. Today, when you stand on a street corner and see a million parked cars, you don\u2019t wonder how you\u2019re going to get to California in the morning. You get into the car.\nFor publishers, it used to be simple: we would print the paper and distribute it.\nThen the mobile Internet happened.\nIn the early days, you had to figure out how to be available to your reader\non a mobile device. This led to some experimentation, like a mobile version of a website\u2014kind of. The Internet was becoming more relevant in the world, and that meant publishers couldn\u2019t ignore it.\nFor publishers, it used to be simple: we would print the paper and distribute it. Then the mobile Internet happened. After that, what happened next really started to shake things up. As the saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the people.\u201d\nIt\u2019s about embarking on a new journey and sharing that journey with your readers, one they can be a part of.\nToday, an important part of the innovation stage revolves around people. Not the paper. The people. Today we know that the best way to connect with our readers is through the mobile Internet and that it involves people engaging with people\u2014and people with people.\nSo, the next evolution of the newspaper, for example, involves connecting with smartphone users.\nAt USA TODAY, we put an emphasis on innovation, and this has been central to our success and growth in both readership and advertising in a rapidly shrinking newspaper industry. For us, it starts again and again and again, with new ways to reach and connect to readers. We are constantly innovating, experimenting and looking for new ways to do things. Because we know\nthat, if we look around, nobody else is doing it and if we stand still, we\u2019ll find ourselves behind.\nThe key is to never stand still.\nAs a journalist and editor myself, I love to be around people all the time. And in journalism we are always around\npeople\u2014our", "A small company can make a big difference, particularly by using sustainable business practices.\nThis is the most important question that we receive, so let's be clear about the definition of \"sustainable.\" The Oxford English Dictionary defines it succinctly: \"Proven to be self-sustaining.\" We like self-sustaining because it means that nothing has to be \"done\" to the company. The company will sustain itself for a long time with proper maintenance and no major changes. That is also the reason why some people call this the \"indefinite growth\" model.\nThere is a lot of confusion about the definition used here, so please do not ask us: \"What is the purpose of my business? To make money or make a difference?\" The difference between these two purposes is \"making money.\" Making money is easy (\"do it, close it, repeat\"). Making a difference takes a little more time and effort but is worth it, because money is a byproduct of making a difference, never the other way around.\nMany people would like to believe that making money is an important purpose, but it is not, so, the \"purpose of making money\" becomes what's the difference we want to make! I suggest that the difference we want to make is: To provide a way for people to work together to do what they want to do and become who they want to be. (And this is, of course, a direct result of the purpose, which is to make a difference). A small company can make a big difference but it will take a while for it to make a sustainable difference because business is, well, business, so all that will follow is, \"business as usual.\"\nTo make a difference, the company needs to grow, but not in the usual sense that many people use the word \"grow.\" Grow means get big, but that is not what sustainable means, so, the company needs to grow as long as it stays as small as it gets, which is not too small! Once a company grows beyond that point, it is in a different category, because it then comes under a whole new set of rules and regulations, and this will be dealt with on a later page. A small company can make a difference by using one of the three models (all described on this website) and/or one of the three methods (all described on other websites).\nIf any of the readers want to make a difference while still maintaining a small company/small business, then one of the three ways may suit their needs. If sustainably-operating is important to you, I suggest you take a look at this website then ask a simple question: \"What do I want to get out of my business?\"\nThe only people who will benefit if your business fails are the people you borrowed money from. If you choose the other two options of \"making a profit\" or \"making a difference\" you have to make sure that you are getting the service you want from your business for the cost that you want. If you don't get the service that you expect from doing the work that you desire, the business will fail.\nLet's say you borrow money from a bank. If the business fails, then the bank will lose. And once the bank loses, it will become a non-profit organization and be unable to do business anymore. The only way that the bank will get this money back is to repossess your house. If a bank were to repossess your house, it would sell it at a public auction to the highest bidder. Do you really think your neighbour is going to spend $173,000.00 more than the bank is going to let it go for? (And this calculation is based upon a 2.5 percent bank mortgage for 25 years so that 30 years after the start of the mortgage, the house has 20 percent left before reaching the principal of $185,000.00). Even if there was $173,000.00 cash available for the purchase, do you really think someone with that much cash will put up $173,000.00 for the remainder of twenty-five years when a bank mortgage for twenty-five years on the same amount is only $140,000.00. What this means is that after the 25 years are up, you own a house worth $140,000.00 and, of course, since houses go down in value over the years, you probably have to sell right away for $110,000.00. And after that, you have to get a job to pay back the mortgage if your business did not become", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing\na forthcoming public meeting to discuss the potential for\ninclusive packaging options that will have the potential to\nsubstantially reduce tobacco-related disease and death and to\ncreate a substantial public health benefit.

The FDIC's current regulation at 12 CFR 701.417 (Operations of an industrial credit union in the 50 states and District of Columbia) applies to insured state and multistate nonmember and federal credit unions with a common bond as set forth by the Act and regulations in 12 CFR 701.401 (Incorporation of Act, Regulations, and NCUA-issued Rules by Reference).\nNCUA published its version of the most recent model regulation, including the appendices, at 71 FR 1330 (1/6/2006), and incorporated the NASCUS Model at 73 FR 21592 (4/14/2008). The FFIEC adopted the NASCUS Model at 73 FR 9725 (3/5/2008).1 The revisions to the NASCUS Model reflect a number of recent trends and changes in the credit union industry, as well as recent financial market and related conditions. The FDIC-issued version of the Model includes the new rules approved by NASCUS and is substantively identical to the FFIEC-issued version.\nFederal credit unions that are state or federal credit unions under the Act may continue to comply with the old rule at 12 CFR 730.420 as amended, effective September 4, 2002, until January 1, 2010, when the new FDIC-issued rule becomes effective.

The number of staff would be determined by a different state regulation. The facility would be built to provide the facility for residents with dementia. Chief Haddad reported that the community would be a 55 & older community. The residents would move into the facility when a person\u2019s needs would change. Chief Haddad stated that 1/3 of the residents would be from outside the community.\nChief Haddad reported that the application includes a list of the people that the applicant had met with the community to be able to submit their project application to the Board. The applicant met with a representative from 18 community groups. When meeting with groups, they presented their project and then took a list of questions from the community.\nChief Haddad stated the applicant had requested a review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Commissioners Flynn and Mersfelder stated that they reviewed the project and their recommendation was 3 to 2 in favor. Commissioner Mersfelder stated that the Planning and Zoning Commission wanted a public meeting to be held to allow the public and board to be able to express their concerns.\nChief Haddad reported the applicant was open to meeting with the community group to see if they could provide input with what they would like to see or not see.\nChief Haddad reported that Lake Boreal Land Company was the applicant. Chief Haddad reported the applicant had held open houses with the community and asked residents what they liked about proposed project.

The resident asked if there is a requirement that there be 30 parking spaces.\nd. Lighting. \u2013 The resident stated that currently she had security lights and when she pulls into her driveway, there is security lighting in her front yard. The security lighting went off when darkness came. This meant that once I park near the house, there is no security lighting for the exterior of my house.\nJoe Smith addressed the Board and stated he lived north of the property under consideration but was active in the community.

Here are some tips on how to get closer to your target audience.\nEditor-in-Chief of CMJ New Music Monthly and CMJ.com\nWhen I was a new editor of CMJ New Music Monthly, it was 1995. We had a print run of 1.1 million at a time when the magazine wasn\u2019t particularly profitable.\nAs we looked around for ads to supplement the revenue from our subscription base and from record stores that carried our publication, we decided to go after those who were not yet readers. It\u2019s not as though we didn\u2019t know who our current customers were: Record stores, and particularly those who carried our publication, were at the top of the list. So, for example, if we saw a story worth mentioning or a person worth interviewing, we would often try and figure out a way to get them to stop by a store to hand out a copy and perhaps sell it to someone.\nHowever, we also decided to reach out to readers who may have been at a record store just an hour ago and had our publication, but for whom this issue was their first exposure to the print publication.\nThis created a big, seemingly unfair advantage for all of us involved.\nBut it wasn\u2019t unfair. Instead, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s simply a matter of focus.\nSo, the key word here is focus.\nI\u2019m reminded of these early days at a moment in modern history when it\u2019s nearly impossible to do anything without distractions. I\u2019m not saying distractions should be eliminated from our lives, but we should take a closer look at how those distractions might be affecting our concentration, productivity and communication abilities.\nWhenever I\u2019m trying to connect with someone \u2014 whether in print, online or in person \u2014 I want to come across as a focused human being. So, to me, it\u2019s a matter of discipline. I don\u2019t have time to wander. As long as I try to make progress, then I can keep myself focused.\nSo what are the distractions in your life? Mine are all-too-often my phone and my laptop: two gadgets that can create the illusion that you\u2019re connected to something or someone at all times.\nIt takes discipline to put up walls and tell yourself \u201cNo\u201d to the urge to check your phone while walking around a park or taking a bathroom break. And it takes discipline to know when to shut your laptop and not check just one more email because there were no new emails in the inbox.\nIt takes practice to not get wrapped up in the noise of everyday life. It\u2019s tough to be the focus point for someone who wants to draw us away from the task at hand.\nI\u2019ve had to make this mental exercise for decades, even before smartphones changed the definition of distraction. But, as technology continues to evolve, we\u2019ve learned to be a part of the noise and chaos.\nHowever, these new technologies also have their advantages. They teach us how to focus better by putting us in contact with thousands of people and allowing us to take part in hundreds of conversations in a single day.\nSo even if we choose not to be a part of the noise or look forward to the moment when we can escape from the distractions, the reality is that we can\u2019t help but participate.\nPerhaps these distractions are also a blessing. Perhaps they help us hone our skills of concentration to a point where we can choose when we want to be distracted and to whom and when we want to be focused, in a way that wasn\u2019t possible just a few years ago.\nThese days, if you want to be focused on something, the person needs to be able to hear your message loud and clear by actually being on a listserv. Or reading an article. Or seeing an ad by searching on a topic. If you want to be focused, you can\u2019t just show up, because, if you do, the person will hear you speak first before they actually hear what you have to say with clarity. So, for better or worse, we need to listen for ourselves a lot of the time so that we don\u2019t have to be listening.\nAnd who knows? The noise may fade and people start to realize that, even if you have been talking to someone on a channel or listserv or in person, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they heard what you said or that you understood it. But, if we\u2019re smart, we can figure out who really deserves a piece of our attention.\nPREV WPP Re", "The Commission considered two notices of apparatus\nperformance at its August 6, 1999, meeting.

The\napplicant calculated the FAA maximum value for that elevation\nangle was 60 db.\nBased on these calculations, the applicant determined that\nadditional co-channel protections would be required to protect the\nAM station if 100% of the ERP was used in nighttime service (01-\n30 minutes after sunset to 0530 hours).  In addition, the\napplicant noted that it was the responsibility of the\napplicant-licensee to provide co-channel protection according to\nthe Commission's co-channel rules.\nThe applicant stated that for 75,500 hours of the year, or\n7,855,600 minutes, the translator with 10 kW non-directional\noperation would exceed the 60 db maximum ERP value at the FAA's\ncalculated minimum allowable antenna height; however, the\ntranslator would be operating within the 50 dBm ERP FAA height\nconstraints on 620 nights per year.  The translator would be\noff the air for a minimum of 3,626 hours of the year on a total of\n34 non-consecutive days and therefore does not fall under the\napplication of Sections  73.71(d) or 73.75 to increase the 250\nwatt average ERP above 50 dbm to avoid potential inaudibility of\nthe AM station during nighttime operation.\nThe translator serves the City of San Francisco, California,\nwith service area being San Francisco from the Golden Gate bridge\nto the airport on one side and San Francisco from the airport to\nEmbarcadero and the financial district on the other side.\nThe commission has recently amended 73.3525 to reduce the\naverage station ERP to 50 watts to protect co-channel AM stations.\nThe applicant also included a copy of its co-channel study as\nannexed to the filing.  The co-channel analysis is from the\nNicholas and Vashakil and Associates study completed in 1995.  In\nits co-channel study, the applicant used the 620 nights as the\nyearly value and included the 1,983 hours of power below the 50\nwatt average ERP as the nighttime power.

THC is the chemical that gets you \u201chigh\u201d where CBD is the opposite and does not cause the \u201chigh\u201d sensation associated with THC use.\nAs medical cannabis gains popularity as a safe and effective medicine, scientific research has found a wide range of medicinal benefits that support the idea that cannabinoids have the potential to treat an impressive array of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, glaucoma, seizures and spinal cord damage.\nA 2014 review of twenty years of clinical research in the United States found that cannabis is useful in the treatment of \u201ca wide range of diseases including cancer, AIDS, epilepsy, Glaucoma, inflammatory diseases and others.\u201d\nThe researchers found \u201cconvincing evidence that cannabis is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis, and for improving the symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\"\nThe review also found that marijuana's major active compound, THC, is antitumorigenic. This means that THC prevents the growth of cancer cells and does not cause damage to healthy cells.\nAccording to Dr. Sanja Su\u0161ac, author of the study, \u201cBased on this evidence, we recommend that marijuana be legalized and available for medical purposes on prescription.\u201d\nSusac continues to state that \u201cthe most important benefit of cannabis is that it is much safer than other substances now in use to treat pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. However, further studies are needed to confirm or refute many of the reports on the benefits of cannabinoid treatment.\"\nScientists at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute and Scripps Research Institute have discovered that cannabinoids protect nerve cells from damage that can lead to the symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\nResearchers identified the endocannabinoid system as a neuroprotective system whereby cannabinoid receptors may help to guard brain cells from damage caused by trauma in a variety of diseases.\nThe study examines how the cannabinoid receptor CB1 plays a role in neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis. The research also found that blocking CB1 receptors eliminated neuroprotection, suggesting a role for cannabinoid receptors in brain chemistry that could help prevent neurological damage.\nAccording to Dr. Mark Kotzsch, Chief of Vascular Medicine at the University of California San Francisco, cannabis is a \u201cfirst-line drug\u201d for stroke and vascular dementia patients.\nA study done by Kotzsch and published in Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association found that marijuana is 100 times more effective at preventing stroke and reversing brain damage than aspirin is.\nMarijuana is so protective of patients\u2019 brains from a stroke, that Kotzsch and his colleagues \u201care using this drug routinely.\u201d\nDr. Aseem Malhotra was also interviewed on the topic. Malhotra said that \u201ctoo many Americans are suffering from the high blood pressure crisis, which is a leading cause of heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. I don\u2019t think the evidence in support of the use of whole-food, plant-based diets for patients with hypertension is compelling. But when it comes to cannabis, the evidence is overwhelming.\u201d\nIt is estimated that the cost to the United States for prescription medicine usage is $725 billion each year. Cannabis on the other hand is cheap and accessible and does not have the negative side effects commonly associated with prescription chemicals.\nMarijuana has been used by people around the world to treat ailments and medical conditions since the beginning of humanity. Its therapeutic properties are still widely utilized in the medical world, and scientific findings have proved its effectiveness in treating a multitude of diseases and conditions.\nThe United States has remained behind with", "Forget about the numbers in your traffic report. What metrics really matter to your bottom line is the time visitors spend on your site, the average number of pages they visit, and, most importantly, how many of them actually take action on your content such as making purchases, signing up for your newsletter, downloading your ebook, etc.\nIn 1931, the English economist John Maynard Keynes presented his landmark book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The book challenged the prevailing wisdom of its day, i.e. that the \"classical\" view of recession (when demand drops off) had to be right and that the best idea was that economists were helpless to counter the cyclicality.\nKeynes's idea was that government can actually influence economic development and, to make it do so, you have to change the way people behave\u2014for example, you have to change how people spend so as to stimulate the economy.\nKeynes gave three reasons why it was possible and necessary to do this. The most relevant to our topic, today, is the third reason. Because people were unwilling to spend, for example, because they did not believe that there was a significant possibility of an inflation, they could be induced to participate in the economy by the government.\nIt is a common perception that economists have a tendency to think in ways that make them feel comfortable and to try hard to make the conclusions fit these ways of thinking. The idea that I want to take up here is just the opposite\u2014that you need to challenge your preconceived notions and find the truth, regardless of how \"uncomfortable\" it is.\nThis kind of thinking is actually very hard (the reason we are all humans) and it's why we like comfort; it makes us feel more \"at home\" when we know what we are talking about. But in order to challenge the established truth and find the truth, you have to think from a neutral point of view. Think just like you start a brand-new business.\nIt's not about what \"economists say,\" but what reality tells you.

The way Google determines if content is good is determined by many factors, but one of the most important is keywords\u2014i.e. the amount of keywords the searcher enters.\nEven today, most people think that if someone enters your keywords, you should be on the first page (where most users look). But Google knows that even if it's an unqualified term, people will enter anything to find what they are looking for.\nFor example, I've seen the keyword for this article written as \"how-to-earn-money-by-having-a-blog\" and as \"howe-earn-money-by-blogging\" with the keywords \"money\" and \"blog\" written with upper case letters! This also goes for how pages with keywords in URLs are ranked on Google.\nBoth keywords are entered into Google many times a day.

They do not make promises they cannot live up to; they do not make statements in the future tense. A tribal leader is someone who knows what to do with the information he or she has.\u201d1 Social media is helping companies build stronger relationships with their customers\u2014they are connecting with them on a more human level.\nWhen it comes to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, a big challenge for them is the perception of being all about profits. This is not surprising given the industry\u2019s legal requirements and the need to make sure companies are doing everything in their power to make life better for people. Therefore, it is very difficult in the pharmaceutical industry to build a brand around a connection with the customer and making customers happier.\nGlaxoSmithKline is one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies. They recently created a campaign on Twitter called \u201cHow Would You Feel?\u201d (Figures 1-3). They invited people to tweet in their thoughts and feelings regarding side-effects and the daily lives of people afflicted with medical conditions including cancer, diabetes, and COPD.\nFig 1. How Would You Feel? 2011\nFig 2. How Would You Feel? 2011 Part 2\nFigure 3. How Would You Feel? Video\nThe campaign was extremely effective in building a strong connection with their customers. Tweeters shared intimate details regarding their medical conditions and provided emotional support to others going through the same challenges. Many times, people with similar conditions are able to connect to one another through online forums, but many people are still unaware of this option. The campaign also made many people feel better\u2014as they were connected with people who really cared. It also helped people feel more prepared and informed about how to approach their doctors and other health professionals.\nGlaxoSmithKline set up a special Twitter account for this campaign and began engaging Twitter users based on the tweets they received. As the campaign progressed, the hashtag #GSKfeel became a huge trending topic during the campaign\u2019s first week, making it the biggest campaign on Twitter for that week.2 As a result, GSK received an impressive 50,000 mentions on Twitter, as well as a 7 percent lift in brand-awareness, 13 percent lift in trust, and 8 percent lift in quality.\nWhat was the most interesting was GSK\u2019s response to tweeters. People shared some heartbreaking stories of losing loved ones due to cancer, as well as their experiences of having to care for people with cancer. GSK responded by sending them links to useful websites for cancer patients. These people went through terrible experiences: their loved ones dying, themselves being sick, and having to cope with the knowledge that they were soon going to end up in the same position. However, people\u2019s words of encouragement did help them feel they would not be alone through it and that they were strong enough to deal with the situation.\nIn the marketing world, this campaign has become a very popular lesson for all students to learn, and many of them cite it as a great example of campaign success. Twitter is quickly becoming one of the most powerful ways to interact and connect with your customers. Not only can companies get immediate, real customer feedback, but they can also help to create and strengthen customer bonds.\n1 Logan, David, and John King.

She can be reached at chines@", "As a result of a systematic data review the risk for the transmission of anaphylactic and other allergenic diseases is estimated as a minimum of 0.1% to the population per year.\nDuring the past decade there was an extensive public debate about the potential risks of transmission of allergic diseases due to cross-reactivity.\nThe objective of the present study is to analyze the prevalence of food-dependent Ig E-mediated anaphylactic reactions as well as other food-associated Ig E-mediated allergic conditions. The results of this systematic literature review demonstrate that the prevalence rates in different populations fall into a 0.1% to 4.7% range.\nHowever, a very high prevalence of 38% could be observed in a study from Switzerland with a population consisting of only children and in vitro studies and/or animal experiments. The present review has determined for the first time, that all of these conditions are most likely a result of the immunological processes of food allergy, but the transmission of symptoms is a result of genetic or epigenetic factors or the environmental factors involved in disease.\nBeyond the systematic review of the published literature, it should be noted that there is a lack of epidemiological population studies using standardized protocols, methodology, and control groups with regards to food allergy and anaphylaxis.\nTherapy-related publications, which were collected using the Medline and Cochrane Library databases, were reviewed. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied:\n1) The publication does include the term \u201canaphylaxis\u201d and a \u201cfood\u201d\n2) The publication describes a study with a minimum of 50 reported cases\n3) The publication does not describe a therapy related to food allergy\n4) The publication contains a description of the sampling design including control groups and sample sizes\n5) The publication was in either in English, German, French or Italian\n6) The publication was published in the last 10 years\n7) The publication was published before 1998, if the study has been repeated subsequently or if the results of the study have been published again.\nThe search resulted in 3164 articles. After removing articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria and the 241 that were duplicates, only 2923 articles remained. Of the 2923 articles, 599 met the criteria of the search and were included in the study. All of the reviewed articles had been conducted in the last 10 years. 483 articles were repeated studies, 61 articles were clinical studies, 35 articles were in vitro studies, and 43 articles were epidemiological studies.\nIn total, 185 articles were epidemiological and eco-historic studies, of which 152 were epidemiological and 33 were eco-historic studies. All of the studies were categorized according to the age groups of children and adults, infants, and in vitro studies, animal experiments and in vivo experiments. In total, 145 articles described epidemiological data; 36 described infants; 24 described animal experiments, in vivo experiments; 16 described epidemiological data for adults; 12 described animal experiments, in vivo experiments; 7 described infants and epidemiological data; 6 described experimental animal data; 5 described epidemiological data for adults and experimental animal data; 4 described epidemiological data for adults and epidemiological data for infants; 3 described epidemiological data for adults and infants; 1 described epidemiological data for infants and experimental animal data; 1 described epidemiological data for infants and in vitro studies; 1 described epidemiological data for infants and in vivo studies; 1 described epidemiological data for adults and in vivo studies; 1 described epidemiological data for adults and in vitro studies and 1 described epidemiological data for children and infants. Most of the studies on the transmission rates of allergic diseases were carried out in Germany, the United States, and France.\nTo assess the risks resulting from the consumption of foods that represent potential causes of an allergic disease for the general population, a systematic literature search was performed using the search terms \u201cfood\u201d, \u201callergy\u201d, \u201canaphylaxis\u201d, \u201ehypersensitive\u201d, \u201eadverse reactions\u201d, \u201echildren\u201d, \u201eadult\u201d, \u201einfant\u201d, \u201ein vitro\u201d, \u201e", "Pain management needs to include a full range of\ntreatment options, including medical and non-medical, but its\neffectiveness remains elusive, and the optimal treatment\nregimen has not been identified.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Pain management programmes must:\n\u2022 Be comprehensive and multidimensional.\n\u2022 Include education.\n\u2022 Encourage active participation by patients.\n\u2022 Provide strong support, especially in the early stages of\n\u2022 Manage the treatment and outcomes of individual patients.\nPREVALENCE OF PAIN: Acute pain is an experience common to\nhumans, and, therefore, the preva\u00adla\u00adence of pain is generally\nassumed to be equally common. Despite the widespread suffering\nthat pain causes, accurate pain prevalence estimates are\ndifficult to extract from existing datasets, especially for\nnon-medicated pain. As a result, it is not possible to estimate\nthe proportion of the population in which pain is present. It\nis clear, however, that 86-90% of adults in North America suffer\nfrom at least one pain episode prior to age 65. For example, in\none survey, 76% of men and 65% of non-pregnant women in the\nUnited States reported a backache during the previous 3-month\nperiod1 . Non-medicated studies report pain prevalence\nrates in the 80-90% range, whereas pre-trial clinical experience\nwith an effective opioid pain relief medication (i.e. a non-\nmigraine headache) is likely to be around 60%, thus lower\nthan reported by non-medicated studies (i.e. 80-90%).2\nPREDICTORS OF PAIN IN CORE PATIENTS: Core pain patients\n(i.e. those with a persistent pain of sufficient quality and\nintensity to interfere substantially in their daily functioning)\nrepresent a population for whom adequate pain management is\nparticularly important, since it has the potential to:\n\u2022 Reduce the pain experienced.\n\u2022 Increase functioning (both physical and social).\n\u2022 Minimize the impact of the pain on quality of life.\nPATIENT BURDEN AND QUALITY OF LIFE: The impact of pain\non the quality of life of core patients can be substantial.\nThough these patients generally do not have a fatal illness,\nthey still have pain, and in studies, quality of life scores were\ncomparable in patients with no known disease as in those\nin whom the cause of the pain had been clearly identified.3\nWithout adequate pain relief, quality of life is poor, and\npatients with chronic pain report, for many, a reduction in\ngeneral health and a subsequent increase in the total number\nof medical problems.4 Pain may limit activities on a casual\nto a moderate basis (for example, gardening or walking) or\non a more intense basis (for example, exercise), and can\nlimit participation in the workforce.5 With regard to social\nfunctioning, it has been reported to cause loneliness and to\ninfluence other aspects of social life (e.g. attendance at family\nevents and religious services).6\nPERSONAL AND PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF PAIN:\nPersistent pain has a significant negative psychological\neffect on patients, with reduced feelings of self confidence,\nhappiness and optimism, and feelings of isolation and anger.\nPain is also strongly linked to depression and anxiety7 . This\neffect is particularly marked in patients for whom the pain\nis chronic and who are dependent on treatment. In addition,\npsychological distress may lead to changes in the experience\nof pain (e.g. to unremitting pain) or may result in an\nincrease in pain (e.g. in depressed patients8 ).\nPhysically, pain has been demonstrated to:\n\u2022 Increase fatigue9 .\n\u2022 Diminish the ability to perform at work10 or to\nparticipate in family life11 .\n\u2022 Influence activities of daily life12 .\n\u2022 Impair sleep13 .\n\u2022 Increase muscle tension14 .\n\u2022 Cause muscle pain15 .\n\u2022 Increase pain perception when it occurs16 .\n\u2022 Increase vulnerability to further pain17 .\n\u2022 Affect appetite18 .\n\u2022 Restrict oral intake19 .\nPA", "A great newspaper is like a well-made musical.

He says that while it seems that media revenue is a \"zero sum game\" (i.e., that one publisher benefits at the expense of another) there really should be an \"arbitrary amount\" of revenue to go around if only it was shared, but this is challenging in a \"competitive\" market.\nAs he suggests, a major challenge here is that traditional media publishers are operating in a \"very competitive market\"; they also face economic pressure, advertising pressure, and a \"whole array\" of pressures on their business models as they shift towards digital media services. They're also faced with new types of advertising challenges, and new types of competition from the likes of Google and Twitter, who are taking advantage of this \"new consumer behaviour\".\nHorne is the CEO of Newsplex, which provides a range of digital media publishing services to news publishers; he also serves as a non-executive director of Media.Au, the online media advertising co-operative.\nRe-Inventing Digital Media, Peter Horne, 5 November 2013, Australian 24/7 Conference on Social Publishing Strategies, Sydney\nPREV Eye on the Market: Tips for news publishers to increase their social media revenues NEXT Why Facebook's graphic content policy has raised the stakes for publishers", "The proposed license was first issued by the Atomic Energy Commission in October, 1950, and\nwas amended at ten different times thereafter. This license was extended until August 31, 1970, at which\ntime it was replaced by a new license which would expire October 31, 1977.   The proposed license was\namended three times after the new license was issued and was ultimately extended to August 31,\n1987.   The original licenses, all of which have been amended, have been set aside, and since all of the\noriginal licenses expired in October 1979, all of the original licenses, as well as the extended license, are\nin abeyance because of the suspension of revenue obligation issued in connection with the construction\nof the nuclear-power station.   The Board's petition to the Supreme Court for re-argument was denied.\nThe finality of the board's decision was appealed in September, 1973, to the Administrative Review\nSection of this Court.\nREVIEW: The Supreme Court, in its opinion and order, found that the Board's award did not amount to an\nadmission that the petitioner was entitled to indemnification, but was an attempt to fashion relief by way\nof an equitable remedy.   The petitioner was not entitled as of right to the relief awarded.   The remedy\nwas not designed to compensate the licensee for its expenditures but was an attempt by the Board to\nobtain the relief needed to enforce the original license.\nThe petitioner relies on two contentions: first, that the Board was without discretion to extend\nthe original license and, second, that the amended license constituted an admission by the Board that\nthe petitioner was entitled to recover costs and expenses incurred under the original license.   As to\nthe first contention, it is only necessary to point out that the board's final decisions are final in the sense\nthat they cannot be amended or set aside in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or abuse of discretion, and\nthat the court cannot go behind the board's actions except as hereinafter stated.   The decision of the\nBoard is res judicata as to the facts, since by its own terms it confessed judgment is based on the\nPetitioner contends that the extension of the original license was tantamount to a declaration by the\nBoard that the petitioner was entitled to recover its costs and expenditures incurred in reliance on the\noriginal license.   It points out that section 2107(b), Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 692a(b)), provides\nthat the cost of construction is deemed to be a final obligation of the Government and may be recovered\ndirectly from the United States or from proceeds of revenue bonds issued to finance the construction.\nThe court held that section 2107(b) cannot be given such a broad sweep that it would permit recovery\nwhen the Government is in breach of a contract, or where there has been any failure or misdeed by the\nGovernment.  The language of the statute requires that the final obligation be deemed to be a cost of\nconstruction.   The decision of the Board in this case did not in any direct manner imply such an\nobligation.   If the petitioner intended to be a party to the contract, the petitioner was bound by it.\nThere was no failure, omission or misdeed by the Government.   It was the petitioner acting under the\nextensive powers and powers at will conferred on it that made the decisions in question.   There was\nmerely an attempt by the Board to obtain judicial relief in the interests of equity.\nHeld:   The decision of the Board and the amended license were not an admission or a direct\nconfirmation of liability because the petitioner was not a party to any contract, express or implied.\nSuch decisions as set forth by the court merely reflect a determination that the petitioner was\nentitled to equitable relief and that the decisions of the Board were res judicata insofar as the fact\nthat the original license was extended was concerned.   There was no determination, nor could there\nhave been a determination, of the contract rights of any party, including the petitioner.   Therefore,\nthere is no such action by it to be construed as action or inaction.\nThere", "An industry-funded study found that the top five priorities\nfor the European Union were better governance, enhancing\neconomic activity, reducing taxation, reforming the single\nmarket, and improving education and health.

The Board of Education was authorized to determine whether public school funds should be made available to private schools under certain circumstances. The circuit judge granted the petitioners' motion to amend the petition. However, the court rejected the petitioners' argument that they were entitled to a further stay of the law pending the constitutionality of the law in its decision, but noted that the petitioners could file further papers if they sought judicial review of that decision.\nPlaintiff/Appellant, v.\nWOODLAWN BOARD OF EDUCATION, KENNEDY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, MARGARET HALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, AND PARSLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS,\nDISSENTING OPINION BY THE COURT:\nCOMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, SENATOR DAVID WILLIAMS, AND SENATOR JOE COLLINS,\nPlaintiff/Appellant,\nCOMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, and SENATOR DAVID WILLIAMS, Defendants/Appellees.\n(\u00b61} This case originated in the Circuit Court, Montgomery County, Ohio, Case No. 00-CV-631.\n(\u00b62} The petitioners in this case are the Woodlawn Board of Education (\"Board of Education\"), represented by their Superintendent, and the individual members of the Board of Education. The Governor of the State of Ohio (hereinafter \"the Governor\") and the Commissioner of Education are appellees in this appeal. The defendants are the Commissioner of Education, Senator David Williams, and Senator Joe Collins.\n(\u00b63} The Governor suspended the named Board of Education officials and employees pursuant to Article II, Section 14(A) of the State Constitution and Senate Bill 285 (Sub. S.B. 285) (hereinafter \"the statute\"), a law that created the Board of Education. The law prohibited payment of the officials and employees during the pendency of an appeal in this case.\n(\u00b64} This court previously addressed issues regarding the constitutionality of this statute regarding the right of the Governor to suspend state officials and employees pursuant to Sub. S.B. 285, the constitutionality of the statute regarding its authorization of the Board of Education to determine whether public school funds should be made available to private schools, and the constitutionality of that statute regarding its requirement that the Governor, in the case of suspicion of misconduct, conduct an investigation of school officials.\n(\u00b65} In the final decision in this case, the trial court found the statute unconstitutional in its entirety. The Governor, the Commissioner, and Senator David Williams took this appeal. The Ohio Department of Education filed a brief amicus curiae. Senator Joe Collins did not ask for permission to be a party to this case, but is not a party. The Attorney General did not file a brief in this case, despite a notice of appeal filed by the Governor. On appeal, the Governor, the Commissioner, and Senator David Williams are the appellees. On appeal we address issues regarding the constitutionality of the statute.\n(\u00b66} The appealing parties were not entitled to a stay of the statute.\n(\u00b67} There is no provision for interlocutory review of orders denying stays of preliminary equitable injunctions, either through an appeal or petition for certiorari. The issue on appeal is whether the appealing parties are entitled to a stay pending the appeal. Absent specific authority or extraordinary circumstances, absent such authority, this court does not stay any preliminary equitable orders, either preliminary injunctions or preliminary equitable orders.\n(\u00b68} The appealing parties filed a joint motion asking the trial court to amend its prior order granting an immediate preliminary injunction pending appeal. This request for amendment of the preliminary injunction was a request for stay pending appeal. It requested stay pending appeal of the final orders of the trial court, the permanent injunctions barring enforcement of the statute that was previously enjoined. In their motion, they sought a stay of the entire trial court's preliminary equitable inj", "If he should choose to become a journalist, he would be called to the bar, as the lawyers say. He's done the  lawyers' job himself in this paper: the research, the finding of the facts \u2013  the writing's not as good as the work of a barrister. He has some more work to do. He must collect the witnesses. If he were working on a legal case, as the man he really is, he would be collecting the witnesses: finding and bringing them into court. The barrister would come with him. This is very  much the same. He's bringing the witnesses \u2013 the ones he can find. His job is  to bring them before The Court of Public Opinion and to call the witnesses he's found before them and question them on what they know about this \u2013 or at any rate, what they think they know about this. He must ask all the questions he's found to ask and he must be honest. Whenever and wherever he finds them, he must be honest. Not all of the witnesses will be honest \u2013 and that's all right. There will be some of them who will be very unpleasant. And that's all right too. The witnesses must be brought \u2013 they have to be heard. He will be the one to bring them to the Court: or at least the person who  will ask for the barrister: or at least that's what he would do if the barrister weren't him and wasn't so very busy with a case that was  actually important to this person. And then of course, if he were the barrister, it would be he, the barrister, who would bring the witnesses: and he would be the one to  ask them the questions in the end. So that would leave him (him, the person he  is but only seems not to be) \u2013 so that would leave him at that part: that would leave him at the end where \u2013 yes,  what would he do at the end where he would ask the questions? He would ask  the questions. Of course.\n'You can't trust him,' the woman said. 'You just can't.' The woman was the wife of the  barrister this person had just met. He'd been to the barrister's office to talk  about the paper; this was the second time he had been there. This person was meeting with  the barrister, the lawyer, on the matter of giving evidence which he, this person, is known to have already given \u2013 and the lawyer is  giving advice on how best to give evidence again. The lawyer is doing the legal  stuff \u2013 the legal business which will mean that the person this person is will not  appear to be giving evidence; not really he's not, because he's already given it \u2013 but  there is still a certain amount of giving evidence there is. The evidence is still the same. It's just that this person might try not to make it look like  he was giving evidence about a specific thing because \u2013 well, that's not quite what  that person would say but that's what would be the sort of reason that the lawyer would think, 'You can't trust him.'\nSo the advice is being given by this lawyer who is now  giving the advice: it's the advice of the lawyer. The answer is the advice of the barrister; now it's the lawyer's advice. The lawyer, before coming  here, has met with the witnesses. The witnesses, in the courtroom, would have sat at the lawyer's table; if he were the barrister, at the table of the barrister. They are lawyers' witnesses. One witness would have been the person whom the witnesses would call 'He.' There might have been two or three more, but there would definitely have been one called  'He,' not the paper, the man, the other person, 'He.' This person, the  one they would call 'He.' They were witnesses to 'He' giving evidence.\nThe witnesses are the first ones he, the barrister, would have talked to,  before coming here. The witnesses would have talked to one of the barrister's  assistants in preparing the witnesses' evidence. The assistants would have  sat in the assistant's room, preparing the witnesses' evidence. The witnesses were  people who would remember things, and as they sat in the assistant's room, their  memories would have been prepared; and, on the day before, when they came for the  final interview, they would have had their memories prepared. And after  this morning they would have met here, and", "Newspapers are the primary source in every age group for news and information about elections, but most also rely on TV for news about politics and elected officials. Many news consumers say they see election issues covered inconsistently by TV and newspapers and, in some cases, not at all by both media.\nAlthough newspapers provide voters with the most comprehensive and consistent flow of election-related coverage, a substantial number of nonreaders who do consume news say they see inconsistent amounts and quality of coverage. While about seven-in-ten people say they will be getting most of their coverage from either newspapers or TV-and nearly all of them say they are following the elections very closely-a significant share expects to draw at least some election coverage from online sources.\nYounger voters say they get most of their election news from the Internet and social networking sites, while newspaper readership remains strongest and radio less common among older generations. Those age 30 to 49 say they are most likely to get their news of candidates and issues from newspapers, TV or radio; older age groups are more likely to rely on newspapers (see figure 2).\nTV and newspapers top the list of news consumers say they use most to keep up with political news and issues. But newspaper use trails that of TV for following election news-which is still the most followed type of political news. More than four-in-ten voters and nonvoters say they are getting almost all or most of their election news from TV and nearly one-in-five each are getting almost all of their election news from newspapers. However, among younger voters and nonvoters, 42% say they are getting all or most of their news on election issues from online news sources. Nearly one-quarter of these same younger voters say they are getting almost all their election news form social networking sites. Facebook and Twitter-once considered by many to be merely social tools-are now an essential part of the election news cycle (see figure 5).\nRoughly two-thirds of voters say they are getting most or all of their coverage of campaign issues and candidates from newspapers or TV, but 25% of voters overall say they are following the elections very closely and this same proportion of nonvoters says they are so following the election (see figure 1). A slight majority of those very closely following the campaigns say they are getting most or all of their election coverage from newspaper or from TV (see figure 6).\nNewspapers lead television as sources of election news.\nMaintain A Media Mix\nAs many as eight-in-ten say they get most of their election news from a combination of news sources, rather than mainly just one. Voters are most apt to get their election-related news from a diverse mix of sources, including newspapers and TV, while nonvoters say they mainly rely on TV and online sources. Still, newspapers remain the only media used most frequently for news about politics and elected officials by most voters; a substantial portion of non-readers say they see little-to-no newspaper coverage of politics-a belief that may, in part, be based on personal choice and in part on how much print news is available in their news markets.\nNewspaper readers are nearly 3 times as likely to say they follow politics closely.\nMore than seven-in-ten news consumers say they follow the presidential and Congressional races as closely as possible in this election cycle. More voters than nonvoters are following the campaign extremely closely, but among voters who closely follow the election, the portion following TV news with extreme intensity remains the most high, at 64%. A 54% said they follow national political news with extreme intensity and 53% follow local political news with extraordinary intensity (see figure 9). Although fewer news consumers follow local and national politics with extreme intensity than follow the presidential campaign, among the 29% who closely follow local political news, a 44% do also follow the presidential campaign with extreme intensity (see figure 10).\nThe percent of voters who follow presidential politics with great intensity is higher among some groups than it is overall. The share following national politics with great intensity was greater among voters ages 18-29 (38%) than among adults ages 30 to 49 (52%), though among nonvoters, young voters were slightly less likely to closely follow the election.\nAmong all voters-regardless of whether they closely follow politics, closely follow the presidential campaign or voters of any age or educational level-the percentage expressing extremely or very much interest in the presidential election declines with each passing day that campaign goes on (see table", "Bloggers at The Arizona Daily Star have found\na way of sharing data that the newspaper can use to sell\ntargeted advertising and drive increased readership, as well.\nBYLINE: Dan Sullivan\nDATELINE: Tucson, Arizona\nThe Arizona Daily Star in Tucson has introduced new\ntechnology that allows bloggers to post on The Star's website,\nas well as publish items to other sites in the blogosphere.\nThe technology allows The Star to aggregate data so that the\npaper can better market to readers the same content that bloggers\nhave posted elsewhere.

Arapiles for 2001 and some\ndisconcerting news\nThe 2001 statistics are now ready for public perusal and have\nappeared on the \"Stats\" web page of the Arapiles site:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/arapiles_info/stats.html.\nA few points should be mentioned:\n1. The list of climbs has been substantially extended with\nmany previously unrecorded ascents and a number of\nattempts on established routes being included for the\nfirst time. It seems that the 1999 and 2000 stats had some\nfaulty climbs in the data (as noted on the site) which have\nnow all been removed or have been re-checked. The\nnumber of ascents has increased from 12,189 in 1998 to\n14,014 in 1999, with 22 climbers climbing the mountain an\naverage of 23 times each.\nThis year a few more people have climbed it an\nexceptional number of times (15 times or more) than in\n1999 - Peter Smith (15 ascents), Matt Tanner (16), Tori\nJagger (18), Tanea Eades (18), Tim Huntley (18), Martin\nGraham (17), Tim Tait (17) and Michael Smith (20). The\naverage number of times climbed for the 25 or so\nclimbers who have climbed it 20 times or more in 2001 is\n23.5 ascents or up on that of 1999.\nAgain this year, a few climbers have climbed it\nmore than 50 times. This figure has not increased\nsubstantially from 2000, with 18 climbers climbing the\nmountain 50 or more times in a calendar year. Matt Tanner\nis the leading \"super climber\", with 68 ascents. The\nnewest names are Danny Lee (47) and Gareth Wintle (31).\nFor most climbers (those having less than 50 ascents in\n2001) the number of ascents in a calendar year is\nquite low, being no more than 999 (with two climbers\nhaving ascended the mountain 999 times - Alan \"Barney\"\nWoodhill and Matt Tanner).

He is now trying to find a safer, more effective way of fighting this child's cancer and, hopefully, to cure Felix and help other patients.\nThis case involves a 5 year old child.\nThe boy is now in Palo Alto and will be discharged today. He was discharged at noon. I e-mailed him then to see how he was doing and I asked him to let me know as soon as possible so that I could prepare to meet with his father tomorrow.\nWhen I saw him at the hospital, Felix told me that he no longer had the bone pain that he mentioned to you on Wednesday or Thursday. He had no complaints of pain today.  He is doing well, and I think tomorrow will be great for him. I think he will need to be on some kind of pain control for some days to come. Otherwise, he will start developing pain, and then it will be a problem.\nThe best medicine for him right now, is rest and comfort and avoidance of extreme cold temperature, so that his internal temperature will not fall down. The best thing for him is to be surrounded by a safe and happy crowd, and for that, he needs warm sunlight and joy.

He needs more knowledge to be able to help this child, and he is searching for it.\nI hope to do that by helping to bring this boy into a community of people who are doing their best to help children with cancer and other conditions.\nI hope to help Felix's father find some friends here in the Bay Area, and perhaps bring Felix to them for occasional treatment and also for the socialization--and, if possible, the healing that can result from joy and comfort.\nWhat I have done so far is set up a web-site about the case, and we had received hundreds of e-mails from people who have read about Felix and who have tried something or the other.  These people may want to do something for Felix or may want to learn about it.\nI hope you can make it possible for me to invite Felix's father and Felix to meet with Dr. Malkin and with you tomorrow or at some other time.\nIt is important for us to do everything we can to help Felix.  We should be able to help parents to know more about alternative medicine for children with cancer. Felix's father is an engineer who is educated. He will be able to understand what is being explained to him.  For other parents of children with cancer, this meeting might be more difficult for them.  However, they will not be as bright as Felix's father, and they are more challenging to reach.  So we should try to help them as well.\nTomorrow evening, we will meet Dr. Malkin. We will also meet the person who is managing the case--Dr. Matsumoto.\nI hope that it can be arranged as follows. Felix's father and Felix and I will meet Dr. Matsumoto tomorrow. He will explain to the father", "If newspapers are to survive the turbulent 21st century, they must not only report news, but also help their readers to interpret it. The challenge for journalists is to find the stories that will help their readers to understand and cope with the complexities of modern life.\nDAVID LITTLER \n**_There is a lot of talk about the need to \"save_**_ the newspaper industry.\" There are good reasons for this, but what are we saving newspapers from? A world that we no longer recognize? Is the point of saving the industry not rather the recognition of the essential role of a newspaper in a democracy that in a sense is saved by the newspaper?\nIn the short run, as newspapers become part of a diversified media platform, the key will be to recognize that their role is to be that which is not available in another medium, which is to help people understand the news and what it means. In other words, rather than be about the news or about providing information, they need to help us understand and interpret it. Insofar as the newspaper is the \"watchdog of democracy,\" it will be its \"watchdog of the media.\"\n\"What was the reason for all this change?\" Journalist and author Jim Warren has often asked and noted that the \"reason for the change was the change.\" The new media was all part of the \"change,\" he noted, but also the Internet. More than anything, the Internet is what prompted the media to change because the nature of the medium changes the way that people use it and the way it is used in society. The Internet is also the medium with which there has been most experimentation: The _Financial Times_ has had the most to gain with its Web site and e-reader. The _South China Morning Post_ has been a leader in multimedia presentations, including the use of maps and animation with text. Other news media have also been involved in experimentation, but the Internet has given readers new ways of accessing and customizing their news. It has also allowed news to become more \"participatory\" and for there to be greater involvement in news reports and presentations.\nThe result of this, Warren noted, is that the \"Internet has brought democracy to journalism,\" but it is not clear what happens when that democracy intersects with the need for \"balanced journalism\" to report news \"impartially\" and \"without bias.\" He has also noted that, \"With the decline in newspaper profits, the demand to make money and the incentives to please advertisers are much weaker... [S]elf-serving advertising is going out the window.\"\nThe \"information\" on the Internet, like the \"search engine algorithms\" of Google, \"is determined by the preferences of the person doing the searching. This means we have to take more responsibility for what we are putting online, and we have to be aware of the possible negative consequences these algorithms may have on our own lives and in society.\" So what is to stop search engines from being \"extremely biased\" and how are consumers to \"ensure bias is not used as a tool against the public?\" What are we to make of it when \"everything\" reported online is labeled as \"journalism\" when much of the online content is made by companies and organizations that are not reporting or publishing the news, which means most of the current output has not undergone the same newsroom \"quality control\" process that the more traditional, formal news media traditionally and formally have undergone?\nThe most recent research on the Internet and online journalism shows just how important it is to know how to make better use of the Internet, including Web sites, and social media, including Facebook and Twitter, and what those skills mean for our education, employment, and even our culture.\n#  The Internet Is a Powerful Information Tool, Whether You Know It or Not\n\"People who do not know how to use the Internet effectively fail to understand that it is no longer possible to run a business successfully or to function as a modern citizen without a reasonably working knowledge of the Internet,\" observes author and educator Steven J. Gartner. \"This simple and self-evident statement is a major theme throughout _Internet in the Life Sciences_. In addition to providing insight into the Internet's transformational impact on society and business (the worldwide online industry continues to grow at an explosive rate), the author also points the way for students, scientists, and managers to acquire the computer skills required to survive, advance, and succeed in the life sciences in this digital age.\"\nEducation is at the heart of the Internet and its transformation of society, as is innovation. \"The Internet is a powerful information tool that has the ability to fundamentally change the way", "When the media does a fair share of the heavy lifting, consumers can be a powerful voice for authentic journalism.\nWhy Media Needs to Be Good, but Not Perfect\nBy Paul Berger of Influence & Co.", "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is\namending OPM's regulations governing creditable service and\ndeposit and recovery for Federal employees who are transferred,\nreassigned, or returned to a different commuting area.\nDATES: These regulations are effective on December 30, 2005.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Karen L.

The injured passenger, despite being a non-owneror-driver passenger, may be insured under the owner's or driver's motor vehicle\ninsurance policy, if the motor vehicle policy provides uninsured\nmotorist liability coverage.\nAccidents CAR OWNER - MOTORCYCLIST - PASSENGER\nThe facts are not disputed that the injured plaintiff was riding as a\nnon-owner or non-driver passenger in a motorcycle owned and operated by\nthe defendant's decedent, who was injured while the motorcycle was\nunder the control and operation of the plaintiff.  The issue before\nthis Court is whether the plaintiff's passenger liability insurance,\nprovided by the defendant insurer, is intended to insure non-owneror-driver passengers on motorcycles.\nThe accident took place about 11:30 a.m. on a Friday in June 1983\nwhen a Honda motor cycle in which the defendant's decedent was a\npassenger was riding north near the intersection of North Main Street,\nnorth of Broadway, in downtown Salt Lake City.  After riding about 15\nmiles, the defendant's decedent suddenly and without warning swerved\nfrom the right hand lane of traffic of North Main Street into the center\nlane of traffic and collided head on with a 1980 Buick automobile\ntraveling northbound in the center lane.\nThe accident resulted in injuries to both motorcyclist and driver.\nWith respect to the injured plaintiff, the defendant insurer accepted\nhis liability to the extent of a $2,000.00 payment to the decedent\npursuant to a $5,000 uninsured motorist liability policy covering motor\nvehicles owned or operated by the decedent which provides under\nsection 10 of the coverage:\n\"10.

Heggestuen has a front-row seat to seeing the monetization and impact of social newsrooms. As news publishers consider what works for them, a couple universal truths have emerged.\nJohn R. Heggestuen is executive director of NewsWhip, a social analytics company that allows publishers to monitor social traction \u2014 shares, likes, retweets. It also provides data insights into social strategy and benchmarking against other publisher groups. The company currently works with about 20,000 publishers and analytics agencies.\nIn his keynote address during a recent conference on social newsrooms, hosted by Hearst, he shared some universal truths about native advertising. Heggestuen is one of the pioneers of native advertising, and in sharing the lessons learned during his keynote, he reminded publishers, \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect science.\u201d\nNewsWhip has been working with native advertising since 2013, and the company has been monitoring the business outcomes of more than 500 native advertising campaigns for a number of publishers, ranging from premium to tabloid, and from local to international newsroom. According to the company\u2019s research, a native advertising campaign should produce 70 percent more engagement than that of a sponsored section of editorial content, which makes native ads 4.4 times more effective at driving engagement.\nHeggestuen, who leads the research team at NewsWhip, shared the following insightful observations that help publishers think about native advertising.\nIMPACT ON VISIBILITY\nNPR, for example, has about three different types of native advertising campaigns running at all times, each of which is clearly labeled as sponsored. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the company works to place these ads and labels them in the appropriate way.\nIn the NewsWhip database we see on average that 1 percent of editorial content is sponsored on an NPR or public radio site, which can range between 20 percent and 80 percent, depending on a specific site. This is an example of where native advertising has led to more content rather than less, but this depends on publisher and site.\nIMPACT ON LEADS\nSites that work with native advertising typically have a 30 to 40 percent uplift. Heggestuen said that when you put that figure in broader context, you see that the uplift is really about 20 percent, because the publisher has a 10 percent share before they engage in native advertising.\nIn terms of leads, Heggestuen shared an observation from a NewsWhip report titled \u201cThe Lead Sources of Your Native Ads.\u201d One of the things the report shows is that, \u201cIf you spend the same amount of money on native advertising and Google AdWords, you\u2019d get 10-times higher leads and engagement on Google AdWords.\u201d\nHowever, what is really being measured in this case is the value of the clicks. \u201cThe difference in values for the clicks may not be a function of the quality or source, but of the advertiser\u2019s ability to target well,\u201d Heggestuen said. \u201cIn certain industries, a click may mean a lead; in others, it might mean an actual purchase. So those numbers you might see from a social campaign may be a function of the publisher. You\u2019re getting leads, or you may be getting actual sales from those click-throughs.\u201d\nIn this regard, it\u2019s important to monitor the value of every publisher\u2019s native advertising to understand that one publisher can get a different yield from clicks than another.\nIn certain industries, for example, leads may not mean much, but other metrics may mean more. In this way, Heggestuen suggests monitoring and comparing your clicks and leads to benchmarks, to monitor what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cBecause it can mean different things, you need to have your dashboard open all of the time so you can see where you are, how it\u2019s affecting the bottom line and, ultimately, how is the business value of native advertising doing,\u201d Heggestuen said. \u201cIs this a function of industry or company? Is it a function of the editorial environment? Is it a function of the way that each native ad campaign was run?\u201d\nHeggestuen believes it\u2019s important to monitor these details so publishers are constantly optimising their native advertising for more engagement and revenue for all of their campaigns.\nThese are universal issues publishers should be monitoring, but", "News Media Canada members continue to look to newspapers and magazines for their advertising needs \u2014 just like the readers they serve.\nFor the past three years, we have looked at consumer buying habits through the eyes of our readers and advertising clients. While the numbers are subject to a few variables, they give a good idea of how Canadian households and businesses view the importance of news media, both in terms of how they consume news content, and how they think about our ability to engage them as customers.\nThis is particularly significant this year since we found that nearly 50% of Canadians believe news organizations deliver on news and information without bias, with another 35% finding that they favour advertisers and sponsors. While a few readers were skeptical, the numbers indicate our industry has a lot of work to do to better communicate the importance of our role in keeping markets informed.\nThis is the fifth year we have done our study. In 2014, we looked at media consumption habits, attitudes, and buying habits for people over the age of 30. In 2015, we took a deeper dive into advertisers\u2019 attitudes towards news media. In 2016, we turned our attention to how readers think about news media and how that affects their views about advertising. And last year, we decided to broaden the study and look at consumer behaviour in all of its forms: how they search for news, read news publications, and engage with businesses.\nThis year\u2019s study covers the age ranges of 18 to 50, 51 to 70, and 71 to 90. The objective is to find out how people\u2019s behaviours change as we age and how that will affect our news media in the future. In addition to asking about media consumption and business behaviour, this year we are including a question about how people believe news consumers will pay for news coverage \u2013 either with a flat fee or by subscription.\nThese are significant questions for most people at this time, because news media today is in significant transition \u2013 and we need to know where our audience is today if we are to anticipate their future needs and plans.\nAs per last year\u2019s study, our research is conducted via online survey. We wanted to make sure people had a chance to see and read about the study before they answered the questions. That\u2019s why we included three posts on the Study, including several visual graphics to help explain the data before respondents started to answer questions. After the first question on media consumption and attitudes towards advertising, survey participants were asked one question on their views of paying for news.\nOur goal was to measure attitudes of Canadians towards the news media industry and how those attitudes might impact their willingness to pay for news from their trusted news sources.\nThe Canadian newspaper industry produces 400,000 pages of editorial products each year, all with the goal of providing trusted, independent, accurate, and reliable local news and information every day.\nWith over 300 daily newspaper products and over 900 unique issues published each year, our industry creates important opportunities for advertisers and readers to engage with each other.\nThis study sought to find out if there is an appetite among Canadian households for different alternatives, such as a flat rate for news and/or subscription services for news. We also wanted to better understand the attitudes of advertisers and other prospective news media payers towards news media, their customers, and the news media industry itself.\nWe used the data from the 2017 News Media Canada Annual Study of Marketing Communications Effectiveness to support these goals, and the study was structured a bit differently this year.\nAt the outset, survey respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of an advertisement they had seen within the past week and to identify which advertising medium they considered to have the highest effectiveness \u2013 news media, print, broadcast, online, or out-of-home.\nAs well, they were asked to rate the effectiveness of advertising for news media brands. Finally, respondents were asked to share their thoughts on news media, paying for news, and the important news media brands in their community.\nIn total, we surveyed 87 people, aged 18 to 90, using our panel of over 1500 online participants. The average survey took 26 minutes to complete. As per our requirements for ethics approval from Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais, we applied a snowball sampling method using several Canadian panel providers. All members on our panels, who were at least 18 years of age, were invited to participate.\nWh", "A series of three stories highlighting the success of the print edition of the Toronto Star have highlighted the newspaper's continued commitment to good print advertising. A well-told story not only builds readership and loyalty, but also raises the status of the print edition.\nA Series Of Stories Saves The Toronto Star\nEditor & Publisher Magazine | Monday, July 7, 2008\nIf it were purely an advertising-driven business, the Star would have folded long ago. It has neither the readership nor the marketing budget to match the Globe-News and other publications. Yet it continues on a sound financial footing thanks largely to a mix of good journalism and steady readership.\nIt\u2019s not an unusual tale \u2014 newspapers that survive with journalistic excellence and a smart strategy have done so for hundreds of years.\nBut there is something special about last month\u2019s story about the success of the Star\u2019s home furnishings section, \u201cInside Edition.\u201d The article not only captured the attention of readers, but also did a terrific job making the case to advertisers that they should place their ads in the local paper instead of a national or regional one.\nThe Toronto Star\u2019s home furnishings pages not only showed growth but also an ability to lure new companies to advertise. As a result, the section\u2019s income for the year increased 6.1% to just shy of $4 million.\nThis month\u2019s edition of E&P looks hard at the print edition of the Toronto Star in the context of the newspaper\u2019s entire business strategy \u2014 something rarely covered in depth by other publications. Most recently, the Globe and Mail has run a series of pieces questioning the Star\u2019s future.\nI think we can all agree we love to hate the Sun as a leading paper in the Metro-Toronto region. But that doesn\u2019t mean the other newspaper has had it easy: the Globe has made a huge investment in its local Toronto news operations, much to the detriment of the Sun, which has fallen into hard times. The Star has had a better advertising sales story in the last year (see chart) but its news operations have seen the Globe gain readers.\nWhat I hope to show is how the Star not only uses its own product effectively to reach readers but often manages to get the Globe and other papers to beat up on each other in a healthy competition.\nMary Orsini, a freelance journalist based in Toronto, was kind enough to spend a couple of days with me, looking at the Star\u2019s business operations. Her story takes a look at how both a Star series and a Globe story demonstrated the real value of the print edition of a local newspaper.\nWith all the focus on online news, it\u2019s easy to forget that local newspapers, like the Toronto Star, are extremely valuable news properties \u2014 providing readers with a level of detail that is not matched by even the most well-heeled online news provider.\nNewspapers have a lot of assets that simply can\u2019t be replicated when delivered through the digital media. And we will look at several examples of how the Star uses both technology and old-school journalism to make them useful to readers and to potential advertisers.\nI hope you like it. I also invite feedback from other papers on what they do to make their print offerings a value to readers and advertisers. \u2014 Mike Ross - Editor & Publisher\nLabels: newspapers save readers' money", "The FCC's current rules\ndefine what is included in commercial mobile\nservice under certain circumstances, such as\nwhen a service is billed to a customer\nwhether or not the customer consumes it and\nwhether the service is billed to the\ncustomer on a regular basis.  The FCC has\nnot been consistent or clear about what\nconstitutes commercial mobile service, and\nit has left the field open for\ninterpretation.  We recommend that the\nCommission be clearer about what it\nintends by its definition so that we might\navoid potential application and\nimplementation issues going forward, such\nas ensuring effective and equal access and\nservice to all 911 callers and to the\nunlicensed spectrum generally that is necessary\nto encourage innovative wireless services\nand applications.  These are issues of\nimportance to the public and to AT&T.\nPurpose of Letter: To ask that the Commission provide clear statements, rather than its current definitions, regarding what it considers to be commercial mobile service.\nIn 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\" or the \"Commission\") amended its rules to create an exemption for commercial carriers from paying annual universal service (i.e., high cost support)\nbillings.  However, in order to qualify for the exemption, carriers and services had to meet certain standards, such as:\nbe provided \"in the ordinary course for monetary\nconsideration\".    (See \"Commercial Mobile Service,\" Section 61.31).    FCC  has generally held that to\ninclude service that a company bills the customer\nwhether or not the customer consumes the service\nbecause the charges are based on a regular\nbilling cycle.  However, in 2003, the FCC\namended its rules in the E911 Report and Order to\nallow a mobile operator to provide a commercial\nwireless service if the customer does not pay for\nthe service for periods longer than one month.\nFurther, it appears that FCC has not considered\nthe effectiveness of its current definitions in\nterms of ensuring effective and equal access to\nand service to customers who depend on\nlocation-specific emergency services and other\nessential communications services.  AT&T is\nthus requesting that the FCC, in adopting the E911\nReport and Order in 2003, articulate clear statements, instead of leaving such critical issues in\nits current definitions.  The purpose of this\nletter is to request for clarification under what\ncircumstances the FCC intended that a commercial\nmobile radio service should not be qualified for\nthe exemption from the universal service support by\nthe definition \"Commercial Mobile Service\".\nAT&T has long and vigorously supported efforts\nregarding 911 and other life safety emergency\ntelecommunications services for both citizens and\nbusinesses.  For many reasons, the public policy\nand national need for emergency telecommunications\nservices and other essential communications\nservices are increasing.  It has long been\nrecognized that these services and applications can\nbe more effectively, efficiently, and\naccessed/delivered to the public via the Internet\nand a variety of new devices, which are more\nportable and user-friendly than traditional \"land-line\" telephones.  In recent years\nthere has been rapid growth in the number of\nwireless services and applications; a number of\nwireless services and applications have emerged;\nthere has been rapid explosive growth of the\nnumber of wireless devices; there has been rapid\ndecline in the cost of wireless services; and there\nhas been a significant increase in wireless data\nrevenue.  According to FCC's most recent\nestimates, the number and type of cell phones on\nthe market today is growing as fast as internet\naccess devices such as iPods, Blackberries, etc.\nThere are currently 220M wireless subscribers\nin the United States -- representing a 25% increase\nover the prior year.  The wireless industry has\ndramatically changed since 1996.  The FCC's\ncurrent rules appear not to reflect this dramatic\nchange in the wireless industry and technology,\nor the significant increase in mobile broadband,\nwireless communications devices and applications,\nand wireless broadband service revenues.  Accordingly, the FCC's current definitions\nand statements appear to be outdated and/or\ninconsistent.  Many companies appear to be\noffering services that may fall within the definition\n\"Commercial Mobile Radio System", "On July 1,  1931\u2014the first day of fiscal 1932\u2014the nation's largest and last private transcontinental passenger railroad service, operating as the Union Pacific Company, came to an instantaneous halt. The immediate cause was the issuance of an order by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to the railroad company to cease operations. The railroad's final service\u2014last known as the Denver Rocket, after the name of the train serving the primary segment\u2014arrived in Omaha, Nebraska, at 2:39 P.M., nearly six hours late.\nOn that same day, in the state capital of Lincoln, the Union Pacific Company began a series of litigations in an attempt to prevent the ICC from closing the road. The railroad company contended that the ICC was violating the terms of an open-ended lease agreement that the two parties had signed in August, 1930, when the ICC had agreed to sell the railroad's physical assets\u2014track, rolling stock, yards, shops\u2014for $39 million to the government of the newly established state of Oklahoma, of which Omaha was the state capital.\nThe ICC claimed that it had no legal basis for requiring the railroad company, which was still operating its railroad under the terms of an ICC certificate of abandonment, to remain in an operational mode. The ICC contended that its order, as well as similar actions directed at the railroad company in Kansas and on the Canadian Pacific side of the international border between the United States and Canada, had been issued so that private railroading in North America would become unnecessary, resulting in a positive effect on the nation's gross national product.\nOn July 2, the United States District Court in Lincoln awarded the new government-owned Union Pacific Railroad Company a preliminary injunction preventing the ICC from closing its shops and yards in Omaha and at Council Bluffs, Iowa, where the company had another major shop. The railroad company's lawyers, in a lengthy legal brief filed ahead of the court hearing, had asserted that the ICC had violated the terms of the 1930 agreement and then had tried to cover up its actions. The railroad company contended that both the lease agreement as well as the open-ended lease agreement (an ICC-issued certificate of convenience and necessity permitting railway operating activity) had been used only to obtain control of the physical railroad assets.\nThe ICC argued that the 1930 lease agreement, which was an assignment agreement to the owner of the railroad to an incoming railroad company, in that the owner had been the Union Pacific Company, had been an agreement whereby the railroad company had not only permitted the incoming railroad company to use its facilities but also had guaranteed the incoming railroad's use of the railroad. In so testifying, the ICC claimed that by issuing a certificate of abandonment, the ICC had been providing the incoming railroad (the Union Pacific Railroad Company, owned by the government of Oklahoma) with the opportunity to recreate the road's assets.\nThe ICC claimed that the railroad company had \"abandoned\" its facilities in Nebraska and Kansas and that it was using the pretext of a sale by the ICC (by using the ICC's sale option) to gain control of the assets, when in actuality, the railroad company still owned the road, but had deliberately closed it to prevent the ICC's sale of its assets. The ICC asserted that the railroad company was trying to create an emergency situation for the ICC to reissue a certificate of abandonment, upon which the company would not only regain control of its road's assets but also force the ICC to once again lease its assets. The ICC argued that once the lease agreement was rescinded, the railroad company could reestablish its road, which would be a competitor to the federal government-owned operations.\nBoth the lawyers of the Union Pacific Company and of the new railroad company testified that they had been attempting only to gain complete control of the railroad's assets, which had been sold to them. At the close of the preliminary injunction hearing, the judge denied the railroad company's request for a preliminary injunction, reasoning that the company had never provided the government in Washington with evidence which indicated that the ICC or the Attorney General of Nebraska had violated any laws or regulations which had come before him or which he had observed.\nThe railroad company was represented in the courtroom by R. L.", "For the first time, there is a\nconsistent relationship between the\nincome level of U.S. adults and their\nperceptions of the importance of\njournalism.  It's not just the middle\nclass that cares about news; it's many\npeople who don't make a lot of money, as well.\nThe findings suggest that people who\nare struggling in this economy are\nstill concerned about current events\nand what the government is doing in\ntheir lives.  Their financial distress\ndoes not necessarily translate into a\ndiminution of the relevance of news to\ntheir lives.  (In fact, the poorer a person\nwas, the more news about\nthe economy was important to him, the\nstudy found.)\nPeople with incomes of $30,000 per\nyear gave news a grade of B-minus\non quality, up slightly from a B in\na 2008 survey conducted for the\nAssociation of American Publishers.\nThis grade was similar to the B+\nGallup found for all classes,\nbut it was slightly better than the\ngrade Americans gave the news\nmedia as an industry last month.\nIn a Gallup survey conducted in\nMarch, media professionals had a\nweighted grade of F minus despite\ntheir hope for a B+.\nGallup's study, which included 1,022\nU.S. adults in April, examined what\npeople thought about the news media\non the basis of how much they valued\ndifferent aspects of the journalism\nindustry, including the accuracy of\nnews reports regarding public\nleaders, the independence of the press\nand its credibility, the \"value of news\nto our society,\" and the \"importance\nof newsworthy information to our lifestyles.\"\nThe study will be published in the\nNovember/December 2010 issue of\nPublic Affairs Quarterly and\nwill be available on Oct.\n30 at www.aaq.com/aaq/paq/articles/summer10_aq116.php.\nThe survey found a slight decline in\nthe quality of U.S. journalism and\na significant downturn in its importance\nto people's lives.

It found\nthat U.S. adults continue to believe\nthat news has a \"significant effect of\n[their] lifestyle\" even with current\nfinancial uncertainty.  It is the first\nsurvey to ask the same questions about\nthe media this year.\nThe survey indicated that 62% of\nthose surveyed believe that news affects\ntheir lifestyle significantly.  That\npercentage declined from the 69% who\nreported a significant influence of\nnews in 2007 and 2008, but it was\nstill above the 55% found in 2009.\nThe percentage of those who thought\njournalism was very important to them\nincreased slightly to 43%, an indication\nthat it may be less affected by an\neconomic crisis than its value.\nPeople were asked to rate the\nimportance of journalism in eight\nspecific areas.

However, the title of the rule contains the words \"Buildings and Facilities\" and uses this term in describing the application of the rule. Additionally, the preamble specifically states \u201cThis rulemaking addresses only new construction and alterations to public buildings and not to other publicly and commercially owned and operated buildings and facilities, such as theaters, hotels, office buildings, apartment buildings, hospitals, retail stores and restaurants.\u201d According to the preamble, the \"Department's Title II regulations do not include public or private sector offices.\"\nAs you may recall, the Access Board\u2019s ADAAG rule was submitted to OMB for a regulatory impact analysis on August 10, 1999. OMB conducted that analysis, and on October 22, 1999, determined that the rule was not a major rule and did not require further analysis from OMB pursuant to Executive Order 12866. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative conducted a separate but parallel analysis of the rule's impact on international trade. This parallel analysis was completed on November 15, 1999.\nOn December 27, 1999, the Board released a draft of ADAAG. It was the Board\u2019s intention at that time to release the final rule within 30 days of the publication of the ADAAG draft. On January 6, 2000, the Board decided to conduct a further public comment period before issuing the final rule and, as soon as possible thereafter, to publish the final rule in Federal Register for 30 days. During this period, the Board continued to receive comments from state and local building officials and others, and responded on February 4, 2000. On April 13, 2000, the Board decided to publish the final rule for 60 days rather than 30 days in the Register. As stated in the final rule, the Access Board believes that this approach best ensures that the public is properly informed of the provisions of this rule. On May 4, 2000, the Access Board released the final rule: ADAAG title 1, design & construction for buildings and facilities.\nThe Board is pleased to have reached the end of the ADAAG rule-making phase. It looks forward to continuing to work with the Department regarding implementation of the requirements of the title III regulation, which is still pending OMB review.\nOn the question of whether Title II and other public and private structures will be covered by ADAAG, the Access Board will not address this issue until the new Executive Order is signed into law by the President and published in the Federal Register.\nI hope this is helpful. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you need more information or if you have any other questions or issues about the final rule.", "Revenue of Hearst Corp\u2019s newspaper division was essentially flat in the second quarter despite strong gains at the Houston Chronicle and at the San Francisco Chronicle. However, the New York Daily News reported its first year-over-year revenue increase in nearly half a decade.\nFor the second quarter ended June 30, 2007, Hearst reported total revenues of US$2,932m, with newspaper advertising (55%) dropping slightly to US$1,697m, and circulation (38%) declining 10% to US$812m.\nAudience revenue rose 18% to US$422m while subscription revenue decreased 2% to $594m. (Pension & other income was up 42% to US$310m.) Publishing operating income (excluding charges) came in at $325m, a gain of 1%.\nFor newspapers, second quarter advertising revenue increased 4% at the Houston Chronicle and 1% at the San Francisco Chronicle. Circulation revenue fell 7% at the Chronicle and 9% at the San Francisco Chronicle.\nAt the other large Hearst flagship publications, the Chicago, New York and Boston dailies dropped 18%, 16% and 3%, respectively. For the quarter, advertising revenue rose at six of the company\u2019s 26 daily newspaper titles.\nThe New York Daily News reported the first year-over-year increase in three years, with total revenue of $145.6m, a 2% gain, and advertising revenue of $96.1, a 3% gain. Circulation revenues, however, continued to slide, losing 4% to $69.5m.\nHearst said it expects ad revenue to drop in the third quarter (July through September), as weakness in the housing market is expected to accelerate.\nSales for the full calendar year remain \u201ctroublesome,\u201d said Hearst president and CEO Frank A. Bennack., Jr., in a company statement. \u201cBut we are encouraged by an improving advertising environment \u2013 which is more evident in the second half of 2007 \u2013 and the ongoing execution of our strategy to produce superior financial returns while delivering news and information value to customers.\u201d", "Forget the old days of media\nconglomerates' dominance and vertical integration.\nVertical integration is actually\nincreasing in a couple of key sectors, including digital\ndistribution, but not in a way that you would expect.  Rather\nthan creating a fully vertical integration around a particular company, such as a news/information site or magazine (though\nsome of these continue), the industry is increasingly getting\nvertical while still allowing for intermediating companies\nto do the actual distribution.  That is, content is produced by\na variety of companies, while distribution and advertising\nare provided by another variety of companies.\nThat variety will continue to grow, as I will describe in my\nfollowing article.\nThe Internet, of course, is the primary reason for this\nchanges.  The Web has become a truly mass medium, and while\nwe all agree that a mass medium like the Web is different\nfrom television, its new characteristics are only just\nemerging.  As more and more new Web uses and services\nbecome established and their usage grows, new\ncompetencies will continue to emerge and grow, as well as\nthose that are obsolete, and they will be even more rapidly\nmixed and matched in various combinations than is the case\ncurrently.  That is, as we move into the next decade, there\nwill be a number of Internet media conglomerates that can't\nbe summed up with any of the simple and one-dimensional\nmodels that emerged out of the TV and\nprint/broadcast magazine industries.\nFor the next five years, a variety of traditional players\nwill consolidate and restructure in a variety of ways to\naddress the new competencies and demands, while a variety of new types of intermediaries will appear.  Some of\nthem will be technology companies, the sort that have\nbeen around for decades, whose specialties are now being\nused more frequently and in new ways.  Some of these\nwill be in areas that people hadn't even thought of, much\nless been around for centuries.  Some of these new\ncompetencies will emerge out of the current crop of dotcoms\nand Web media players.  One thing I do know is that the\nnewest and latest players will not always be the best ones\n- the current wave is not about style, but rather about using\nthe technology that is there.  In other words, whether a\ncompany has a cool looking site doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it is a good one.  While it may draw customers for a\nperiod of time, coolness wears off over time.  Good companies\nkeep finding new and better ways to use the technology\nin-house or they keep coming out with new technology that\nchanges businesses and industries.  The companies that are able to do these things can keep succeeding even in a\nslowing economy, an economy where most dotcoms fail in\na couple of years.  I'm hoping that those who continue to\nbe successful will continue to survive the current wave of\ndownsizing and upsizing, especially as their own stocks\nremain under pressure.\nThis article is based entirely on conversations and interviews, as well as on my own research and analysis.

But she fears there\u2019s an ulterior motive for his romantic interest \u2014 what it is?\nThis is a work of fiction, with elements of fantasy and paranormal action, but there are strong characters and realistic and moving social messages woven throughout. I wrote the scenes in the beginning as a journal, so they are very pure and unedited. Then I developed as a story where the girl meets her friend, gets rejected, tries to overcome her feelings, and gets more clues about his intentions. In the end, an epilogue allows the girl to finally discover the truth.\nI\u2019ll write more details in the notes, but I wanted to get the story out since there\u2019s just 4 days left for National Novel Writing Month! My goal was to make as good a story as possible in just 30 days, but we\u2019ll see. Feel free to share your feedback and any ideas for improving it.\nI hope you enjoy this short introductory sample from my 2011 novel \u201cDifferent Worlds.\u201d\nNotes from the Author: I have an unusual ability to see through the eyes of different people and I\u2019ve always tried to use my gift to help others. Now I work at a homeless shelter with my best friend, Steve.\nOne night while I was living alone in a studio apartment, I was awakened by a strong wind. It felt like a tropical storm, but it was winter. I looked out the window and saw nothing but a gray fog with heavy rain.\nI walked to my balcony and stepped onto the weather deck. It was very hot and I felt humidity on my skin that I had not felt in months, even in California summers. I thought this was strange and then began to sweat.\nSteve called to say he was getting stuck in traffic and I started to panic. He was late to the shelter. I was screaming \u201chelp\u201d into a walkie-talkie as my legs began to feel weak.\nAll I\u2019d have to do was walk to my car and drive to the nearest emergency room near my building. But suddenly I did not have the strength and my vision blurred, so much so that I had to sit down.\nFrom the kitchen area I thought I saw a figure, an old man with a gray beard and wearing a long coat. He seemed to be waving at me and then disappeared.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d I screamed, \u201cPlease hurry!\u201d\nMoments later he appeared on the balcony. He looked nervous, but rushed inside and told me that a tree fell on an elderly man\u2019s home during the thunderstorm.\nHe told me he had asked the man where he had moved to. He said he would call me when he got settled.\nI went back to my room and put on a light jacket against the rain before going back to work the next morning. When 11AM came around and I arrived at the shelter, I found a man waiting for me in the lobby, sitting on a metal chair that had been discarded from a nearby food truck.\nI saw that his face was pale and his eyes were dull and red. This gave me a serious fright and I wondered how in the world he could have gotten to the shelter alive?\nI asked him if he wanted to stay the night, but he refused. Then he told me his name: Paul Smith.\nI had never heard that name before in my life, but his strange speech patterns and his appearance convinced me that he was from outer space.\nI couldn\u2019t believe it when he told me that a tree had crashed through his house, but he said that he was okay and not much had even rattled around it.\nHe also said that the tree had saved his family, that it had knocked them all to the floor since his wife and kids were reading a book at the living room table when it happened.\nThe rain and storm were so strong that his family was shielded and protected by the fallen tree.\nHe said that he didn\u2019t need to stay at the shelter, but I told him it was very cold outside and I knew he would be comfortable in my small room.\nHe didn\u2019t even seem concerned about his living arrangements, but he wanted to thank me for letting him use my room.\nHe seemed so calm and kind while he sat there and drank some hot tea. He had a strong accent and an unusual vocabulary, but he seemed so normal, considering the circumstances.\nMy husband, Bill, was a homeless man that had been in a terrible car accident many years earlier", "A group of researchers have shown that the more time children spend on electronic gaming devices, the more time they spend not being physically active \u2013 and that is linked to childhood obesity.\nRESEARCHERS: Yvonne Kelly, PhD, from the Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences at UCL Institute of Child Health, and the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, and the MRC Unit for Social and Community Psycho-Oncology at the UCL Cancer Institute, London. Dr Kelly, and her research colleagues had published a similar research study in 2008 in the journal Pediatrics, after surveying a sample of over 2,000 15-year-olds in the UK.\n\u2022 The average time spent playing electronic gaming devices in the UK rose almost 20 percent between 1998 and 2014. The average in 2014 was an hour per day.\n\u2022 The average time spent not being active in 2014 was 4 hours and 24 minutes per day. Previous research had suggested that the average total daily screen time is one hour per day. Thus, time spent playing electronic games was not accounted for in the prior research. That is why the research team re-surveyed children and their behaviors and activities.\n\u2022 The average total daily time spent watching TV and videos in the UK was 34 minutes.\n\u2022 In the UK, children spend 41 minutes each playing electronic games daily, and the average daily time spent not engaged in physical activity in 2014 was 2.9 hours.\n\u2022 In all, 49 percent of the surveyed children were found to be meeting the 60 minutes per day minimum physical activity guideline. The percentage of girls meeting the guideline was lower in comparison to boys, at 40 percent versus 54 percent respectively, even though no other activity-related behaviour showed a gender disparity.\n\u2022 Boys were more likely to be physically active than girls in all age groups.\n\u2022 In 2014, 10 percent of the girls surveyed were obese; the same percentage of boys were obese. In response to an earlier 2008 UCL study that made the initial claim, more researchers at UCL and other universities have pointed out that more children with lower socio-economic backbones were being exposed to media, and thus spending more time sitting and less activity, at the same time.\n\u2022 Researchers suggest that efforts to combat childhood obesity are best done through a family\u2019s activities, and emphasize that family meals, and time spent with family around the dinner table, has been shown to be vital in getting young children to grow into healthy adulthoods. At the same time, parents can teach their children about healthy activities by spending time doing them.\n\u2022 The research team says that the increase in electronic gaming devices may be due to the growing influence they have on families \u2013 and in the amount of money being spent on them.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Betsy Davis is a freelance writer and mom.

At media companies like The New York Times, the transition in the sales force means that most reps these days are cross-platform, or fully equipped to sell digital revenue in any space \u2014 mobile devices, tablets, desktops, and laptops.\n\"In the sales force we don't have much of a digital/print divide,\" said James H. Freeman, group ad director, at The New York Times. \"It's not like people don't know how digital advertising works; it's just that these people have been on the digital side for too long.\"\n\"People now in the sales force are more conversant in digital platforms, and that's why print salespeople are moving toward advertising digital. It's a matter of keeping up.\"\nNew York Times Media Group Ad Sales Executive\nJames said that in his group \u2014 the media group, which sells primarily national advertising, not consumer advertising \u2014 about 35% of its members (including new hires) have digital backgrounds. The media group was formed out of the former print sales force.\n\"So in the sales force we don't have much of a digital/print divide. It's not like people don't know how digital advertising works; it's just that these people have been on the digital side for too long.\"\nThe New York Times' sales teams focus on selling to the nation's top advertisers. Its revenue, from which the company earns over 90% of its total revenue, is primarily from advertising. The paper gets a lot of attention for its editorial prowess, which it should. But the advertising side of The New York Times is extremely innovative and aggressively looking ahead at the future of advertising delivery.\nThe New York Times is also extremely innovative in its ad-buying strategies. It recently launched a new ad product called \"Instant Ads\" -- an interactive ad unit that can be bought alongside its editorial content.\nThe ad product leverages the new Times Reader app and its digital subscribers to reach a highly engaged and desirable demographic -- and it's the kind of product that digital advertisers have been looking for: the chance to buy alongside editorial content. Instant ads are delivered as soon as content is published.\n\"The ability to serve Instant Ads within editorial was an immediate hit,\" said James. \"As an advertiser, to see that sort of targeted, quality audience with very short tail, it's very appealing.\" And the response has been impressive. Within a couple of days, it had \"sold out.\"\nThe Ad Sales Team Is \"Reactive\"\nJames says the ad sales team is \"very reactive\" in terms of how it thinks about its opportunities and innovations in the space.\n\"We believe that our print advertisers are very savvy digitally, especially for our specific advertisers,\" he said. \"If someone reads the print edition, they like to look at the e-edition of the New York Times every day.\"\nAnd as consumers interact with content, that interaction is valuable, James said, whether it's reading editorial or engaging with native news ads. \"We're looking to see where the opportunities are -- whether the opportunities are growing or going away -- and to find ways to connect the two.\"\nThat connected revenue is what the Times does best; it's what it excels at doing that other publishers can't do as effectively. \"The more ways we can connect it to print, that's the direction we're headed in from a business standpoint,\" James said.\nAnd that's the direction newspapers are headed in from an audience standpoint. Most newspapers are focused on driving subscriptions.\n\"Newspapers continue to focus on subscription, on developing audience, on making sure people have their paywall down,\" James said.\nBut a new group is emerging, as well: people who use the paid model of an app \u2014 in this case, the New York Times app \u2014 \"to the extent the product is worth it.\"\nJames said that's where newspapers' future lies. \"That's a significant cohort.

Business is down and more competition is opening up which means you need to have another plan than just being satisfied with your job, career and income, or worse yet, become entrenched in your own comfort zone and in the current day habits and patterns of daily life.\nAs many readers know, I have been working 100 hours every week for the last 6 years straight with the same company and no real plans of having a Plan B. Lately, I have been taking a few hours off here and there to get a few things done at home that I never have time for. It's called, \"Going out to get the mail.\" So now, after working 100 hours every week for 6 fucking years and being very successful, I am now thinking, \"What a boring waste of time my whole life has been.\" So now, all of a sudden, it's time to start having lots of plans and alternatives, and also more time off! I guess 100 hours will be too little now that I have the time to enjoy it. Or, will it? I don't know, and I don't want to take a vacation because then we'll be broke and living off food stamps and section 8 housing by next year. But if I don't step things up now to make myself more employable and marketable, and diversify my time and income sources now, how will I know if I can ever do it without putting a major dent in my current cash flow (pay off the car, and all that)? This is why it's good to have another source of income now, so you know.\nThe hardest part is deciding what to do. I am really torn between taking my current money game and marketing and sales skills, and going out on my own to form my own company, or going back to work at a start up company (of whom I am currently being courted) or whatever else catches my fancy and that seems fun, interesting, or exciting. I never realized how hard it is to choose what to do, and the worst part, who's going to hire me? Nobody. I should start working on building 10-12 different incomes all at once, and start with the easiest things or hobbies that can make the best money, or at least be the most interesting and fun at first: teaching dance lessons, playing the piano, writing books, having a yard sale, flipping houses, teaching online, blogging, tutoring.\nI also need to make money while doing the things I really enjoy and really want to do, which is hiking and camping, writing and teaching. I'll probably do all these things in some combination with the following businesses:\n1. Camping And Hiking Store: What kind of business or service does that sound like? I am not even sure if this is a service or a business, but I would love to offer quality gear, camping supplies, outdoor clothing etc. that will improve the quality of camping and hiking that you do.

This action is proposed to amend a special rule and, when amended, would establish a 24-hour time-area closure to all transiting vessel traffic, with exceptions, within the designated geographical area. This action is intended to prevent harassment of tropical tuna and certain other species of pelagic fish and to minimize the potential for negative fishing behavior or competition. The Department has determined that this rule is expected to facilitate the conservation and management of the tropical tuna group of the Atlantic tuna groupfish. This rule also would minimize bycatch of tropical tuna and address other impacts to fisheries resources. DATES: Comments on this action are requested until March 21, 2014.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian C. Sims, Chief, Division of Management Authority, (703) 358- 1404; brian.sims@fws.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this amendment of the Pelagics Special Rule is to prevent harassment of tropical tuna and other species as a result of increasing vessel activities in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The Hawaiian Islands have some of the last viable stocks of these highly migratory species and the increased vessel activities may result in unwarranted bycatch that can further diminish these stocks. This action is intended to prevent or minimize harassment of tropical tuna and other species of pelagic fish, minimize potential fishing behavior or competition, and address other impacts to protected resources. The Special Rule does not apply to vessels that were issued a valid tropical tuna Angling Permit for the 2013 permit year. These vessels may operate during a closure if they submit a copy of such permit and report their angling activity at the applicable reporting station as required by 50 CFR 223.206(g). The Special Rule generally does not apply to persons engaged in the landing, processing, storage, freezing or distribution of tropical tuna or fish that feed on tropical tuna; support vessels; or fishing vessels on the high seas. The rule also exempts vessels from the special rule while actively engaged in fishing under a fishery management plan. If a vessel is fishing under a fishery management plan, such vessel would be in a closed area but not have to comply with the regulations when such vessel has submitted to the applicable Federal law enforcement agency satisfactory evidence of compliance with the fishery management plan and such evidence has been forwarded to the Regional Administrator of NMFS Western Pacific Region for the region in which the special rule applies. Comment on Other Issues: The HI-PSR is a special rule which is not subject to the administrative provisions of section 301 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or the public comment or other requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, (NEPA), or other public laws and regulations. No comments are being sought on the policy issues raised by the HI-PSR.

At the click of a mouse, an endless array of information is just a few clicks away. Search engines like Google make it so easy.\nBut in the field world of journalism and marketing, we have learned that search engines are not necessarily helpful (or even realistic) to use when trying to pinpoint an audience specific enough to target it.\nThis is where media companies still tend to struggle. It can be a challenge to use big data to zero in on a specific demographic group with the appropriate marketing message based on the human experience. As the data shows and the customer support teams can attest, it's not all that easy.\nAccording to \"Data-Driven Marketing: The Human Experience,\" an analysis released earlier this year by Bain Consulting and BDO USA, \"Few large companies have the ability to truly combine data to understand customers' journeys and predict their next moves.\" In fact, most media companies often find themselves on the fringes because they lack the technology and capability to make the most of big data in its real estate, financial services and retail divisions.\n\"Data doesn't help you deliver an actionable idea or insightful proposition to your customer.\"\nYet, it is important to note that media companies are better at this than many of the industries mentioned in the survey. One of the reasons is that media companies often have the means to gather big data, and therefore, are much closer to the consumer. Media companies also have a good idea of how to use the data.\nBut this doesn't mean media companies always get it right. In fact, a lot of media companies still find themselves on the fringes of big data. For example, there were no responses of large companies using big data to drive operational efficiencies and there was a measly response of seven companies using big data to drive product launches. Many media companies are not taking full advantage of this technology, despite its power to help generate relevant content for target audiences.\nIn the media world, it's so easy to lose sight of the end goal -- the human experience. Many times, the focus lies with the technology. In fact, many media companies are so caught up in the technology that they forget the \"why\" behind making use of this technology. This is often why many media companies struggle with their big data strategies. Media companies forget the most critical element of big data -- to understand the \"why.\"\nWhat do the data show about media companies? To sum it up, media companies are more likely to focus on the \"what\" behind big data rather than the \"why.\"\nIn order to be successful in big data practices, it's important not to overlook the human experience. This is why it's crucial for media companies to remember what makes them and their consumers tick. For example, most media companies have data on their own online audience. They often know how much time the average site visitor spends on a site and what they click.\nThis is all useful information, but often it's not enough. The key is to uncover the why with the data. To do this, media companies need to focus on where to store and analyze the data and use it to make the most of the data.\nThe challenge for media companies is they really need help to fully explore and understand how to use big data to build real relationships with consumers. For example, media companies also need help to create a strategy, and that often entails having the right tools and technology to handle big data. This is when media companies struggle.\nIf you look closely, there are few media companies that understand what's most important with big data -- putting themselves in their customer's shoes to take a 360-degree view of their customers. The trick is to be aware of the human experience, to understand where your data sits and what else the data has access to, and to be able to link this all together with the media company's audience and product mix.\nTo truly put the big data practices to work, media companies need to make sure they use the data in a way that makes sense to their end customers. They need to look at their consumer's behavior and preferences to offer a truly relevant user experience for the audience.\nBig data is all about the human experience, so media companies need to keep this in mind and make it a priority. For example, if you want to start big data campaigns for your audience, it's important to go back and look at what past campaigns have done to see if you're on the right track. One way to keep the focus on the human experience is to make sure the consumer experience you are providing will bring you one", "A woman accused of killing her best friend over her best friend\u2019s husband is found incompetent to stand trial.\nSTATE JOURNAL RECORD (OKLAHOMA CITY, OK)\nSlayer Not Competent To Stand Trial\nRACHEL WILLIS, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nA woman accused of murder in the bludgeoning death of her best friend has been declared incompetent to stand trial.

The appellate panel ruled that the agency's determination that the proposed reactor facility would not pose \"significant risk,\" when there had been no scientific evaluation on nuclear safety, was arbitrary and capricious. The panel also ruled that the agency erred in denying the appellants' petition for hearing, and that the agency was, thus, in violation of the state's Administrative Procedure Act and its rules of procedure, all of which permitted hearing and consideration of issues that were presented in the petition.\nREASONS: The Connecticut Environmental Protection Commission had unanimously denied a siting permit\nfor the proposed reactor because of environmental threats; the denial, according to the appellants, was based only on the economic threat of competition from nuclear energy. A majority of the state's nuclear siting council also voted to grant the application, however. Appellants argued that the state agency's decision that the economic consequences of the proposed reactor did not constitute \"significant risk\" was arbitrary and capricious, as this issue, even though discussed by the commission and the council in hearings, was not addressed in the agency's decision. The agency's decision to deny petitioner's request for hearings, and to preclude that issue from consideration at the next stage of the application process, was also arbitrary and without legal foundation\n(State Of Connecticut. v.

We predicted that participants in a condition with increased interdependence would give more generously and reciprocate more frequently than participants in a control condition, and we hypothesized that interdependence-based increases in generosity would translate across different types of social exchanges. In Experiment 1A, 315 participants read a newspaper story about a sudden rise in the level of perceived interdependence among people in an organization, or about a rise in the level of interdependence for people in their place of business or between groups of people in their place of business. Results showed that a rise in perceived interdependence increased generosity with a stranger from 22 percent to 60 percent. However, this effect did not extend beyond the individual, with no further increases in giving seen between strangers, between friends, or between employer and employees. Experiment 1B tested reciprocity using five versions of a computerized ball-tossing game called \"Bubbles.\" As predicted, a rise in interdependence increased reciprocity in Experiment 1B's nonsocial versions of Bubbles (in which players did not interact with others), but it did not significantly affect the prosocial version of the game in which interaction among players was required. We suggest that the increase in interdependence could have led people to view others as not very reliable, which might have interfered with their ability to identify social reciprocity as a rewarding behavior. Experiment 2A examined the causal effect of a rise in the level of interdependence across five versions of the Bubbles game, 392 participants read a newspaper story about a sudden increase in interdependence, and the result showed a large, significant increase in interdependence (an increase in giving to a stranger from 22 percent to 60 percent) in a game design where individuals play against each other. Results also indicate that this increase in interdependence did not spread between friends, as giving between strangers significantly increased, but other players did not reciprocate by sharing more balls. Experiment 2B tested reciprocity in a version of the Bubbles game that facilitated reciprocity through a computer that automatically rewarded cooperative behavior. For this version of the Bubbles game, 87 participants read a newspaper story describing an unanticipated increase in the level of interdependence for people in an organization; this rose from 20 percent to 77 percent. Despite a large, significant increase in giving to a stranger, the level of reciprocity remained at the pretest level, even in a game design that facilitated reciprocity. These results imply that an increase in the level of interdependence does not automatically translate into an increase in the level of reciprocity. Experiment 3 found a rise in interdependence to be similarly potent at the small group level as at the large organization level tested in Experiment 1, using three games. Results consistently showed that an increase in perceived interdependence (an increase of the level of giving from 11 percent to 35 percent) led to a significantly increased level of generosity within a group, regardless of whether the group was composed of friends, strangers, or coworkers. Experiment 4 found that an increase in interdependence facilitated the sharing of both physical objects and emotions across five versions of the Bubbles game. In general, sharing among friends and between participants in a high-interdependence group was significantly more frequent, but more significantly, a single increase in interdependence resulted in a significantly higher level of physical sharing and emotional sharing for groups composed of strangers as well as friends; that is, an increase in the level of interdependence generally increased the giving behavior of groups that were perceived as not particularly social with one another. In this experiment, we also found that participants' beliefs about giving behavior in a group\u2014that is their perceptions of the normative environment\u2014were significantly affected by our manipulations and influenced their subsequent behavior. Experiment 5 found that a rise in interdependence led to higher, significantly more frequent level of prosocial behavior in the ball-tossing game, regardless of whether the interdependence was with an acquaintance or a stranger. Experiment 5 also showed a shift in social norms, both in that the level of prosocial behavior increased and in that participants perceived their group as more social.", "On Tuesday, June 22, 1982, Delta Air Lines Flight 191 bound for Los Angeles from Kennedy International Airport crashed into a townhouse complex soon after taking off.

It was named by the man who, in an age when few families were so small, kept a house of such size that it was filled, and yet he felt his family could not be filled, and hence it belonged to Cedar Grove.\nThe railroads brought not only the first white settlers, but also a general merchant, a doctor, and 22 children. The population grew from 54 souls in 1849, to 553 in 1850. The town was built on 960 acres, and was so called because the railroad crossed a deep gorge, and built, as it went up the mountain, 5 different stone arched bridges. Cedar Grove had the distinction of being the second largest village in Greene County after Xenia. However, in 1851 the railroad moved to the flats at Xenia, and the bridge at Cedar Grove was taken down. The village lost trade, the hotel went into bankruptcy, and people moved away. Cedar Grove was incorporated in 1867, but its population never again reached 500.\nAt one time or another, a church building stood on any one or more of the three plots of ground belonging to the church and graveyard in Cedar Grove. The present brick structure dates from the late 1800s. The present basement structure is believed to have been the original church, and the bell is from the original 1800s church building.\nThe first ministers were Rev. John Dewhurst, Thomas L. Parsons, and Rev. John H. Roper. The first ordained minister, Rev. Roper, was called from the Methodist church to serve the Presbyterian church in 1820.\nThe second minister, Rev. Thomas L. Parsons, was the son of John E Parsons. He was born in 1808, and was educated in the public schools of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati College of Eclectic Medicine. He married Catherine R. Wickland, and her father gave the land on which the family cemetery, located off Riverside Drive, is now sited. Parson's practice was in the line of homoeopathy. He died in about 1886, at age 76. He married Harriet E. Shilling in 1836, and they had 5 children; of these only two survived them both.\nThomas Roper Parsons was a doctor here. In 1830, the railroad was built to Cedar Grove. The town was named for the thick cedar woods found there.  Most of the settlers came in 1833, and 2 years later the railroad to Cedar Grove was completed. Parsons' father was a physician, who moved to Cedar Grove when it was just a village of 40 houses.\nIn 1863, Rev. Parson was called to the Presbyterian Church in Carnegie, NY. In 1886, shortly before his death, he founded and was president of the Youngstown Medical College.\nRev. Dewhurst was born in Massachusetts in 1799 and died in Cedar Grove in 1852. From 1814-34 he was principal of the Wadsworth Literary and Eclectic Institute in Medina.\nJohn McIntyre was born in Cedar Grove, Greene County, OH, and died in Uniontown, PA in 1838. His wife was Barbara, she was from Pennsylvania, and she died in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The funeral notice and obituary read, \"The deceased was born September 26, 1797, and therefore was ninety-one years, seven months and twenty-seven days old at the time of his death.\"\nThomas Owen was the son of William and Mary Owen. He was born in Newberry, Maryland in 1764, and the family migrated to South Carolina shortly afterwards.\nThe family moved to Fairfield County, VA in 1790.\nJohn McIntyre married Nancy M. Shannon. They are both buried in the Cedar Grove cemetery.\nJuly 2000 J.W.C.", "News media, advertising and marketers, and publishers themselves need to rethink how consumers are being served on all screens. What can they do?\nIt\u2019s time to kill the \u201cdigital\u201d\nThe Media Online | 10 February 2012\nWhenever someone starts talking about the digital world, you can be sure they are going to be wrong.\nTo be fair, the word has never had a fixed definition, so it\u2019s difficult to be very precise in what you mean by it. And some argue that it\u2019s necessary to have a wide definition to describe a new era that is being shaped by innovative technological developments.\nBut that means the word tends to be used vaguely to describe any aspect of the Internet, or any kind of innovative new business model. And it makes it difficult to say what digital is doing that makes it more interesting or exciting than the past.\nI\u2019ve used the word myself, but only where it\u2019s used in the historical sense. It was useful to describe the birth of the Net, in the 1980s and 1990s. Digital was the right word for a different and revolutionary kind of information environment, which did have a new business model.\nBut now that we\u2019ve had digital for a couple of decades, it\u2019s time to start using a new word.\nThis weekend, I saw a tweet from Chris Marr of Time Inc UK. He wrote: \u201cWas on a panel this lunchtime debating the importance of a \u2018digital media company\u2019 and, of course, the \u2018digital sector\u2019 as labels for new companies. Time to kill the \u2018digital\u2019?\u201d\nI agree. It\u2019s time for new words to reflect the new era.\nIn fact, it makes it harder to talk about publishing if we don\u2019t have a new term, because at least the word publishing is still precise enough to describe what you do (if slightly too often, in the digital era). And we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the value of precision, especially when marketing, branding, and repositioning are at stake.\nBeyond the words, though, this is a bigger idea. And it makes sense to look at the broader issues it raises.\nIn a new era, publishers (and advertisers and media organisations) will be defined by the audience they serve, rather than any technical, business, or even journalistic innovation. That audience is not digital. It is the \u201cglobal citizen,\u201d as John Paton of Digital First Media calls it.\nThe key will be to design products and offerings that put the audience first. It would be nice if that meant it made no difference that \u201cglobal citizen\u201d gets its content as much or as little from a \u201cdigital\u201d desktop device as from a phone or a tablet. But publishers need to put the \u201cglobal citizen\u201d first, not the technology we\u2019re using to meet them.\nPublishers and advertisers need to stop being divided by \u201cdigital versus broadcast\u201d thinking or a \u201cdigital versus digital\u201d fight, because in the global citizen\u2019s mind, we\u2019re already one big digital world.\nThat means thinking about the global citizen rather than the devices they use, with the big media companies serving global citizens rather than platforms. That means new approaches to how consumers are measured, how business is structured, and how media brands are designed, built, and marketed.\n\u201cDigital\u201d is a word that has outlived its usefulness. It is not a new era.\nPREV Why the Internet is not a new medium NEXT New Yorker publisher to retire in 2013", "This summary was created to help you make sense of the bestselling book Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action, written by Simon Sinek.\nThis book summary is organized into sections for your convenience, so you can quickly take what you need.\nThe book introduces us to Simon Sinek, a well-known author and motivational speaker who has worked with leaders in business, and the military. In this book, he argues that leaders can't be successful, if they start with \"what\" instead of \"why.\" Sinek gives examples of companies\u2014from Apple to the Wright Brothers\u2014that had been wildly successful for starting with why. His point is that every organization he has studied is doing exactly the same thing, whether a nonprofit, a small business, a multi-billion-dollar company, a religious organization, a government agency or a military unit, they all start with their why.\nIn this book, you will learn the importance of your WHY in every way you can think of.\nLEARN THE SECRET OF WHY THE RIGHT WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY\nSimon Sinek helps leaders find the right way to inspire their employees to do their best. In business, politics, or the military, people start with \"why\" and they are inspired to act. He believes that if leaders were to start with their \"why\" and inspire their employees, they will be much more motivated, and the organization will be much more successful.\nSinek shows us that any organization, whether it's a small company, a nonprofit, a big company or a government agency, needs its people to be motivated and inspired. But to accomplish that goal, leaders need to remember that great leaders lead with their WHY.\nSinek believes companies have already found answers and solutions to many problems, but they may be unsure of their WHY, and therefore lost in the WHAT. People need to know WHY you do what you do. What is the purpose of your organization? WHY do you want to be outstanding? WHY do you want to make a difference? WHY?\nSinek believes the world will only be a better place, if the people working for you understand your WHY, and follow your lead with WHAT they do.\nSinek believes leaders need to look outside of themselves and learn from the people around them. He uses the following examples:\nA great military unit is not made up of people who are the best at what they do, but rather people who believe in each other, and believe that what they are doing matters. Therefore, people do whatever they need to do to accomplish the job, if necessary, even if it means the sacrifice of themselves.\nA great nonprofit organization is not run by people who want to help people. Rather, the people involved want to help their cause. For example a firefighter does not necessarily want to be a firefighter to help people. Rather, the firefighter wants to join the fire department to fight fires.\nA great company is not run by people who enjoy selling things, but rather by people who like the cause of the company, and will do anything to help them realize that cause. For example, people in a company do not join the company to sell bicycles. Rather, they want to help people realize their dreams of riding a bicycle.\nHOW GREAT LEADERS INSPIRE GREATNESS IN OTHERS\nThe point that Sinek repeatedly emphasizes is that the WHY comes before the HOW or your WHAT. Great leaders start with their WHY, and great organizations start with their WHY. In business, this means that once you know your WHY, it will be natural to ask yourself, \"How do I do it?\" and \"How do I measure it?\"\nLEARNING YOUR WHY\nSinek advises that before you can start a business, or start the process of discovering the best in you, you first need to ask yourself these questions about your WHY?\nWhy are you doing what you're doing?\nWhat do you want the world to look like?\nWhich people do you feel best about serving?\nWhy are you being of service to them?\nAsking yourself these questions is the very first thing you should do if you need clarity and guidance, if you need to do something better or if you simply have a question about how to do it.\nSinek gives an example, if you work in a cubicle, and you're unhappy with what you're doing and where you are. Or for example, if you're a nonprofit organization that's doing good work in the world, and it'", "The SIP correction at 46 CFR 155.1153(a)(1)(i) was not effective because it did not fully correct an error in the table designation in the rule listing.\nACTION: The Coast Guard is correcting the omission of the designation to read 33 CFR part 155, \"Dangerous Cargoes (33 CFR part 155).\"\nDATES: This correction is effective November 11, 2005.\nSOURCES: The Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700'Washington, DC 20408, via Internet at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html, mail at 800 North Capitol, NW., Suite 700; Washington, DC 20408; or fax at 202-512-1544.", "How could newspaper publishers possibly increase advertising revenue during a recession? That\u2019s the challenge being faced by the industry, according to a new report in paidContent, which suggests that companies could generate more sales during economic downturns\nby focusing on their most valuable customers.\nWhen budgets get tighter, publishers have to shift their focus to retaining their most valuable advertisers, argues the article. By using targeted offers to maintain these relationships, publishers can protect themselves against losing advertising revenue in these difficult times.\n\u201cPublishers should focus on their super-high spending advertisers during the recession,\u201d says the article\u2019s author, John Burke of MediaLink. Burke highlights companies such as Ford and HP as typical super-high spenders. When super-high spenders were cut back during downturns in sales, a decline in revenue could be seen. By concentrating on these companies during bad times, publishers can help minimise this revenue loss.\nThe advice in the article is based on the premise that media and marketing budgets increase in good times - meaning that there is great potential for advertisers with good times approaching to increase their marketing spend. With advertisers making better returns on their investments during times of growth, businesses such as those mentioned above are especially likely to invest more in marketing during the recession.\nHowever, with advertisers becoming more selective on where they spend their money, publishers are likely to lose businesses in addition to the ones mentioned above.\nThere are ways for publishers to try to protect themselves, according to the article. MediaLink outlined several opportunities for publishing companies, including:\n\u2022 Keeping focus on value\n\u2022 Increasing the number of campaigns advertisers ran\n\u2022 Shifting budgets towards mobile advertising\n\u2022 Focusing on cross media\n\u2022 Using third-party verification of advertising\u2019s effectiveness\nDespite the importance of this advice, the article points to publishers\u2019 reluctance for taking action on new media platforms. \u201cPublishers don't do new media because they don't have faith in the industry,\u201d says Burke.\n\u201cA year ago, nobody knew what [ad revenue] would look like this year.

According to MAGNA Intelligence\u2019s \u201cUS Digital Advertising Forecast and Outlook 2017-2022,\u201d connected consumers spend more than 22.71% of their total media consumption time on mobile devices.\nTo deliver on this demand from consumers, publishers are exploring monetization opportunities beyond traditional display advertising. MAGNA forecasts that mobile video advertising could account for 50% of the US market by 2022\u2013\u2013an increase from around 40% in 2017. Consumer demand for on-the-go content is expected to be driven by an increasingly time-starved and multi-tasking mobile consumer population, with 22.37% spending 10% or more of their total screen time on mobile devices. As a result, mobile adoption among the under-18 population has doubled from 68% in 2015 to 93% in 2018.\nBut publishers also have a responsibility to ensure mobile content remains valuable, even if consumers are not physically sitting in front of a screen. The challenge is that today\u2019s connected consumers may demand content, but don\u2019t often have the time to physically tune in.\nTo meet the needs of today\u2019s connected consumer, which still craves convenience, publishers may need to add other channels to their content distribution mix to ensure the content they offer consumers aligns with their preferred delivery method and can be consumed whenever and wherever they prefer.\nTaking Control of Data, Delivering Personalized Ads\nBy Emily Mendelsohn, Mike Nolan and Tushar Ved\nThe rise of data collection and the ability to target and deliver personalized messages to users have led to a significant increase in revenue for publishers, marketers, and ad networks across the digital advertising industry.\nThe IAB\u2019s \u201cData Transparency and Consumer Control,\u201d a white paper released in July 2018, found that the mobile advertising ecosystem has been collecting the data necessary to deliver custom audiences and advanced creatives since 2012. As publishers and advertisers build personalized audiences from their own data, they can expand their addressable audience options to include those created from data partners and competitors.\nThe mobile advertising ecosystem now has more than a decade of experience in consumer data handling and management, helping to bring about a level of understanding, mature decision-making, and transparency in data collection. This experience, in turn, lends credence to the fact that advertising in general has a positive impact as it allows people and brands to share and transact with one another.\nPublishers and advertisers alike can find ways to take advantage of all this data, while also taking the appropriate measures, along with industry peers, to protect that data. Doing so will help build trust and confidence so that consumers can continue to benefit from the personalization provided by mobile advertising.\n\u201cMobile advertising is a major part of the digital advertising ecosystem,\u201d reads the IAB Data Transparency and Consumer Control white paper. \u201cCollectively, it is one of the largest consumer marketing platforms ever created, a critical driver of consumer choice, and an important contributor to America\u2019s economy.\u201d\nMobile Marketing Reaches 167.8 Million U.S. Consumers\nBy Brian Kuhn, Josh Zimmerman and Annie Lopez\nWhile mobile video may be seeing an increase, so are mobile-only users.

By not tailoring each campaign for both devices equally, mobile advertisers risk missing out on the 30% of consumers who primarily access", "The New York Times had a few months of discomfort before the\npublic started to notice a problem: how to identify its digital content\nfor print and online readers--and make it clear, from the start, all the\ndigital enhancements that accompany the paper's news stories.\nMost significant among the technology that is helping publishers\nto integrate print and online with an increasingly powerful brand\nidentity was the New York Times' recent switch to a design approach\nknown, simply, as the Times Square. It involves everything from page\ndesign, to an expanded masthead, to increased attention to headlines,\ncolors, photos, and fonts.\nAnd the Times decided to do away with the long-time practice of\nprinting the day's paper with the same front-page typeface (Dekko,\nfrom Zuzana Licko of Emigre) across both the digital and the print\n(print subscribers, it must be noted, have always gotten the best\ntypeface, while online readers typically have had to settle for\nComic sans).\nThe Times chose a much more \"legible\" face, and one that seemed\ndesigned for print first, then for the web second. The goal,\npresumably, is to have that typeface be easily recognizable as\n\"newspaper type\" to both print readers and web consumers.\nToday\u2019s New York Times front page (pictured here)--the\ndesigners and developers of the interactive edition of the paper\nare still tinkering--is a bit of a visual mixed bag: it's heavy\non type as a visual motif, but light on photography. There are, for\ninstance, two big ads running in the newspaper, while the online\nversion has one less, presumably in exchange for an extra ad in the\nNew York Times on the Road to One-Font Nirvana (http://www.nytimes.\ncom/yr/mo/day/news/national/20070625/0/1.2819994.rm.html?\nscp=1&sq=New%20York%20Times&st=nyt)\nWhat is clear, however, is that the switch to the Times Square\ndesign means more than typeface, though it means that. It means\nthat designers and developers have an opportunity to tell online\nreaders in a new way that they can learn and browse on the web,\nand that the experience will be more like reading the print paper,\nnot just the web.\nAside from the new web interface, the Times' digital news\nstories are enhanced with a number of features (thanks to\nTimes developer Jeff Mick for his clarified notes explaining how it\nall works). First among these features is a graphic that is\ndisplayed when the web page first loads. While perhaps not the\ngreatest feature from a user-experience standpoint (readers might\nwant to browse the headlines before they load the full story), it\nis an easy way for designers to indicate to users that the Times is\ntrying new interfaces and features. Once you're into the actual story,\nyou're greeted with additional features like the \"Times Topics\"\nsidebar and boxed text features. For example, the sidebar on the\nleft-hand side of the New York Times homepage lists topics like\n\"Crime,\" \"New York City Politics,\" \"Environment\" and \"Health Care\"\n(an interesting link, given the recent political debate). The top\nstory on the page has a red box framing the text, with a related\nfeature at the bottom of the page.\nWhat's also interesting is how the Times highlights related\ncontent from its site. For example, you can see a \"related topics\"\nbox for the story on the CIA leak (\"A Special Prosecutor is Sought in the\nCritical Revelation of a C.I.A. Spy\" 6/25/2007). You can also see\nrelated content in the \"Times Topics\" boxes on the left.\nThere are many other design elements that have received\nincreasing praise in recent months, but which were not necessarily\nrevolutionary, but instead just good ideas implemented better. The\nuse of color and white space and attention to the \"eyebrow\nheight\"--as the NYT calls it--in online fonts and headlines, are\nsome of the best examples (see also this article, on the\n\"freshness\" of the design).\nAs the Times notes, \"In terms of design, the new site tries to", "\"Aggregate, and personal, health risks are the focus of new approaches to advertising, which may be more ethically questionable,\" writes Mike Hyman, CEO, Media Initiatives Holding Co.\n\"The first step in the process involves the development of a new model\nof media, which must evolve to embrace the emerging environment.\nIt should be a value-added approach to the traditional process that\nhas been a backbone in the media market for decades. By applying\nthis model, there is opportunity to create and promote media\nappropriate to the needs and wants of the customers.\n\"This value-added model is the way forward as media adapt to\nthis new, challenging, and evolving environment.

EXTRA: MIHC: Media Initiatives Holding Co\n_Ad Age_ (09/08/08; T.M.R.)\nThe New Ad Model's Goal: To Create 'Customers for Life'\nBy Andrew McMains\nToday's conventional advertising model is focused on pushing\nmessages and products. But the new ad model is focused on\nbuilding trust and a relationship with consumers over time. Think\nof a brand like IBM, which has been investing heavily to create a\ncustomer-centric organization. It not only sells a product to\nconsumers, but also provides services, consulting and technical\nsupport related to its products over the long term.\nThe new approach will rely heavily on data collection in order to\nprovide a more targeted, customized and individualized pitch.\nBy understanding people's needs and wants, companies can better\nsatisfy them and build better relationships for the long run. In\ndoing so, they can reduce their reliance on conventional marketing\nspending. This data-based approach will be driven not just by\nmarketers, but also by technologists, designers and other types of\ninteractives in the design thinking process behind the product.\nThis customer-centric approach is the best way to build lifetime\ncustomers. After all, it is a lot easier to retain an existing\ncustomer than it is to acquire a new one.\nClients will be able to better understand the \"customer\nlifecycle\" that goes into creating a purchase. This might sound\nlike science fiction, but it's not that hard to understand. Think\nof this as a process that includes four stages.\n__First is acquisition. Companies will have to determine the\ncost and methods of acquiring a customer when they first encounter a\nconsumer. For example, acquisition could happen when a consumer gets\nan e-mail from a brand marketing it. This individual is a potential\ncustomer and now becomes a lead. From here, a company will have to\nfind a way to convert this lead into an actual customer.\n__Second is cultivation. Now that you've acquired a lead, you have\nto turn this prospect into a customer through a personalized\nmessage that creates a relationship between the new customer and\nthe company. It's the first step in building a lifetime relationship\nbetween the buyer and the brand. From here, the buyer becomes a\n__Third is nurturing. This phase is built on the strong\nrelationship that was established during the cultivation stage. In\nthis phase, the brand will use creative techniques to build a\nstronger emotional connection with the consumer over a longer term.\nIt's all about creating a relationship over the long term, which\nisn't what marketers are traditionally used to doing.\n_Last is retention. After the acquisition, cultivation and nurturing\nstages, it's important to keep customers happy.___This approach\nto marketing can be especially effective for high-end products that\nrequire consumers to experience and fall in love with the product\nbefore they would have bought it. For high-end products like jewelry\nor luxury cars, it's in the company's best interest to spend money\non the relationship-building stage and keep these customers satisfied\nfor their lifetime. The same kind of thinking can be applied to\nB2B products and services where building long-term customer\nrelationships can be just as valuable, if not more valuable, as\nhaving a big sale to a new customer", "A former student has been given permission to return to the college campus.

The proposed rules would amend the list of radio stations that can be shared among the public and non-public interests in a given local market; modify the cap on the total number of commercial radio stations that a single entity can own in a local market; and modify the cap on the number of FM radio stations that can be held by a single entity in a local market. The agency has also released a report and an FCC filing analyzing these regulations and their impact on the public interest.\nThe FCC adopted final rules in 2008 for Part 54 (Federal Communications Commission, \u201cFCC\u2019s Inquiry into the Rules Governing Broadcast Ownership, Financing, and Attribution,\u201d MM Docket 06-121, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 23 FCC Rcd 22807 (2008)). This update seeks to further amend those rules and, in particular, to revise the definition of a \u201cmarket\u201d and the cap on the number of commercial stations that one entity can own in a single local market.\nWithout a formal notice of proposed rule making, the FCC has decided to implement the rules as adopted in 2008 without going through a rule making process. This approach is uncommon and was taken, in part, the Commission said, for its \u201cmore certain regulatory path in the near term\u201d to the goal of a more effective broadcast station ownership regulation.\nSpecifically, the Commission has updated the methodology underlying the definition of local market for the purpose of calculating the market limits on the number of stations that any one ownership entity can control locally. The FCC also revised the population criteria used to define the \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d markets that receive the 50% and 10% attribution rules. Finally, the proposed rules include a definition of commercial audio broadcast station.\nThe FCC\u2019s proposal provides the following modifications to the broadcast ownership rules:\nUpdating the 50 Mile Local Market Radius Rule. In the 2008 Order, the Commission determined that the 50 Mile Local Market Radius Rule should be updated to allow more market adjustment in certain markets. The Commission has now determined that the 50 Mile Radius Rule should be adjusted to account for local radio markets with a population of fewer than 15 thousand persons that are located in the top 50 most populated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (\u201cMSA\u201d) or in 132 smaller markets. Under these updated guidelines, broadcast station ownership within the modified 50 mile range for an individual station in a non-rural area will be calculated using the local population of the station\u2019s primary service area, without regard to its designation as urban or rural.\nProposed Modification to the 15 km Local Radio Markets In Area Limits. In the 2008 Order, the Commission determined that the 15 km Community of Interests (\u201cCOI\u201d) rule should be updated to account for local radio markets in urban and rural areas. In the MMOC Notice, the Commission seeks to modify this rule by adjusting the 15 kilometer COI for the metropolitan areas that it identified in the 2008 Order.\nUpdating the Population Criteria under the 50% Attribution Rule. In the 2008 Order, the Commission determined that the 50% Attribution Rule needed to be updated to allow for local adjustments when there is limited competition. The proposed rule now requires that stations meeting the population criteria under this rule for either the \u201csmall market\u201d or \u201csmaller market\u201d designation may be included in the attribution total only where \u201clocal\u201d audiences, as defined in Section 73.3526(a)(1), as amended in the Report and Order in MMOC do not have to travel more than 15 miles in order to receive local service.\nSetting Population Criteria under the 10% Attribution Rule. In the 2008 Order, the Commission determined that the 10% Attribution Rule needed to be updated to allow for local adjustments when there is limited competition. The proposed rule now sets the population criteria under Section 73.3533(a)(ii) for the \u201csmall market\u201d or \u201csmaller market\u201d designation at", "A 12/23/97, 1:44-1:49am telecast of the\nTonight Show  1/6/94, hosted by Jay Leno, consisted\nprimarily of a re-run, with a brief opening segment.\nDuring the 3 minute segment, the hosts used the\nF word 9 times, repeatedly.

The first guest appeared at\napproximately 1:53 [53] A.M.  This is Leno's\nstandard introduction to guests and there was nothing\nnoteworthy about it.  The segment,  which was\nintroduced to viewers as 'Tonight\"'s 11:45pm\nshow was nothing more than a re-run of the 1/6/94\nshow which the guests had appeared on originally,\nand of which the band had played its 16\ninstrumental versions of \"Auld Lang Syne\nover the opening credits.\nThe segment, with Leno's guests went on for\njust under a minute,  with the cymbal player, who\nwas the  band's leader,  still playing his\ncymbals very slowly  in time with the \"Auld\nLang Syne\" music.  This continued through the\nsong's 16 renditions.\nLeno's guests commented on the music and the\nband did not comment on the  guests themselves\nexcept for an off-camera voice asking the lead\ncyambal player, \"Were you at rehearsal?\", which  got\na chuckle from Leno's band.\nThere were 16 instrumental renditions of \"Auld\nLang Syne\" during the opening, which aired for\njust under a minute during the segment and for\n3 minutes of the 1/6/94 original show.

It was named for the ship that John Jacob Astor sent to the region to find the mythical \"Columbia River,\" supposedly in the Oregon Territory of 1812. Today, Astoria is known as a popular tourist destination on the western shore of the Lower Columbia River. It has a wonderful working harbor, and the oldest Fort in the Country that sits on a windswept bluff offering the best view of the river. Its people are friendly, quirky, artistic, open-spirited and often witty. They have a penchant for history and humor. Many of its citizens work at The Museum at Fort Stevens, the U.S. Coast Guard, Fort Stevens State Park, Warrenton, and Astoria, the School District. The Astorian works hard and plays harder. The city is the 17th largest city in Oregon, and third largest in Clatsop County behind Seaside and Warrenton. Over the past ten years, this former logging town has prospered economically and the population has increased to over 10,000 people by 2014.\nIn recent years, the area has changed in many of its aspects. However, the harbor has been the same and always changing and adapting to what happens when nature decides to make modifications in your life. And the Astoria/Warrenton area has been shaped by its working waterfront, but over the years its identity has grown into being a regional arts center and a tourist attraction.\nIn the summer of 1994, I had a choice to make. I was offered a position teaching at The Museum School in Portland. A few moments later, my husband, Bob, who was a professor at Oregon State University and Portland State University, said he would be open to moving here. I said, \"Do you really like Astoria?\" He said yes, with confidence. Well, I was just a bit hesitant, because there was hardly any history of Astoria in Portland.\nForty-five long years had passed since Astoria had been linked to the Willamette Valley by the Astoria-Megler Bridge and the Columbia River Highway. The Columbia Highway (now the Pacific Coast Highway) was originally constructed between 1912 and 1914. It was the first highway to link the Pacific Ocean to the Cascade Mountain Range. This stretch of highway between Portland and the Columbia River Gorge has made history as one of the first all-American byways, and the third byway in the USA to receive International Historic Monument designation (after the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Smoky Mountain Parkway) in 1986. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Scenic Byway.\nFort Stevens and Fort George, both of which are open to the public, are both on the National Register of Historic Places and are accessible year round. The Astoria Column has been here since 1926 commemorating and honoring the memory of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of discovery and the opening of trade with the Pacific Northwest.\nThe Museum of the City of Astoria has on permanent exhibit many great examples of Astoria and the history of the area, including, but not limited to, Lewis and Clark, the Coast Guard, the Native Americans, the Chinese immigrants, the fishing industry, the arts, and the famous and infamous people of the area. It is a must-see attraction when making a visit to Astoria.

(Comcast) from 198.107.0.0\nto 198.108.200.0 in order to accommodate a change in the\nconfiguration of Comcast's IP address space.\nComcast and its partners are presently in the process of migrating\nComcast users from its previous IP address configuration, which was\n198.X.X.112 (X = a range from 0 to n) to its new IP address\ncombination, which is 198.X.X.X.x (X = any value from 0 to n).  The\nchange from 198.X.X.112 to 198.X.X.X.x is due to the exhaustion of\nthe /112 address block that was previously used to address all\nComcast users.\nA full description of what IP addresses are, and how they function\nin the Internet, can be found in RFC 791, the \"Internet Protocol\n(\"IP\").\"  The Internet Protocol is a transport protocol designed\nto efficiently move data packets between users on the\ninternet.  Each IP datagram consists of three elements, each of\nwhich is identified by its own field.  The first element is\nthe IP address of the source of the packet.  The second element\nis the IP address of the intended final destination of the\npacket.  The third is the IP header information, which is\nvariable in length.  The IP header fields identify the protocol\nto be run, the length of the packet, and other data relevant to\nthe transport.  The IP header is encapsulated within the datagram\ndata itself, so that it is not part of the information to be\ntransported.  RFC 791 defines and explains the function of the IP\naddress and gives a sample IP packet.  A more complete\ndefinition of the protocols and the packet format can be found\nin RFC 793, which is a general description of TCP/IP protocols.\nThe Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has recently released RFC 1178\nwith the title \"IAB Recommendations for the Use of IP Address\nBlocks in Routing.\"  This document is a followup to a workshop held\nin 1990 during which the problems in allocating and assigning IP\naddresses in the Internet and other internets were discussed.  For\npractical reasons, the document recommends that sites not change\ntheir IP address space unless it is necessary.  It cautions that,\n\"any change in the IP address distribution should be taken by\nsystems administrators only after full agreement with the site's\ndomain manager.\"  The document recommends that sites have the\npractice of redefining their IP address space whenever a change in\nthe organizational structure of the company occurs, which is a\nmuch faster process than is required in the assignment of new\naddresses by Network Information Center (NIC), (for details, see\nBGP).\nThis document is being submitted following a discussion between\nthe two companies involved in the migration to the new IP\naddress configuration.  The current IP address configuration of\nComcast is 198.X.X.0-198.X.X.254 (X = a range of numbers), which has\nbeen in use since the company has been online.  Previously,\nComcast's partner, AT&T, allocated addresses in this block from X\n= 0 to X = 254.  In the new configuration the addresses are 198.X.X.X,\nwhere X = any number from 0-254.\nDuring the last year, AT&T has begun a process of allocating\nlarge number blocks to Comcast in order to meet the requirements\nof the IAB and to relieve themselves of the burden of IP address\nmanagement.  When finished, Comcast's entire internal address\nspace would consist of 198.194.X.X with no exceptions.  For\noperational reasons described below, AT&T has asked Comcast to\nreclassify all of its sites to the new IP address space.  Comcast\nagree that this is an extremely large transition, and a\nproportionally large effort for any company to undertake.  It\ndoes, however, offer some practical advantages and is mandatory\nfor Comcast under its agreement with AT&T.

The reality is that a successful brand-building strategy is based on the quality of the company's management, the company's product or service quality, and the price of the product. When you understand these, you will be positioned to build a valuable brand.\nCompetitive advantage is based on two things: product pricing and marketing budget distribution. The first is to charge a premium price while maintaining a product or service quality that is unmatched in your marketplace. The second is to develop a quality product that the customer will perceive as having quality and value.\nThe cost advantage allows your firm to offer its product at a lower cost than the competition. You will then have the opportunity to pass on those savings as lower prices to the customers.

WD-40 has historically focused on industrial markets and has only recently turned up its social media, PR and branding game.\nThe brand recently launched a marketing campaign that gives consumers a place to record and share their many uses for the product in funny videos, and then share on sites like YouTube. WD-40 claims that there are more than 2,300 of these videos posted.\nThe WD-40 Company launched its \u201cGet Juiced\u201d campaign to celebrate its rich heritage of over sixty years. The product was first developed by Dr. Norm Larsen, who was a scientist for the naval shipyards who was tasked with lubricating machinery with an unlimited amount of water, making the idea of a single can of lubricant unthinkable.\nWD-40 claims that the average person has heard of its product more than 14,400 times and that it can even be used as a toilet bowl lubricant. But instead of spending large amounts of money on advertising, WD-40 has used word of mouth and social media to spread the message.\nWD-40 uses a social media fan base called \u201cTeam WD 40\u201d to promote the product, which consists of 150,000 people who are given a code to join for free. The company asks that Team WD40 recruit as many other people online that they can, who would then be tasked with sending a special URL to recruit another three or four friends and family members. Members are also given access to a special code that gets them a free sample of the product. There are 272,000 Facebook fans of the product as well.\nThe product\u2019s latest marketing message is aimed almost exclusively at sharing a sense of humor and getting people from around the country and around the world to laugh at the brand. WD-40 claims of its advertising \u201cthat we\u2019re still old school, but we\u2019re trying to find new ways to tell the stories of our old school. We are starting more and more of everything, we are embracing social and digital.\u201d\nWD-40\u2019s vice president of marketing Tod Swormstedt told the San Diego Business Journal in an email: \u201cGet Juiced is an engaging way to tell the story of WD-40. It is a social media campaign that provides an opportunity for people to share their use of the product by making a short video and uploading to sites like YouTube or Facebook.\u201d\nAccording to Swormstedt: \u201cWe are trying a number of different ways to engage consumers, we have a marketing budget for digital and social media channels and for more traditional and traditional-looking ads, and a mix of both. Our goal is to provide people with interesting and valuable content that keeps the brand top of mind.\u201d\nPREV How the BBC Can Avoid Getting the Snooker Table Treatment NEXT The New York Times' \"T\" Op-Ed Makes a Risky Bet in a Changin' World", "The paper will be introduced by the head of the journal section. The discussion will be continued for 10\u201330 minutes. One of the speakers can be called upon for a more in-depth discussion. The audience will then be invited to ask questions.\nHead of the journal section: I think it is the role of the head of the journal section to give a more detailed introduction on the chosen topic at the beginning of the discussion. In my opinion, it would be necessary to define the terms used, to provide an overview of the various approaches from a historic perspective, and to describe the most recent advances in research on the topic. However, what is crucial in your opinion? Maybe it would be necessary to explain the difference between the various approaches to research. This is a very specialized field of research. We would have to explain its particularities. I should mention how the research is structured and explain how the topics are treated within the journals\u2019 section in order to be able to have further discussions on the topic during the debate. Finally, I think it is important to emphasize the particular role of each approach for specific purposes.\nPresentation of the first speaker: I am going to talk about some specific aspects of the \u201cnew\u201d research approaches and to discuss how we can best use them to study the topic of choice. I believe you will agree it is necessary to start the discussion with a presentation on the theoretical approach, in this case the \u201cnew\u201d research approaches, and an explanation on how the information gleaned from these methods can be used to shed light on the topic.\nDiscussion of the first speaker, to follow:\nQuestions by the audience: I would like to know if it is also possible to use some of these new approaches to study this topic without being tied to one particular approach and to present different outlooks.\nPresentation of the second speaker: In my view, the key is to take into account the different approaches and to explain how this can lead to further interplays. We all know the importance of interplays and intersections. Some of them are quite crucial when they lead to a \u201csynthesis\u201d of approaches. Of course, I think that the research we do has to focus on one single topic and approach the issue from this point of view. There are no two ways about it. It is simply the wrong approach. We have to define a specific approach and to use it. However, to return to my point above, there is also an interplay between the different approaches. This interplay is an integral part of research. This is not to say the interplay doesn\u2019t exist, but rather that it has to be defined and studied by us. I believe this interplay is crucial.\nDiscussion of second speaker to follow:\nQuestions by the audience: I am very much interested in how you can make a choice of approach among so many? Is there a \u201cbest\u201d choice? Which criteria should be considered?\nPresentation of third speaker: Well, let\u2019s talk about that. The issue of choice goes beyond the \u201cbest\u201d approach. I think it is important to be explicit about the topic. What are we trying to understand? What do we want to do? What do we expect to find? What are our priorities? I believe in any case it is necessary to take into account the strengths and limits of the various approaches. The topic is very important. It is crucial to choose an approach that meets the requirements of the project. To give an example, let\u2019s take a topic such as the impact of colonial domination on the development of democracy. We will have to choose the most suitable approach. How can we know in advance what to use and what not to use? That means that we should examine all the approaches and then decide which one might have the most value for the project. In general, I believe it is an integral part of the research process. The most crucial point is not to forget this fundamental task. I will also address the question of \u201cbest\u201d approach in my lecture.\nDiscussion of third speaker:", "A summary of the weekly newsletter with links to important sites of the week.\nSometimes we make a decision and go through the day knowing we shouldn't have done it. We know we were wrong somehow, that the decision was a bad one, that something should've been different, that we should have handled it one way rather than the other. We feel guilty and ashamed, and maybe we've even apologized, telling the other person we're sorry. But the apology, the admittance of wrongdoing, the contrition\u2014it doesn't help. And maybe if it did, we would've noticed it. We need to be able to fix the problem, to make it right. But our attempts at fixing things don't work. We try and apologize again and again, but it doesn't matter. Our apologies are unsuccessful\u2014they don't take away our guilt and shame. And perhaps the other person is so unhappy they won't forgive us. And after all our apologies, after all our attempts at making it right, the issue remains. But still we have not made it right. We need to do something. The problem exists and persists, and we're stuck with it.\nWhen people ask how to get rid of anger, or deal with an addiction, or learn how to get the other person to forgive us... they make a lot of assumptions about the process, they make a lot of errors. How do I get rid of anger? Well, if someone else is angry and asks you to tell them where to start, it's probably best to first ask how they feel about the other person they are angry with. And then ask them about their anger or addiction. Why is it there, what is it for, what are they looking for? How do they feel about this thing they're stuck with? Perhaps they're looking for a way to unload guilt, perhaps they think about it so much they can't think of anything else. Perhaps they're looking for something they can change or improve or make better or fix. But these are questions that, in my experience, people have a hard time answering. And if we can't answer these questions first, we'll never be able to find our way around and around and around to getting rid of anger, forgiveness, whatever.\nWhen we do something and we want to correct it we don't just woke up one morning and decide what to do to fix it. We know what we did was wrong, we know what we want to correct it. And so it is with addictions: we know what the addiction is and where we want to be. We just need to remember the things that we've forgotten. It's like waking up somewhere and realizing you have no idea where you are, or what town or city you're in. How did I get here? Did someone bring me here? Or did i leave somewhere and drive here? I need to fix the problem, i need to get back, i have to fix this. In any of these cases it's easy to say, \"I need to get rid of addictions.\" But which one specifically? I need to get rid of this one, this one, maybe this one, but which one? How do you get rid of anger? How do you get rid of something in yourself that is there? How do you eliminate a pain? A pain that's there and growing, and what will get rid of it is taking a sledge hammer to the thing that's causing it? What kind of hammer? What's your problem, what's your pain, tell me about it? If i don't know my problem, i won't be able to identify my hammer. Then when i finally do, i'll take the wrong hammer and bludgeon the wrong thing, and there'll be a whole other situation that i can't fix because i missed the first one. And if i don't even know my hammer, my wound, i won't know what's killing me. I won't even know there's something killing me. So it's pretty important to know that at least; where the pain is coming from.\nSo let's talk about pain. We need to remember what pain is. Pain is a sensation that tells us something has happened in the body, or the mind, or the spirit\u2014that we have been hurt, that we have suffered an injury, and that as a result we need to take care of ourselves. It's a sign of something, and the thing that's being signaled is that we cannot put ourselves or our bodies through another moment of the sort that caused that, the sort that has brought us to this point, the point of pain", "A new study says the more time a parent spends with a news site, the less money the parent makes. Is this a sign that news consumption is the cause, not the effect? Or, are the consumers of news simply incapable of thinking beyond the immediate and the urgent, and thus can't be trusted as a reliable source of news? Meanwhile, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal tracking poll shows Donald Trump maintaining substantial, consistent support in 2016 GOP nomination contests. And if you're wondering why there's no such poll for Democrat Hillary Clinton, the answer is quite simple: Trump voters are passionate, and enthusiastic for their candidate, according to the NBC News/WSJ survey. This has some predicting a long and bitter primary race between Democrats, who will fight vicious ad wars about each other, while there are few signs Clinton will be able to take on Trump.\n1. NBC/WSJ SHOWS DONALD TRUMP MANAGES TO CLOSE GOP PREDICTION MARGINS AS HE REMAINS ON HIS MARCH TOWARD CONSENSUS WINNER\nThe release of the long-awaited NBC News/Wall Street Journal tracking poll, with Republican nomination winner results and GOP contenders' levels of enthusiasm, shows that Donald Trump has effectively closed the margins in GOP nominating contests, without seriously boosting the levels of enthusiasm among his supporters.\nTrump holds a clear 12-point lead in NBC News/WSJ polling (he now leads Texas Senator Ted Cruz 42 percent to 30 percent in Iowa, and 42 percent to 24 percent in New Hampshire);\nHe is the only one of his six major opponents who has not fallen 2 percent from where he was a few weeks ago, a sign of consolidation of his voting strength;\nThe only candidate who has suffered the most since the last NBC News/WSJ poll in mid-September is Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who has fallen 12 points and seen his share of the Iowa vote fall nearly in half (from 16 to 9 percent);\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz has benefited from a bit of a surge in enthusiasm (more candidates were positive about him now than were positive then -- from 48 percent to 51 percent) but his support levels are little different than they were more than three months ago, suggesting there is a ceiling and he is not positioned to close the overall gap to Trump.\nRubio and Cruz are competing for establishment Republicans who are wary about the popular brashness of Trump. These findings will probably make Republicans think again about what it will take to stop the Trump juggernaut heading into the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, when Republican voters go first.\n2. HUBBUB OVER HASHTAGS, BUT NOTHING TO SAY FOR NEWSPAPERS\nIf we took to Twitter with our opinions about how we saw the world, we'd be in a mess. This article explains why, using as an example the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag.\nIt shows that our capacity to see any issue in black and white terms, is not compatible with the complexity of the world. And that's why our ability to reason and to think, even to make sense of the events which have led to our need to use hashtags to express our opinions, is so critical in this modern age.\nBut where do you go to find this kind of critical reasoning in news sites? In papers which rely on advertising for revenue, one of the main objectives is to attract a large audience, which of course means taking an \"every man for himself\" position on every story they cover. If you're a newspaper which, for example, reports news of the day from the perspective of a Christian, it means you'll be seen as being biased. If you report from another angle, you'll be accused of being biased in another respect. No single news site can be right by all parties, so the news is always reported based on the perspective of one group, and then it's up to individuals to take in the information and come to their own conclusions. This may explain why, overall, news sources seem to lose followers as readers get more involved in the news and think about what it truly means to them personally.\n3.

Millennials are not simply uninformed. They are manipulated, cynical, and skeptical. However, as they learn how media is produced and manipulated, they become more sophisticated in their media use.\nThis study has profound implications for newspaper media companies' ability to get meaningful audience attention on their content.\nMillennials will never be truly attentive to the long, considered analysis of an in-depth news report. Nor do they have an interest in the nuance and complexity of a long investigative story, especially an ongoing one. They are likely to tune out a TV news report about a convoluted political battle, unless it promises a solution to their daily concerns. Millennials need a news product that is fast and easy and does not require a long mental or visual investment. Such a product would, in fact, have a lot in common with fake news stories.\nIn contrast to fake news, however, millennials are highly alert to the risks of online trolling and fraud. Despite the low trust levels for news in general, they know that the digital world is dangerous.\nIf a newspaper company is able to help its millennial readers learn the lessons of digital media manipulation\u2014of how online and social media are constructed, managed, and manipulated, and what the risks are of engaging with those products\u2014then millennials might be willing to learn news and to pay for it. Otherwise, millennials will never pay news organizations for online content.\nThe millennial approach to media seems counterintuitive. This age group has been raised by parents who had high expectations and emphasis on hard work, learning, and the development of analytical skills. In this sense, millennials are quite intelligent and well-educated. These are people who have been taught to question everything, think critically, and challenge authority. Moreover, most people in this generation seem to have a well-developed sense of social justice and a strong desire to be helpful to others. They seem to have an abundance of good will and selflessness. If millennials are so smart, so analytical, and so good-willed, how come they don't recognize fake news? The answer lies in the reality of their media consumption.\nWhile I am sure millennials can recognize the superficiality created by the production, reporting, and presentation of fake news, most of the time they do not have the skills or the tools to see beyond that superficiality. Millennials are not merely uninformed. They are manipulated and deceived by the media ecosystem surrounding them. Their attention is targeted and they have become addicted to the dopamine (or the buzz) of quick and easy fixes\u2014like the fake news that they click on and then share. In short, millennials are vulnerable targets for the exploitation of their curiosity, their desire to be entertained and to have their social-media bubbles validated, their sense of outrage, and their search for meaning and purpose in their lives.\nBefore I discuss the characteristics of the millennial mind-set that have a corrosive effect on millennials' media literacy, including how the digital world affects their ability to focus, it is important to say something about why and how media literacy became irrelevant.\nIt was the advent of the digital world that fundamentally changed millennials' media literacy and their ability to make sense of information. As a result of this shift, media literacy no longer applies to media. In fact, millennials are, in general, losing their ability to think critically as well as think analytically about what they read and hear. What they need is media education that helps them learn strategies to interpret news and other media and not a media literacy training that allows them to decode text and images. Because of these transformations in the media ecology, many of the lessons that people learn through media education don't apply anymore.\nFake news and trolls have become a ubiquitous part of media life. Millennials are bombarded with social media, mobile gaming, and fake news, which are not simply a result of \"bad\" behavior or lack of skills. They are part of millennials' everyday experience in the digital world. They have become normalized and millennials now have a sense of entitlement and expectation of getting what they want online, particularly from social media platforms.\nMillennials' attentional deficits", "A recent case in New Jersey should be good news for reporters who want to take a picture of a crime scene: an appellate court in Trenton ruled that a police officer was required to provide a copy of a photo he made before a crime scene was disturbed. The officer testified at the trial that he made the photo available after the crime scene was altered with the cooperation of the prosecutor but before the trial started. The Trenton Court of Appeals found that the officer waited too long to provide the trial judge with the photo; the court ruled that there had been an \"intentional deprivation of a material witness statement.\" In this case the police officer also took pictures before the trial that might have contained critical evidence. He is now required to provide those photos to the defense.

The United States has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world, including Stalin's Russia and Mao's China. The U.S. also leads the world in prison populations as a percentage of total population. In 2001, about one percent of the American population was in prison. Today, one in thirty-one is locked up. The prison population doubled in a decade, while the general population grew by one percent. In contrast, both the Soviet Union and the U.S.S.R. were, by 1970, close to maximum incarceration rates. In China, the rate was about one-hundredth of our prison population in 2009.\nBecause the U.S. was also the world's number one exporter of weapons, this is the \"War on Terror\"'s deadliest legacy. The U.S. government has used a state of emergency and the War on Terror as a justification for mass detention without warrants, denials of the accused's constitutional rights, and indefinite detention. After 2002, the incarceration rate for people deemed \"terrorists\" or terrorist sympathizers soared beyond the normal rate of increase, tripling in three years, in spite of their alleged lack of criminal history.\nSix years later, in the wake of the election of the first African-American U.S. President and several days after the death of the founder of al Qaeda, the U.S. imprisoned an additional 104,000 people in 2009\u2014more than ever before\u2014doubling its national prison population in just six years. Meanwhile, the national crime rate continued to drop significantly over the same period. Over half of the increase was due to the imposition of harsh criminal sentences, many of them mandatory minimums, in response to the War on Drugs\u2014fueling an increase even more remarkable because it occurred despite a decrease in crime and in the use of illegal drugs.\nAfter the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, and just after the passage of draconian antiterror legislation, the U.S. government began to use the War on Terror to detain without charges those people it deemed to be terrorists, a small number of which the government deemed sufficiently dangerous to merit the designation of \"enemy combatants\" entitled, it claimed, to a \"war court.\" In 2004, the Bush Administration attempted to extend the U.S. criminal definition of \"material support\" to political speech, including speech that advocates violence. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned most of the administration's expansion of the material support law in _Hamdan v. Rumsfeld_ in June 2006, but by December 2008, the Obama administration had reversed course and reinstated military commissions under similar guidelines.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations both used the threat of enemy combatants to justify the imprisonment as well as the torture of detainees held at Camp X-Ray, Abu Ghraib, and Gitmo.\nIn addition a number of countries have followed the U.S. lead and established detention centers to jail their enemies according to their own standards.\nAt the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba, on the U.S. naval base on the southern tip of Cuba, 228 imprisoned \"enemy combatants\" remain indefinitely detained, in some cases for ten years, charged with nonexistent crimes and denied U.S. constitutional rights. The current administration continues to deny these detainees fair trials; this includes denying that habeas corpus exists as a legal basis for challenging their indefinite detention.\nMeanwhile, as the United States government continues to use the \"War on Terror\" to build a political climate of increasingly heightened fear, its international role has dramatically changed.\nAs the War on Terror has produced the largest prison system in the world, it has created a boom in the private prison industry. As federal prison cells were filled by immigrants with nonviolent \"crimes,\" prisons filled with people like Jose Luis Gomez Castillo, who was sentenced in 2008 to 117 years in a South Carolina prison for the nonviolent offense of having", "The Commission concludes that an ex parte\nmeeting between a Chairman and a Commissioner during a\nperiod of investigation is acceptable for purposes of\ndisclosing the relevant information.

Each Commissioner is charged with\nparticipating in the investigation of a campaign finance matter brought\nbefore the Commission. See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101. Moreover, Commissioners\nare to \"receive the testimony of witnesses and have access to the data,\npapers, or other things required for a proper discharge of our\nduties,\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101. In the particular case at hand, a\nCommissioner was investigating the allegations in a complaint against an\nindependent expenditure committee, and the record suggests that his\ninvestigation of the matter has required him to speak with other\ncommissioners about the complaint, the case, and various aspects of the\nagency's investigation. According to the motion, the Commissioner\nattempted to schedule a meeting with his colleagues in order to\ndiscuss the case, the need for a referral to the enforcement staff for\nalleged Commission violations, and the need to establish the scope for\nthe FEC's investigation into possible improprieties. The memorandum order\ntouts the Commissioner's good faith, and offers this observation:\n[W]hile a Chairman may be more likely to view a meeting\nwith a fellow Commissioner in an ex parte context\nfavorably, a Commissioner may feel the need to\ndisclose that he or she has been summoned for\nex parte purposes -- or the Commissioner may be\nunaware that the meeting was scheduled -- given\nthat there was no vote by the Commission to approve\nthe ex parte meeting.\nComm'r Ackerman's Mot. to Recuse (Feb. 9, 2001) at 2. In other\nwords, the motion asks us to assume that, before calling, the\nChairman did not obtain the unanimous consent of the Commission to\naddress the Commissioner on a matter of ex parte investigation. In the\nCommission's opinion, such a meeting is unlikely to raise any ethical\nconcern. The Federal Election Commission Act requires that \"the\nCommission shall make decisions . . . [f]or investigating,\nreferring, or initiating administrative proceedings[,] by a vote not\nto exceed two-thirds of the number of members of the Commission\nconstituted under section 192. . . .\" 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437c(b)(1)(F).\nAccordingly, there is no legal requirement that ex parte\ninvestigations, which must be authorized by a Commission vote of two-\nthirds, can only occur in meetings called pursuant to the unanimous\nconsent of the Commissioners. Moreover, the fact that the Commissioner\nin the case at hand intended in all likelihood to discuss the pending\nmatter, and not to confer on other business of the Commission, and\nthat he initiated the meeting does not make the ex parte investigation\nimproper or unlawful within the meaning of the Commission's ethics", "Newspaper advertising and marketing executives have always had an innate understanding of the concept of \u201ctime tested truths.\u201d There are a number of them in the marketplace, as outlined below. Unfortunately, some of the time-tested truths are not longer true. But, more important, many of them don't apply anymore. In fact, truth-testing advertising is one of the most challenging duties newspaper marketing, advertising, and, to a lesser degree, publishers have right now.\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING AND MEDIA\nWhat follows is a listing of some of the more prevalent truths about digital media published over the past year.\nFirst, it is a truism that newspaper advertising is dying. True, but not true. It\u2019s certainly not on the demise bed yet even if classified revenues are suffering. Indeed, when it comes to total dollars spent, there appears to be some life left in both print advertising (http://www.mediabuyingindex.com/Blog/newspaper-advertising-stays-afloat-in-2012/) and classified revenue ( http://www.mediabuyingindex.com/Blog/what-happened-to-classifieds-yesterdays-truth-today-is-a-contradiction) in spite of the decline in volume of total ad pages booked.\nSecond, digital isn\u2019t a priority and even a waste of precious monies. True enough, but advertising in a newspaper, not necessarily digital, remains the best way to acquire customers. Average order values are highest in newspaper advertising for a variety of reasons \u2013 from lower cost per sale to longer term brand awareness to less expensive distribution to the ability to control messages with coupons and contests \u2013 than in any other medium. (http://www.mediabuyingindex.com/Blog/digital-buying-is-not-a-priority-but-is-a-waste. These can be found on the MBi\u2019s blog at http://www.mediabuyingindex.com.\nThird, newspapers can generate higher revenue on digital than from print. True, but is that possible to sustain? Probably not. What could work is the notion of shifting advertising from print to digital at premium prices. But that isn\u2019t going to happen to a sufficient degree, particularly to replace the lost classified revenue, any time soon. At best it will be a slower, steady increase, as advertisers realize that print and digital deliver different benefits to an advertiser. But that\u2019s still not the time for a newspaper to stop offering print.\nThe most predominant truth that is circulating online is that social media will make traditional media irrelevant. If it is true, it will take years to see evidence of this transformation, if it is actually true. For example, even when a product or service goes viral online, newspapers can still create a spinoff for it, creating an offline-spin-off effect. Also, newspapers can offer social media as a complementary asset, particularly social communities, which are already being used quite effectively.\nThe time-honored truth is that newspapers are the most effective vehicle in acquiring and retaining customers. This is true in terms of all media, not just television. However, it\u2019s more effective when television and radio don\u2019t dominate the advertising market when print still has space and when the newspaper can get an audience directly from its subscribers. When newspapers were still on subscriber\u2019s doorsteps, they had the greatest impact. But what matters is the message and the delivery of this message to the right audience at the right time to the right person. And how this is done is a big part of the challenge newspapers must now undertake.\nThis is not to say that print is dead and newspapers can\u2019t be printed on glossy, uncoated stocks (http://www.mediabuyingindex.com/Blog/advertising). But it is also not being realistic to suggest that it will always be printed. Newspapers, after all, are now in a competitive era in which print has some limitations and there is more competing out there. For instance, one of the major barriers to local advertisers is a lack of the ability of newspaper advertising to deliver a specific audience \u2013 in other words to target readers for a particular demographic, psychographic, or geographic group of readers who will be receptive to the ad.\nThis has already happened in the case of classified advertising, particularly in", "This proposed rulemaking would require the Department to collect personal information from individuals enrolled in the program so individuals have the opportunity to opt out of having personally identifiable information in the FERS Direct Deposit Program made available to OPM and to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the event of a pay decision dispute. The information will be used to identify individuals to resolve pay decision disputes and will be collected through the electronic Direct Deposit enrollment form. This collection will support our ability to carry out functions consistent with the direction in the Consolidated Financial Services Act of 2009; however, OPM has made a determination that this collection is not subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A-4 to be considered an emergency collection.

Current law allows OPM to provide access to its internal information systems to identify individuals that are involved in potential pay decision disputes. This can be done because OPM holds the information in an electronic system, Federal Employees' Pay and Benefits System (FEPS), which is designed to permit access to information maintained on those systems. The only personally identifiable information that could be accessible in the FERS Direct Deposit Program may be found in the FEPS payroll system. This information can be available to OPM through the FEPS data structure maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service.

I am keenly interested in the\nfactors which shape the news output of the day in the print and\ndigital world.  I want to know who pays for the output, who\nselects and appoints editors, regulates and supervises the output and\nin what sort of fashion.  How are the stories selected, packaged\nand presented for consumers and how is the journalistic process\norganized so that the consumer is supplied with a comprehensible,\ndiverse, and reliable selection of news?\nBesides my personal interest in the process of journalistic\nreporting, I am also keenly interested on a wider level in the\ngrowing importance of news and the changes that take place in the\ndelivery and production of news with the growth of new media and\nnews technologies and the increasing complexity of media law.\nSo it was with great interest that I recently started my journalistic\ncheck up in Germany.\nI was interested to see to what extent the German journalistic\nand publishing scene is ready for the digital age.  And this was\na chance particularly because in Germany, one of the most stable\nand predictable political and media systems in the European Union,\nnothing really changes on a political and legal level.\nThis is an ideal time to take a look at how the media industries\nadapt to the conditions of digitalization, and to see how they work\nout the new structures of the digitalized world.  How are news\ncompanies dealing with increasing uncertainty? What impact can\nnew kinds of competition have on the German news industry, on the\nmedia law and on governmental media policy?\nSince I have experience of the German media market and the German\njournalistic scene, as well as an experience of studying and living\nin the UK, I had to get a first idea and take in the news situation\nin Germany in context.\nThe task proved to be much harder on the German scene than in the\nUK because since the UK has been at the forefront of the digital\ntransformation, where many different and competing media industries\nare involved, it has been easier to follow the news flow and the\ncompetition here - there is a competition.\nBut when you look in Germany, the traditional media giants keep\ntight control of their markets in print and broadcasting.  One\nhundred years after the introduction of radio, the German\nbroadcasters still dominate radio listening and continue to\nprotect their markets by the enforcement of licenses, and by the\nenforcement of the \"pillars of industry\" doctrine, which puts\nlimits in the number of radio channels in a market, the maximum\nnumber of broadcasting hours a week, and the percentage of locally\nmade programming.\nThe German cable operators are still struggling to find their way\ninto the broadcasting industry, and the new players in the world of\nInternet broadcasting are still small.  The largest German Internet\nradio station, www.radio1.de, was recently sold to a Dutch media\nenterprise from the same group as the Dutch radio station Radio 538.\nBut the new digital players, who compete with the traditional\nbroadcasting giants, as well as with the big players in the\npublishing world, are not able to do so in the same manner these\nestablished players of the old media do.\nThe big German newspapers continue to try to hold back the digital\ntide.  They are trying to build up electronic services on\nspecialized websites, in a move to make users register with the\nprint editions, and to use their e-mail addresses as the basis for\nreinforcing the print products with newsletters.  This is an\neffort to keep away the increasing number of news consumers who\nare turning to the Internet and the new, interactive and personal\nnewspaper websites.\nAt the same time the German newspapers, which are the largest\nreaders to their print products, are finding ways to get more\nreaders and thus advertising-revenue by publishing electronic editions.  At the same time, they are trying to increase the market share of their electronic editions, which are mostly presented on mobile phones.\nTo understand this you have to know that the German newspaper\nmarket is controlled by five large newspaper companies that\ncontrol or manage about 90% of the daily newspaper market.

The company expects to be testing the results within six months.\nThose results can, in turn, help media companies track the audience ratings and revenues of their programs and decide how to plan their schedules in order to maximise ad revenue.\nIn the U.K., digital currency company\nGemalto announced the first transaction of its kind in Europe last week in a deal with U.K. media\ncompany\nLazer Interactive, one of the first media networks to accept\nLearnmoreCoin (LCR), with users being able to directly exchange advertising space for the exchange\ncurrency which rewards the viewer.\nLCR is an exchange currency that can be earned and traded through watching short video advertisements. In turn, LCR acts as a currency that can then be exchanged in place of advertising dollars.\nIn Canada, the\nWinnipeg Sun\nis launching its first\nmultiplatform mobile magazine.\nThe 80-page, weekly mobile edition will be based on the original edition, but will also include new features, including videos and interactive surveys.\nUnlike most Canadian and American mobile magazines, which have separate apps for their print edition and their mobile magazine, the Winnipeg Sun is planning an app that will be an outgrowth of its already digital- and mobile- friendly website.

Kaszuba said that, as a local\nnewspaper, \"We see ourselves as a service not only to\nreaders and advertisers, but also to the community.\"\nThe strategy has paid off in both revenue and readership,\nwhich has grown consistently under Kaszuba, a New Jersey\nnative and a career newspaperman who began selling papers for\nthe Daily Gazette of Schenectady, New York when he was 16\nyears old. Even so, the Pioneer Press isn't the giant it once was. In 2007, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the paper sold roughly 175,000 print copies and 65,000 digital copies. Now, Kaszuba said, the average daily figure is more like 160,000 print copies and \"we sell more than those two other brands put together.\"\nThose two other brands, City Pages and Mpls.St.Paul, are both part of the Gannett chain, publishers of USA Today. By way of further comparison, the average daily sales of the Mpls.St.Paul is roughly 8,000 print copies and 25,000 digital copies. The City Pages, not so long ago, sold more than 100,000 print copies -- before cuts by Gannett decimated its staff.\nThe Pioneer Press has also gone far to embrace digital\nmedia -- one reason Kaszuba believes the paper is in such a good\nposition. \"To be able to offer a digital product that is\ncomplementary to the paper -- an extra vehicle that's both able\nto reach a younger demographic -- both are vital to us,\" said\nKaszuba.\nOn Monday, the paper announced another new endeavor.\nThe Pioneer Press has introduced a new \"inverted\" print\ncirc model under which readers can buy a print subscription\nfor less than $20 a month, or, for just $3 a month, get any\nsix print weeks of their choice, according to the paper.\n\"We've been the number one paper for subscriptions in our\nmarket for the past two years,\" Kaszuba said. \"We believe this\nis yet another way to keep up in that category and continue\nto build it.\"\nA big part of the newspaper's success seems to be in its\nability to offer something extra for readers. After all, the\nmarket may not be quite so willing to accept cuts to the\ndaily newspaper in the manner the industry is accustomed to\nmaking around the world. To maintain its loyal, local\nfan base -- the cornerstone of its success -- the paper\n\"We're part of what the community looks to for leadership,\"\nsaid Kaszuba, \"and we have to be able to take positions,\nmake editorial decisions that people agree with, whether or\nnot there's a financial impact on our bottom line. And there\nhas been many of those.\"\nThat can involve deciding whether or not to stand up to\nthe Metropolitan Council, which in the past has tried to\nshut down the local newspaper. \"We did report that the Council\nwas going to meet in closed session in 2008 to discuss our\ncoverage of a failed development project, and we were\nthreatened with having to pay costs in legal discovery,\nwhich we felt infringed on our right of open meetings.

The value of total intermediate inputs was $10.4 billion, and the value of raw\nmaterials used (the value of imports) was $11.9 billion. The mining and construction equipment\nand other machinery and mechanical appliance industries used about 29% of the total intermediate\ninputs to directly produce their finished goods and services (see Table 1). In 2016-17, the value-added\nof businesses in the mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and mechanical appliance\nindustries was valued at 0.6%, or $2.5 billion lower than in 2015-16.\n1 Intermediate inputs purchased directly by businesses in the mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and mechanical\nappliance industries and those value-added from their manufacture.\nSOURCE: ABS Survey of Business Inputs (Cat. No. 5248.0).\nTable 1: Value-added and intermediate inputs of businesses in the mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and\nmachinery and mechanical\nmachinery and\nappliance industries\nIn 2017-18, the mining and construction equipment, and other\nmachinery and mechanical appliance industries directly generated over $114 billion in income.\nIncome accruing to households totaled over $23 billion. These industries contributed almost $12.4 billion\nto GDP and employed over 1.1 million people.\nOver the last two decades, the mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and mechanical\nconstruction equipment,\nappliance industries have been among Australia\u2019s fastest-growing industries. Between 2008-09 and\n2016-17, value-added by the mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and\nmachinery and mechanical appliance\nindustries grew at an annual average rate of 1.4% (see Table 1). All major mineral industries\ncollectively accounted for over half of the growth in the mining and construction equipment, and\nother machinery and mechanical appliance industries over this period (see the \u2018Industry Groups\u2019\nbox).\nThe mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and mechanical appliance industries face\nan array of environmental, economic, social, and technological challenges, ranging from increased\nregulation in relation to sustainable development to shifting markets and globalising business cycles.\nChanging consumer demands are also having an impact. The mining and construction equipment, and\nother machinery and mechanical appliance industries are constantly seeking ways to become more\nefficient and profitable.\nAustralia is world-leading in mineral exploration, production and processing technology. It imports many\nmachinery and mechanical appliance products because of technological limitations or international\ncompetition. These imports are estimated to be valued at $31 billion per annum, and Australia\u2019s main\nexport markets are the United States, Switzerland, India and Japan.\nIn 2017-18, coal and iron ore industries accounted for more than half of the value-added produced in\nthe mining and construction equipment, and other machinery and mechanical appliance industries.\nTheir value-added was valued at around $6.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively (see Table 1).\nCoal is not just Australia\u2019s largest commodity export, the main export revenue generator, and its\nsecond-largest export sector. It is also Australia\u2019s only resource industry that has experienced a\ncontinuous expansion of its value-added in terms of volume and value over the last ten years. It\nhas done so without being linked to any one specific mining area or region of Australia.\nAnother feature of the mining-led economy has been its role in contributing to the overall export boom\nthe economy has experienced this century.

The debate around mobile advertising is interesting, but that\u2019s certainly not my main focus right now. At the moment, in fact, I\u2019m more interested in native advertising within news organizations\u2019 own content.\nSo it seemed like an appropriate time to discuss where I am in terms of thinking about mobile at The New York Times. I\u2019ll start with a brief history, and move on to discuss a few themes that I think we will be exploring over the next several years.\nA note about where I come from . . . I\u2019ve been at The Times since December of 2008, where I started by looking at our website. The Times\u2019s website was an early adopter of responsive design, and I got the sense that the Times was generally more responsive to consumer demand than, say, newspaper after newspaper.\nAt the time, I found it interesting that there were so many responsive designs, and so much new content within mobile. It also seemed like there was a lot of experimentation going on around responsive design in general. And I felt very comfortable saying that it was very clear that people wanted to consume the product in a native, mobile environment.\nThat was about two and a half years ago. Since then, however, we\u2019ve made some drastic changes to how we look at mobile, our newsroom, and our editorial process. It had become clear to me that there was a general appetite amongst our editors for a big change in how we thought about our mobile newsrooms, and how native advertsing was going to figure into that as well.\nSo I looked around for something that I could learn from, and I saw what was going on at Quartz, which was launched in September of 2012. The New York Times was Quartz\u2019s largest competitor, of course, at that point, and I had this sense that there was a lot of energy and experimentation behind Quartz.\nI also wanted to see how something from outside of The New York Times could impact us and shape us, so I made my pitch: I wanted to look at Quartz as a case study for mobile and experimentation.\nI actually looked at the story of how Quartz was able to establish and launch itself as a company as well \u2013 I saw a very entrepreneurial and experimental spirit at work in a lot of areas, so it seemed like a good match.\nTaking that first step\nThe decision was made to take a full-time leave of absence from The New York Times to look at these questions of mobile, and to look at how that might shape the future of The Times itself. I had that leave of absence for a year, but I\u2019ve only been back since December.\nI\u2019m no longer working on mobile at The Times, but what\u2019s interesting is that I\u2019ve been able to bring back a lot of ideas and discussions that I had had with people at Quartz and other places around those themes to have a big impact on The Times even after my leave of absence.\nAnd that\u2019s where my work has really expanded and blended into the fabric of the newsroom itself; we\u2019re a long way down the road from the mobile newsroom that were working at the time of the launch of Quartz.\nThere is now a much bigger, more active group of people across The Times who are looking at how technology is transforming the future.\nThey\u2019re coming from all different areas \u2013 it has people from product development and technology, it has a few people from the newsroom itself, and it has a few from the advertising side as well.\nPeople had already been talking about the future of news in a general way, and I felt like it was necessary for the people from that particular group to start looking at the future of news from a much more specific angle, by looking specifically at mobile and the ways that The Times was able to produce content specifically for mobile users and devices.\nThe first steps to our new mobile newsroom\nIn September 2012, that big group of people started to meet to talk about technology that was transforming newsrooms and the business of news, and I went to meetings to represent myself as well and talk about how that was changing here and how The Times was doing it.\nI found myself being a big part of that work and talking about how Quartz and The Times were doing mobile, and how other companies and news organizations were shaping mobile for news.\nWe were already at that time working on a number of projects", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requests\ncomment on its final rule, ``Fire Prevention and Control Plans\nRequired,'' and the National Fire Prevention and Control Plans\nAdvisory Committee report, ``Recommendations for Improving Fire\nSafety in Homes & Businesses,'' for incorporation into 36 CFR\n39.

One of the latest issues on publishers' minds is the way to continue to expand readers' universe while maintaining an exclusive readership base.\nFor many companies that have been around for a while, this is not a great issue. They have a loyal readership group, and they are already looking for ways to keep this group enticed with new content. However, for startups that are looking to keep growing, the need for an exclusive readership base is almost as urgent.\nSo how exactly can publishers maintain their loyal readers, while creating this exclusive readership base that will attract new users? Here are a few examples of how successful media companies are going about this practice.\nWriting for a Niche Audience\nNiche publishers' primary target usually consists of an audience that shares a demographic trait or attribute. For example, a magazine for women 35+, or a publication that covers alternative lifestyles, or a journal that talks about specific technological developments in the tech world.\nIn these types of cases, the audience knows exactly what they are looking for, and they are not interested in new media content. Therefore, a niche publication's focus is to make sure that it provides its readers with a well-defined source of information about a specific field. This makes a great deal of sense. It is an established fact that niche targeting brings better results to a publisher. Research shows that the ROI for niche publications is much higher than general interest publications.\nBecause this type of niche publication is about creating loyal members for this target audience - these readers are not as loyal to new sources of information in this industry, which means that the readership is often very small, and is less likely to spread across the world. Therefore, these are the types of publications who face the challenge of how to expand their universe while at the same time working on attracting new readers.\nThis is where niche publications can differentiate themselves by adding extra value to the core publication. If a magazine is about fitness, for example, some of the content could revolve around recipes and family-friendly meals. In such a case, the magazine's readership would be looking primarily for fitness-related articles, but having an extra element that the reader values - such as recipes, can draw in a new wave of new readers.\nIn essence, the magazine publisher is looking for an audience who is looking for this type of niche content. For example, a magazine's editor-in-chief who has a strong opinion about a specific topic, may well be the type of reader who will enjoy reading about fitness and home-cooked meals. Therefore, by offering this extra content in a magazine that focuses on fitness and health, a publisher is essentially adding value to its content that could be attractive to new readers as well.\nThink About the Target Audience\nIdeally, any publication, regardless of its niche, is always geared for target readers. It is not enough just to establish a niche target audience: you also need to think about their needs and desires.\nThis is particularly important because if a publication does not fully understand the demographic group it targets, it will have a very difficult time attracting new readers who would need to fall into these demographics in order to be interested in the information presented in the publication.\nPublishers need to fully understand the dynamics of each specific target audience. They also need to know what their readers are reading. In order to maintain their loyal readers, as well as to expand the sphere, publishers constantly need to look over the shoulder of their competition, and ask themselves: Who is my competitor? Once they know who their competition is, publishers need to study competitors' content and determine exactly how their audience is receiving this information. They need to then look over their audience demographic - and take a good hard look at the needs and desires of these individuals. Are there areas that could be covered in their area that is not being covered anywhere else?\nIf we look at the example of the magazine being in the fitness, health, and home-cooked meals niche, there are a lot of ways that publications can reach into different areas. Maybe there are a significant amount of readers who are trying to get back into shape and are finding ways to be healthier as", "The Department of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), will sponsor an industry meeting and workshops on October 13, 2008, at the NTIA Conference Center at 425 14th Street, NW., Washington, DC. The meeting will focus on the Department and the NTIA's views on the future of the Internet and the development and deployment of next-generation and future wireless technologies, including opportunities for industry collaboration on these initiatives. The meeting will also focus on topics related to the deployment of next-generation networking technologies in the coming years, and how the Internet and the communications environment might be enhanced to respond to technological, social, and economic trends. Through the meeting, NTIA intends to collect information from U.S. firms and other interested parties related to the Department and the NTIA's views of the Internet and future technologies in order to develop a draft National Broadband Plan, as required by Section 113 (i) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, the meeting will seek input on how companies and other interested parties might work with the NTIA to enhance next-generation networking technologies and innovation in the Internet and associated communications technologies domestically and abroad as described in the National Broadband Plan.  The meeting will focus on these topics, among others: \u2022   1300\u20131600\u2014Draft National Broadband Plan (Draft Plan) workshop. This workshop is designed to assess how technology, including the Internet and next-generation wireless technologies, could better support the creation of new jobs, innovation, education, national economic goals, and broadband penetration, and how Federal, State, tribal, and local policies could facilitate these goals. Participants will also analyze how the Federal Government could support innovative and sustainable business models, including those associated with applications (apps) and content that could enable the continued evolution of the Internet and facilitate the broadband market's transition to next-generation broadband and global wireless standards. The purpose of this workshop is to determine the appropriate roles of the private sector, Government, and academia to improve the Internet and future communications technologies, such as fourth generation (4G) wireless broadband, and how the United States might foster the development of the next-generation internet infrastructure through innovation and the use of best business model practices, including consumer and environmental protections.  \u2022   1300\u20131400\u2014NIST/NTIA Next Generation Wireless Broadband Workshop. The workshop will assess how the development of the next-generation wireless technologies could be stimulated by market and policy incentives to facilitate investment in the network to support services to commercial entities and to enhance and enable broadband services for end users. The purpose of this workshop is to identify opportunities to enhance competition, promote investment in the fourth generation (4G) network and broadband wireless infrastructure, and enhance opportunities for new applications, content, and services. In addition, it seeks to gather input on how NTIA and NIST might work with the research community and other interested parties to explore these opportunities in an effort to promote the economic benefits of the next generation network and ensure that these benefits are shared with consumers. \u2022   1400\u20131500\u2014Draft National Broadband Plan (Draft Plan) workshop. This workshop is designed to assess how technology, including the Internet and next-generation wireless technologies, could better serve the needs of students, schools, libraries, and hospitals and improve health care, how Government could provide access to broadband infrastructure to improve the ability of schools to support digital education, and how the United States might facilitate the development of next-generation networks needed for these public and private sector needs. The purpose of this workshop is to gather comment on the appropriate roles for the Federal Government; to identify goals that would improve the delivery of education and health care; and to describe how the Federal Government can help increase broadband access to support these needs.   \u2022   1400\u20131500\u2014National Broadband Plan (Draft Plan) workshop. This workshop is designed to assess how technology, including the Internet and next-generation wireless technologies, could better serve the needs of all United States citizens and the economy and how State, tribal, local, and regional organizations might use broadband to advance these needs. The purpose of the workshop is to identify public needs and how to use broadband to better serve the citizens; to assess how the Federal Government could help improve the delivery of education and health", "In an increasingly competitive environment, the Daily News needed its most successful and valuable media partner to help drive results that can be tracked, measured, and compared with the rest of the national print market.\nABOUT THE PROBLEM\nThe Daily News was looking for a media partner that could generate the types of analytics data that are critical in a competitive newspaper space. The paper would also be looking for more effective reporting, as well as more reliable performance against key target markets and metrics like CPM and TPM.\nMEDIA SOLUTION\nAfter conducting research comparing The Daily News to other papers in the region, it became apparent that The Daily News needed a more effective media partner. The first step would be establishing the value of effective data collection and analysis in making informed buying decisions versus relying on gut feeling and estimates. This was also the last step required before the paper could move full steam ahead with the development of its Digital Media Kit.\nRESULTS/CASE STUDY\nBefore embarking on the creation of its Media Kit, The Daily News worked with The AAM to develop more effective media strategies. Using their extensive database of performance metrics as a benchmark, The Daily News and AAM worked together to develop a Media Kit. Key factors that were included in the Media Kit were a CPM ranking of the market; Average Advertising Rate to Revenue (AARR) performance by section; and ad positioning within the paper. This information was used to define rates and offerings for The Daily News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 digital product.\n\u201cThe information contained in these kits helped us move forward, as it laid out a very clear path on how to properly structure a ratecard for our new digital product. The AAM proved to be a valuable resource as we navigated through the difficult process of determining an appropriate rate for our company in the new digital landscape.\u201d\n\u2013 Kevin Finkelman, Vice President/Group Publisher, Daily News & NYDN.COM\nThe AAM team met with representatives from The Daily News to discuss the company\u2019s market position and key audience target. The AAM team then conducted a media scan in order to compare The Daily News\u2019 performance to other regional papers and newspapers across the country. This was the final step prior to the creation of the Media Kit. After the scan, The AAM team began development of the Media Kit. The document that was eventually produced as a result of the project showed the paper\u2019s performance as compared to key local and national digital competitors in the market.\nThe resulting Media Kit was a valuable and reliable resource for The Daily News as it moved to enter another segment of the marketplace. It allowed the paper to clearly position itself for success against key competitors and to structure its ratecard appropriately.\nCase study by John MacDermott, Vice President Data Publishing, The Alliance for Audited Media", "A look at some of the best digital initiatives that are bringing the media and audiences together through apps including the Times of India, the Guardian and Hearst Media\u2019s 90-Day Winner app\nThe mobile space is rich with innovative digital content. It has been a space of trial and error for both publishers and audiences, and there are far more failures today than successes. But there have been some successful digital content properties that have made an impact.\nIt\u2019s a testament to the audiences and publishers.\nI recently caught up with Times of India (ToI) CEO Venky Vembu, who revealed that one of the company\u2019s top selling digital content initiatives right now is its news app for the Hindi market, which ToI hopes will become one of its top selling digital products.\nAs part of this initiative, ToI has also revamped its Android application for Hindi readers and made it a hybrid app, available for both mobile phone and tablet usage.\nThe app also has a social media layer that allows users to post content from various other sources such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+, and these posts now go live in a ToI app, instead of the other social media apps. \u201cThat is an important point of differentiation for us,\u201d Vembu said.\nAdditionally, the product gives users the option to go in and search for content by various topics or topics by section. \u201cThe whole idea is for the user to be able to see a full page with topics that interest them, and we\u2019re bringing contextual ads to that page depending on how you want to find it, whether it is content or search, or a combination of both,\u201d he said.\nTo get these initiatives out to the market, the company is doing a lot of advertising across several channels and platforms, including television, radio, print, as well as digital.\nVembu also spoke about how important it is for ToI to be where the audience is. \u201cWe will make whatever changes necessary to be where they are, rather than expecting them to come where we are,\u201d he said.\nThe media space was a little late in seeing the potential of a successful digital initiative. But with the market continuing to evolve and adaptability, publishers have been able to create content that has had success, and they can continue to tweak the content to better serve their target audiences.\nIt\u2019s a challenge that must be undertaken if publishers want to see the same level of engagement with their audiences they see with their competitors.\nNewsgd.com/Tony Wong\nPublishers, whether they are print-based or digital-only, are constantly looking to enhance their offerings, sometimes finding innovative ways to do so.\nOne such outlet is the Guardian, which, as part of its efforts to boost engagement, implemented several social network connections and various tools for users to better interact with its content.\nThe Guardian, with help from a third-party service, made it so that its articles are accessible in a variety of different ways, whether it be on a mobile phone device or a desk or laptop computer. \u201cUsers can still read the content online, but if they were on a mobile device with a larger screen, they would be presented with options. They can click on each of those three links,\u201d explained Joshua Berman, The Guardian US editor.\nAdditionally, the Guardian has implemented social network connections to its content through a service called ShareThis, which provides the following features:\nAllowing to select to have a story opened in Facebook, or on a particular social network/profile. You can specify this to be \u201cDefault Facebook,\u201d \u201cLinkedIn,\u201d \u201cMy Profile,\u201d or \u201cCustom Network.\u201d\nBeing able to see what your friends are sharing, either on Facebook or Twitter, and that content is surfaced in real time. \u201cWhat that means is that all my content would be surfaced whether a friend or not (via Twitter). If a friend of mine likes a piece of content on the Guardian, and I also like it, it would automatically be shared on my profile (via Twitter), and be available to my friends who are on Twitter to see if they want to like it or not.\u201d\nThe ability to share comments on articles with your network of friends.\nThe Guardian has also implemented several tools such as the Guardian App, which delivers breaking news content, commentary, and reporting for audiences to read in a more visual way.\nTo help audiences engage with its content, the Guardian also utilises tools such as the Comments section to give audiences a broader perspective on its stories through debates and discussions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Comments section below each article, and the goal with this", "There was a long black limousine idling at 16th and L with three guys in it.\nIt was eleven threes on the clock. I heard some scuffling inside and somebody got dragged out in handcuffs.\nThere was a lot of blood. I figured the driver was pissed off. Or maybe somebody bled.\nSomebody else started screaming. But it was too deep and too loud and all I could make out was \"FUCK YOU!!\" and \"AHHH!\" and \"SOMEBODY HELP ME!\"\nThe limo was stuck like a bad tape. I'd already given the scene the onceover, but I went back at it anyway. I saw somebody running up the street. No way of knowing who that was or why, but it got an attention-getting rise out of the people in the limo.\nMy guess is that it was a carjacking. Probably just a gang banger, maybe an out-of-town yuppie, but maybe. In any case, a good reason to get the cops right there and right now. I gave the guys three or four different ways to call them and I was outta there. They were still screaming.\nI was pretty sure they were out of earshot anyway. \nCHAPTER ONE\n\"DON'T STOP.\"\nI kept moving anyway.\n\"Fast ball. FUCK! Get the fuck away from her! Don't hurt her! FUCKING TAKE IT!\"\nShe was screaming. I hoped at least one of them would see her. And they could see me, but not too clearly because of the smoke, and I thought at first nobody heard me.\nI was a little closer, though, because I'd kept going. Or kept moving. I'd been doing it for a while now.\nThe fire was already halfway between me and the car.\nI was heading toward the car, at the end of a short straightaway, moving fast because I could, but still moving slower than I'd wanted. It could have been much faster by my guess, which I was sure the others, who were just getting started following me, didn't know. I'd have to get closer.\n\"Take it! Somebody take it!\"\nThat time even the car wouldn't hear her.\nThe car's four doors opened.\nI stopped. I hoped they could see me.\n\"Help me! Jesus. Fucking take it!\"\nShe had no idea what might have come to her.\nI made my own decision. I could see one of the guys just getting out. I looked at what they were doing. They didn't realize she was being taken by other guys.\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!\"\nIt was what I needed to get me going again.\nNot as fast as I wanted, but faster. I headed toward the two guys.\nSomething happened at the same time. The guy who'd stepped out of the car was now back in it with a gun aiming at the two guys running with the girl and her shirt tied over her face when all of a sudden, the fire seemed to get bigger and bigger. It was like getting in the car was too late.\nIt got too hot, and too dark, and too big, and too bad fast.\nThen it was too late.\nThin and tall, I was the fastest among us, and that is what I did, what we did. We just ran.\nI did not look back. Instead what I did looked down.\nI could still see them even in the dark, which made me think I should see more of them. And I thought they were getting closer. Close enough to see them. I was thinking we were all getting closer, and that it seemed too quick, and that there should have been more time to see more. I thought that. That I needed more time. But instead what happened was what happened. And I am glad we did what we did.\nI went back. I heard a girl scream.\nCHAPTER TWO\nI SHOULD SEE MORE BUT I DON'T SEE ENOUGH.\nI go by the sidewalk that I know. But it doesn't help. It doesn't bring me where I'm going. My feet move but sometimes it's like they are moving but they get the next step wrong and then they stop again. I feel stupid walking there, like walking in circles.\nI just want to know. The way I hear it, a thing happened. That I could have been at. That was pretty bad. Pretty big.

That \"Policy Statement\" provided guidance as to how the Commission intended to \"balance the need to introduce broadband billing/format with the need to control postal subsidies expenditures\".\nThe policy statement in effect established 2 tiers of subsidy rates for applicants who wanted to introduce broadband billing/format. \u00a0The first rate tier specified postal subsidies of 30 cents per linear meter for the broadband billing class of publications launched in any large urban Canadian market, including Toronto.  \u00a0The second rate tier specified postal subsidies of 25 cents per linear meter for such class of publications launched in other Canadian markets but not including Toronto.\nIn the Policy Statement, the Commission stated that it would \"treat all applications to eliminate or reduce postal subsidies for newspapers pursuing broadband billing/format equally, and that all applications must be consistent with the other related policy statements, in particular the Commission's policy statement concerning postal rates for large urban markets.  This statement was issued in October 1998, establishes minimum postal subsidy rates of 35 cents per linear meter for the broadsheet class of newspaper, and requires that such rates apply to all members of the class in a given market.\nThe Commission did not indicate that it would treat all applications to reduce postal subsidies for broadband billing class newspapers equally, but did indicate that all such applications \"should be consistent with the other related policy statements\".  \u00a0In general, the \"related policy statements\" which the Commission refers to are generally intended to \"prevent the use of broadband billing format... as a means both to circumvent the large urban market subsidy and to maximize subsidies\".\nIn the course of its filings supporting a reduction in its Postal Subsidy Rates, the Globe and Mail claimed that it faced increased printing and transportation costs. \u00a0The Globe and Mail also stated that it felt that it was being put at a disadvantage in the marketplace due to its existing postal subsidy (28.37 cents per linear meter for broadsheet format in the broadband billing class).\nIn an application dated January 10, 2001 and referred to the CRTC's Newspaper Classification Panel, Toronto Sun Company Limited (Toronto Sun) claimed that the Globe and Mail's reduced postal subsidy rate of 30 cents per linear meter (postage paid) for the broadband billing class was putting it at a considerable disadvantage and requested an increase in the subsidy rate.\nThe Toronto Sun indicated that it had 100 per cent market-share in the broadband billing class (28.37 cents per linear meter postage paid) in Toronto, but that 41 per cent of its total circulation was sold in this format. \u00a0It also contended that the Globe and Mail made 7 cents per linear meter per copy on such sales and made only 2 cents by selling the Toronto Sun paper in the format.\nThe Globe and Mail filed its reply to Toronto Sun's application in August 2001.", "The Commission grants a 45-day waiver of\ndisclosure of the identities of certain commenters who have not\nidentified themselves as such.\nSecretary, Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW, 10th\nFloor, Washington, DC 20463.

But one of the most important aspects of our health is the health of our gut.\nOur gut health impacts so many aspects of our life. It dictates how we process our nutrients; plays a huge role in our immunity; helps control our mood; and determines our ability to heal and lose weight.\nWhat Can We Do to Manage our Gut Health?\nManaging our gut health largely starts with the foods we eat. A well-functioning gut means being able to digest food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste products all in the proper time and manner.\nDairy products, sugars, grains, fried foods (especially fried chicken), and alcohol can all have impacts on the health of our gut, but these foods are often staples in our modern diets.\nIt's hard to avoid these foods entirely without changing your lifestyle, as processed foods are everywhere.\nIf you're struggling to eliminate these foods, take baby steps. A great way to start would be to make small, realistic changes to your diet.\nStart swapping out one of the foods in your daily diet for one of the foods we've listed below, and continue making these swaps until you\u2019ve slowly started to replace some of the more unhealthy foods in your diet with these recommendations.\nThe Benefits of Bone Broth\nStock the shelves of your kitchen with bones from your healthiest cut of meat, and start drinking bone broth. A bone broth drink is simple \u2014 it\u2019s warm water mixed with the broth that's been simmering for hours in the same pot. One of the healthiest choices in broth is a bone broth with chicken feet and chicken cartilage in it because it\u2019s a highly concentrated source of collagen. Some recipes include garlic and rosemary to make it more flavorful.\nWhat's the Difference? Beef vs. Bone Broth.\nFermented Foods Boost Gut-Health\nTrick your gut into thinking it's in a happy, healthy, and richly populated environment through the consumption of fermented foods. Fermented foods add healthy bacteria to your gut and help your gut to be able to break down the food, as well as extract the nutritional value of it. These foods include sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, miso, and kombucha.\nOther Foods you Should Include in your Diet\nEat leafy greens like swiss chard, dandelion greens, spinach, beets, and arugula. They have a huge variety of nutrients in them, so consuming your greens will do your digestive system a ton of good.\nGet your fatty acids from grass-fed butter and meats for a healthy gut. Fatty acids are the nutritional building blocks of your gut and cell membranes, so they're foundational to your overall gut health.\nFermented cod liver oil can boost your immune and digestive systems by improving your liver function and regulating your digestive health. It'll also boost your absorption of vitamins A and D and magnesium, which can improve your gut health along with that of your skin and mood.\nProbiotic foods like yogurt, kefir, and kimchi can have huge impacts on your gut health. These foods add gut bacteria to your system and improve the efficiency of your gut's digestive processes by feeding the healthful bacteria in your gut. Yogurt can contain beneficial probiotics, as well as be nutrient dense and packed with healthy fats.\nDon't forget to drink enough water, as not drinking enough will increase your toxicity level and potentially create even more harm to your gut if you were underfed in other areas.\nThe key for successful living healthy is a combination of healthy eating, good rest, regular exercise, and a positive outlook. When you follow the recommendations above, they will help manage and avoid many health issues.\nPrevious articleEating a Balanced Diet: 5 Steps to Eating Well\nNext articleThe", "The EAB Registration Division is issuing an interim rule allowing growers to continue to grow EMS tree species in the regulated areas.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are implementing an eradication strategy for this beetle. Part of this effort is the development of an areawide quarantine to prevent the spread of ALHB from regulated areas to unquarantined areas, and the establishment of regulated areas from which the plant host on which the beetle feeds (i.e., Maple) will not be allowed to propagated. The EAB Registration Division had the authority to promulgate an areawide quarantine to protect the United States from this beetle when it was first detected. On July 14, 2007, the EAB Registration Division published an interim rule (72 FR Start Printed Page 483925206) that extended and expanded the areawide quarantine to include regulated areas in Massachusetts. That interim rule has an effective date of August 13, 2007, and expires on January 22, 2009.\nOn April 29, 2008, the EAB Registration Division published an interim rule (73 FR 25020) that extended the interim areawide quarantine (IWQ) to further regulated areas in New York State (NY). The effective date of this interim rule was August 6, 2008. The interim rule provides for enforcement of the IWQ and allows for additional plant pests to be quarantined to respond to changing information regarding the beetles. On August 6, 2008, the EAB Registration Division published a supplemental interim rule adding the regulated areas of the 22 Kentucky counties (73 FR 44674) to the IWQ.\nThis interim rule adds Kentucky counties that were found during routine surveys and by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Pest Management (PPP) staff to have EAB when trapping sites were set-up as part of ongoing detection efforts.

Here's where you can\nhear what others thought when the 82nd Congress of the United States\nsought \"to make history and fix everything in America.\"  The 82nd\nCongress found that it couldn't fix everything.\nWHY FIX WHAT ISN'T BROKEN?\nThere were a lot of people in 1959 and 1960 who looked forward to\nwhat they hoped would happen in 1961, when, they said, \"it will\nAll right, all right, people who are not dead and who were 28\nyears old then and more know that there has happened a lot of\nthings since 1961.\nSome of those things were:  Martin Luther King was shot in\n1968; the Beatles had their first hit in 1963; I came out of the\nwoods in 1973; the Russians put a man into space on April 12\n1961; man landed on the moon in July 1969; there was an assassination\nAttempt on our President in 1981; and then there was the Gulf War in\n1990 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.\nIn all of this, if you weren't a spacecraft or a bombing truck,\nyou probably could feel the effect.\nAnd you might not know that there was a \"New Frontier\"\ndeclared by JFK in his inaugural address on January 20, 1937. His\ndeclaration was:  \"The winds that blow around the world do not\nexclusively blow on us; we too are to- day in a phase of history which\naffects us all.\"\nAnd then you probably couldn't know that all these historical\nfacts affected our Congress in 1961.\nAnd what Congress couldn't fix what is not broken, is why 13 amendments to the Constitution were introduced in the current Congress, of which none have yet to be approved except the one to give a President one year to enforce existing laws. And you'd want to know why and how many, but now you are probably not going to.\nBut when, for example I found out that 29 states and some\nindividuals opposed the amendments, then it occurred to me that\nmaybe there is something about these amendments that you should know.\nTo begin with, when I say that there is no way for you to know\nwhat you have to know, I'm not implying that there is a way for you\nto know what you have to know.\nI guess, however, you probably would want to know what are these\namendments that the 82nd Congress came up 13 of, which are so\nimportant that they are affecting our lives today - 1999.\nThe amendment that the 82nd came up with and was introduced\nby Rep. Paul McGeough, (D) South Carolina on December 4, 1999 was\nthis:   \"The Congress shall meet at least annually and that if\nthey can't fix it, it shall be fixed in a reasonable time.\" - 1969.\nAnd this was the amendment that the 82nd Congress voted down.\nAnd you wouldn't even know about this one:\nThe amendment, introduced by Charles Rangel, (D) New York on\nDecember 4, 1999 and the next day, introduced again by John Lewis, (D)\nGeorgia, gave the President one year to enforce existing laws, with\nthe amendment defining existing laws as \"every law that is in effect\nuntil it is repealed or modified and any law that may be passed by\nany of these United States after the president receives this amendment.\"\nAnd the 82nd Congress, of course, voted this one down on December\n31, 1999.  And then it voted for it in 2000. But that's for the\nSo, I guess, the 82nd Congress didn't fix nothing worth fixing.\nBut maybe - the 83rd is working.\nAnd we also wouldn't know yet about the 11 that they voted\non, which include such things as:  Eliminating the President's\nright to veto.

In November 2011, a study by the American Society of News Editors reported a 4.6 percent fall in newspaper revenues for the first half of 2011. That was down from a 5.8 percent drop in the first half of 2010.\nHowever, that may be a false signal \u2013 the figure is misleading, Rosenstiel told Editor & Publisher. When read the news, online or print, the first thing a consumer does is form an impression -- either in favor or against a brand -- and that impression is carried forward, he said.\n\"That is why the fact that [print] appears to be stabilizing is so encouraging,\" he added.\nIt's still early days in the digital age, he said, and many readers haven't turned to the Internet for their news needs. In that respect, the poll, conducted in October, marks the first significant shift since the advent of the Internet in 1995.\nIn that year, only 9 percent of adults surveyed said they had gotten their news in the last week off a cell phone, only 3 percent from a personal computer and 1 percent from a tablet computer.\nNewspapers' share of the news consumption market has increased even as newspaper circulation has dropped \u2013 suggesting that readers have turned from reading printed versions of their chosen newspapers, either daily or on weekends, but they still rely on those publications to deliver quality news content, said the report.\nThe study also said Internet content has remained the major news source for those who get most of their news online \u2013 including those with the highest levels of online activity.\nOnly 18 percent (mostly younger, technology-savvy people) of those who get most of their news online get the \"majority of that news\" from a mobile device. And only 4 percent of those most involved with news on the Internet get most of that news from a tablet computer. By comparison, a print newspaper gets most of its news from a mobile device from about 50 percent of the \"most plugged-in,\" and about a third get news for print paper on a tablet computer.\nHowever, those involved the least with news on the Internet \u2013 those who say they \"hardly ever\" consume news online (14 percent) \u2013 are much more likely to get most of their reading material from a tablet computer than from a print paper (15 percent vs. 5 percent).\nThe poll, conducted by Pew/Elon University, queried more that 2,000 adult Americans via cell phone and landline, 1,513 are Internet users.\nAsked about their sources of news in the last week, the poll found that 88 percent of Americans favor print newspapers most of all from any media format.\nHowever, the poll found that many people \u2013 51 percent - who do get most or most of their news online say they are likely to check more often now that they have the Internet at their fingertips, as opposed to only 7 percent of non-Internet users who are more likely to check news more often now they can get it on the Internet.\nThe shift to online news consumption appears to be mostly among young adults who were most likely to be online news frequenters. This is driven in large part by the fact that their most preferred source of news is news online \u2013", "What makes publishers happy? More than just an increase in readership, according to IAB Europe's 'Making online digital'.\nReading time: 3 minutes Average read\nIAB Europe\u2019s annual \u2018Making Online Digital\u2019 study released at the end of July 2009 has shown that European advertising is not only recession-proof but actually getting stronger every year. The study focuses on advertising in digital media and is the 4th annual independent survey of interactive advertising in Europe and this year provides a comprehensive overview of the development of online advertising including display, classifieds, performance media, search, email marketing, mobile and the \u2018long tail\u2019. Initiated by IAB Europe in partnership with KPMG International, IAB Europe\u2019s survey partner in this project, the new survey of European interactive advertising was conducted on behalf of the Organisation by the IPSOS media and advertising audience measurement specialist \u2013 IAB Europe - also working with Comscore, an online advertising performance measurement expert.\nAs far as content is concerned, IAB Europe saw four important trends emerging from the study. The first is the need for quality content: The survey reveals a greater investment in premium, professional content by all media marketers. Higher quality content, often sponsored, was seen to be most effective, and brands such as Tesco, O2, Virgin and L\u2019Or\u00e9al are now investing more than ever before in professional online content as part of their overall marketing strategy. Other trends, according to IAB Europe, are more time and more effort being spent on digital advertising across all marketers, although budgets are still small. As a result, a third trend is emerging. Quality content, with an increase in brands using online media in their planning and strategy alongside other mediums. Last, but not least, according to IAB, a fourth trend is that digital media is no longer a \u2018digital\u2019 medium \u2013 it is a medium which is being considered in every media planning meeting. What is more, IAB believes that European publishers are now happy again.\nMaking Online Digital: Europe Ready for Growth\nMore publishers report digital media advertising sales growth than before. According to IAB Europe\u2019s 2009 \u2018Making Online Digital\u2019 study 1, online advertising sales volumes grew by a much larger margin in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. For the first time since IAB Europe started publishing annual European interactive advertising figures, more publishers reported online advertising sales growth than online advertising sales decline. The study revealed that the online advertising industry remains recession proof and is even gaining strength. Overall, the study reveals an increase in display advertising, classified advertising, search advertising, email marketing, mobile advertising and premium advertising \u2013 but of course, as with print media, news media is still facing a serious challenge in this respect.\nIAB Europe\u2019s study is based on a new methodology, focusing on online advertising sales by companies which are principally engaged in publishing advertising space online and offline. As a result, the study includes companies where advertising sales represent most of sales revenues (as opposed to IAB Europe\u2019s earlier research which included companies whose advertising sales made up for at least 10% of total sales revenue). 72% of European companies\u2019 (of those included in the survey) online advertising sales were growing on a year-to-year basis \u2013 only 24.9% reported an online advertising sales decrease. The overall figure has increased significantly from 2008 when only 53% of European companies\u2019 online advertising sales were growing on a year-to-year basis. This positive trend was again evident across the board, with all types of media enjoying a significant increase in online ad revenues. Digital media was especially recession-proof as it was the first advertising medium to show a healthy profit and growth during the recession.\n\u2018Making Online Digital\u2019 survey results\nIn terms of online ad spending, the study found that online advertising revenues generated by European companies (of those included in the survey) increased from \u20ac28.6 billion last year to \u20ac31.2 billion during the last quarter of 2008 \u2013 a 8% increase. This figure is significantly higher than the previous figure of \u20ac20.5 billion reported in 2006. IAB Europe estimates the true figure to lie somewhere between \u20ac25 billion and \u20ac50 billion, and IAB Europe believes that the current figure is the most accurate to date as it also includes companies from countries", "Fusion's approach to the 2009 U.S. presidential election was an exemplary use of social media.\nIn the last week of voting for the United States\u2019 next president, both major parties launched\na significant effort to engage their base of younger voters online. The campaign efforts\nwere similar in some respects \u2014 both parties built microsites to organize grassroots\nefforts, and both parties relied on Facebook to generate support for the candidate of their\nParty while building relationships with their younger constituents.\nThe difference in the way each party managed the online discussion, however, was\nsubstantial. Republicans, who made significant use of traditional media from the start\nof the election cycle, maintained a similar stance when it came to social media.\nRepublican presidential candidate John McCain's Facebook page was launched early in the\nelection cycle. It was a standard profile where supporters could learn about McCain\u2019s\nplatform, join the campaign, and stay up-to-date on latest news. The page had over 17,000\nMcCain supporters as of November 3rd and was active.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's supporters on Facebook were much\nlarger \u2014 at 410,000, over one million in the aggregate. But in their case, supporters often\ncommented on the Wall of the candidate's profile page, which often featured\ndiscussion ranging from Obama's positions on various issues to campaign tactics to\nThe two candidates' Facebook pages took different approaches \u2014 Obama's pages were\nless active, but much more engaged; supporters there were talking, not just reading\nnews or taking actions that made a one-time political impact. The Obama team used\nthe platform as much as a place to organize campaign efforts as a place to keep people\ninformed about them.\nSUPPORTING TOOLS, PLATFORMS, AND WEB SITES\nFusion's online strategy also had several key features:\nGrassroots: Supporters were able to share their volunteer efforts with one another\nand with the rest of the group, which encouraged more people to get involved.\nShare your efforts or sign up as an organizer:\nFusion has an online organizer tool, which allows campaign supporters to sign up for\nevent volunteer hours and to help out with various campaign efforts. Supporters can\nsign up to give up-to-4-hours a week of their time to helping organize neighborhoods\nSupporters could:\nSign up for events and join one of the campaigns' 358 local groups\nSee what other supporters are doing, sign up for events and join one of the campaigns'\n358 local groups\nGet involved in a variety of local neighborhood efforts\nUse Fusion's organizer tool to become a local organizer and create events\nParticipate in a variety of group activities organized through their Fusion account\nCommunication: Fusion had a robust discussion community where all supporters could\nparticipate in the dialogue. A discussion about which candidate to support took place across\nFacebook, with members expressing their preference.\nVOTING: The candidate who garnered the most discussion votes would be the one to\nreceive campaign funding from Democracy Partners. Fusion had an active discussion board\nacross the Internet, so this helped generate a large volume of conversation.\nBONUS: Fusion used online marketing to get people involved, starting with 100\nparticipants. This gave the campaign momentum to work and resulted in one local group\nthat had over 1,400 members. Fusion had a local organizer tool that helped create new\nFusion's Online Marketing\nFusion used the following tactics to engage and organize its supporters online:\nUse a group name the same as the candidate's: Having Fusion's candidate's name\nas part of the group name helped create more online buzz.\nUse social media: Fusion used Twitter and Facebook actively, and both online tools\nwere in their initial stages.\nEncourage people to become neighborhood organizers: By encouraging supporters to\nbecome local neighborhood organizers Fusion was able to build momentum with their\norganizers. Fusion's local neighborhood organizers were able to generate local discussions\nby having supporters of that same candidate join a local group.\nCreate a local group in the candidate's name: To help grow the conversation to more\npeople, Fusion used a local community approach, where every county was", "A summary of the highlights of the conference is included in the May issue of the Journal but this\nconference in particular deserves a separate article. It was very well attended and has resulted in a lot of\naction. A brief summary of that can be found on the conference\u2019s web site.\nThis year\u2019s Conference was focused on the theme of \u201cClimate\nCommunications\u201d and the agenda was full. There were a variety\nof formats to deal with the complexity of the topic of climate\nchange: a presentation of the current state of climate change was\ndelivered by John Abraham, Professor at the University of\nMinnesota, followed by a presentation on a \u201cNew Science of\nClimate Communication\u201d by Naomi Oreskes. They made it\nclear that there have been lots of things done in the USA and\nelsewhere, and the USA has a lot going on with respect to\nclimate change. These talks were followed by a group session\non climate change (with participants working in a \u201cworld cafe\u201d\nformat to discuss challenges). Subsequently, Dr. George\nMonbiot participated in a panel discussing the media and climate\nchange together with Dan Cassidy of the Alberta EIA, David\nSuzuki, and Dr. Richard Lindzen of the IOP. Other session\u2019s\ndealt with what to do locally and what to do to create a\n\u201cClimate Change Bill of Rights\u201d (this led to many side discussions\non the way home).\nThe conference closed with the traditional AGM of\nCitizens\u2019 Climate Lobby Canada, the only one which requires\nan election of the board and the announcement of the\nnominations committee. That event was chaired by John\nFarrell of BC4W. There were 15 nominees for 8 openings on the\nboard but none were required. The results and presentations\nare available online at http://Citizensclimate.ca/.\nAfter a break at the end of the first day, the second day\nstarted with presentations by Peter Robinson of David Suzuki\nFoundation on climate change as a \u201cSustainability, Social\nJustice & Indigenous Peoples issue\u201d and by Chris Turner of The\nGuardian. The 4th plenary session was chaired by John\nFarrell and included a panel discussion on the topic of \u201cClimate\nCommunications \u2013 The Realities of the Climate Change \u2013\nBudgetary Trade-Off\u201d with John Klein at NRTEE, Paul\nKramer at the Pembina Institute, and Mark Cameron. There was a\nsession on communications \u2013 \u201cInnovations \u2013 Tools & Strategies \u2013\u201c\nchaired by David Dodge. Dr. Chris Wouters & Mr. Ian Bruce\npresented their views at the session on \u201cA New Approach to\nClimate Change\u201d (led by Chris Selley of the National Post). The\nlast plenary session of the day was chaired by George Monbiot\nand included Dr. Naomi Oreskes, Gabor Bojdewik,\nFrancois Dufour of Tides Canada, and Mark Kertesz of Sierra\nClub of Canada. This had to close the conference (otherwise the\nconference would have gone on to at least midnight!) although\nthere were some panel discussions later that evening outside\nthe conference room and others during the conference as\nwell as some of the breaks for drinks and coffee \u2013 perhaps a\nsubject for another article\u2026.\nOne very notable thing that everyone had noticed was that\nthere were many more participants of colour in the sessions\nthan in years past. This was very obvious to all. There were\nmany more Asian-Canadians at this event than any previous\none and it was very obvious that women participants made up\nas large a portion of the participants as the other gender. Of\ncourse CCL is known for being a women-friendly organization\nand it certainly felt that way at the conference. There were also\nfewer US visitors and more Europeans were seen. There\nwere also not so many people from Canada (perhaps for the same\nreason as there were fewer US participants). However there\nwas some consensus that this conference seemed less of a\nconference and more of a \u201csummit\u201d. There was a feeling that\neveryone seemed united on the issues and felt that a new approach\nwas needed. This summit type conference was intended to show the\n\u201cnew face\u201d of CCL to the public and to raise awareness about the\nfuture they want on the topic. The second part is also important\nbecause there was no way that this event was not going to focus", "A 330-mm-long 216 Hz sine-wave sweep (Fig. 1) with a frequency range of 75 Hz to 2500 Hz was used to generate sound pressure levels (SPLs) over a frequency range from 212.8 Hz to 2129.5 Hz (equivalent to 2 x 289.5 Hz - 2 x 144.75 Hz) for a 225 Hz sweep range.  A single microphone was used to record the noise and the sound pressure level (SPL) was calculated from the output of the microphone.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An analysis of the SPLs measured was performed over a 225 Hz sweep range from 212.8 Hz to 1757.5 Hz (equivalent to 144.75 Hz to 969 Hz).  There was a total of 146 measurements in this range.  As shown in Fig. 3, the 225 Hz sweep measurement range was separated into 4 groups of data and the mean SPL for each of these groups was calculated and plotted from which a regression trend was determined.  For all of the curves in Fig. 3, it is shown that as the frequency swept upwards, the SPL began at a 2 x 144.75 Hz (225 Hz) value that is equivalent to 125 dB(A) and then drops to a value of 112 to 117 dB(A) when the frequency is 112.5, 157.5,187.5, or 212.8 Hz respectively.\nThe trend that can be derived from Fig.3 shows that there are decreasing SPLs within the groupings and that the decreasing SPL values may be proportional from the results of the regression analysis in Fig. 3.  An analysis of the SPLs measured was also performed over a frequency range of 75 Hz to 750 Hz (equivalent to 212.8 Hz to 2129.5 Hz).  A regression based on mean SPLs for the groupings of data was determined.  The mean SPL values are shown in Fig. 4 and the regression curve is shown in Fig. 5 The trend for these data sets is identical.\n As illustrated in the plots of Fig. 3 and 4, a relationship between the SPL and the frequency (2 x 144.75 Hz), as shown in the plots, can be determined based on Fig. 3 and 4.  It appears that there is a declining trend within the frequency ranges from 75 Hz to 252.8 Hz (75 x 2 x 144.75 Hz).  This same relationship is seen with the analysis of the frequency range from 212.8 Hz to 2129.5 Hz (2 x 289.5 Hz - 2 x 144.75 Hz).  The range of 212.8 Hz to 893 Hz has about the same downward decline as the analysis from 212.8 Hz to 75 Hz.  The two series of measurements each show a similar relationship with each other.  It appears that there is a decreasing trend within the frequency ranges with the exception of the two frequency ranges between 212.8 Hz and 75 Hz and 212.8 Hz to 2129.5 Hz.  In these two narrow groups of frequencies, there is an apparent upward trend, with a peak at 2128.5 Hz.\nThere were 141 measurements for frequency ranges that contained both upward and downward trends and there were 19 measurements for frequency ranges that contained only an upward trend.  The means of the measurements taken for the two ranges of frequencies were calculated.  For the frequency ranges ranging from 212.8 Hz to 75 Hz and 212.8 Hz to 2129.5 Hz, the means were found to be 110.6 dB(A) and 98.9 dB(A), respectively.\nThe data for the measurements taken in a single sweep for both ranges showed that they had similar means and that", "Ad revenue growth across Europe\u2019s newspaper industry rose 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, according to the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA).\nWAN-IFRA, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers, reports that ad revenue growth across Europe\u2019s newspaper industry rose 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, according to the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA).\nDigital advertising growth of 1.2 percent contributed slightly to the overall rise, offsetting a 6.5 percent drop in print advertising revenues.\nAll newspaper segments showed an increase in revenue, with some stronger than others, according to the report.\nIncreases ranged from 0.8 percent in print advertising and 1.7 percent in print circulation revenue (total advertising) to 8.8 percent for new media revenue, 4.2 percent for print circulation, and 4.7 percent for print advertising.\nDespite a 2.3 percent drop in print circulation revenue and 3.5 percent in print advertising revenue, Germany\u2019s daily newspaper segment remains robust (4.0 percent annual growth in new media revenue and 3.9 percent in print circulation).\nThe French daily newspaper segment\u2019s print advertising and circulation revenue fell 7.6 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.", "This is the first true detective story the detective\u2014or anyone\u2014never expected to happen. Two bodies in two months, but are they connected?\n**A** RACLE\nThe rain was cold, like a slap to the face. The cold made the mud a little lighter; and the mud was heavy enough when it was not frozen\u2014it weighed men down like a stone. So the men inched along behind the officers, feeling each step, feeling their feet sink, their eyes straining with the effort of seeing.\nThey were marching along the path between thick banks of woods and swamp; ahead of them was a wall of rock covered with vines, and beyond it a clearing where there was no movement save for the slow motion of the officers' bodies, and the slower motion of the men behind them, and the dull movement of the bodies of the dead men. The officers wore uniforms of green; they kept their heads low to the breeze, their eyes on their feet. They carried rifles. The men behind them carried shotguns, and on their shoulders and backs were sacks with extra rounds of shells, their hands clasped with handcuffs. They would have to shoot the officers\u2014or, if they got the chance, all the officers\u2014they had been given orders to do so. They did not know what orders the officers had been given, and what orders they had been given about the officers: they were not clear where things led, or what it was all leading toward. They could hear in the distance the faint sound of the river, and feel the pressure of the hills behind them\u2014the hills that curved up to the east and the west, and in the direction of the river there was a line of straight hills, a long, long line; one hill was a black rock, with gray rocks at the top. They knew the men above them hated them\u2014they did not hate them\u2014and now they hated them even more than they had before, which would have been hard. They did not know what the men above them wanted, and did not know whether they would get it.\nAt the beginning, things had started to go wrong. Someone had done something, or not done something\u2014and these were their orders, to go forward, or take this detour, which did not make any sense at all, and was not going to make any sense, and they did not understand it. Something was always wrong; they never got straight information; the instructions and the orders and the plans had always been shifty\u2014the plans had always been changing\u2014and these had been the officers, and they were in charge. At first there had been orders to go to the main road, and then orders to proceed, and then orders to go to one side, or stand still; or for one day, or two days, orders for two weeks, or for the rest of their lives\u2014in all those months there had been no order that they could trust. Then, when things had finally started to go right, they got orders to break out\u2014orders to escape\u2014and these orders had been issued by the men who had once led them; who were now their captives, being held and guarded. They did not know for what, but then they had known\u2014because they had seen.

For the news to survive, it has to be willing to fail. Every big media company will have to, at some point, become a start-up company all over again, even if only for a brief period of time. The \u201cnew\u201d company will need to be small, nimble enough to move into niches and grow without being weighed down.\nThat\u2019s why we need more organisations that are prepared to take measured risks in new frontiers, some of which will fail, and are not afraid to have a crack at launching ideas that have never been heard before.\n\u201cNew ideas are the lifeblood of the industry,\u201d said Greg Clayman, CEO of the GlobalPost at INMA\u2019s World Congress. \u201cThe more ideas we put in place, the more chances we have to see something new and different work. We need to create an environment which is conducive to failure and encourage an entrepreneurial culture. The world we live in is very unpredictable and you need to be able to react quickly.\u201d\nIn a world of content abundance, the only way that news companies can grow is by creating new kinds of content that have not been around before, such as the kind provided by GlobalPost. Clayman described his organisation as an \u201coutsider\u201d company \u2014 the world in which it operates is not a predictable one.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of parallels between what we do here and what you guys [newsrooms] already do,\u201d Clayman said. \u201cWe are outsiders, we are start-ups, we are willing to fail, and are not afraid of the marketplace.\u201d\nIn a 2006 report, Clayman said that the news industry was no longer a \u201cmonopoly\u201d for news organisations and that the newsroom has become a \u201ccommand centre of operations.\u201d He said that the most profitable companies were those who had succeeded in managing this transition to a news centre management approach.\nThis management approach is not without its challenges, but what it teaches traditional news companies is that they must think like a start-up. They really need to be able to take risks, and to think beyond what has already been considered. That means having the courage and the desire to fail.\nTo truly change the way people experience news in the future, there has to be an unprecedented amount of failure. I would argue that the news industry of today is one of the biggest hold-outs resisting change and embracing the Internet.\nThere are still many, though I would argue not enough, who feel that their print business will thrive because they have a certain kind of content in their product. The problem is that this content is becoming less and less in demand, as people are increasingly turning to the Web for more interactive content.\nAs an example, let\u2019s imagine somebody who is a print newspaper subscriber. This person has been subscribing for years and will continue to do so for years to come. Yet, once these consumers get home, they\u2019re looking at articles on news sites like the Washington Post and BuzzFeed.\nWhy don\u2019t we try to embrace the Web and take the content we have in our newspaper and try a new way of producing it?\nFor example, rather than just creating news reports, it would be great to create a news portal with a lot more interactive content that brings more to the discussion, such that your reader can get involved. I\u2019m not talking about creating community forums as such, but rather a hub where people can discuss articles, where they can give their opinion and where they can interact more with each other, because that is what people today want.\nSo, what I\u2019m saying is that the digital news organisations have to be more ambitious. They have to be more willing to fail and try new things.\nIf I go to the local library, I may get to read a book that discusses how to improve my marriage. However, I can go to The Huffington Post, mydaily, or whichever new media company, in order to get some tips on better sex.\nWhere is the local newspaper or media company I can turn to for this kind of content?

We're in the process of writing a book for media salespeople, and had to determine why most of media's best people will never work in media sales. To do a book, we'll have to have many more interviews than for blogs or conference speeches.\nFirst, we are not looking for anecdotes or tales designed to shame any salesperson or sales training firm. There are plenty of those in the field. Our book is really a work of literary non-fiction, where the protagonists represent the best of the best. But those salespeople, in the very beginning, often make mistakes, or suffer from flaws that keep them from selling as much product as possible and as often.\nSo, I put the word out, and got over 80 responses in 48 hours. Some were so inappropriate I won't bother posting them. Most were in one of two categories:\n1. \"Hey Scott, I really want to sell media, but the job I have right now doesn't allow that. But here's why I won't ever get a media job...\"\n2. \"I had a job selling media and here's how I screwed it up...\"\nThe point of my blog this week is to show you, at least to the untrained eye, what NOT to do. If you are a seller of media looking for the job, you should take a hint from the mistakes and bad habits these people have -- whether or not you make them yourself.\nLet's start with a few rules for dealing with media salesmen or women:\n1. Give them a lot of money at a very large corporation; give them all the budget they need to close all the clients they want.\n2. Pay them a percentage of the money they sell. It doesn't matter whether you have to pay them their fee every month, they go out, do their thing and collect monthly.\n3. Pay them a bonus when they close clients, or their year end bonus is a percentage of the clients they put on the books.\n4. Pay them a bonus when they close a big client that has a large budget -- so you need to make sure your total is sufficient for media companies to pursue.\n5. When you have a good media salesperson in the building, don't cut his or her budget. Instead, give them more money.\n6. When you do cut back salespeople's budgets, tell them before the quarter or the year, so they can prepare themselves for the cuts when they occur.\n7. Let them decide who they want to sell to and how to sell, so they can do what works best for them.\n8. Don't have a sales manager or account manager telling them what to do in their sales calls. If you have done #7, you may end up with two salespeople selling to the same client -- in the best of business circumstances.\nHere now are three anecdotes where media professionals made mistakes, and a fourth where one did not, which will show you what to do, what not to do, and what you should say to a potential media or ad agency salesperson you may hire in the future.\n1. A rep called two days ago, and we talked for over half an hour. We need some clients right now, because we have some that don\u2019t have money right now. But I will have some to offer to pay him a commission, whatever he gets.\nNo, no, and no. Media salespeople will make a lot less money selling to small clients and those who cannot pay more than 5-10% of their budgets to media companies.\nFurther, when you offer commissioned sales, the salesman will tell you at their pitch meeting their plan for a budget he or she wants. You then say \"I'll guarantee you we've already budgeted that.\" Unless you want a media rep who will only sell to the most budget-strapped companies, don't play this game.\n2. The reason that many agencies have \"sales directors\" or \"VPs of sales\" is because a lot of media reps are dodo birds \u2014 they can't sell. The reason that they can't sell is because they sell to clients like yourself!\nYou said a few nasty things in two sentences, and then you made me feel bad about the clients who don't pay. The worst salesperson I have ever met was a managing partner at a huge national media buying agency who loved talking about how all media firms only wanted money and would sell to almost any client, whether or not they could afford their media budget. I never did buy into his", "The newest way to share and explore great content is a conversation.\nContent is what we say, and conversations are what we hear\nIt is not surprising that we are beginning to see more content on mobile and fewer ads. Google recently announced that people are accessing Google Search on more mobile devices than desktops for the first time.\nThe reason seems obvious; you can Google more anywhere. However, people want to learn when they are where they are. Mobile access means people can find information to learn more about things as and when they want, not just when they set aside time to do a Google search from a desktop computer.\nThe shift of people towards mobile consumption and mobile search is one that marketers are eager to follow and act on.\nContent as a core business strategy\nAs mobile consumption of content becomes more commonplace, and even the norm, for many people, content becomes an essential core business strategy.\nAccording to a Google/IPSOS study, \u201cThe Future of the Google Business,\u201d 75% of businesses responding to a global online survey believe it is critical to have a strong online presence.\nContent is not just the latest fad\nThe fact that content is still viewed as a strategy with staying power is important to marketers who want to be among the best known brands in their markets. Brands who are the go-to thought leaders gain their reputation on the quality and trustworthiness of their content. As consumers, we tend to trust experts, particularly when we can tell they put in the effort to make sure their content is accurate, well-written, and compelling. It\u2019s invaluable to a great brand to be recognized as a trusted thought leader.\nContent marketing does not need to start from scratch because it is made up of all of your expertise and knowledge. It just needs to be assembled in a way that is easy for your audience to access.\nConversations are replacing the way we read, engage, and share content.\nThe more you add, the more you learn\nThe more content you create, the more you learn, and the more you grow into a stronger brand in the process. The key to being a known expert on a topic is to be able to demonstrate your expertise time and again in new and engaging ways.\nContent marketing requires more time and effort, but it pays dividends in terms of the value it adds to your brand and business, and to your relationship with your audience.\nIn the end, content marketing means being a great content company and being a great content creator. It is about being passionate, knowledgeable, and committed to your subject matter.\nCONCLUSION: Content marketing builds trust through action, demonstrating your expertise, and showing how passionate you are about your subject matter. The newest way to share and explore great content is a conversation.\nPREV What are the best ways to learn the skills for brand newsroom success?

These reports and more were featured today on the Weather Blog, the Weather Desk and Local on the 8s. The weather continues unseasonably warm today and Thursday although the chance of precipitation increases for Friday and Saturday.\nOur main story today has to do with the National Weather Summary and the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor. We continue on a week-by-week look back of how the weather trended across the country. The national average temperature over the past seven days ranked as the fifth warmest from the weather bureau. We also had the fifth largest rainfall in March in over 70 percent of the contiguous United States. We're also looking at the current month of March and how this has ranked so far, both temperature wise as well as percentage of normal rainfall across the country. We go to the National Weather Summary in our First Alert Weather Segment. The Summary also gives a look ahead on what the weather will be like for the rest of the week before we take a look at the U.S. Drought Monitor.\nToday's Weather Blog featured the warmest and coldest weather extremes, rain and snow forecasts, and our First Alert Weather Video. The Highs were featured from across the country from today and yesterday. The lows, however, were featured from across the country from March 25th. A couple of these lows were from back in the 80s and 90s but we focused most of our attention on the last seven days. The Highs and Lows were featured in the Weather Blog to help you get prepared for the day.\nToday's Weather Desk Forecast talked about the weather for the rest of this week as well as beyond. The Desk also discussed any major changes we may experience for the rest of the week, especially for this weekend. We talked about the snow on the ground from Sunday and the chances of rain or possible snow for the rest of this week. We also offered some insight into what the weather would be like for your Friday commute and for the weekend as well. After we discussed today's local weather, we ended with a Look Ahead to the rest of this week, beyond. We discussed any major changes that we may see as well as what was going to be happening for the rest of this week and beyond. Today's Weather Outlook gave us a complete hour by hour look at what was going to be happening for the rest of the week. The Desk also looked ahead to some rainfall amounts for Saturday and Sunday.\nToday's Weather Forecast began with a look back over the past couple of days for those in the Central and Northern Plains where the snow was heavy. Today, we looked out ahead to a warmer Wednesday. We also checked out the rain in the Northeast which has now turned much warmer. However, the snow is in play today for those in Southwest and Central Plains. The Northeast continued with that rain which extended into the Carolinas as well. In the Southwest, we had that shower and thunderstorm possibility for the interior Southwest into the Desert Southwest. We also had that rainfall in the Central Plains for those in parts of the Central Plains and Upper and Lower Mississippi Valley. The Southeast and North Georgia still had the rain in play but it turned heavy. Today, the Eastern Great Lakes also had that heavy rain in play. Over the next couple of days, you could see heavy rainfall in the Upper Midwest as well. The Northeast remained wet and then we also have the rain extending into the Western Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. So, you can see just how much moisture was being pulled into the Continent and that was only for the past couple of days. The wet weather was starting to wind down in the West for Thursday. On Friday, we saw the return of some dry conditions from Central Plains to Mid Ohio Valley and into New York. Also back into that dry air was that snow and heavy rain from the Rocky Mountains to the Mid Atlantic and into the Northeast. Some of these rain totals could be in the 1 inch range. The Desert Southwest also had wet weather return on Friday as it did so in the Desert Southwest. However, that dry weather was returning to the Central Rockies and Midwest. A large band of heavy snow was also developing in the Rocky Mountains and High Plains into Saturday. For the East, we're still looking at a chance for light snow", "A news organisation\u2019s online video viewing platform can offer personalised suggestions that will attract a new online audience and grow the news organisation\u2019s online audience. The platform can also create a more interactive experience for news consumers.\nThis can lead to higher watch-times, more sharing, and a more engaged audience. News consumers can interact with their own local news organisation in a safe online environment.\nThis case study aims to illustrate how such personalised suggestions can create a more immersive experience for news consumers.\nThe results can be easily implemented for any online news organisation.\n\u201cA personalised selection experience for a niche brand is the key to sustainable growth for online newsrooms.\u201d\nOur mission: \u201cA selection of stories that you care about\u201d\nNews consumption in traditional newsprint or through television has become much more limited, according to a recent survey. News consumption via the internet has grown, but not in a uniform way. A great variation is witnessed between the different online video formats. This makes it more difficult to determine which news formats will gain popularity from the outset.\nWe have found that a format of online video content which is personalised and interactive will gain more popularity. News providers can use this knowledge and implement a customised selection experience which will build an audience and attract a whole new group of online-only news consumers.\nThe solution: Personalised recommendations for all devices\nOur recommendation strategy offers a tailor-made solution for news providers. The solution works on all devices, platforms, screen sizes, etc. A news organisation\u2019s online video consumption platform can offer the user the ability to personalise the content that will be offered to him based on his interest, preferences, and previous behaviour.\nThe news website can offer personalised suggestions which can take into account that the user has certain interests and preferences. It also builds a picture of his previous behaviour and uses this information to present relevant content in an appealling manner. Based upon the users\u2019 preference and behaviour, the news organisation can also create unique combinations, which a news organisation can experiment with to determine which combinations will prove to be most efficient in attracting and retaining viewers.\nOur strategy has been used on a successful basis in many countries and in many environments. This includes Norway\u2019s biggest newspaper group and numerous other local players.\nThe solution can be used for any online news provider\u2019s new news streaming channel and on the organisation\u2019s online video platform. It can also be used to create highly relevant personalisation across a site.\nThe results: Three recommendations will result in 700% more viewings\nOur recommendation strategy can lead to three times more video viewings during every online session. The three most important recommendations will lead to an even more significant gain. These three tips will therefore lead to more than 700% more viewings on a single session. This is even without any previous viewing of the video.\nIn this project, a video news website with a niche audience saw that it was in need of new ways to attract and retain viewers. The website decided to implement our recommendation solution.\nOur video recommendation strategy was introduced on the site\u2019s \u201cFront Page\u201d which has the highest possible reach on the site. It was also tested on two alternative personalisation places on the site.\nThe personalisation solution is highly relevant and the combination of this and the recommendations\u2019 design will encourage viewers to spend more time with the personalised video portal.\nThe personalised recommendations led to a 21% increase in viewing behaviour, as well as a 312% increase in \u201cwatch-time\u201d and a 240% increase in the number of \u201cpage views\u201d.\nThe result: A better viewing experience and a successful implementation\nWhen measuring the users\u2019 views and page views, the system is able to provide a \u201cmore customised experience\u201d as the users only see video recommendations that are highly relevant to their preferences.\nThe personalised recommendations will also help the news organisation to retain their audience and will lead to the development of a much more customized viewing experience.\nWe are happy to share this result with any organisations seeking to gain similar results.

The answer to that question is getting more and more complex as media consumption hab", "News organizations of all sizes can find their own success in mobile technology -- even before creating an app.\nThe question is not if newspapers should build an app. In fact, it's when. If 2012 is the \"Mobile Year,\" then why wouldn't a newspaper start building a mobile presence sooner rather than later? But even before you build an app, you can create mobile-friendly content on your Web site.\nThe problem with mobile is that in the short run, it creates a barrier to content -- at least, one that a newspaper publisher is generally not very good at building.\nUnfortunately, in the short term, creating a custom app isn't as straightforward as it should be. It's not as if someone can just create a basic mobile design and be able to use it later. At the same time, the idea of using the same design on tablet versus phone versus reader is anathema to many.\nSo many challenges are ahead that you'll lose readers before you ever make it to the app store. One of the best things you can do at first is make your mobile experience better right when you're loading.\nMobile is a whole new medium. When that little icon of a computer appears on your homepage, people feel like they're being asked to join another technology club of which they haven't got a key card. They don't know how to begin on a mobile device.\nAside from helping readers enter your new mobile world, they're also entering a new world in which a brand, your brand, is different. Mobile is going to change perceptions of many existing brands.\nThe challenge for newspapers in many ways is the same as one faced by every other traditional brand that has been forced to adapt to changing consumer demands. No one wanted to make newspapers available in an easy to read \"bite\" size before. Now no matter what newspapers do you'll always be a \"tablet\" version, and not the hard-printed paper.\nOnce you get past those hurdles, getting the content onto the phone takes some work. Every design team will have to go back to the drawing board and re-analyze how images are treated and formatted.\nYou need to make your content as accessible as possible, since many people are looking at your content on screen with a 5- or 6-inch small window.\nOne of the challenges with smaller screens is how you display content. You have to make it as accessible as possible to maximize all users.\nNews companies need to ask themselves, \"How can we help?\" How can you make it easy to do everything from commenting, bookmarking, and sharing to downloading additional multimedia elements that are part of the story? How do you make it easier to understand the story through graphics, design, and typography?\nAs you build for the mobile environment, you're bound to face some of the same challenges. If you want to have interactive features on your app, you'll have to deal with how they work on a small screen.\nThe good news is that the \"problem\" becomes a new opportunity over time. As we gain experience with mobile technology (particularly the more complex iPhone hardware), new features like voice dictation and near-field communications (NFC) will become common among users. Even if we never use them, we'll learn and incorporate the technology into our apps.\nWhat a mobile platform means to a business is that you have new opportunities for communication and engagement. How can you create a more personal relationship with your readers? How can you find more ways to reward readers? It's all very new and very exciting, even for an industry that's had a mobile presence for more than 100 years.\nYou can't ignore new technologies because your product has to work for the people in your city. While there can certainly be resistance, there is never a point where you can say, \"Well, we'll deal with that later.\" If you do, you're at an even bigger disadvantage than when you're just getting started and don't have the right technology yet. Don't wait!\nPRESENT: Don't confine your content to a mobile app.\nDon't build an app before you have compelling content that you can deliver easily to every mobile device. Once you have an app, consider how to offer the same information to mobile users but in an easier, more elegant manner, rather than a second-best alternative.\nConsider that a mobile device is different (different form factor, different content needs, different screen size).\nDon't treat your Web app the same as your print (or broadcast) app. They have different needs, and you've already decided what you'll offer where and when.

It\u2019s being used to serve ad units better and optimize time-based messages \u2014 when it works, it builds a relationship between the consumer and the advertiser, a relationship made stronger by the relevance of the interaction.\nUsing this information, Open Media Stack enables publishers to engage consumers in relevant exchanges. Relevant exchanges is a term we are using a lot at AOL, because our approach to advertising is fundamentally about relevance.\nIt\u2019s all centered on that idea of publishing in an open platform for consumers, advertisers, content creators, and developers. There\u2019s an interplay between those components.\nWe\u2019re finding what we call \u201cmoments\u201d. We\u2019ve identified the points in the user journey where they might want to click, buy, or share. Moments matter. They matter across our publishing and advertising businesses.\nWe do research across all platforms, including desktops, mobile environments, connected-TV devices, and wearables, such as fitness trackers. We look at all the devices people are carrying with them throughout the day from the minute they wake up until the minute they lay their heads down.\nIt\u2019s all about contextual content. You can reach all the people wherever they happen to be.\nWe\u2019re using data analytics to optimize content formats, timing, and messages for every moment of the day.\nMoments matter, whether they are on a desktop or a mobile or a connected TV.\nWhat is data analytics? It\u2019s really the study of patterns, whether you see them in the stock market or in Internet use or social media.\nAt AOL, we\u2019ve been fortunate that our CEO, Tim Armstrong, has always been in favor of investing in data analytics, and today we leverage that data for all of our media products. We analyze all of the things consumers are doing. The same sort of things we do with data in our advertising products we do with content on our advertising products; we do with content on Huffington Post we do with content on AOL.com.\nWe analyze the data from the Huffington Post articles that the readership is looking at on their devices and where are they reading them. Are they reading them on the subway, are they reading them in the airport, are they reading them on the way to work? Where are they reading them? What\u2019s important to them about that article? Are they looking at the content in a desktop environment? Are they looking at the content in a mobile environment? Are they looking at the content on a TV?\nUsing data analytics enables us to reach our audience at the right moments and on the right devices. We make sure to optimize for those moments throughout the day, taking into account the timing, the location, device, and the environment.\nAs we optimize, we\u2019re able to bring the most relevant advertising to them. That\u2019s what we did with the Superbowl \u2014 we went across many of our platforms and created a moment for the viewer, so they took a moment to watch that particular NFL ad.\nWe\u2019re using data analytics to optimize all of the content we create. We look at every piece of content that we produce and say, \u201cHow do we create a moment?\u201d\nHow do we create a moment \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a piece of content, whether it\u2019s a paid unit?\nHow do we create a moment? What\u2019s the content creator saying? How is the content creator thinking? How can we help that content creator deliver moments? It\u2019s what we do with the ads, so why not do it with the content too?\nI think it\u2019s really what\u2019s going to drive the future of content, as we", "This is the fourth in a series of three stories, each 90 minutes long, following The Rise of the Republic, the The Rise of the Empire and the Fall of the Republic.

The proposed revisions would, among other things, retain the current 12 percent risk-weighted assets leverage ratio for well-capitalized institutions and set a phase-in leverage ratio requirement to increase to 8 percent during the initial phase of credit unions' transition to the new capital rules. The revisions also would remove existing excess reserves thresholds, as well as the net worth margin over required levels and asset credit ration minimums, and replace those with new regulatory adjustments for both risk-based and leverage capital as part of the transition to the enhanced minimum capital requirements. The proposals are in response to recent action by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to permit phase-ins of the new capital framework and would help ensure credit unions can transition to the new capital framework as smoothly and efficiently as possible. This is a summary of the proposed revisions; interested parties may wish to review a copy of the proposal which will be posted on the NCUA Web site at http://www.ncua.gov. In addition, a copy may be received and reviewed at NCUA's Office of the Chief Economist located in the G-5 Building of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20006, or contact Susan Woods at (703) 518-6374.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Woods in the Office of Examination and Insurance, at telephone number (703) 518-6374, facsimile number (703) 518-6469, or by e-mail at supervision@ncua.gov.\nNCUA MAILING ADDRESS: National Credit Union Administration, Three Lafayette Centre Street NW., Suite 9257; Washington, DC 20001-2187 Attn: Chairman's Office; ATTN: Policy Formulation and Analysis Department. ATTN: Legal Division.\nNATURE OF AND REASON FOR CONSIDERATION: As noted, the final capital standards rule included in Part 702 of NCUA's rules and regulations, issued jointly by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and NCUA, was made effective January 1, 2015. The rule set forth the capital framework for the future of banks and holding companies in the United States and includes enhancements relative to the capital adequacy requirements in place prior to January 1, 2016. That date also marked the effective date of a rule included in Part 748 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations to implement its new risk-based and leverage capital minimums. In order to better reflect its risk-based and leverage capital minimums to the risk-based capital framework under the enhanced standards rule, NCUA has revised Parts 748.1 through 748.5 and Parts 761.1 through 761.2 in its rulebook to conform to the updated capital adequacy framework. This filing addresses amendments to Part 748 of NCUA's rules and regulations.\nNCUA may grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days for good cause shown (12 CFR 748.7). Any commentary received concerning this notice will be available to interested parties for examination in NCUA's Public Document Room.\n1. The proposed rule amendments are summarized as follows: Section 748.1-- Amend 748.1 to reference Part 702 of the regulation as a whole. The proposal would not affect the text of this section.\nSection 748.3-- Revise to replace the words \u201cMinimum risk-based capital\u201d with the new risk-based capital standard, which appears in Part 702 of the regulation.

So how can real estate agents harness the power of social media to make these connections? (And how can they do so in a way that fits in with their business plans?)\nIt's important to be sure that whatever platform you use to network online is right for your business goals, in addition to the specific tasks you want to complete. The good news is that most any platform that works for individuals will also work for businesses -- and if you already use these platforms the way you want to, you're likely to be successful.\nMost people already use at least some form of social media, but this variety of platforms is a double-edged sword for real estate professionals. There are numerous options -- each with its own audience, culture, and format. As many consumers as professionals use social media, so it's vital to understand which options will help you achieve your business goals, which you may not use at all, and which might not work well if you do -- and not everything might work at the same time.\nSo, let's take a look at six of the most popular networking platforms.\nLinkedIn is best known for the professional networking. It's the most popular platform for professional networking. This platform is designed for the sharing of expertise, and is one of the best platforms on which to network with professionals in your industry.\nLinkedIn is also useful for finding potential contacts for referrals and new business, with nearly half of all US professionals on the platform.

The two papers contend that the Wichita Eagle\nhas had a disproportionate share of  advertising dollars and has had\na \"cavalier attitude\" towards the Commission's rules. The Wichita\nEagle contends that it has consistently abided by the rules, and that the\nAssociation of American Publishers will provide an equal advertising\nopportunity.

Smith, Wichita\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Through the proceedings commencing in\n1990, the Commission has sought to ensure that media owners would not be\nable to use their newspaper properties to dominate the entire market\nfor Wichita, Kansas political advertising during election years. The\nCommission's final order and subsequent opinion, 7 FCC Rcd at 6521,\nordered 14 local newspapers, including the Wichita Eagle, to divvy up the\nmarket for political advertising in the Wichita market.\nThe parties first came to the Commission with respect to the Eagle in\n1991 after the paper published a billboard campaign in Wichita on behalf\nof a political entity, thereby, it asserted, violating the Commission's\npolicy of allocating advertising in Wichita to other newspapers.\nCommission Order, 4 FCC Rcd at 4567-4571, permitted that, but imposed\ncertain ceilings on how much the paper could spend on a billboard\ncampaign in any given period.  See id.  at 4582.\nThe matter returned to the Commission three years later, this time\nregarding the Eagle's decision to close its Wichita operations in mid-\nNovember 1991 because of a decline in its revenue. The Commission\nopined on January 22, 1992, that the paper violated the Commission's\npolicy by closing its Wichita operations, but did not order the paper\nto reopen. Pending before the Commission on February 26, 1992 was a\nmotion by the Association of American Publishers to permit the Wichita\nEagle to resume publication under a revised advertising policy. The\nCommission subsequently issued an order giving the Eagle until March 20,\n1992, to provide the Commission with a plan for providing the Wichita\ncommunity with an adequate newspaper.  Order, 6 FCC Rcd at 838-839. On\nMarch 10, 1992 the Wichita Eagle submitted a plan to the Commission\ncontaining proposals for reducing the number of newspaper delivery\nstops, allowing for more local news in the new reduced daily edition,\nand a specialized \"Business and Finance\" section. See id. at 879-881.\nThe Wichita Eagle, 1011 N. Topeka St., PO Box 533, Wichita, KS 67201,\nstates that under the plan the paper would \"accomplish its goals of\nproducing the best news coverage and the lowest effective cost per\nreader.\"  The plan proposes retaining the four current daily\nnewspaper editions (morning and afternoon editions in English and in\nSpanish) and eliminating the Sunday edition.  The plan also proposes\nallowing newspapers sold at retail locations (as opposed to subscribed\npapers) to be sold after 1 PM on Saturdays, to reduce the waste of\npaper in large quantities for Sunday editions.

So while it was a sunny bright winter morning in Chicago, the weather wasn't the reason I was awake at 6:30 a.m. This was March 6, 1986, and I was fresh from an exciting New Year's bash at a beautiful club in downtown Chicago. The party was great, but my night was over, and with an early 9:00 a.m. breakfast interview with the director of the Chicago office of CNN, I had nowhere else to be.\nThe reason I hadn't taken a later or later-in-the-morning appointment when CNN came through the Chicago Tribune, where I was working at the time, is I'd told my boss that on the first day of the second month of 1986, I would have my dream job: I was going to work for the first all-business cable news channel in the world. The interview went well, and though the director did not offer me the job, I was told this was only a formality. I was sure once he looked at the dozens of applicants and found even just one who was as qualified as I was, I'd be offered the position. I should have had a lot of reservations about working for the world's first all-business cable news channel.\nI've always liked to set the alarm for 5:00 a.m. and get up early. This habit has served me well in that I almost never have to be at work for 9:00 a.m., and more importantly in a career that would span 30 years, I have always been able to do something I looked forward to first, at the start of the day. I have no idea what I'm going to do next for the rest of the day, but I always know I get a couple hours in the morning to work out, go for a run, go see a movie, read the newspaper, have breakfast with my wife, Pam, or write. Once I get going with something, the rest of the day falls into place and I get a lot accomplished.\nMy 9:00 a.m. CNN audition was in no way related to my morning exercise routine. I love to work out and feel it sets the stage for the rest of the day. Now, at least this morning, it was going to have to take backseat to my job search.\nAfter my 9:00 a.m. with CNN, I was on my way to lunch with an old friend. I called him on the way, and had the feeling I had just won the lottery. In fact, he was calling because I had just won the lottery. I'd actually won something much better than a winning lottery ticket\u2014a job offer from the Tribune Company.\nThe Tribune Company, with its legendary publishing arm\u2014the Chicago Tribune newspaper\u2014was the most prestigious company in Chicago and probably in America when it came to", "How Does a Mudder Do It? (July 5-11)\nIn the last 7 days we've covered some pretty big items, some fun\nmini-stories and some very funny anecdotes.\nMy favorite mini-story came courtesy of Buzzfeed's Caitlin Dickerson\nand Sarah Mirk, who compiled video interviews about how people\ncelebrate the Fourth of July in this \"very America\" compilation.\nThough it makes me feel old, I was once a youngster who went off\nto watch fireworks with friends and family in a nearby park.\nI've always had a soft spot in my heart for anecdotes, so I also\nenjoyed The Washington Post's recent compilation of stories\nabout a particularly bad day on Capitol Hill. From aides falling\nasleep in meetings to representatives having their clothes ripped\noff, it's a great read.\nHow Does a Mudder Do It?: The Obstacles and the Opportunities\nRunning a marathon is, by all measures, challenging. 52.2 miles\nfor an amateur (less-than-an-elite) runner takes a very specific\nphysical and mental preparedness.\nBut to run a half marathon and then run an obstacle course and\nthen return to the half marathon (thus running another half\nmarathon) is quite frankly crazy.\nA \"mudder\" (or \"mud run\") is a physical challenge like no other.\nIt's more than 13.1 miles of a mix of running, climbing, swimming,\ntubing and a myriad of other things that would make this column\nan endless list of funny anecdotes.  It's much more than your\naverage 5K.\nSo we asked some people who have done this to give their recaps\nfor the rest of us who are probably not crazy but maybe a little\nbit crafter.\nThe first one, and probably the coolest, is from my personal\nfriend and running blogger, Sam, who wrote a brilliant blog about\ndoing a mud run with her 12-year-old son.  It's so good that I\nasked if I could borrow and republish it here.\nSometimes, on our long runs, we talk about doing mud runs together,\nand I say, \"Let's just start doing it!  I'll never be in better\nshape than I am now\" but no matter how many times I raise\nthis obsession, he is not interested.  He knows that my mind\nis too crazy for him to let me talk him into anything I want\nat the moment.  When I heard that Mudderella was coming to\nDC for a weekend, I was thinking to myself, \"Oh my gosh, Sam will\ntotally do this\" but not my son.  And then the following weekend,\nI was invited to do it and I said to him, \"This is so lame and\nI know you won't want to do THAT but ...\"\nAnd he said, \"You are so doing this!\" So I did! But he was right,\nit was lame.\nThe course was very muddy and very wet, there were so many hurdles,\nand it just seemed long and stupid and exhausting but at the end,\nI was so happy to have done it.  It's not like a typical 10K by\nany means, but I would definitely do another one.\nYou can check out her blog here, follow her on Twitter @sammym25\nand, of course, follow her on Twitter at @sammy_25_25.\nThe next post comes, again, from a friend of this newspaper.

Google Inc et al. In a 55-page order Judge\nClancy found that Google's use within the 11 Java APIs at\nissue infringed Oracle's copyrights. However he also said that\nthe evidence so far did not support a finding that Google acted\nwillfully in violating Oracle's copyrights.\nThere are two parts to the injunction. The first relates to\nJava SE technology, which Google used for the Android OS project.\nGoogle is required to discontinue any act of infringement until further\nhearing in the case.\nThe second part deals with Oracle's patents. Here Clancy\ndecided that Google cannot use the two packages containing several\npatented claims in the Java APIs.\nThe judge said that Google had \"unquestionably\" violated Oracle's\ntrade secrets and unfair competition rights with its use of the\njava APIs. The only remaining question was if Google had\npurposely violated copyright law.\nJudge Clancy wrote in his order that the burden of proving\nwillfulness was on Oracle. For the patents Google was not found\nguilty in Clancy's opinion.\nThe judge said that although Google may have known that the API\npackages were under copyright, the evidence was insufficient to\nestablish that it intentionally developed \"a blatant\nwillful violation of Oracle's rights\".\nClancy also said Google could not argue that \"fair use\" of\nthe material in Android precluded finding any violation. The\ndistrict court judged that fair use was not a defense against\nunauthorized use of copyrighted material and that since Google\nhad no license to use the packages in question for the use at\nissue, its fair use claim was misplaced.\nAs far as Oracle's trade secrets and unfair competition claims\nwere concerned, Clancy noted that those claims were based in part\non a \"confirmatory\" e-mail sent by Google's engineering director\nto his colleagues. Clancy ordered that the e-mail be sealed and\nnot be released without his direct orders.\nThe case is one of the most complicated patent, trademark\nand copyright cases in the software industry in this decade.\nOracle wanted $7.7 billion, Google argued it should only hand\nover $50 million in patent licence fees and $1 per copy if it\nused Android in more than 16 countries. The latest action came as\nthe parties tried to discuss a settlement for the case.\nFor Oracle the court injunction is good news. It said it\nwould ask the judge to rule that Google should pay at least $150\nmillion in royalties.

The search giant\ninitially denied any wrongdoing before subsequently\nsettling with Sun Microsystems for around $40m.\nhttp", "Talking the 'Big-I' talk, the BT/Newsis pact and what newspapers (not just in Europe) can learn from each other.\nNewspaper Summit Europe in Brussels, Oct. 29-30\nNEWSPAPER SUMMIT, BRUSSELS\nLawrence Parsons, chief executive of Independent News & Media, is very focused on the key to keeping the brand young, vibrant and innovative.  Parsons, who is co-chairing the 2nd annual Newspaper Summit Europe in Brussels alongside M. Pierre-Michel Caubet, general director, Groupe Hersant, described the current situation in the market from a global perspective.  Parsons gave a snapshot of all the problems for both new and veteran newspapers, and pointed clearly at some solutions.  \u201cThere are lots of signs out there that things are not good,\u201d he said.\nAside from the current worldwide print advertising slump, there are other threats to the printed newspaper.  Parsons told the audience that people used to reading a newspaper over breakfast are now spending those precious free minutes searching the internet for news.  The rise of broadband, cable and the internet as viable information sources has brought up a host of challenges for print publishing \u2013 from competing with advertising in the space sold to other print publishers down the same alleyway, to trying to provide the same content but more cheaply over the internet.  Parsons pointed out that print readers and advertisers are much less price sensitive in their print media than in the internet environment.\nHe pointed to the 67th most popular story for the first two months of 2001 being a piece about the U.S. national security adviser Sandy Berger\u2019s resignation at The New York Times.  \u201cThis is the story of the 10th largest daily in the U.S.,\u201d Parsons said.  \u201cIsn\u2019t it a shame nobody ever clicked on it?  Of course we should all care.  It was one of the most important security breaches in the last decade and it was completely unreported in the digital environment.\u201d\nParsons pointed out that the most eyeballs the story got were 1,500 for the print version.  \u201cThe print newspaper has some advantages,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt takes longer for people to consume information from a screen and the Internet is good at getting short attention spans to consume a lot of information more quickly.  This is not just a good thing for advertising, it\u2019s a good thing for readers, as well.\u201d\nAside from the internet, Parsons said there are other challenges for newspapers.  \u201cThe biggest threat is that we are going to be locked in a competition not with each other but with ourselves,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe will become locked in a battle with ourselves and the way to win that battle is to have the most innovative editorial products in the marketplace.\u201d\nHe pointed to recent success stories in the UK from Newsquest, Trinity and The Hersant group showing that it is possible to improve circulation figures and newspaper quality.  In the UK, there are some papers that have held their circulation while others have risen.  According to Parsons, it is the \u2018Big I\u2019 \u2013 innovation \u2013 that sets successful newspapers apart.  Newsquest, he said, is an example of a newspaper group that has used innovation \u201cto stay ahead of their competitors and in some cases beat their competition.\u201d  Newsquest, he said, is investing more and more heavily in new product development.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like \u2018Big Is Good\u2019 as an expression,\u201d Parsons said.  \u201cAt a certain point it is just big because it is big.  You can do the same thing, but you do it in a different way.  We are trying to be the most innovative in the 180-odd countries in which we operate.\u201d\nFrom the standpoint of advertisers, Parsons said they like to be in a newspaper owned by people who care but who are not owned by the news.  He says that being independent and having a good product are the best selling points for a newspaper.  To show how they are pushing the envelope, Parsons pointed to the 600 different iPad titles that Newsquest will offer with subscribers able to read one for as little as 52p.  Parsons said that Newsquest\u2019s sales results in the UK show their strategy is working.\nIt is the same story on this side of the Atlantic.  Parsons pointed to The Irish Times\u2019 iPad title of the same name", "The new digital world, with its\nexploding, dynamic communication is a wonderful opportunity for brands\nthat make things\nthat sell.\nAnd for all those that write about\nthem.  In the first half of 2005 alone, there was news on consumer-\nfocused brands that sells, whether it was Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs,\nSafeway groceries, or Sears. Some of the names will surprise you, others\nwill be totally new to you, but one thing is for certain after reading\nTony's new book: the media landscape that exists now is just the tip\nof the huge iceberg that is coming in the next few years.\nTONY SIMMONS:\nI'm a strategist, creative, journalist, presenter, marketer,\nadvertiser and producer \u2013 all wrapped up with a little bit of\nauthor/publisher in there. But it's my job to understand brands and\nhow brands work. Brands aren't just logos or the occasional ad. If\nyou take a good brand \u2013 the Apple iPod for example \u2013 it has\nbecome an entirely independent and very strong media brand in its own\nright.  It has a personality, it has a brand promise, it has\na visual identity, it has a voice, it even has its own\nculture and its own fandom. Apple created a new media product to\nlaunch this particular brand.\nAnd, of course, Apple has other brands as well, Macintosh,\nIpods, Pcs, music stores, and they also create brands for their\nretail environments, retail stores, offices and so on.  And that's what \"Brands That\nSell\" is about. How to create brands that sell and the\nwhole ecosystem around that.\nBrands that sell can be an idea, a person, a product, a\nservice, an experience, a lifestyle, a value proposition or a personality.  In fact,\nin most cases it's all of those. The only thing that these brands\nhave in common is that they sell or they have the objective to sell\nsomething, either something that the consumer is happy to\nfinally get their hands on, or something that needs\nconsumer awareness so that it can get to market more efficiently.\nThis book is about the tools and techniques that are used in\nbrand strategy to create powerful 1-2-3 combinations that then\nlead that brand to either win market share or achieve a\nsituation where they have a huge market share, like in the case of Starbucks.  But they\ncan also be used to generate revenue and create profitable\nbrands and media brands.  This book really covers it all.\nBuzz is a great thing.  Word of mouth is not a one-day\nphenomenon; you have to plan, build trust and then maintain\nthat trust to make sure that your buzz is maintained.  And at the\ncore of that is to do what brands do best \u2013 create relationships\nand then nurture that relationship by understanding your\ntarget audience, and then acting on that.\nAll media, content, creative and advertising is really about\nrelationships and the management of those relationships. Advertising and good storytelling have always had this element of creating relationships and\nhaving an emotional connect. And this whole new communications\necosystem is all about building relationships between the brands, the clients and with\nthe consumer so that we can make the brands that sell a whole lot better.\nTo talk more about the concepts of 'brands that sell,'\ncheck out Tony's new book, \"Brands That Sell: 1001\nStrategies and 1010 Tactics for Products and Services.\"\nVisit the publisher, Allworth Press: BrandsThatSell.com\n\"Brands That Sell\" also is available at Amazon.com and\nAmazon.ca and through most online bookstore worldwide.

The regulations are necessary to meet the\nrequirements of the International Commission for the Conservation of\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT), which has management measures in place for\nthe fishery that are necessary to ensure sufficient fish remain in\nthe stocks to support sustainable fisheries into the future.  The\nregulations are designed to improve the sustainability of the\nfishery by implementing the quota management system at ICCAtlantic\nTunas.

Its design is based on a strong concept, which is the sun. There are pictures of the sun on every page along with words and headlines. All the words and elements work towards highlighting one idea - the sun as a concept of the day in the life of a citizen.\nIn other words, circulation-building tactics are more about art.\nTake again the Sun. It has a strong headline - \"News from here.\" It plays on a psychological idea that people in other parts of the world are just like citizens. So people here should feel attached to people in other parts of the world.\nWe are not in charge of how the headline plays in any newspaper or market. But as producers of news, we must not ignore the art and psychology side of the job - even though it is not news or a tactic. The whole newspaper must be structured with an editorial approach that connects readers to people, events and societies that are new to them, or known to them, but are different to the way they experience them in their localities. That is how we build bridges.\nIn order to help people build bridges, you must understand the bridges people cross.\nThe most important thing to understand for any newspaper is how people build bridges to their home, their neighbourhood, the place they call home.\nThe first bridge is the natural environment, the environment around people, the landscape. For instance, the landscape where people come from is often a feature in newspaper stories, and so is the weather.\nThen we cross the neighbourhood itself. Bridges to family and friends are very important, whether you are in New York or in a small town in Nebraska. Then bridges are built to school, sports and other local activities.\nCrossing bridges is a journey of discovery of a neighbourhood. It is a journey of discovery of the neighbourhood that surrounds us, and the larger society that we are not accustomed to.\nCROSSING BRIDGES IS A JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD\nThen we cross bridges into the world. We are, after all, citizens of the world, and we must see the whole world in the newspaper. News of other countries and societies are very important to build bridges between worlds. We have to experience other worlds to build bridges. This is the main purpose of international news.\nThere are many bridges to be built. For instance, bridges to new languages to learn, to new countries, to new arts and histories. A newspaper should open all the doors of the world.\nThen there are bridges to people. People are important to build bridges - to our families, friends friends, as well as strangers. Bridges will help us expand the people we feel connected to.\nThere are also bridges to communities, bridges to a wider society outside our immediate neighbourhood. A newspaper should help everyone build bridges, so that we can see where we are and what our connection is with the world around us and what we are experiencing in the world.\nBridges will also help us discover ourselves, because we can see who we are in our neighbourhood, in what we do in sports, in how we interact with our families and friends, in what we discover about our town, the town, our state, and our world. Bridges help bring people and groups together to create something.\nThere are bridges to a past, bridges to a future. It is through bridges that we can get an overview, a perspective, of what has happened to us and around us. We also get an overview of what we are and of what we are going towards. It's through bridges to the past that newspapers can understand society and culture better.\nWhen you see these bridges, you see the journey of discovery in the act of crossing them.\nBy understanding these bridges, you can know how your readers are building bridges. You can know what they are looking for when they cross a bridge. And you can use this knowledge to write stories, to create ideas for pictures and artwork that help readers across bridges.\nTake the example of a newspaper in Nebraska, USA.\nThe editor wanted to publish a series of stories and photographs about life in the city of Lincoln, called \"Day 101 of Me", "The Commission amends \u00a779.18 and \u00a761.104 of its rules to   adopt a procedure for permitting one-time   emergency use of the UHF Television Channel 41 in 56    markets, and modifies the rules to make technical corrections.\nDATES: This rule is effective October 11, 1999.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jill Reiser, Media Bureau, 202-418-2488.\nPetitions for Reconsideration must be filed by October 1, 1999 and   the reply by October 8, 1999.  If multiple parties are involved in a joint    reconsideration petition, one of the parties must act as the   coordinator of the reconsideration petition. In the case    of a consolidated petition by multiple parties, a party        must submit a copy of a consolidated petition and a statement        of the party's position on the petition. Unless the Commission    specifies otherwise, all of the requirements in this section apply to    any reconsideration petition filed after September 1, 1995.        If a reconsideration petition is filed by parties who are not    the original petitioners, the original petitioners must be notified       of the filing. The original petitioners may file comments on            the petition, which will be considered by the Commission, but        not as part of the record in the original proceeding, unless the       original petitioners file a motion and establish good cause why        the petition should be part of the record in the original       proceeding.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    On August 6, 1999 the Commission released in a Report    and Order (FCC 99-128) a procedure for allowing one-time          emergency use of UHF TV Channel 41 in 13 markets for the purpose          of providing emergency alert information related to Hurricane      Andrew.  FCC 99-128 included a Notice of Proposed       Rulemaking (NPRM)/Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM)     in which the Commission proposed to amend its Commission's rules     to permit one-time emergency use of UHF TV Channel 41 in 56 markets.\nIn FCC 99-128, the Commission determined that the     short timeframe in which the emergency alert was developed and the    urgent nature of providing emergency alert information justified the     waiver of rules that require the filing of construction permits       for the assignment of licenses for new television facilities.\nOn September 22, 1999, the National Association of Tower       Erectors (NATE) filed an Emergency Petition for Special          Dispensation or Stay.  The petition requests that the Commission        delay the implementation of the technical rules necessary to        complete the broadcast of emergency information.  NATE stated that it filed        the petition to allow the Commission to review the technical aspects        of the broadcasting emergency alerts in the UHF Band.  NATE's       arguments are discussed in the analysis of the 155 pages of       comments filed in response to the NATE petition.\nDue to the large amount of written submissions on the       NATE Petition and the length of time necessary to review a large      amount of written submissions, the Commission declines to adopt        in this Proposed Rulemaking a rule for emergency use of the UHF TV      Channel 41 as proposed in FCC 99-280.

But on this story I\nwanted to write you a brief note.  My life's major job was to\nwrite crime stories for the Richmond (Virginia) Times-Dispatch\nin the 1950s.  The story I would like to send you is the very\nfirst crime story I ever had published in a morning newspaper.\nIt was the fall of 1952.  I think I was 25 years old.  The\nRichmond Police said they were ready to arrest a 42-year-old\nman for what I was told was a long pattern of sex with young\ndaughters ages 12,14,16 and 17.  The parents of the young\ngirls were now in Virginia waiting for the arrest.  The\nmother of the younger daughter had heard about this from a\nfriend of the mother.  She and the father of the younger\ndaughter did not know about this crime until this mother\nheard it from the other mother and called the police,\nalthough she had noticed the girls being seen and talked to\nby the older son of the suspect.  (The police said it\nseemed likely that the young suspect boyfriend was now the\nfather of the younger 14 year old's baby.)\nAll the Richmond Police required was my promise not to\ntalk about the pending arrest before the day they said it\nwould take place, which turned out to be a false\nprediction.  That was the story I sent to the newspaper and\nit came back the following Tuesday, a few days later.  (An\nearlier version of it appeared in this web blog, with all the\nnames changed to protect the identity of the innocent and the\nguilty.)\nThe Richmond cops were going to arrest the pedophile (they\ncalled it that in those days, although they were careful to\nspell the word with a \"P\" because the word \"pervert\"\nwould have been derogatory and unacceptable to the media) at\nthe home of a middle-aged married couple with four daughters\nranging in age from early teens to 20-something.  Someone got\nto me early on Monday and said the arrest was going to be\nscheduled for Monday afternoon.  I was told to not go near\nthe planned arrest place after the arrest.\nI was told to not be at the scene of the arrest when the\ncops came knocking at the door.  They told me that the 42-year old suspect was already in jail and that they were\ngoing to arrest the husband and wife of the suspect and the\nspouses of all four of the victims to try and get them to\ntell police where the others were (the parents and other\nfamily of the victims).  The plan was then to get them to\ntell the police where the pedophile was, the home where he\nwas found.  (I found out later that the police did not go to\nthe house to begin with.  Instead, they brought the suspect\nfrom the jail to one of my police contacts I knew who lived\nnearby and then took the suspect away to another police\nstation where the interrogations then took place.  This\nis probably why the wife and the others were arrested at the\narrest house and in turn led to their being arrested that night\non their way to church.  It was a mistake that may well have\ncost me my job because I was the only one not present at their\nsecond-day interrogation.

In the more than six decades of his life, Twain was born, spent 63 of those years in the same village in Missouri, and then died there as well, an accomplishment which has made him into a local folk hero, with a museum in his home and a statue in his honor placed in front of the courthouse in Hannibal. In his lifetime, Mark Twain was mostly a newspaper writer. He started writing at the very young age of 11, contributing to \u201cthe boys\u2019 paper\u201d in his hometown, \u201cThe Hannibal Journal.\u201d He became a printer\u2019s apprentice at 14 and in his teens published some of the first short short fiction in American literature, appearing in popular papers like The New York Saturday Press. He began his career as a newspaper reporter at age 17, before becoming a riverboat pilot at 21. It was as a riverboat pilot that Twain gained a real-life taste of the humor he\u2019s best known for. It was on a river trip that Twain met a young man named Thomas Paine Aldrich, a reporter and editor for a publishers\u2019 clearinghouse in New York City. Aldrich became a lifelong friend of Twain, and helped him get his first book published. In 1870, Twain\u2019s humorous travel accounts of the West, Innocents Abroad and Roughing It, were immensely successful. In the following years, his other major books were widely influential including Life on the Mississippi, The Gilded Age, and A Tramp Abroad. From 1873 to 1887, when the New York Publishing Company offered him unlimited support and resources, publishing 13 books, Twain produced over half of his fiction\u2014including a masterpiece of satire, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and one of the most acclaimed books of the 20th century, his autobiography, which took seven years to write and was finished on October 18, 1904. In 1904, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, now 72, who had struggled with lung problems for years, was bedridden when fire broke out in his library. The manuscripts he was working on, along with his 12 remaining unpublished books were destroyed, and Twain\u2014whom some feared had been lost in the flames\u2014later wrote to his friend: \u201cNo pen can describe my grief, my horror, my despair, and I can\u2019t describe them even now, though I was 20 minutes in the fire.\u201d A week later, however, Twain died after five months of illness; he had contracted pneumonia in September. Twain left behind 89 handwritten manuscripts.\n{\"cdnAssetsUrl\":\"\",\"site_dot_caption\":\"Cram.com\",\"premium_user\":false,\"premium_set\":false,\"payreferer\":\"clone_set\",\"payreferer_set_title\":\"American Literature\",\"payreferer_url\":\"\\/flashcards\\/copy\\/american-literature-328213\",\"isGuest\":true,\"ga_id\":\"UA-272909-1\",\"facebook\":{\"clientId\":\"363499237066029\",\"version\":\"v2.9\",\"language\":\"en_US\"}}", "A woman's hormones start to shift after reaching her mid-thirties.

The first stage is the beginning of symptoms: PMS, cramps, weight gain, fatigue. However, they only get worse:\na premenstrual breakdown, severe abdominal cramps,\nanxiety and irritability, depression, crying spells, and headaches.\nHer menstrual cycles shorten. She is less able to cope with stress and tension. By her late forties, hormonal changes begin to cause symptoms more severe than previous menopause: dry skin, dry mouth, hot flashes, insomnia, joint pain, memory loss, and poor vision or loss of night vision.\nMid-life crises lead many to mid-life depression. Many find themselves depressed, disoriented, or disillusioned. Depression, anxiety, and agitation can cause physical changes, including increased intestinal activity and increased blood flow that causes fatigue and migraine headaches, among other problems. Some have reported problems with sex drive and urine incontinence.\nDepression, agitation, insomnia, and anxiety are all symptoms of anxiety, a condition more common than heart disease and cancer put together. Anxiety is a disorder characterized by feelings of uneasiness and apprehension, and it is the leading problem of women today.\nHormonal changes in mid-life and menopause also cause many symptoms, from hot flashes, headaches, and night sweats to fatigue, sleeping problems, and anxiety. Hormones and emotions can both be factors in depression.\nThe only way to prevent the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome or menopause would be to remove the ovaries at or before the onset of symptoms, but there is no reason to do that unless you can find a different cause for the symptoms.\nThe answer to this condition is to improve your hormonal balance.\nThis can be achieved with nutritional supplements and vitamins. The first and most important step for women will be to reduce their consumption of polyunsaturated oils and take olive oil and vitamin E supplements instead.\nWomen will also want to take Vitamin D and calcium supplements, and supplements of vitamins A and C. These can all be found in capsule form as one product, EFA Advantage.\nB vitamins may also help, as they help the body metabolize fat. Some women have found that ginseng and ginkgo help, as well, along with other vitamins and minerals, including\nvitamins A, C, B-complex, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and boron.\nOther herbal supplements and alternative therapies may help as well. Acupuncture has shown promise and is worth exploring. Lifestyle changes are another option. Some women can benefit from exercising and eating a better diet.\nHypnosis and biofeedback may likewise be helpful in the management of anxiety and stress. There are also a number of self-help strategies for stress, including relaxation and imagery techniques, yoga breathing and other relaxation techniques, progressive muscle relaxation, tai chi, and Pilates.\nPracticing good sleep hygiene can help as well. That includes practicing good sleep habits: going to bed at the same time every night, avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and TV or computer for at least an hour before bedtime, and making one's bedroom sleep-friendly (dark, cool, and quiet).\nTreating stress through biofeedback can help\nstress is the source of all disease:\nstress causes anxiety, depression, and mood swings,\nand eventually leads to an autoimmune disease\n(IBS, psoriasis, RA, MS, fibromyalgia, etc.).\nWhen a person undergoes chronic stress,\nstress produces chronic, unrelenting\nhormones. Eventually, the person develops\nan autoimmune disease.\nAutoimmune diseases cannot be cured.", "In this matter, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London v.  Ace American Reinsurance Company,  ICA 4104082, The  Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed Ace's summary certificate of  appeal of the court of appeal's decision in which Ace appealed only certain  issues that it had raised at first instance.  This is the first copyright judgment in Canada to consider and ultimately  approve copyright's fair dealing exception with respect to  education and determination of the appropriate standard of review.  The analysis herein is applicable not just to the  use of copyrighted materials as textbook material but also to the use  of that material in a distance learning capacity.  Whereas British Columbia's copyright legislation contains the exact same wording concerning the fair dealing exception as Canada's  Copyright Act, British Columbia has adopted, via the Supreme  Court of British Columbia, a different interpretation of the  applicable test (a test in which a different standard of review, for  non-delegated federal power cases, is ultimately applied).  This case is important because one cannot assume that the federal  government does not have the legitimate ability to regulate the  fair dealing exception in relation to education and distance  learning.  The fact that Ontario's courts have adopted a different approach does  not change the fact that the federal government has the right to  revoke or amend the applicable legislation.  Where, as here, the  applicable legislation expressly provides for an exception where the  use is \"fair,\" then absent some very specific text or other  evidence to the contrary, Parliament is entitled to interpret the word \"fair\"  in relation to educational purposes.   The decision provides for, and endorses, the use of copyrighted  materials in distance learning as long as the fair dealing test is  applied and that the copyright holder is afforded their appropriate  remedies upon proof of infringement.  The court also stated that Canada's Copyright Act does not preclude fair use of copyright materials for the purpose of teaching in a distance-learning capacity.  At page 51, the court states that \"[i]nsofar as the 'fair dealing' provision of the Copyright Act is concerned, we must look to the provisions of the  current federal act, including the addition of s. 32.1 that was created in  2000.\"  The federal government has the power to revise, amend or revoke  the fair dealing exception but it must act in a fair manner and not deny  copyright holders adequate protections.  It seems evident that fair dealing must be interpreted in relation to education.  It is possible that the use of the term  \"fair\" in the definition of fair dealing is a mistake because the word is  often misunderstood as being absolute and not subject to any other reasonable  circumstances that can be taken into consideration so as to provide for  fairness on both sides of a transaction.  To suggest that Parliament did not  envision a possibility of fair use does not make sense.  If the fair  dealing provision provides only for a defence to copyright infringement, then  obviously it is not to be considered as an exclusive licence.  This  is also demonstrated by Section 29 where the fair dealing exception  is listed as one of many exceptions to copyright infringement (the  others include research, private study, criticism, review, news  reporting, education, satire, and parody, to name only a few).  According to the Court, s. 29(3) can be viewed as expressly permitting a court to consider all of the circumstances of the case.  A summary of the case's  decision is provided at page 42.

Traditional businesses will be forced to transform themselves into digital businesses, so that they would not be overtaken by the new media.  How should the newspapers, in the new context as digital players, transform themselves?", "Navigating social conversations requires a different set of skills than traditional marketing strategies and requires marketers to think differently to achieve success.\nThere has been a lot written about social media and how it\u2019s impacting our lives. We\u2019ve seen how social media has empowered us to communicate and be connected in ways once unimaginable. But we can't ignore how social media and the Internet have given us access to the collective knowledge and wisdom created by the millions of people working and playing online. Our role as social media marketers now also includes mining this collective wisdom to inform our decision making and business strategy.\nAt the heart of this \u201ccrowd intelligence\u201d concept is what I call the five C\u2019s - connect, collaborate, challenge, collect and critique. As marketers, the most important principle for you is the fifth C \u2013 critique. To quote the old saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t manage people; you can only lead them.\u201d As we seek to create the next generation of marketing excellence, we need to understand how to help marketers manage and guide their audiences to a better collective result using the power of connective tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, YouTube, Blogs, e-mail, wikis and text messaging.\nMarketers must understand that the Web and social media have changed how people search and purchase. With more information from multiple channels and diverse sources, consumers are more selective and demanding in what they need and want from you. How do you create a strong connection that gets and keeps their attention? What challenges does the Web present to brand-building? And how do we better collect consumer feedback? If marketers can\u2019t understand how social media affects their brand\u2019s identity and how to develop better ways to engage, then we'll be behind the curve in building sustainable businesses.\n\u201cThe five C\u2019s are an integral part of how people want to connect, communicate, share knowledge and express their opinions. They want to be heard and respected, and these elements are critical to social media marketing success.\u201d\nThe Five C\u2019s - Connect, Collaborate, Challenge, Collect and Critique\n1)Connect\nFacebook, Twitter, Flickr, blogs, mobile and Internet video are just a few of the many channels that connect us with those things, organizations and people that we care about the most. In today's society, people seek out and create a social network of people they feel have interests similar to theirs. Through this community-based network, people are finding resources, making new friends and creating experiences that are shaping their personal brands. When brands can connect with this network of social friends and create a community around the brand, they in turn create a powerful marketing tool.\nThe Web has allowed people to become the most knowledgeable and vocal brand ambassadors anywhere. They connect others to your brand through their personal opinions, ideas and sharing points of view. This gives each brand a voice that may never have been able to come from the brand and provides an opportunity to influence many of those people who will never do direct business with you. What you say also becomes important as it has to meet the personal expectations of this network, which now connect, collaborate, challenge, collect and critique your company on a daily basis.\nAs marketers, we need to know our most loyal customers better than anyone. This means we need to know their behavior and how their interests match with our brand. By understanding them, we can help them share and champion our products in the \u201cright\u201d places. Today, your customers connect you to those channels, and they tell you what is good and what does not fit within your brand. If you can create connections and value for your customers that help them build relationships, then you will have a valuable brand voice within your customer's network.\nMarketers need to realize that the Web also connects your customers to others who do business with your competitors. As we live in an era where there's little marketing loyalty, your customers can connect in real-time to competitors to express their complaints, opinions and suggestions. It is no longer easy to change a customer's opinion of you \u2013 once that community is formed it takes a lot to shift it again. This means that social media marketing can affect your customer service, product design and brand messaging. Your brand\u2019s marketing must work to match what is being said online about you because that will determine people\u2019s perceptions of you. Marketers need to be thinking of their customers as a community and of their product as a brand within that community. This requires companies to have a better understanding of how social media can impact their organization at a more detailed level than other media channels, because the impact of the network is more powerful and more direct \u2013 it\u2019s like the difference", "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.        REPLY BY ELLSWORTH H. PARKER\n2.        (Continued)\n3.        SUMMARY OF REMARKS OF ELLSWORTH H. PARKER:\n3. The speaker deplored the thought which led Congress back in 1867 to\nagain use the word \"Caucasian,\" in one of its laws, and stated that\nhe did not know much about Caucasian anthropogeny, but that if he read\nhis Bible he was glad to find there recorded the fact that \"God divided\nthe peoples from the beginning of the people and all the families of\nthe earth do kind after their several kind.\"\n4.        SPECIAL ORDER NO. 85\n4. The Speaker mentioned, among other matters, special order 85 as one\nwhich he would like to get rid of. He quoted the order, and remarked\nthat if it were true, as he understood it, that two-thirds of the people\nof the States had voted against secession, on the plea that they\nunderstood that secession meant annexation to a foreign power, they\nwere deceived, for the whole thing was annexation to a foreign power.\n5.        OTHER MATTERS\n5.  The Speaker referred at other times to various other matters.", "Troy Hunt, a popular data security expert, has revealed that more than 3 million email addresses and 360 million passwords\u2014mostly from 2012\u2014have been posted for sale by a cyber criminal on the dark web. The passwords are salted and stored in plain text. A hacker can check the passwords using a password cracker to find similar matches. According to Cyb-sec expert, these passwords are not of sufficient strength to protect access to most user accounts, and are likely outdated and therefore no longer in use. Some accounts could be used for automated spam activities that send out unsolicited bulk email to users who have never opened that account.\nA malicious hacker used a weakness in the database setup to access 123 million user names with email addresses (though the breach does not contain passwords or sensitive personal information such as phone numbers or billing information) belonging to 250 million customer accounts in the 10th largest bank in the United States, according to an SEC filing obtained by Reuters. JPMorgan Chase has set aside $200 million to cover damages from the breach. The stolen user names and email addresses were sold for US$487,000 by resellers, who have also revealed the bank is offering a premium service to buy back users\u2019 names that could fall into the hands of scammers.\nJ.P. Morgan says that customer accounts could have been affected, but says \"there is no evidence that any core banking system data were compromised at this time.\" SEC documents revealed that JPMorgan had to take \u201ccomprehensive remediation steps\u201d related to its cyber security incident, which came amid other high-profile cyber heists at Target, Home Depot and Neiman Marcus.\nJPMorgan has had to spend US$350 million since the 2012 breach.", "On December 17, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued an\nadvanced notice of proposed rulemaking to launch a new trade remedy lawsuit\nprocedure allowing for the \"imposition of trade remedies on products deemed to\nbe unfairly\nsubsidized or sold dumped into the U.S. market.\"  USTR states that the new\nprocedure\nwill ensure that U.S. industries are not disadvantaged by foreign\ngovernment actions that injure domestic manufacturers by providing unfair\ncompetition.  Comments are due on or before January 26, 99.\nBACKGROUND:  The \"new remedy\" is an \"alternative approach to\nthe imposition of\nan antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that will expedite the\nadministrative process and allow the Department of Commerce (DoC) to\ndetermine, within 13 weeks, whether a product should be treated in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in section 421 of the Trade Act\nof\n1974,\" as amended.  Section 421 (d)(5) states that USTR \"shall consult * * *\nwith the United States Trade Representative of the [U.S.]  Congress * * *\nconcerning the need of the foreign producers and exporters to receive\nadequate\nconsideration, including the opportunity to participate in the process for\nthe determination of subsidization and injurious effect * * * *\" In its\nnotice, USTR stated that \"the Department of Commerce has found it to be\ndesirable to develop the process for conducting countervailing duty and\nantidumping duty\ninquiries under the Alternative Approach to determine whether imports of a\ngood are being subsidized at such a level as could be injury causing.  In\nview of the fact that the Alternative Approach is based on an\nadministrative review\nprocedure, a number of substantive and procedural issues have been made\nclear.   However, DoC and the USTR recognize a number of key legal issues\nthat still must be addressed with regard to the process * * * and in\nparticular the\napplicability of certain WTO agreements to the process.\"  The December\n21, 1998 DoC Notice stated that under the Procedures (Adv)\n(1) In the interest of promoting a speedy determination, both the scope\nremand to the USTR\n(2) \"The Department will provide an opportunity for written comments\ncountervail, injurious effect analysis and to submit rebuttals on or\nbefore January 11, 1999.\"\n(3) DoC \"will apply the Alternative Approach as to subsidies when DoC\nfounds a\nSubsidy Program; and (4) DoC will apply the Alternative Approach as to\ninjurious effect when it does not find in favor of the petitioner.\nDETAILS:  USTR states that the notice is a joint notice issued at the\ninitiative of the U.S. Trade Representative and DoC\n(1) It seeks to invite public comment on the Department of Commerce\n(DoC) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\nregarding the application of an alternative approach to determining\ninjurious effect\nof imports; and\n(2) It describes the consultations among USTR, DoC and the\nagency's legal counsel on issues related to the application of section 421\nof the Trade Act of 1974; Public Law 93-618 as amended.\nDISCUSSION:  USTR states that the department's notice constitutes \"an\nadministrative effort to develop the process to apply an alternative approach\ndetermine whether imports of a good or products like the good are being\ninjury causing subsidies.\"  USTR claims that \"In its efforts to develop the\nprocess, the Department of Commerce requested public comments on the\nproposed  procedures.   These comments are the basis of\nthe consultation summarized in the Department of Commerce's December 17,\n1998, Notice.\n[The above statements indicate that public comment has been sought\non the procedures provided for in the recent DoC Notice - (see below)]\nEFFECT ON EXPORTS: DoC states that: \"Because this notice invites\nand written rebuttals, it does not impose duties.\"  The USTR", "In a significant victory, on Wednesday, Dec. 29, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the circuit split over whether retaliation against an employee for complaining about conduct violating Title VII is actionable as an act of discrimination and not as a matter of \"internal company or personnel action.\"  Echaveste v. Firstenberg, No. 10-743. In this case, the First Circuit held such retaliation is not actionable while the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have held it is an actionable form of retaliatory discrimination. In granting cert., the Supreme Court will determine whether \"an employer may violate Title VII by implementing a workplace rule prohibiting nonmanagerial employees from complaining about their employer to government, union, or other officials, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\" The Ninth Circuit ruled against the employer in this case, and the Ninth Circuit Court was the majority view, with judges sitting on the Ninth Circuit concluding that while an employee cannot complain about a violation of Title VII, they must be free to complain about conduct unlawful under other federal laws. The Second and Fourth Circuits rejected the Ninth Circuit's holding. The Supreme Court will issue its decision on the issue in the spring of 2011.", "The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted a study to determine the\nreliability of billing codes used to bill Medicare for\npharmacy services.

The OIG reviewed claims for 800 billing\ncodes used to bill Medicare for drugs and biologicals.\nThe OIG found that: billing codes are reliable indicators for\nidentifying drugs billed to Medicare; and the billing\ncodes described drug administration. These findings also\nindicate that Medicare payments for prescription drugs\nshould be limited to drugs whose billing codes accurately\ndescribe the medications that are furnished and ensure the\nappropriate documentation of the diagnoses that prompt\nadministration of the drugs to Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe OIG conducted a study to determine the reliability of billing codes used to bill Medicare for pharmacy services. The OIG evaluated the accuracy of Medicare claims billed on Form 1, the Claim for Drugs or Biologicals, to determine the reliability of diagnostic and therapeutic billing codes used to bill Medicare.\nThe OIG reviewed claims for 800 billing codes used to bill Medicare for drugs and biologicals. We focused on the most frequently billed diagnostic and\ntherapeutic billing codes that could be used to bill for\nprescription drugs and biologicals administered to 65-year-\nolds or older. We identified these billing codes on the\nproposed and current fee schedule lists for claims billed\nfrom October through December 1998, from January to\nMay 1999, and the first 6 months of 1999. These lists\nidentified 800 of the most commonly billed codes for the\nadministration of prescription drugs or biologicals.\nThe billing codes that we reviewed were for prescription drugs and biologicals, both single and bulk, administered to a beneficiary under\ncare of a doctor, that is for the treatment of a specific\ndiagnosis. These were the billing codes most frequently\nbilled for physicians claims in 1998 under the current pharmacy policy.\nWe reviewed 800 claims billed on Form 1 during the\nperiod of February 1998 through May 1999 and\nidentified 21,782 billing codes. Our approach was to\ndetermine the reliability of a billing code for bill-\ning a pharmacy service only if a physician billed the\nsame code for the same diagnosis.\nThe OIG found that billing codes are reliable indicators for\nidentifying drugs billed to Medicare and that the billing codes\ndescribed drug administration. These findings also indicate that\nMedicare payments for prescription drugs should be limited to\ndrugs whose billing codes accurately describe the medications that\nare actually furnished, which can be easily understood by anyone\ninterested in assessing the reliability of billing codes, and that\nthese billing codes are not so specialized that they would require\nphysician coding and billing expertise to assess their reliability.\nAccording to Medicare's billing and payment policies, the\nprescription drug benefit pays pharmacists either the average\nacquisition cost (AAC) of the drug plus 6 percent, or the \"Average\nManufacturer's Price (AMP)\" plus 6 percent, which depends on\nwhether Medicare obtains the lowest price. The average acquisition\ncost is computed with data from a billing-code-based survey,\nwhich does not account for the time or effort spent by a pharmacist\nwhen providing a prescription drug service. Reliable billing codes\nallow pharmacists a fair and equitable method of demonstrating\ntheir time and efforts on a patient's behalf. The billing codes and\nthe documentation of the diagnoses for which they are billed and\nthe time spent on the drug's administration permit other entities\nthat are interested in assessing the reliability of billing codes\nto assess accurately when Medicare policies did not result in fair\npayments for services.\nAlvaro C.

These yearlong campaigns are helping to create positive brand associations. \"People trust the Washington Post. They know it is a reliable source for information. They know it is a place to go for community information,\" said Rabb. \"People are attracted by the good they want to do in the community.\"\n8. The outreach efforts are also helping to raise awareness within the Post of how local communities are being affected by these various problems.\nPREVIOUSLY: After a highly successful \"Literacy Crisis\" campaign, the Post this year will launch \"D.C. Kids,\" a yearlong outreach campaign to raise money and awareness about child literacy issues. The Post will be engaging with local celebrities, events, media and readers to raise money for local children's literacy organizations.\nEfforts thus far include an outdoor concert held on March 21, raising more than $56,000 for the Reach Incorporated, and a second outdoor concert fundraiser held on Easter featuring \"The News Boys\" and local celebrities singing Easter songs, raising almost $20,000 for the Reach organization. A third concert was held on April 9 featuring \"The Washington Ballet,\" dancing to music from the \"Hairspray\" Broadway soundtrack, which raised over $100,000. (The ballet company will perform the same concert again at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on May 7.) The Post will host a number of similar events throughout the year. The outdoor concerts were sponsored by the Post and several local companies, including the TKG Agency and Macy's. All proceeds go to charity.\nREACH Inc., one of the agencies benefiting from the campaign, works to prevent juvenile delinquency and empower youth through community outreach programs, recreation activities, counseling and advocacy. REACH serves approximately 3,000 D.C. residents each year.\nEarlier this year, the Post announced that it has selected six D.C. area non-profits -- including REACH -- that provide services for children to benefit from the \"D.C. Kids Campaign\" efforts. Each organization will be able to leverage funds raised from the campaign to support local efforts to build a better and more literate community for children.\nThe Post has chosen the following non-profits for", "The FTB has announced new deadlines for its electronic tax filings.

It has been the core of a newspaper \u2014 both physically and psychologically \u2014 for generations.\nThe importance cannot be overstated.\nTo take a step back, there are a few key things a news organisation should be looking to accomplish with its front page:\nThe newspaper has a distinct mission of both the newsroom/reporters/editors and the business (ie sales team) team. In terms of content, it should reflect the mission of the business \u2014 not the opposite. That is a common problem in the digital world today, especially when papers start to believe that \u201canything goes\u201d:\nThe front page is the first opportunity for most people to sample your content and decide if they value it enough to pay for it \u2014 in today's age of unprecedented access to news, audiences are growing more discriminating \u2014 and that's a good thing. News organisations should be taking steps to provide more value, not less.\nToday, the front page needs to reflect:\n\u201cMission\u201d \u2014 The first page is a branding opportunity and reflects the core ideas and themes that define the brand of your organisation.\n\u201cCore purpose\u201d \u2014 The front page reflects your organisation's core purpose \u2014 again, the first impression of the brand you are trying to build. The front page is a branding opportunity.\n\u201cEditorial voice\u201d \u2014 Your organisation can establish a powerful editorial voice through your front page. Remember \u2014 it's one page in your entire media brand. It should define the voice of every page and brand touch point.\n\u201cCovering community\u201d \u2014 A good front page includes local content and perspectives, reflecting the diverse interests and stories from the community you wish to serve.\n\u201cContent differentiation\u201d \u2014 A good front page demonstrates and promotes your value proposition to the audience and delivers on it. It differentiates you from your competitors.\n\u201cLead value\u201d \u2014 The front page is an ideal place to demonstrate the value of the content you are providing \u2014 in content, design, and the presentation of information.\n\u201cInformed opinion\u201d \u2014 A good front page should include informed opinion from the journalists of your organisation, which adds distinction and value to the front page and ultimately to the publication. This should come from the journalists, not the business, that also helps readers understand the bias of the reporters and opinions.\nYou should be able to answer these basic questions before committing to a front-page presentation/design:\nWhat is your coverage goal for the newspaper?\nHow will your coverage of each story reflect the audience that you are trying to reach in that coverage area?\nIf you choose the former, how will you choose your top stories of the day?\nHow will you choose the stories that will appear below the \u201ceverything else\u201d area at the bottom of the page? What are the editorial considerations of the various types of stories you put on the page?\nIf you need to be more specific, how will you determine the content that appears on the page?\nHow would you prioritise your various objectives when producing the front page?\nOnce you have decided your coverage goals, you need to develop a plan to realise them. In fact, your coverage and presentation should actually be driven by your editorial objectives. So how will you do that in today's competitive market? Here are three strategies to drive your front page based on your editorial objectives:\n\u2022 Look for hot spots that are relevant to the readers' interests (ie news, weather, sports).\n\u2022 Look for a consistent and repeated theme to anchor the page around; eg a news story that can be spun off into various stories from many different angles, which can help create many types of content.\n\u2022 Look for stories or trends that give the audience a chance to reflect and be entertained.\nOnce you have decided on your coverage goals, look for a unique way of showing your audience the news \u2014 in other words, something worth their attention! For example:\n\u2022 How about using an interactive module that provides an opportunity to respond to a newsworthy event from the weekend? For example, a popular weekly show recently held a poll to get audience reaction about the latest results from their most-popular match of the week. (See Figure 1.)\n\u2022 How about developing a \u201creveal\u201d package that features a short visual tease to", "In this letter, EPA solicits public\ncomments on a draft Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) for\ndichloromethane (DCM).

This is a breach of customary religious behavior as well as a breach of customary cultural behavior (parents don't kill themselves for the sake of their children). As Hecuba explains, this leads directly to the abduction of Helen by Paris, a breach of Hecuba's honor as well, since it is she and her daughter, Polyxena, guardians of her honor, who must stand before Achilles in a special shrine of Trojan women, with their hair covering their heads, and who must then take their own lives.\nThe breach of custom on one level is simply understood as what the play considers to be wrongdoing; and on another level, it is a matter of religious and cultural practice. The goddess Athena, who protects and maintains the city of Sparta, the city of Helen, is angry that a priest (a _woman_ priest) should be slandered in this way and demands that her brother-goddess god Zeus, who is king of all gods, deal with this. Zeus makes plans for Paris to pay for his offense to Hecuba (the goddess of a temple in Troy) and to Helen (his mortal wife). To pay for his offense to Hecuba, Achilles will seek revenge upon Troylus and Paris and destroy the Trojan priesthood, and thus destroy Troy itself. To pay for his offense to Helen, Paris will be expelled from the city and sent to live out his days with King Priam of Troy. Further, there will be war, and the whole world will witness Troy's fall and Paris's downfall.\nParis and Helen, at the beginning of these events, are happy and are going to get married. Paris has taken Helen far away from Sparta and far away from her father, Menelaus, the _king_ of Sparta (i.e., he is king of the women he is supposed to rule). This is another breach of customary behavior as the king (in every country) of women who are his wives and queens is _not_ supposed merely to protect and maintain those women, although this is what he is supposed to do, nor is the king's first and foremost responsibility with them the protection of his own power and honor or the honor of his family. The king's first and foremost responsibility is the maintenance of the wives and children as the center and heart of his own country and the center and heart of _his_ family. Paris, as a prince, has been given the gift of wisdom by the goddess Athena and given the task of being a soldier for his country. It is _he_ who has _taken_ Helen away and it is _his_ country that suffers for it, even as Paris himself suffers and, ultimately, _dies_. Even though his mission is successful in that it enables him to _take_ a woman (Hecuba is a woman and therefore he has a greater ability to succeed against her than against a Trojan man), his actions are harmful to Troy and Troylus, who have given him hospitality, protection, a home, a city that is his own country, and his wife. This causes the goddess Athena to call in her debt.\nNow, however, Hecuba has not only to defend her honor against Achilles but to have her daughter, Polyxena, executed because the Trojans have given her, Polyxena, to Achilles as a _human sacrifice_. This is what makes Troy a _pagan_ country, but it is what will be its downfall.\nThese are the problems the gods themselves struggle to resolve. First there is the problem they have created by their own indiscretion: having created Aphrodite, they also created Eros, who _weds_ Aphrodite with his gift of love. Aphrodite is a goddess of love, a goddess who causes people to fall in love and thus causes them to have passionate sex and beget children. Eros is a god responsible for marriage. Thus, in a culture that values marriage and monogamy, it makes a certain amount of sense that there is something like a goddess of love who can cause people to fall in love. What does not make sense from a traditional \"pagan viewpoint\" is that, as a result of the gods' own bad behavior, Aphrodite and Eros have a son, Harm", "Too easy? Wrong word. Wrong thinking.

According to a Pew Research Center\nproject, \u201ca significant increase has occurred in the proportion who say that news about important issues is a good thing. In total, 64 percent say that news about important issues is a \u201cgood thing.\u201d Just six years\nago, only 33 percent said that news was a positive. Similarly, 63 percent said that \u201cnews about politics is a good thing\u201d and seven years ago, only 42 percent held that view (Rosenstiel, Peress & Purcell, 2007, pg. 4)\u201d\nThe media world has changed a lot in the last 100 years, and many might point to its latest transformation into the social media sphere as the pivotal point. The role of the journalist has become more interactive and community-based as a result of what we are terming in the online world as\n\u201ccitizen journalism.\u201d This form of journalism\nisn\u2019t new, but it has become more prevalent\nin today\u2019s world. For years, bloggers and readers alike have been helping fill in the media blind spots with stories and information found in everyday life.\nBecause of the nature of the Internet, this has expanded greatly, reaching places all around the world.\nWhat is the role of the journalist, then, in this new world? A simple Google search will reveal many journalists struggling with this new territory. Many journalists believe that citizen journalism is a threat to professional journalism and, therefore, to their jobs. Many also believe that it will undermine and lower the quality of professional news. But, is this true? Is citizen journalism something to be afraid of and to be scared of, or is it something to be welcomed into the media landscape and embraced for what it can do?\nCitizen journalism has been around for a very long time \u2013 possibly as long as the journalist and media has been in existence.\nCitizen media has been used for communication in different formats for several centuries. The first person to communicate with citizen media was St. Paul, in 56 AD, and the first news publication, a bulletin board, was established in Britain in the 1300s, not to mention the first newsletter, the Boston Newsletter, in 1806 (Thornton, 2010). There have also been many examples of citizen journalism throughout the news media industry, with examples such as: (Beyerstein & Miller, 2000, pg. 73 \u2013 75) the Washington Post\u2019s \u201cWatchdog\u201d series, \u201cA series that gave readers a behind the scenes look at the newspaper and the people who worked there\u201d; the Chicago Tribune\u2019s \u201cInvestors and the News: The News as a Corporate Tool,\u201d in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and WCBS-TV New York\u2019s NewsWatch program, where viewers call the station to report news stories around the New York City area (Thornton, 2010, pg. 36, 37). A more recent example of citizen journalism is that done for the Haitian Earthquake Relief page, which was set up for friends and family to post on, following the Haitian Earthquake.\nThough citizen journalism may not be new, its rise has taken a while to happen; there are just as many examples of it being suppressed as there are examples of it being allowed to rise.\nWith the rise of the Internet in general and social networking in particular, citizen journalism has come in to\nits own as a recognized media type in many places around the world. As of January 2010, 25.6% of the world\u2019s population used the Internet and this figure is continuing to rise, with 27.2% of the population expected to be on the Internet by January 2012.\nThis massive amount of new Internet users means that", "C.B. Fisk/Organization of American States,\nS. R. Shriver/U.S. State Dept.\nThe New Music Consortium\nThe New Music Consortium, a project of the Organization of American States, was organized in 1980 to bring\nthe music of composer C.B. Fisk and his contemporaries to a wider audience. The OAS has worked with the\nU.S. Information Agency on several occasions since 1977 as part of its mission of promoting cultural exchanges\nbetween nations. When the consortium began in 1980, Mr. Fisk's New York-based music was in its infancy.\nSince then, however, compositions such as the three-movement \"Trio for Strings\" have had their first hearing\nin some 21 countries in nearly 50 concerts. The OAS music specialist, Miguel Angel Soto, describes much of\nMr. Fisk's music as \"exuberant, colorful, with a sound texture often evoking Spanish folk influences.\"\nThe second program of the consortium's first half of 1983 included performances of works by Mr. Fisk in\nthe cities of Tegucigalpa, Honduras; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and San Juan, Puerto Rico,\nattracting nearly 10,000 people. The concerts were led by maestros Michael Christoffersen, Gustavo Dudamel,\nand Jesus Alejo Lopez, and by young musicians and conductors from universities in Tegucigalpa, Santo\nDomingo, and San Juan. Mr. Fisk's music will next appear in a program of the OAS New Music Consortium\nin Bogota on August 31.\nS. R. Shriver, U.S. State Department.\nThe U.S. State Department offers a program which provides American composers with the opportunity to\nhave their operas produced or sung by national or professional-level performing arts groups overseas. In\nreturn, composers must provide their productions free of charge and waive royalty payments unless the\nproducing company is affiliated with the U.S. government or U.S. industry. One such opera, \"The Golden\nSlippers,\" by composer Scott McMillan, came to life in 1979 as part of the \"Opera in America Today\" project\nsponsored by the State Department. The opera focuses on a poor Russian peasant family living in Moscow at\nthe turn of the century. As part of the project, a two-person opera company from the State Department's\nAmerican musical theater festival called American Repertory Arts International (A.R.A.I.) was created in a\nseries of rehearsals the opera group conducted in Leningrad, Moscow, and Riga, Latvia. These rehearsals\nwere recorded on a portable recorder which was sent to the U.S. and edited into a masterpiece. The\ncompany went on to premiere \"The Golden Slippers\" in Riga in July 1979, the Latvian opera company's\nfirst such production. The opera was a huge success and was presented on five subsequent occasions.\nAccording to composer McMillan, the success of the opera in Riga made the production an \"international\nhit.\" In 1980, the Opera Lirico d'Italia undertook a production at Viterbo, Italy under its president, maestro\nRoberto Devereux, which was highly acclaimed. The opera will receive its \"American premier\" on\nApril 11-13, 1983 at Carthage College in Wisconsin.\nThomas S. Whitney/American Chamber of Commerce in Panama.\nThomas S. Whitney, Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Panama (AmCham), told the\nNew York Times in a recent interview that the presence of the U.S. trade mission in Panama will allow other\nU.S. companies to develop Panama as an international trade center. Other U.S. companies are\nparticularly attracted, according to Mr. Whitney, to Panama's close proximity to the United States-both\ngeographically and in terms of the ease of doing business. \"Most of the companies now doing business\nhere in Panama come to us as customers.

I had just gotten my PhD in Communication Arts. Mary was four or five months pregnant with our first child. We had gone to the fair as one of our last pleasures before we got married and moved to the big city for a new job for me. As I recall, it was a gloomy, damp day -- the sort of day that makes you want to do nothing but curl up with a book or watch something on television. I wasn't much into either of those activities then; as a matter of principle I wanted to soak up the last few days that I would be free of a 12-month commitment to one of Ohio State University's graduate programs. By and large, I was able to accomplish that objective.\nThe three of us were sitting at a place outside of the main building. There were big windows all around us that were designed to look out over the central park that was the center focus of the fair. The three of us were talking about different issues, but mostly we were discussing our personal problems. In fairness, John and Mary didn't talk about being pregnant with their first child; rather he just seemed to have a never-ending well of frustration at work since the company he worked for laid off 70 percent of the people in the building he worked in.\nMy focus was on how Mary and I would be able to handle so much being thrown at us at once. The first step was to get married, that much was certain. I had never had a serious romantic relationship before, so I worried if I would be able to handle the responsibility and the pressure involved in marrying Mary. We didn't have much money in the bank, and we had to start thinking about things that weren't going to be fun to talk about.\nI knew some of the basics that needed to be worked out: Mary and I had to find a place to live and furniture to put in that place. We needed to find jobs that would pay for all of this. I could see that Mary and I were on different pages in this respect. In my opinion, it was more important to find and do jobs that you would like doing. In her view, those two points weren't related, and in fact, you should take the most difficult job you could find, because then you would be sure to earn enough to pay the bills.\nI was a bit young-looking for a lot of regular jobs, having just finished college and all that. So this first discussion that we had led me to believe that I would probably be out working for a year or two while one or both of us went to graduate school. Mary and I ended up agreeing that this was probably the best course to take. We didn't want to burden each other with large college loans we wouldn't be able to pay just because we wanted to go back to school.\nThe discussion made me realize that if we were ever going to find out if marriage could work and if Mary and I were a good match, we probably ought to be single for a least a couple more years, and have some real responsibilities in our lives. Once we had some serious issues going in our lives, we would be more sure of the rightness of marrying the other person.\nAnother aspect of our discussion was that Mary was going to quit her job. She had done well there (wherever \"there\" was) but she was still working for a little over minimum wage. Her employer's insurance hadn't covered anything related to childbirth. And the company had been down-sizing for a while, and was likely to do so again before the new year. She had been able to leave her job and move with ease as the company was making fewer people redundant. But Mary wanted to have the benefit of health insurance, which many smaller companies offered. And even though Mary had only been at the company for a short time, there was a sense that when people started they tended to be around for a while. Mary didn't want to leave that opportunity, but it had seemed that no matter how hard she tried she couldn't get further on in her career there.\nWe knew that Mary was going to start in the mail room for the largest bank in town. That seemed like it was going to be the best opportunity to move some time in the future when the bank needed more help. We had agreed that the bank was worth looking at, particularly because it was a major financial institution during an", "It is hereby ordered that Part 22 of chapter I of title 47, Code of Fed.

(A rise of 1.5% results in a 1.5% increase\nin energy content (heat), because the only \"law\" of\nphysics that is of any consequence for atmospheric\ntemperature is the \"law\" of Stefan-Boltzmann, which\ndescribes the relation between the energy emitted by the\nsurface of the earth and its temperature. So a 1.5 percent\nincrease in the energy emitted by Earth as a whole\ncorresponds exactly to a 1.5% increase in the surface\ntemperature of Earth.) This figure is consistent with the\nprediction that the net radiative forcing from the\natmosphere-warming greenhouse effect would add 1.5 W/m^2 to\nthe downwelling surface radiation, which by the Stefan-Boltzmann\nlaw is equivalent to a surface warming of 1.5 oC.\nIn the same period, the annual CO2 emission rate was approx.\n2 PgC per year (one PgC of carbon [C] is one Petagram, or\n10^15 g of C) (Houghton, 1987).\n(Note 1: The CO2 emission rate is based on observations\nmade at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Note 2: A Pg = one\nbillion kg and a ton = one million kg.)\nIn the same period, the global mean surface temperature of the\nAtmosphere is known to have warmed, by an amount consistent\nwith an increase in radiative forcing of approx. 0.75\nW/m^2. These changes are observed by direct measurements and\nare not predicted by any model. (This is the main uncertainty\nin the present global temperature record.)\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, the mean\nsurface temperature of the Earth has risen by approx. 1\noC and the mean temperature of the Global Atmosphere at the\nSurface has risen by approx. 0.5 oC. These small rises in\nglobal and surface temperature are consistent with a very\nsmall rise in the \"Net Global radiative forcing\" of approx.\n0.28 W/m^2, to be compared with the total radiative forcing\nresulting from the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of 0.79\nW/m^2 (Houghton, 1987). (Note: \"Net radiative forcing\" is\ndefined as the radiative forcing minus the terrestrial and\natmospheric energy storage, i.e. minus any planetary changes\nin energy due to vegetation effects, etc.)\nAn increase in Earth's radiative forcing of approx. 0.29\nW/m^2 could account for the known Global temperature\nincrease of approx. 0.5 oC, based on the approximate 0.75\noC increase in radiation out-putted from the surface:\n(0.29 W/m^2) / (0.75oC) = (16.4 oC - 10 oC)/(0.75 oC) = 0.084\noC/oC = 0.084 - 1.\nIn other words, the \"0.29 W/m^2\" increase in the net global\nforcing has the capacity/potential to produce a\nsurface temperature change of 1.oC -- at\npresent, an under-recognized value that exceeds the projected\nclimate sensitivity of 0.5 to", "Draft 2019-21 Triennial Plan for New Zealand Post is a framework for NZ Post to deliver the agreed goals of the Portfolio.

Every August 25th since, local businesses open their doors early or stay late to provide special promotions to 25,000 citizens with free coffee or breakfast or haircuts.\nThis year Conan and Craig opened a new chapter. Gone are the morning radio ads and citywide banners. Now, Grow Guelph, a program powered by the Canadian entrepreneurship promotion agency Futurpreneur Canada, will be launched as a digital platform that extends a new definition of entrepreneurship.\nGrow Guelph will be introduced nationally with a digital microsite, blog, Facebook (FB) and YouTube (YT) pages, Twitter (TWEET) feeds, and more. It promises to feature entrepreneurship success stories from across Canada, with the aim of inspiring would-be entrepreneurs and existing businesses alike.\nFacebook (FB) and Twitter (TWEET) have had an explosive introduction to the business community and, according to the Grow Guelph microsite, entrepreneurs have been using the social media platforms to spread their messages. But businesses have had a limited opportunity to respond, so the microsite allows for two-way communication.\n\"What we are trying to do is be the platform that brings the best of online and offline into alignment,\" explains Daniella Capaldi, Senior Manager, Strategic Partnerships, at Futurpreneur Canada.\n\"We're really excited to be on Facebook and Twitter,\" Capaldi says. \"We've recently opened up our Grow Guelph site to two-way interaction, and we've already had responses from people and businesses. We want to have a conversation, not simply publish content.\"\nCapaldi sees this social media integration as an opportunity to further engage with the next generation of business leaders as they look for the inspiration and the resources to go from the idea phase to a viable business enterprise.\nOne of the most important things for the launch of a digital platform is to plan for success early and identify all channels used by the community, along with any additional platforms that should be incorporated to allow two-way communication.\n\"A successful launch is when the community understands it, when the community engages with it, and when the community takes over the channel,\" Capaldi says. This requires being intentional about the direction and implementation of a digital platform, she adds, and requires building an initial core group of users and early adopters to help push the initiative forward. A digital campaign or platform without any users or content will do little to engage or inform the community.\n\"The way we create the buzz is the content,\" Capaldi says. \"We think of it a lot like content marketing, that if we've put together the right stories, the right information, the right resources -- and really it's the stories we love, but if people find the right information, we really want them to find it -- the buzz will come because people are engaged.\"\nEngagement is the key to a successful public relations or marketing program, she explains. \"The most important element is, can they take it to market, are they using and building it and making it relevant and sustainable and scalable? Is the community using and sharing? If not, then we don't have success, right?\n\"It's about telling these stories that are inspiring and helping people to get to the next step of starting a business.\"\nEngagement should be a two-way process between businesses and entrepreneurs on one hand and the community and the digital platform on the other. According to Capaldi, success is measured in the following:\n1. People are sharing -- sharing the great stuff that they are watching and also sharing the great stuff that they're working on, so they're helping their businesses and other organizations succeed.\n2. People are linking to it and using it and embedding it into Web sites and using it as a resource to link to when they are sharing information or just sharing their own story.\n3. People are tagging it so we and others can find them. When you're tagging it, you're helping it scale because it means it's going to get seen in the stream on social media, on other Web sites, on other pages.\n4. Businesses and entrepreneurs are starting conversations and then people are contributing to those conversations and they are having real discussions about ideas that can make", "The City of Lacey is requesting a Conditional Use Permit to expand the property located at 6446 33rd Avenue SE, Lacey, WA from a 7,185 square foot building to a new enlarged 27,237 square foot building.

From local news to national politics to the comics, there is something for anyone on the Internet today.\nTo get a window into reader attitudes, I turned to NewspaperDirect to poll 1,500 Americans from the online survey panel NPD Group between February 2008 and January 2009. This survey took place before any newspaper website made it easy to embed video or audio content from its site.\nAs I explored the survey data and results, I was struck by two things: how much people visit the newspaper sites and how important they are to every step of the reader cycle.\nNews Websites: A Community\nThe findings confirmed that the Internet has radically changed the reader\u2019s habits and has created an environment where the newspaper sites are more often visited first in the morning and last at night.\nWhile only an average of 18% of people visited the Internet on any given day, about 22% of them turned to newspapers websites at some point. That is over a quarter of all Internet users, from those who never visit the newspaper sites to those who do every day.\nI was also surprised to learn that over a third of the time spent in a media environment was spent on the newspaper sites. There was also a 3% increase in the share of time readers spent on newspaper sites, while the share fell for TV to TV and radio to radio sites.\nI also noticed that over half of newspaper site visits lasted more than five minutes. While other site types vary in the fraction of visits that spend time on each site, more than half of them spend at least a minute on each site.\nThese figures show that reader habits are migrating toward newspaper sites on the Internet, which seem to be the starting point for most people\u2019s news cycle. Newspaper site visitors not only use these sites as a gateway to their news but also as a destination, spending more time and clicking more often than other sites.\nWhat You Read and How Often: Content and Engagement\nI also probed the survey findings to better understand the mix of content that Internet readers find useful and a site\u2019s role as a source of news.\nThe first result shows that people visit newspaper sites to look at both local and national news. From breaking news, which is one of the things that draws people in the fastest, to the site\u2019s ability to offer up-to-date information on specific stories, readers clearly value its local content.\nThe next finding shows how important the newspaper website is as a source of news. The Internet is also the top source for national news by readers, beating out TV and radio by a significant level. The Internet also shows a slight, but significant advantage over newspapers for national news.\nReaders find local news on the newspaper site and news about the political campaign even more important to get their news. National and local news on a newspaper site ranked the most important as a source of information for readers.\nNews content on a website is so important to readers that almost all of the topics the newspaper covers get a relatively high ranking compared to the site\u2019s other content. This finding holds true even for articles on less widely known topics, like golf and wine. The one exception is gossip, which is ranked as the least valuable newspaper content on the site.\nThis survey data on reader attitudes shows that as more people are connecting with the Internet, it seems that increasingly the first place people go is to the newspaper sites.\nI believe this could be part of a positive trend of the newspaper website becoming a core part of the daily routine.\nNewspapers should think about the way newspaper websites can create a sense of community for its readers. While many people may talk politics online, there is nothing that can replace the role that newspapers have played in bringing a community together.\nRob Ragozine is a consultant working with newspapers, radio stations, and nonprofits.

We're in the process of shifting away from a subscription-based model, to one that uses all of our media's resources - video, TV, digital - to promote ourselves as thought leaders and to drive digital subscriptions.\nWhat do you think of this model? What are your thoughts on the future of print, and how are you shifting your company to adapt?\nI think that you have to make this choice very early on: either you can be a digital native; or, you decide \"I'm a legacy print business that must find a way to have these two businesses co-exist going forward.\" Unfortunately, in all of the M&A deals we have done in the news industry, we have not seen many examples where there is an effort to \"bundle\" both.\nTo me, this is more of an organizational approach that will ultimately shape which type you're going to be, than anything that you can do in the short term.\nMy team and I have been grappling with some of these same issues.\nThe bottom line is that our revenue is split into two buckets: print and digital, though you have to think of print as a digital revenue stream too.\nTo me, it's more of a revenue stream. Print, to me, is a revenue stream. I consider it part of the digital revenue stream. I would prefer to think about print that way.\nI don't like the term \"traditional revenue\" to refer to print. We certainly need print. There is no question about that; however, we are shifting away from print to a subscription base, which will ultimately morph more and more into video. This is what will create the subscription revenues in the long run. We have always had and have always had to have a print advertising business to back it up.\nUltimately, we will be a 50-50 digital-print company. We are looking at shifting towards more video, so, by the new year, we will be experimenting with video content, but I do not think we will pull the plug on our print operations anytime soon.\nWe are a two-tiered organization: we have the print company and the digital company. The digital company makes a ton of money now. The digital ad revenue streams come in, and it is in the high eight figures. Print is not doing as well, but that is because we do not have a big enough digital audience.\nWe are the largest Spanish-language publisher in the country. We have 11 million unique visitors to our digital sites per month (our audience is 40 million). Digital revenues are up; they are growing. Advertising revenues have grown at a slower pace for many reasons.\nWe have to get our advertising business to match the growth that we're seeing in our digital business. We have to get people to trust our brand when we do advertising online. When they have an interaction they will trust our brand. Then, when they open up their newspaper, to a certain extent, they trust what we are saying.\nSo I would say that our audience engagement has gotten higher with digital content than with print. We have to get them to engage more - and to make the jump to digital advertising. So, one thing we have done recently at Univision is create a media agency, Univision Interactive Media. And we have built a programmatic marketing platform so that we can do programmatic display. Univision Interactive Media will allow us to compete. That is good news to me. It has allowed us to compete on an equal level with other O&Os that sell programmatic.\nWe don't have the audience numbers just to go digital, and our revenue stream there does not live up to where print revenue is. For example, I have heard advertisers say that they would like to try digital, but just not yet. We have to prove it to them that is something that is worth doing.\nSo, Univision Interactive will allow us to compete on an equal level with other O&Os that sell programmatic.\nThis year will be a major year for us for digital advertising.

The White Paper on International Migration outlines the government&#8217;s policy for international migration, including the conditions necessary to regularize temporary residence. This Department of Home Affairs&#8217; White Paper on International Migration guides all policy and decision making in the Department to ensure that our policy is consistent with international instruments and South African law governing the international movement, stay and residence in South Africa.\n ENQUIRES: Enquiries may be directed to the Department of Home Affairs in Pretoria on telephonic number: 012 0030 or through direct communication on:\nE-mail address: iast@dha.gov.za or immig@dha.gov.za\n Webpage: http://www.dha.gov.za or http://www.workpermits.com.", "A new report points out that \u201cnews\u201d aggregator apps can lead to the same issues as traditional news apps\u2014including traffic dips and decreasing user engagement\u2014when \u201cnews\u201d in the app title is irrelevant to what users see inside the app.\nIt might seem obvious to say, but many app developers who have created news and media apps are not paying attention to newsworthiness. The same apps that failed previously in the desktop environment (when news is rarely read on desktops and users are increasingly inundated with email) still aren\u2019t performing very well on mobile\u2014and for the same reasons.\nAccording to a new, four-stage study from Sensor Tower, the leading mobile-centric app store analytics platform, the majority of all free news apps on Google Play contain no original editorial, relying instead on links or \u201cclickbait\u201d methods to attract readers. And this lack of editorial-based originality leads to less engagement from users, who are inundated with both a never-ending supply of headlines and what many consider to be \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\u201cUsers\u2019 perceptions of media content are not neutral, and that has been brought to light in recent years as fake news has become such a hot-button topic,\u201d notes Nico Rosberg, a report writer at Sensor Tower. \u201cEven the most-followed news companies get accused of bias or of promoting their own agendas. This gives users a tendency toward skepticism about the news content that they consume, and we should expect this to be true of any other forms of media as well.\u201d\nThe study examined more than 600,000 free apps with news, editorial, or magazine-format content in Google Play at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Only apps that contained full articles or other original content related to the news genre were considered. The apps were then categorized and analyzed in terms of their originality, the type of news content, the language they\u2019re written in, how much they cost, and more.\nResults of the study pointed out a few of the key issues regarding news apps:\nEven though many apps included original news content, most of these (66%) were free but had to rely on advertisements in order to stay free;\nOver one third (36%) also contained no original content and only links to articles that might have been written by the app\u2019s developers.\nSensor Tower also noted that:\nA high percentage of free news apps do not focus on a particular topic, category, location, or even language; instead, they cover the full range of topics. And the ones that do have a specialization or focus are not following a specific, narrow journalistic topic but instead focus on general news topics or a wider scope of issues relating to the news.\nNews apps that had previously enjoyed success on the desktop often experienced low levels of engagement. And the apps were not designed to take advantage of user data collected by other applications such as Apple News. Also, they were not updated in line with the preferences of their users or with user trends.\nOne of the primary reasons behind the struggles of free news apps might be linked to the fact that these apps are not unique enough to gain an edge over other mobile news options.\nBased on the amount and level of engagement that these apps are enjoying, it is highly likely that users are looking for news that matches their own news preferences and interests.\nRead the Free App News Study 2019\nPREV How to Build an Effective Customer Service Strategy NEXT SensorTower Announces \u2018Branded News\u2019 - News Apps Growing in Popularity", "In addition to offering readers a chance to buy a print copy of _A Matter of Blood,_ this sneak advance copy gives you access to two excerpts from two upcoming short stories.\n_A Matter of BLOOD_ is a prequel, but it stands alone and is not a backstory.\n\"The Pull of Gravity\" is a story from a forthcoming science fiction collection, and is followed by \"The Language of Moths,\" a story from _The Bazaar of Bad Dreams_.\nFourteen Years Earlier\nWe meet Mhakis in a garden.\nMhakis and I worked as partners, which would once have seemed impossible, but a mutual love of blood, the scent and shade of it, had brought us together. My name and his were long forgotten, and we'd found we no longer cared about the details of the past, either. We were in love, we were partners. We cared about nothing, we needed nothing, even a name was not important. I was Mhakis and he was Mhakis, or he was Mhakis, then I was Mhakis.\nWe called the garden home, because of the blood.\nThere were two great trees at the edge of the garden. The trees provided the blood, which came to them through the earth and from the soil bared by the great winds that blew across the sands.\nWe made nets, tying the rotten limbs of the trees to the stems of long-dead plants and then stretching the whole net out and tying it at each end to anchors we hammered into the hard earth. The blood came to us each time the tide was out, sliding and rushing across a sea of sand, and we waited, ready to pounce and snatch and pull the blood from the sea.\nHe was Mhakis and I was Mhakis, and there was not much else for either of us, and I was happy to give my life to him.\nSometime it would come. That was how it worked with the blood\u2014and also with us. A cycle always arrived, and we could always sense it. We called it the cycle of blood, and it brought its end. The blood turned thinner, then thinner still, thin enough to slip through the nets, thin enough to slide through your fingers. We were as ready for the time of the thin, for this inevitable death, as we could be.\nI was Mhakis and I waited for the last time, and we sat in the sand and worked our nets into great, perfect ropes. We tied them to stakes driven into the sand and we wove them down into a net that would not break, and a net that would enclose the water, where the blood would be.\nWhen it was ready, we were ready, and we sat back, waiting for the water. We did no more, because all we could do was wait.\nThe water rose, and it rushed, then rushed harder. The net twisted and writhed, the blood pushed into the sand as the surging waves forced the water into the net.\nThis was the best time, the best of this cycle of blood.\nThe water grew thick and rich, and we could smell it, taste it, like the sweet and savory blood of a great herd and of a great bull.\nOur eyes were open and we had to wait until we thought it was near, and so we sat and watched and watched. The net was full of water and so the blood was moving\u2014everywhere in the net.\nThe net began a shining, shimmering, rippling dance, as the ropes and the fine mesh of blood became a great ballerina, as the nets spun and the wind turned their tides and then the tides, the wind, and the blood and the dance all became one until they were all one, and then they were all the same...\nThere are beings who are like us and like the blood. We are not always so sure who they are, and they are not always so sure, either, but the beings are there, and the blood and us, and all three of us exist because of a cycle that will come to an end in time.\nThe blood is like us, but not quite. And we resemble them, but not fully, and they resemble us as much as they resemble their blood.\nThey are here, and they move on the periphery of the blood as we do, just as the blood moves, just as we do.\nI am Mhakis, and I think.

I'd be happy to go through it with you in greater detail if you're interested.\nAs you might expect, the job requirements are nothing short of impossible.  I guess this isn't surprising considering they want 'math geniuses'.  These geniuses must have 11 years of experience, advanced degrees, math expertise, and a solid understanding of probability theory.  And to top it all off, they're hiring interns to do math for them.  In fact I'm surprised they don't want them to work out of their cars.\nNow I understand that they're competing with other automakers for the best talent, but they're actually in worse shape than I thought.  The article goes on to say that they're going to expand the number of interns up to 750 this year, and expanding to 1,500 by the third quarter.  As if to drive home their desperation, they also want all the applicants to send in resumes to the company, no matter where they live.  I mean, isn't this what the mail room people are for, and isn't their mail address listed online?  Oh, and if you're wondering about the 1,500 interns, no they aren't being paid.  The article says this about the intern program, \"Chrysler declined to say how many of those who work at least 18 hours per week for 12 weeks without credit for college work will be offered full-time jobs.\"  So, at what point, do they realize math isn't the only game in town?  Do you actually want to put out that much cash when you know you're not going to get much back?  The article further states that they just don't want to pay overtime or benefits to any of the interns.  What a company, really, really...  I can't believe they are in this much debt.\nI know that you don't want this to get out.  I've also been reading about these contracting problems with United Auto Workers and all these lawsuits and strikes.  So I'm sending this letter to you in confidence hoping that you can get them on the track.\nPlease be advised that your company is in trouble, and because we're not in the car business, I suggest you stop doing the same things over and over again and expect different results.\nThere is one problem: you already have a better car than the other automakers and there was a time you had the best vehicles to buy, and the best employees to build them.  They are all gone, and the competition has caught up, or in some cases, surpassed you by leaps and bounds in all areas.  I could start a number of examples but they would all come back to the same thing: you are the company that is too big to fail, and so you probably will.\nBut, you can get out of this if you can follow the same advice I give everyone I read about on the news: you can't keep doing the same thing in hopes of a different result.  You don't have the money to spend like you used to, and you don't have the reputation the way you used to.  You need to reestablish your former reputation and rebuild your money pool, and there's really only one way you can do that.  You have to think small, and that means thinking 'small car'.\nYes, I know it's not sexy, and yes, I know Fiat and BMW make the cute little vehicles in your family, but no one is making them the way they used to make them, and you haven't lost your knack of making small cars that Americans like, except everyone else is starting to catch up.\nIt used to be when a customer had a problem with one of your products, the person making the product or the person servicing that product was accountable (sort of).

Ad Age recently ranked the St. Louis Post-Dispatch #1 in its print and online readership metrics, and it was the #3 top-ranked paper online in terms of weekly audience.\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch Uses Digital Tech to Increase Audience\nBy Jim Meenan\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch is being hailed as a model for many local newspapers across the country, including the ones in cities such as Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia.\nThe newspaper also is experimenting with a new print-platform that has resulted in an increase in audience. The product is called Bounce. For the last year, the publisher has been experimenting with this technology.\nThe key to the product may well be its mobile component, which enables users to turn the paper into a \"jumping book\" when they touch the paper.\nFor a newspaper in small town Missouri, this is a big deal. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has the largest print circulation of any daily newspaper in the state of Missouri. Its print circulation reached 233,734 in the Audit Bureau of Circulation's latest reporting period of six months in 2008. However, if you count the readers of the newspaper's website, this figure is more than 1.2 million.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch's website audience has more than doubled in the last seven years. It has 2 million unique users a month, which is a new record for the newspaper. It is a number rivaling that of The Wall Street Journal online.\nWhile the St. Louis Post-Dispatch has become a major force in the news industry, its reach is limited to a geographically constrained market. The challenge is how to move beyond this 300-mile radius to reach a much larger audience.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch had experimented with new technologies like mobile and wireless in the past, but never in this manner. It is working in conjunction with News-Press & Gazette Company, which owns a large newspaper, radio, and television station in the market.\nSome of its other efforts include a print-edition that has many more pages than most daily newspapers. That print edition comes with a second-tier paper that has half as many pages. It is a daily newspaper that is also put out on a Sunday morning.\nIn addition to its regular Sunday edition, the newspaper publishes a so-called \"Sunday Special,\" which is in effect a mini-version of its print Sunday paper.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch has also expanded into magazine publishing with Citygarden Magazine. Additionally, the newspaper has added a Sunday section entitled \"Living in the Lou.\"\nThe paper publishes eight editions a week, including a special Wednesday edition that is devoted to women's issues. The paper's readers have an average age in the mid-40s.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch is experimenting with a new mobile platform, which takes digital photos and automatically uploads them on the newspaper's website. The publisher expects to make this available in this coming year.\nThe newspaper recently acquired the St. Louis Business Journal. St. Louis' local business newspaper has a circulation of 20,000 and more than 1,000 subscribers online.\nThe St. Louis Business Journal also will be transitioned from weekly publication to a daily publication in the spring. It also will be adding a new editor of the business journal.\nAs with any experiment, things can take a little longer to get right than when you have a clear road map on what to do. The experiment with a new print-edition may have to continue for a little while longer before the audiences stabilize.\nFor both the print and digital editions, the newspaper's goals are to increase the level of its audience for 2009. For 2008, audience was flat at about 217,000. The Post-Dispatch's digital audience was about 726,000.\nIn November 2007, when the publisher decided to embark on this new technology journey, the targeted audience was at 146,000. The goal by year-end 2008 was to grow this number at 217,000. That was almost an increase by 52%.\nFor 2009, the goal for print audience is at 226,000.\nThe publisher is not trying to be a digital-only media.

Journalism is an industry that requires change, adaptation and evolution. However, that doesn't mean that some things are worthless; no...some things are worth a lot more than money.\nIt's no secret that the industry has been struggling for a while now, as it is continuing to do so. The layoffs are not going to stop, nor is the pay cuts. With all this negativity going around, it's starting to get a little overwhelming, and more importantly, negative (no offense to Mr. Crampton or anyone else on SMS, of course).\nBut, do you remember the good ol' times you had in J-school? Of course, you miss those days. Some people want to go back, and I understand why; it's one of the most exciting times in one's life - and it doesn't matter how old you are (just ask the many, many retired senior journalists I know). However, I can't say that one can return exactly to that time, but we can certainly give it our best effort.\nIt's the feeling we need to grasp, the feeling that we are part of something big. It is so simple, and yet so hard to grasp. Now don't get me wrong, I would never put anyone down because of the financial situation they are in. It's just that there are some things money can't buy. It's the feeling of being part of something that's in motion; the feeling of being in the front-line.\nI'm not going to sit back here and tell you that you should grab a laptop and travel to war-torn countries to report on people dying in the name of freedom. That's not what this post is about. I'm going to tell you to take an hour out of your day to have an honest conversation with your boss, your mentor, your colleague - anyone. Explain to them how you feel and the kind of work you want to do.\nSure, they are busy, and you know what? You are busy, too. That's why it's so important to make time for a constructive conversation like this one. I used to be the worst when it came to this sort of stuff; I was just thinking about myself most of the time; how would a conversation like this benefit me? How would it help me with my career?\nMaybe you don't feel comfortable having a conversation with your boss in regards to career. It's OK, that's their role. It's your job to tell them how you feel, especially if this is something that you feel needs to be changed and to ensure that you will be able to move forward. Remember, a career is something you put the hours in to earn.\nYou are your own boss. We are journalists, and this is what we do. If being a journalist is all that you've ever wanted to be, and you go into a situation where no one feels you are a good one, what do I tell you then?\nThere are some people who I've run into when starting to talk about wanting to change my career; some people told me that it was pointless and that I was going to waste my time. They were probably right. However, it was important to me to have that conversation with them, and now I don't have them telling me I am wasting my time.\nIt might be hard on your ego (as well as theirs and even you yourself at times), but having career conversations with the folks who matter (the ones that count) helps everyone move forward and to help you achieve your dreams.\nI've heard a lot of things from different colleagues, of how things need to change in their newsroom, and how they shouldn't have to cover a certain assignment because what they have being doing for 20 years is what's being paid into their pension - blah,blah,blah. I don't buy that. They're paid to do a job; however, that doesn't mean that their job has to stay exactly as it has. That's how people stagnate.\nA career comes from dedication and passion. A career comes from the fact that you don't just want to be a writer, you want to be a writer who reports. It's about being able to report on something you care about.\nSometimes it's easier said than done. There are a lot of things that you want to do in journalism; there's only so much time you have to do it. So, what do I suggest? I suggest that you take these moments to develop yourself without having to wait for someone to get you into", "Nineteen-year-old Kody Keplinger was born in Lexington, Kentucky, grew up in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee. Keplinger wrote _The Duff_ in her spare time while she was a student at Lipscomb University. At the end of high school, \"Kody\" got straight As, a full-ride track scholarship to Lipscomb University, and a book deal.\n_The DUFF_ is a story about Bianca's friends, her boyfriends (one of whom might be a psychopath), and her relationship with her parents. She's dealing with what happens when you're a teenager growing up\u2014you fall in and out of (and in and out of) love; you fall out of, in, and out of fashion; and you fall in and out of rebellion. Bianca is figuring out how to define herself, and the book is a coming-of-age story that explores the way relationships of all kinds help us to answer those questions.\nThe story was inspired in part by Keplinger's real-life experience working behind the desk at a movie theater in Tennessee. One day, a guy told her that he didn't want to sit near the \"Drama, Underachievers, Flubbers, and Freaks\" of the world\u2014which is _the_ best line in _The Duff_. The man, a high school teacher, was obviously looking at _The Duff_ as a guide for how to treat the so-called DUFFs in his school, and it made Keplinger want to write this story about a heroine who is not willing to be ignored or talked badly of.\nDURING THE WRITING OF _The Duff_ , Keplinger read _Rump Shaker_ by Ann Hood, in which the nineteen-year-old narrator learns that her first boyfriend tried to have sex with another woman the night they met. She read the book for a college class, but realized that it could just as easily be a book that a girl could read on her own\u2014to figure out what happened and maybe learn why they've spent the last five years of their lives as good friends.\nReaders who want a true story about one teenage girl writing and reading a \"chick book\" (a book that is about women and girls) might try _Rump Shaker_. Those who seek a story about a girl figuring out who she is will probably enjoy _The Duff_. And those who are interested in learning how one aspiring novelist worked her dream job may find inspiration in _The Duff_.\nKeplinger's inspiration for _The Duff_ has one big thing in common with her inspiration for _The Ugly Stepsister_. Both books are based on true things that happened to her. While most authors embellish the stories that they tell, Keplinger wants to tell them exactly as they happened because as an author, she wants her characters to ring true.\nShe is currently working on her third novel _Hide and Seek_.\n# CHAPTER 1\n# KODY'S BIG BOOBS AND THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT FOLLOWED\nTHEY WERE SOMETHING TOTAL, Kody was convinced. Kinda like Kim Kardashian's famed derriere before it matured to its current (and perfect) size. They had to be something totally extraordinary. But she didn't really think she'd be able to describe them until she asked her dad.\nHe was a writer, a man who could explain things, like why the sky was blue, or why people ate certain foods, or what caused your heart to beat. Not that Kody was in any way an idiot. In fact, she'd already won third prize this year in her regional science fair\u2014that in itself, she was convinced, totally made them noteworthy. But to be honest, she'd only entered because her lab partner was sick the week of the deadline, and her chemistry teacher was always the fair's overseer. And so a week later, after a quick phone call, she was walking in the door, holding the little green cardboard trophy in her hand, to the question she'd asked.\nShe held out her hand. \"Daddy.\"\n\"Kody,\" Mike Keplinger replied.\n\"You're the only one who calls me that,\" she said.\n\"Probably because you're the only one we've got,\" he said, coming from the kitchen, where he was reading the newspaper, drinking coffee, and eating a half", "In its Report on the Use of Information\nTechnologies by Public Broadcasting Systems of Canada,  the\nStanding Senate Committee on Transport, Communications and\nElectoral Modernization tabled its 31st interim report on November\n18, 1998 with the following terms of reference:\n1.

To be honest: we\u2019re still figuring out the answers.\nFor the last five years, Wall Street Journal executives have been working on creating a new class of businesses to diversify advertising revenue away from print, and so far we\u2019ve successfully added The Wall Street Journal + The Barrons + MarketWatch Advertising + Motley Fool + All About Your Money + and other offerings.\nIt\u2019s the second-largest collection of high-profile digital brands in the world that are tied to a traditional print product.\nOur portfolio is a result of a lot of hard work, and the efforts are continuing.\nThe digital ad market continues to grow, with Internet advertising spending expected to surpass total advertising spending in the entire U.S. by 2014.\nLast year, digital advertising revenue outpaced print advertising revenue for the first time.\nThere\u2019s much to explore.\nFor instance, a number we haven\u2019t talked about yet is the amount of time consumers are spending online and on mobile phones and tablets. We know we\u2019re being paid by advertisers based on consumers who have an opportunity to see our online ads \u2014 not because someone will see them 10 times.\nSo, if my theory is correct, it would be a safe assumption that some of those views are through mobile phones and tablets. That\u2019s an area we haven\u2019t yet tackled.\nThere\u2019s also the opportunity to integrate social media into the mix. When the Journal had 2 million unique users a day in November 2012, we had 3 million people on our paid/free apps and the Journal\u2019s website. By December, we\u2019d added 1 million additional app and website users.\nWe\u2019ve got a strong business model that\u2019s growing. We\u2019re not just sitting back relaxing and taking in the cash. It\u2019s a big world out there, and we intend to see the big picture.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve had great success with the digital/print blend. For instance, when the Journal\u2019s 2-page ad rates were the highest in the industry, the business became known as \u201cTwo Paid.\u201d But, we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re also looking at other models to monetise, such as bundling premium news content with advertising.\nSo, what is the digital advertising model?\nTraditional advertising models still hold strong. We do everything online and on mobile as a complement to our existing portfolio of print ad products and advertising relationships.\nBy using new and innovative ways to deliver, measure, and monetise content, we\u2019re bringing in consumers. And, we\u2019re not stopping there.\nIt\u2019s not about \u201ctraditional\u201d advertising anymore. We are developing new products to monetise the digital space.\nFor example: The WSJ + The Barrons Advertising product includes some of the highest-quality print publications in the world that have an established reputation with consumers and advertisers.\nThese are strong, vibrant, highly read publications for people that work in the financial services industry.\nOne of the best examples is on our new home page, WSJ.com. The Barrons Real Estate Advertising product is being integrated into the new Barrons real estate \u201ctab\u201d on the home page. The tab allows Barrons readers to search real estate listings in their own regions, and the advertising will be targeted to their specific preferences.\nFor example, \u201cJohn Doe\u201d might be browsing the site, looking at home listings in Florida. Based on his preferences, he will be served ads for homes in Florida.\nWe work with the same advertisers we have always worked with who understand that our content, the advertising around their content, and the experience the brand creates for consumers can drive significant return business in addition to the advertising spend.\nWe also sell on a category basis, which allows our advertisers to target their brands to readers who look at these publications because they share a common interest.\nFocusing on Mobile\nMobile apps have changed that game.\nThey are the single largest media vehicle that we\u2019re", "A new study has revealed that most Americans get their news from social media. More specifically, 28% of social news consumers say YouTube drives their news habits, followed by 28% who rely most on Facebook and 10% who say Snapchat is their primary news source.

More specifically, 28% of social news consumers say YouTube drives their news habits, followed by 28% who rely most on Facebook and 10% who say Snapchat is their primary news source. The younger the person, the more likely they are to check social media for news.\n\"While users of these three platforms are not all that much more likely to get their news from social media generally, it is interesting to see that users of YouTube and Facebook are more likely to say their first news website accessed is Yahoo or Hearst Digital and users of Facebook are more likely to get their first news from the Wall Street Journal or MarketWatch,\" said Raju Narisetti, head of T Brand Studio, The New York Times. \"Also worth noting that 32% of the users of these platforms get their news from non-traditional sources online like Google search or a brand/publisher's website or app, like the Wall Street Journal, and another 8% say they get their news from a non-tech company (like Disney or General Motors),\" he said.\n\"But interestingly, as the data above shows, when it comes to getting news on these platforms, users seem to gravitate to more traditional sources (WSJ and other established publications). So for traditional publishers like the WSJ, Yahoo, and Hearst Digital Media that are trying to break through the noise and get ahead of the pack, this can be significant, as the only way they might be able to get ahead of the pack would be if they can reach these users on these platforms.\"\n\"Also for Google and Facebook, though they are in this space, their brand or product name might not come to mind as a quick or go to source,\" he said.\nANALYSIS: There\u2019s not much of a social media ecosystem in which people can get all of their news, so this new survey makes sense. However, the younger generation relies the most on social media, with 61% saying they access news regularly via Facebook, followed by 55% on sites such as Snapchat and YouTube. On the flip side, only one in five Americans ages 50 to 64 use social media to stay abreast of the news. The older a person, the more reliant they are on Facebook and YouTube, according to survey data. Overall, people ages 18 to 34 rely on Facebook the most (55%), while over age 50, the most influential news sites are YouTube (29%); followed by Snapchat (10%); WhatsApp (6%); WeChat (5%); and Twitter and Weibo (both 3%).\nThe data confirms two basic trends: One is that people who rely on social media are also looking elsewhere for news, and the second is that social media news-reading habits vary widely.\n\"The most important takeaway from this survey is that people are not going all-in on social media to get their news, but instead are using it in combination with other sources. For traditional news brands, this means they may want to prioritise social media for getting their audiences to discover them, but also put an emphasis on other vehicles such as direct e-mails, referrals from others and other owned channels,\" said Mr. Narisetti. \"For social media platforms, there are two main takeaways: the first is", "This 3-month follow-up study demonstrated that a healthy microbiome can be established as early as 4 weeks of age. It is known that during the first 6 months of life, rapid microbe succession occurs within the gut of infants.\nThe composition of the gut microbiota is largely a result of breastfeeding and pre- and postnatal maternal antibiotic exposure. The early microbiome may establish a pattern for health or disease in humans, suggesting that infants who are born preterm or who suffer from malnutrition, infectious disease, allergies or asthma may have an altered microbiome.\nThe authors of this study concluded that a healthy microbiome can be established in infants, regardless of the gestation period during which they were born and regardless of the initial microbiome composition. The findings of this paper support the importance of lactation in the establishment of a healthy microbiome, which is essential to the immune system development of the neonate.\nThe Importance of Probiotics  -----", "This report provides a summary of the activities at the Hanford Waste Vitrification\nProject and Hanford Site for the period July 1987 to June 1988.

How bad is it?  Is there a Plan B?\nThe situation looks even worse than it did Saturday. The economy is not moving, it is sliding. People can smell that the government is stalling, hoping that something will happen that will take the pressure off. It is more clear than ever that the only way out is a large stimulus that will work rapidly, and a bank rescue package that will work in parallel.\nThere is some new language floating that indicates that the Obama people are beginning to talk about Plan B and, yes, the government shutting down if the GOP does not come around.\nThat is, we have reached the point where a large stimulus and a large FDIC/TARP-type program to get the banks working are the only things that will save the economy. A smaller stimulus or nothing at all is just going to make things worse. And the Obama crew has made it clear that the government must act quickly.\nIt's very hard to fight what is true and what everyone else seems to believe and wants you to believe for that very reason -- it is obvious and true.

We tend to be a nation of \u201cdon't worry, be happy\u201d when that has never been more dangerous. Our economy may have been stimulated by record-level debt, but how does that benefit the rest of us in the long run other than a little extra \u201cfun money\u201d to make ourselves feel better? The \u201cfun money\u201d will evaporate when the bill comes due and there will be no more \u201cfun money\u201d to ease our pain. We will not \u201coutgrow\u201d the problem. The only solution seems to be the next bailout with a guarantee that another bailout is right behind it. Our government has become a Ponzi scheme that needs a perpetual influx of new entrants.\nOur government knows better, and they know that if the people could \u201cget it,\u201d that they would change the way that they feel about spending, they would cut up their credit cards and limit the amount of debt so that they could focus on what is important. The government knows that if the people could just \u201cget it,\u201d most would realize that it was a bad decision to buy a home with an option-ARM and then later, when unable to afford the monthly payments, decided that the only solution was to call their lender and ask that their monthly payment amount be reduced to $200 because $200 was all they could afford. They know this because they created the mess by lowering lending standards and then encouraging everyone to enter the housing market so that they could all make money through home-equity loans.\nThe government also knows that most Americans are not ready to \u201cget it.\u201d They know that most Americans are willing to give up a little personal freedoms for some \u201csafety\u201d and security, that many of us do not think that there is anything wrong with a bipartisan-led federal government that is funded with record-level government debt and by taxing individual income. They know that we are okay with borrowing money in our children's names and grandchildren's names for our \u201csocial security benefits\u201d and pensions.\nWhen we see the government borrowing money, we tend to believe that it will have to be paid off in our lifetime, but we have no idea how much money we have borrowed. When we see the government spending money, we assume that we have spent money into existence; we have not. We are merely adding debt onto debt. In order for our economy to function, we need to be able to afford the basic essentials of life: food, shelter, clothing and health. Our children should not need to be concerned about basic essentials because their parents are responsible, and the country is successful and prosperous.\nThe government has to make it look as though our economic situation is stable. The government is creating the crisis, promulgating the solution and then taking some of the hardest-hit loans away from mortgage companies and turning them over to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to cover with taxpayer money. The government is now saying that the taxpayer money, of which we are short, can be found overseas. We must be like a drunk that wakes up in the morning and goes to the refrigerator to find that the booze is all gone. It was good while it lasted\u2026\nThe real story is out there. It is not about the housing market. It is about the economy and the government's handling of it. Our nation needs to awaken before we are stuck with a $4 billion bill for the \u201csafety\u201d of our children and a $30 trillion national debt. There may be some \u201cmoney magic\u201d coming from the government, but we might as well accept that it is only going to happen because of our ignorance.\nPETE EHRLICH is President of the Seller's Resource of Colorado, a Denver-based boutique real estate agency which specializes in helping sellers throughout the country achieve their home-sale goals; and owner/managing broker of Real Estate Solutions, LLC, a real estate solutions company based in Denver.

This rule applies to the Pacific sardine fishery from May 1 through April 30 of each year to be consistent with the Pacific sardine fishery and the annual Pacific sardine quota. As a result of recent population assessment information, it has been determined that the fishery for Pacific sardine should be opened sooner than the current May 1 date. This final rule will open the Pacific sardine fishery for the initial period of June 2013 through March 2014, followed by July 2013 through April 2015 and will be followed by July 2014 through April 2016; which provides access to full quota for this fishery. This action is necessary to implement the Pacific sardine research program and provide access to the full Pacific coastal sardine quota of 83,900 mt. DATES: This rule is effective for the Pacific sardine fishing year of 2013 from June 16, 2013 through March 31, 2014, for the 2014 Pacific sardine fishing year from June 17, 2014 through March 31, 2015 and for the 2015 fishing year from June 16, 2015 through March 31, 2016.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Takes of Marine Mammals Under Section 7 of the ESA The \u2018\u2018Take\u2019\u2019 Limit The Pacific sardine fishery is subject to the National Standard 1 (NS1) Take Limit of 37.5 per cent. The amount of the total take of Pacific sardine incidental to the Pacific sardine fishery, and to other fisheries subject to the Pacific sardine fishery management plan, that will result in the take limit being exceeded is determined under these amendments. Since it has not recently been subject to an annual catch limit, the Pacific sardine fishery is considered \u2018\u2018unlimited access\u2019\u2019 since 2006 and, therefore, must meet the NS1 limit to be consistent with this determination. The current, annual catch target is 83,900 mt (82,783 mt in 2012). The Council determined the 37.5 per cent NS1 limit results in a catch target of 31,489 mt for 2013. In view of the recent population assessment information, the catch target is being changed for 2013 to 24,000 mt (24,000 mt (23,200 mt in 2012)). The Council adopted 20 per cent of the 83,900 mt (16,770 mt) as the 2013 NS1 limit for the Pacific sardine fishery (i.e., 13,105 mt (13,105 mt in 2012). The Council determined the 20 per cent NS1 limit results in a catch target of 12,660 mt for 2014. In view of the recent population assessment information, the catch target for the fishery in 2014 is being changed to 13,333 mt (2012) 240 80614. 148 149 National Marine Fisheries Service NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE Final Rule", "CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DIGESTS, 1975-1976 (SPECIAL), AND CALIFORNIA ANNUAL\nREPORTS, 1975-1976\nCalif.

According to some, this is a way to help newspapers deal in the era of the \"Google world.\" The Independent's managing director suggests the image format is \"a way of cutting through the clutter, of finding a way of saying something that resonates with people.\" The Observer claims that the \"future of print [is] to adapt to different ways of using images.\"\nDesign Week's Ian Douglas suggests the format is \"a big bold statement. While most national media content is measured in page views, [the Independent's move is a] statement of intent, making headlines look a little bit superfluous and irrelevant.\"\nImage: Independent, UK\nNews, Digital Media, English, Featured, Newspapers, Summary, 2010 Digital Trend No. 3", "A 1998 PwC study shows that an increase of 46 full-time newsroom positions has a $19 million ripple effect in a city with just over 80,000 print readers. It suggests that media brands are critical to a community.\nWith the ever increasing popularity of mobile devices, the way we get information is changing. When I bought a new car, I bought it on the Internet from a company that sells cars in my market to consumers in my market. It might come from a dealer in my market; but probably not. The company has a virtual inventory in cities across the country, and can sell directly to the consumer without building a dealership.\nI also buy almost all of my books on my tablet. I go online. If the publisher doesn\u2019t have an online store, or it isn\u2019t well-designed, I will go to a competitor. It doesn\u2019t matter if the book was published by Amazon, Penguin, Hachette, or any independent publisher \u2013 I find, download, and consume the book.\nI don\u2019t go to a book store to hunt around for the book that I want; this practice is on the decline. I simply want an easy way to find what I want and buy it. The internet is my go-to source for just about everything. I have learned to consume information in a different way.\nThe same thing is happening with news. Instead of picking up the newspaper and reading it, I get the news on my phone first thing in the morning. I can get it from Google News; Yahoo News; Bloomberg; The Wall Street Journal; or CNN. If not that, I will ask people at work or find alternative ways to get my news.\nWe have learned to consume our news this way because it is easy, it is in-tune with the way we are working and living, our digital lifestyle. The print newspaper, for now, is a thing of the past (for me). I prefer a digital experience and a digital experience is changing the industry \u2013 but there is still life for print newspapers.\nAccording to a 2013 report from the Pew Research Center\u2019s Project for Excellence in Journalism, print circulation at newspapers continued to plummet, dropping to an estimated 42.5 million daily and circulation on Sunday fell by 11.9% in 2013.\nPrint subscriptions are down 44% since 2008 and as of 2013 the circulation of U.S. daily newspapers was below 40 million \u2014 for the first time since the early 1950s. By 2040 the industry will still exist, but it will certainly be different, and that is okay.\nThat news is on the decline is not at all surprising. Newspapers began to fade from popularity in the mid-19th century; as we started to see more and more technological advances in communication. As technology and societal needs change, so does the industry. But it is not going away; what it is going to look like in the future is still up in the air.\nIn the news business, the print product has lost to the electronic. But, just like with books, there has to be some reason to buy the physical version. It cannot just be because it\u2019s fun to consume news the old fashioned way; or because it\u2019s fun to own a physical product.\nIf there is no value to the print product, there is no business in it. In a report from PwC that was released in 1998 during the height of the internet age, it suggested that in a community with 80,000 print readers, an 11% decrease (or 8,800 people) in print circulation and a 6% (5,400) people in staff reductions would see 6,500 full-time equivalent (FTE) business service jobs (or 566 full-time jobs) left in the community. That\u2019s not a big number, considering you are talking about just 11% change in readership.\nThe PwC study estimated that total output in a town with 80,000 newspaper readers was $196 million. With a change in circulation of 6%, it would cause output to decrease by $11.5 million and job losses of 18 new full-time positions.\nWith a town having 8,800 new jobs, it would be created through spillover effects in other industries. And, with a $11.5 million loss in output from circulation change,", "Newspapers need to recognise that they have to be transparent on their own content.\nOnline Media Companies Must Be Transparent\nBusiness Wire | February 1, 2008\nBy Robert A. Grossman, president, Business Wire\nNEW YORK, Feb. 1 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Business Wire Global Media Monitoring\nstudy found that newspapers publish an estimated 4.6 billion content references per year--up\nby 21 percent from 2006. In addition, the study found that the number of companies that\npay for editorial content doubled from approximately 200 in 2006 to 425 in 2007.\nAs is apparent from the study's findings, the journalism profession is in a transitional\nsituation with regard to new business models because of new, emerging technologies and\nnewspapers are at the front of a transition to these new platforms.\nOnline news is becoming more influential in a variety of ways. The study showed\nsignificant growth in the number of media outlets, the number of editorial content items\nthey published, and the amount of editorial content posted to media outlets' own\nThe study also showed that media outlets are gaining an increasingly large portion\nof their total website referral traffic from other media outlets, from 25% in 2006 to\n49% today.\nTherefore, newspapers need to recognize that when they post editorial content\nthey need to be transparent about the source of the content. Media outlets should also\nbe aware of copyright owners' proprietary rights.\nTransparency in online media is critical because newspapers need to avoid\nmisrepresenting their editorial content. A misleading presentation and representation of\ncontent can confuse or deceive news consumers and this can violate their trust. Trust\nis the backbone of building loyal consumers.\nNewspapers should be open, clear, and truthful.\n-- Robert A.

To take\nfull advantage of the interactive\nopportunities provided through\nonline publishing, newspapers\nshould take their newsroom operations\noffline and engage readers as\nmore than just sources. Stark adds\nthat newspapers today must take the\npublic's concerns into account in\norder to produce news that is useful\nto people, rather than just another\nnews outlet that produces news\nfor consumers. \"I think the journalism\nof the past was great, but\nthere's more to come. The\nopportunity now,\" Stark exclaims, \"is\nto make it even better.\"\nStark also pointed out that newspapers\nshould take advantage of the\ninternet to make use of the vast\namount of online discussion.\nAccording to him, traditional journalism has\nbecome \"a sort of\nmonologue, when discussion is\nso much cheaper and more\ndynamic. Newspapers can\nmake money from blog advertising\nand can create relationships between\nreaders and writers,\" said Stark.\nBesides offering new ways of\nthinking about journalism, the\nunconference concept helps\nnewspapers figure out what they\nshould publish, and who should\ndo the reporting, Stark says. \"If the\ntopic has been discussed by 1,000\npeople, the problem has been\nsolved and you can find that out and\nthe best journalism is what\npeople do on their own. They're\nalready talking online, and in ways\nthey wouldn't think and talk\nabout in other settings,\" Stark says.\n\"It's an opportunity to harness\npeople's ideas.\"\nWhen considering the subject of\nnews, Stark said it would be\ndifficult to find a topic that wasn't\nalready being discussed on the web.\n\"If you take a traditional story\nidea such as marriage, there'd be no\nplace to start,\" he said. \"You have to\nlook at a different way of thinking,\nthen go out and see what else is\nhappening. It's a great way of\ntaking a story and moving it into\nthe mainstream for discussion.\"\nStark, with the support of a small team of\ncommunity and social media\ninnovators, is looking at the best\nopportunities to make the\nunconference happen in New York.\nBeyond using the Web 2.0 concept to report on\nthe event, Stark said that it offers\na chance for him and his team to\ndevelop the unconference, \"to take what\nwe're learning at the unconference,\nthen implement it through a newspaper\nand report back to those involved.\"\nStark acknowledged that while \"we may be\nsomewhat disorganized today,\" he adds\nthat as time moves forward the plan\nwill be refined. \"We are hoping that\nsome organization will move toward\nbeing more open to different ideas\nand methods of delivering the truth,\nbut it will be the people who will\nmake any changes, at the end of the day,\" said\nStark. \"The newspapers have\ntrusted their readers and their\nadvertisers to go out and explore,\nand if we're lucky enough to have a\nnewspaper, we'll report back.\"\nThe unconference concept was not\nactually a new idea for Stark, who\nadmits that he has been familiar with\nthem for some months. \"It\nfell over me like rain and I was\nsoaked in it,\" said Stark, \"but in\na good way.\"\nStark admits that he has to\naccept the fact that he is new to this\nwhole newspaper world. \"I'm\nreally an academic, I've worked with\nnewspapers before, but now I'm running\none and have to learn the ins and outs\nof the media business.\"\nAs", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received a\nPetition for Reconsideration, in accordance with Commission's Rules, in\nthe above captioned investigation.

On June 3, 1994, pursuant to sections 207, 208, 4(i), and 403 of\nthe Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and sections 1.98, 1.41, and\n1.211 of the Commission's rules, the FCC adopted an Order on\nSupplemental Review and Initial Decision in Tape #P45 1396, which\nestablished certain limitations on interstate switched access rates\nimposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on\ncertain interstate Telephone Directory Services (TDS) rates based on\nthe presumption that TDS rates were unjust and unfair. 11 FCC Rcd 11794\n(1996). On May 11, 1998, the FCC issued a decision in response to\nsupplemental briefs concerning the CPUC's position that its rules\nare immune from review.  The decision in Tape P45 1396, Order on\nSupplemental Review and Initial Decision adopted in Docket TC-2/3A,\nfound that the California TDS Access Rate Presumption was an illegal\nper se presumption that was imposed on all jurisdictions regardless of\nhow the jurisdictions treat these services, rather than being an\nindividualized determination based on the evidence. See Tape P45 1396,\nOrder on Supplemental Review and Initial Decision at paragraph 25.  The\nOrder reaffirmed that it has statutory authority to modify rate\npresumptions. The order also instructed the Administrative Law Judge\nto make recommendations concerning the most appropriate method for\nreconciling presumptions with the FCC's rules. The decision was filed\nas Decision #587 on May 11, 1998 in Tape P45 1396. In the meantime,\nthe FCC issued an order finding that the 1994 Order on Supplemental\nReview was not appealable, yet still binding unless reconsidered.\nSee In the Matter of ACC Corporation, 11 FCC Rcd 6117 (1996).\n3. The Petitioners argue that the FCC erred in finding that it\nhas authority to rebut the \"illegal presumption\" established by the\nCPUC. The Petitioners assert that this policy is inconsistent with\nthe FCC's policy goals of providing national access rates and that\nthe FCC may not set different rates in the state or federal context\nwhen it has already established national access rates. The Petitioners\nraise numerous legal arguments in support of this", "How often do you feel like your team does\nthings in a way that is most profitable for the company, rather than\nthe way that's necessary because someone, somewhere, has always\ndone them that way?", "In this chapter, we discussed a range of techniques for dealing with conflict and resolving disagreement. We looked at different ways of managing conflict as a process, using the \"Six P's of Conflict Management\":\n  Acknowledging we have a problem\n  Talking to those affected\n  Analysing the problem and working out who is most affected\n  Planning how we are going to deal with the problem in a practical way\n  Getting the people who need to be involved on-side, and making sure they understand what is to be achieved\n  Implementing the plan, achieving the outcome, closing the process\nWe thought through how to go about these different steps, using questions and tips and tricks to help in a variety of situations, ranging from handling disagreement on a management team, to working with your boss or a client and ensuring that your personal and professional relationships with those you deal with can be constructive, and not destructive.\nA word of warning and a piece of advice came with this chapter, in the form of our tips at the end (see p. 74). Whilst much of the advice is straightforward and easy to follow, this one piece of advice should form the foundation of thinking about, and therefore managing, conflict in the workplace:\nRemember. It's not personality clashes and problems that matter here \u2013 it's the work, it's the delivery of the outcome, and it's making this important.\nYou could say that our aim for dealing with conflict as a process should be to _achieve something rather than to fix someone_!\nOur \"Six P's of Conflict Management\" are designed to help you think about how to achieve something, rather than to fix someone. It is the outcome that matters, and not the personalities or egos of individuals. If we try and remember this when dealing with different types of conflict, then it is much easier to keep an eye on the target \u2013 and to keep our aim true!\n1. Acknowledging we have a problem\nThe \"I\" is the \"I\" of \"I've Got a Problem!\" (to quote one of those all too common and not very helpful pop-up windows on the net).\nSometimes it's hard to recognize when you are at that first stage of a conflict or disagreement situation. If you are in a working and busy environment, it's easy to fail to see how friction can be affecting you. You may simply be feeling uncomfortable or unhappy and, as you get on with your business, you might not realize that you're not exactly seeing eye to eye with a colleague, or that you're in the midst of a disagreement and not very comfortable.\nTake time to think back over the last day or two (or perhaps longer if you are feeling friction). Have you had a meeting at work where things didn't go smoothly? This is a very common reason for feeling friction. Or perhaps you've been told off by your coach, mentor or boss, for some aspect of your work. Or perhaps you have a colleague with whom the relationship is quite difficult \u2013 and this difficult relationship is the source of the most amount of friction!\nTake out a pen and paper, or write on a blank page (or use your computer), and give some thought to the different sources of friction or conflict that you are experiencing in your professional life right now. If a colleague or someone is annoying you, make a list of the most annoying things they do, with a brief explanation. This will help with dealing with difficult colleagues and with difficult people (see p. 21).\n2. Talking to those who are affected\nFlicking through various issues of management journals, industry periodicals, trade press, business magazines and similar media, you may well get the idea that the biggest barrier or obstacle to managing conflict and resolving disagreement is failing to talk to the people we disagree with, or to communicate better when discussing issues.\nThere are a lot of management and business courses around where people seemingly sit all day and discuss how they feel. For a lot of participants in these programs, much of what is communicated in these courses is stuff that they don't need to discuss at all.\nWhat is needed is people who have the ability and skill to talk sensibly with individuals, but also to be able to work with groups and have difficult conversations.\nSo the second P of conflict management and resolving disagreement is, in this context, about managing people and negotiating with other people.\nRemember that in a disagreement or conflict situation, it's a good idea to use the two-step method suggested", "A former publisher/editor of two local newspapers is accused of embezzling more than $96,000 in checks\nfrom 2001 to 2004, reports The Gainesville Sun.

Penguin Random House acquired the North American digital rights last year from J.K. Rowling and her Pottermore imprint.\nPublishers should take a cue from the way Penguin Random House manages that relationship. The publisher gives Rowling the space she needs to control how her brand is handled. She also is able to share details about the process to her millions of fans on Pottermore. In return, Penguin Random House gets a great deal of exposure as the official publisher of the \u201cBoy Who Lived.\u201d\nThe Harry Potter eBooks will be available in the next few months, and Penguin Random House and Rowling are already planning a massive fan activity in New York. Rowling is creating new content, and there will be a launch party to kick off the availability of the eBooks the same way the first eBooks were available 15 years ago. The publisher has built a comprehensive website to explain the eBook process and provide links to the Harry Potter story world. In addition, every eBook will have a Q & A with Rowling about her relationship of writing and publishing in the digital age. The publisher is also working with Google on exclusive content such as a Hidden Chamber of Secrets Google experience tied into the eBook.\nWith a deal of this scale, how do you get exposure in the press? Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher of the digital eBooks, not simply a rights holder, which it could have been.\nIn its deal, Penguin Random House also got a global distribution and marketing deal with Sony as well as ebook retailer deals with Kobo and Sainsbury\u2019s, with others in the works.\nPenguin Random House is taking the Harry Potter eBooks with Rowling, who is using her voice to bring attention to the new versions, and its partnership with the author in a marketing and publicity way that is consistent with its brand. It will be a marketing force like none that the publisher has ever used before.\nWhile this type of deal would be tough for a midsize publishing house, smaller publishers should look at ways they can partner with authors or other influential people to get the same level of exposure.\nWhat can publishers do to get attention on big deals? While the size and cost of a deal can get attention from the press (i.e., the $160 million deal that Random House signed with Tina Turner), you should create other opportunities to make sure the audience knows your story.\nHarry Potter eBooks:\nPenguin Random House took control of the Harry Potter eBooks from J.K. Rowling using traditional publishing rights, not only to reacquire them, but to license Rowling\u2019s eBook to Sony.\nThe Harry Potter books\u2019 eBook rights had been held by Sony in the US and the Netherlands, and by Bloomsbury in non-US language editions. Bloomsbury is a publishing house, but it is too small to license the deal.\nAs a result of Penguin Random House buying eBooks, both Pottermore Books, which is an imprint of PRH and a digital publisher, and Sonys has control over the eBooks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some confusion over this, but the books will be available in English from Pottermore Books,\u201d Sonys said in a statement.\n\u201cElectronic rights to Pottermore Books\u2019 editions will be withdrawn from Pottermore, LLC, the organization that manages the ebook rights of all English language rights for digital editions of the Pottermore eBooks, including the digital editions previously distributed by Sony.\u201d\nRowling holds the digital eBook and audiobook rights to the Harry Potter phenomenon, and has used that right to license some of the books to Amazon.\nAccording to the Guardian, \u201cSony\u2019s editions will be sold through all platforms, in territories where Pottermore does not have digital and audio rights, including territories currently managed by Pottermore in the UK (including Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), Ireland, Europe or the Commonwealth.\u201d\nIn a statement, Pottermore said: \u201cThere are no plans for a physical edition at this time as ebook and audio versions will be available.\u201d\nOne of the biggest problems facing publishers as the digital market matures is getting press exposure for a deal of this size, which is why a publisher took control of it.\nAs part of the publishing deal, Penguin Group USA is publishing", "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) proposes to eliminate the National Highway System (NHS) Eligible Bridges (EB) program. The program, administered by the FHWA Division Offices, was enacted by section 117 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), enacted on August 10, 2005 (Pub L 109-59, July 10, 2005), which consolidated former Safe, Accountable, and Flexible Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA) programs, including the Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. 23 This rule proposes to eliminate this FHWA EB program upon expiration of program authority under Title V, Subtitle D of SAFETEA-LU at the end of FY 2009. FHWA's Office of Federal Lands Highway in partnership with the Office of Program Administration in the Resource Center (the Resources Center) will ensure continuity of service and will manage the final distribution of program funds and technical assistance to state bridges agencies. The Resources Center will also administer an EB reimbursement contract that has been in place since 2007 and will continue to serve agency customers. The FHWA proposal to eliminate the EB program at the beginning of FY 2010 has the full support of the Resources Center and does not anticipate any adverse ramifications for Resources Center customers. FHWA does not anticipate any disruption of services. The elimination of the EB program will not impact state bridges programs. State bridges programs will continue to be administered by the States.

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires that the public be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed collection of information before it is implemented. This notice seeks public comment on the proposed information collections. Title 23 U.S.C., Section 300(b) requires that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Transit Administration, and the St. Louis Metropolitan Transit Commission (SLAT), conduct an analysis of all Federal-aid projects, programs, and activities and assess whether the projects, programs, and activities are carried out in a manner that reflects to the greatest extent practicable the institutional arrangements of the State, local, and Tribal governments (Public Law 107\u201345; October 26, 2001). The Unified Agenda reflects the agency\u2019s on-going efforts to follow section 300(b) on an annual basis. For each project, there are numerous submissions to the FHWA and Federal Transit Administration: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Environmental Assessments and Reviews (EA/RS). Construction Environmental Impact Statements (DEIS), and other environmental reports used for the National Environmental Policy Act Process. Environmental Management Plans (EMP).

Other Environmental Documents in Categorical Exclusion (CE) format. Federal lands transportation planning documents. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The FHWA/Federal Transit Administration proposes to continue collecting environmental-related information for environmental impact analyses (EIA), documents used in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Process and environmental consultation on Federal-aid (Title 23 U.S.C.) and non-Federal aid (Title 49 U.S.C.) Federal-aid projects, including Federal lands highway systems.

But what exactly is an acquisition funnel, and how can you best use it?\nAs many companies are now doing, content marketing teams have begun shifting away from the traditional funnel model, which was often inaccurate and out-of-date. The old method would put your visitors in one of the following categories:\nTheir first conversion is to click your CTA.\nOnce they\u2019re on your website, they can then convert to a lead via forms, surveys, contests, or downloads.\nLeads can then convert to customers by going through another purchase process on your website or purchasing offline.\nThe acquisition funnel is a bit different than the funnel model in that instead of focusing on whether a lead converts or not, it\u2019s more geared toward driving traffic to each stage of the process and measuring this \u201cfunnel\u201d process.\nOnce you start to apply the concept of buyer\u2019s journey to your marketing content, instead of simply converting leads once they\u2019ve become customers, you\u2019ll notice engagement with them will get higher as well. People will actually be seeking out your content to help them figure out how to solve their problem!\nSo\u2026what\u2019s this buyer\u2019s journey?\nBefore you can talk about a buyer\u2019s journey, you should know what it is and why it\u2019s important to think about it when creating a content marketing strategy.\nAccording to a Google study, by the time buyers actually engage with your brand, it takes 57% longer than what used to be the industry standard (at only a 35% increase).\nBuyers today have evolved into what Google calls \u201cConsidered Shoppers.\u201d They are more savvy than ever before and need a good reason to buy from you instead of your competitors.\nSo how do we answer this question?\nFor a long time, sales teams have relied on these buyer personas in order to reach the correct target audience, and content marketers are following suit.\nIn an ideal scenario, you would have a buyer persona for each buying process stage, so you could tailor your content to those specific buyer personas\u2019 specific needs.\nA buyer persona should be:\nGender and Age.\nThis may seem extreme, but all of these small pieces of the puzzle are incredibly important to know before writing your content. Once you know everything you can about your buyer persona, you can create the content they\u2019ll love most and that will convert the highest percentage.\nSo now that we\u2019ve got the basics down, let\u2019s talk about the buyer\u2019s journey using the marketing acquisition funnel.\nEach stage requires a different kind of content.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re familiar with the buyer\u2019s journey model, you\u2019ve got all of your buyer personas sorted out, and you now have the foundation to start creating content to nurture these buyer personas.\n1. Problem awareness\nThis stage is the first step in the buyer\u2019s journey. Customers often can\u2019t recognize that a problem exists, or even if they do recognize that a problem exists, they can\u2019t figure out what the problem is yet.\nFor instance, say you\u2019re an e-commerce retailer and people come to your online store to check out new styles, but aren\u2019t ready to pull the trigger yet. They may be on your website because they want to figure out if the shoe in the photo is actually the exact color they want.\nPeople may also come to your site to check if your brand\u2019s new perfume is available elsewhere and why. They\u2019ll visit blog posts and product pages and even chat customer service to figure out the answers to their questions.\nIn this stage, you\u2019ll want to give this person more information to help answer their question, but you want to do it in a way that engages them without seeming too \u201csalesy.\u201d\n2. Problem recognition\nNow the customer is at least aware of a problem that exists and they may have even figured out what the potential solution could be. However, they probably aren\u2019t ready to actually talk to your sales team yet.\nThis is a classic example of a funnel stage.\nThey can be very passive here before they\u2019re ready to actually buy a product or hire the company.\nSo keep providing them with solutions and answers to their questions, but do it in a way that still provides them with value instead of", "In June 2008, the FSCS, a public body, provided financial support to the customers of a bank that was in financial difficulty. Under section 251B(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, an applicant must notify the company concerned of a claim against the company. The FSCS did not do this, and consequently the recipients were not notified that a claim had been made. The applicant subsequently took a series of steps to prevent the claim from being made public. In this case, the complaint is that the FOIA, under section 44 of the Crime and Courts Act 2003, provides a limited exemption for information which is held by a minister of the Crown, and which was obtained under or by virtue of, the Act or any other statutory provision, if compliance with the request: (a) relates to an application for damages under section 7 of the Act (section 38 (4)(a)); or (b) is likely to prejudice the conduct or outcome of such an application. In a previous case, the Commissioner had found that the FSCS was a \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the FOIA and the exemption should be held to extend to such a person. In the present case, the Commissioner found that the FSCS held the information \u201cunder or by virtue of\u201d the Act. He therefore concluded that the exception was not engaged, and that the FSCS should provide the claimed documents. The public interest in withholding the information would have been better served had the Minister provided a certificate excluding the information under section 39 of the Act. The Commissioner therefore allowed the complaint that the FSCS was not entitled to withhold the information under section 44(1) of the FOIA.

The Globes\u2019 increased advertising revenue in the year after winning is not a fluke but reflective of the increased exposure the show generates for its viewers and the advertisers. Furthermore, this exposure seems to be consistent over time and advertisers are willing to pony up the cash to be associated with the Golden Globes\u2019 viewers. While this paper has established that the Golden Globes are a successful awards show, further analysis and investigation will be needed for more generalizations to be made about which awards shows are the most successful.\nAwards shows are increasingly gaining prominence in the media sector, as they provide viewing opportunity and high ad revenue. Given that it requires little to no effort to watch, the awards show is a unique medium to use and leverage to build brand awareness and advertise a product (Baumgarten 2011). While awards shows were once the province of film, TV, and music industries, they have expanded to other areas as well to include fashion, design, and social media. By 2010, there were dozens of awards shows that focused on different genres of media. For instance, there were 29 different awards shows in 2010 focusing on the advertising industry, while the Golden Globes were one of eleven awards shows that focused on film and TV (Awards 2011).1 For marketers, award shows are a way for brands to leverage current trends and capitalize on consumer\u2019s increasing appetite for media content (Baumgarten 2011). According to Nielsen, the global hours spent with media has increased by 300 percent since 2006, and the biggest increase has been in emerging markets (Nielsen 2014). Given the increasing popularity of media, it was bound to find a new niche that would capture consumers\u2019 attention. The Golden Globes found it in awarding the best in film and TV, bringing awards shows to a whole new class of viewers. While the Golden Globes had already made a name for itself as a successful awards show and advertising vehicle, the results of the study show just how successful they have been in not only winning the trophy but generating large amounts of ad revenue. According to Nielsen (2014), the top five award shows accounted for 46.4 percent in ad revenue for the total awards show industry in the US. This study analyzed the performance of the Golden Globes from 2009 to 2015 in both winning the awards and the revenue it generated for advertisers. While past research has focused on the performance/success of award shows (i.e how many nominations received, number of viewers), the results of this study indicate that winning the Golden Globe Awards could produce positive financial results for advertisers and potentially provide a competitive advantage for their brands.\n2.\tThe Golden Globes: Winners of Success\nThe study focuses on the performance of the Golden Globes from 2009 to 2015.2 Golden Globes awards have been given out since 1944 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which consists of around 90 members mainly representing film and TV industry outstanding work. Most of the members are journalists, writers, and photographers that are not involved in the film industry; however, their opinions on film and TV in both domestic and international markets carry weight in the industry and are considered to be very influential by many in the US film industry. The Golden Globes have evolved from being a less-known awards show into a leading awards ceremony. While in its formative years, it had difficulty making an impact within the film community, by the 1950s, the Golden Globes were considered the second most important awards show next to the Oscars. From 2001 to 2004, the Golden Globes were ranked third, but starting in 2005, it took up the first spot, and since then, the Golden Globes have remained at the top of the charts to be the best-performing awards show (Wikipedia 2015).\nDespite all its efforts to prove its importance, the Golden Globes has some detractors. One of the reasons is that the organization has had a long history of discrimination and has often made racist remarks. Since a majority of its members are from Southern Europe, the organization was slow to", "Nielsen's Local Watch is a platform that will allow marketers to measure local television from different angles and formats. Local TV is the most difficult to use for advertisers, and it will be the last major media channel to get such a platform. Nielsen CEO Bill Ackerman explains how Local Watch works, why he loves it, and where it goes next.\nThe Local Watch platform will help advertisers understand and measure local television and the role that it plays in the life of consumers and their buying behaviors. The biggest advantage of a Local Watch environment will be the amount of information that advertisers will be able to access, and the fact that it delivers in a way that allows brands to make adjustments to their mix of advertising media and to their plans from the consumer data and the insights the data delivers.\nLocal Watch is the next step in television's continued evolution. The platform will include syndicated audiences (like Arbitron and Rentrak, which Nielsen has just acquired), Nielsen set-top box data, and first-party data. Each piece of data can be matched at the household level, allowing for customized advertising messages and a very granular understanding of where people are and what they're doing at any given point during the day and night. There will be a host of benefits from the marketing agency perspective that we're excited about, from a data and analytics perspective.\nLocal Watch allows advertisers to create a consistent dialogue with consumers at a local level. Each of us knows that the most important advertising today is the one that's most relevant to the people watching it -- what they're watching, where they are, what they like. From a measurement perspective, Local Watch will help to deliver that message at a local level in order to understand and be able to talk to people's behavior and the role that plays in what an advertiser is trying to achieve in the marketplace.\nLocal television has been very difficult for marketers to use, which is one of the reasons that we think local television is the last major platform to have that type of understanding. You have to have a very precise way in which you define the marketplace and then how you understand consumer response and behavior in order to understand the role that local television is playing in terms of what brands are trying to do with their audiences. The Local Watch platform will allow advertisers to understand what roles a particular audience is engaged in the day and the night and to adjust accordingly their plans and spend.\nWe've built the foundation for Local Watch, and now we're moving quickly to build the next phase of the product. We're going to include a broad array of data sets, including the local TV space using Nielsen's Local Market Rating methodology. We're going to include Arbitron and Rentrak. We're going to include first-party data from some of the major advertisers in the marketplace. We're going to include the ability of advertisers to build first-party data sets themselves and work with their agencies to help them be able to provide their insights.\nI'm most excited about where Local Watch is going next. The platform is the most sophisticated digital advertising platform now available on local television; it allows advertisers to use a variety of data at the household level in a way that's never been done before. What I'm most excited about is what it looks like next, how we can move the technology forward and incorporate other data sets. I look forward to the day when we're able to use this product to understand a wide variety of audiences, their behavior and their role in the marketplace. Most of all, I'm excited that advertisers are now able to create an environment that allows for a more effective dialogue with audiences using this level of data sophistication.\nThe platform will allow advertisers to look at TV the way they look at digital because they'll be able to use their digital data analytics methodologies to work with a new platform to understand consumer behavior, context of that behavior and the role that media plays in those behaviors. Advertisers will be able to use the same methodologies that they use now in digital to understand how TV can work for them.\nAdvertisers will be able to work with an integrated platform that allows for a cross-platform strategy that incorporates the impact of television, radio, digital and more. This platform will help advertisers be able to integrate all of those different platforms into an integrated advertising strategy. The real-time data available from this platform will allow marketers to customize the marketplace based on specific campaign plans and strategies.\nNielsen's CEO, Jim Attwood, recently", "Telling your story in video is the best way for a new site to promote its journalism and tell it to a wider audience, especially on sites that cannot afford to pay for expensive ad sales strategies, like those promoted by Google\u2019s YouTube.\nLivio Andronico\u2019s presentation to the 10th Digital Video and Mobile Video Conference at the International Symposium on Online Journalism, Washington, D.C.\nLivio Andronico, director of media and audience growth for Univision Digital, spoke about the rise of news videos in Latin America and how Univision Digital uses them to tell its news stories.\nSince 2008, when Univisi\u00f3n opened a new newsroom and began reporting on the digital and multiscreen audiences, it noticed that these new viewers were increasingly turning to video for news, reports Andronico. He said Univisi\u00f3n\u2019s digital news strategy is based on a very simple idea: They aim to tell the story that people watch.\nThis simple idea is not as easy as it seems, noted Andronico. It requires that the news team know what issues matter most for its audience, how to craft original stories, and how to bring in high quality content.\n\u201cWe now need these stories in the form of video, and here is where we face the biggest challenge: Our news video teams need to be very creative,\u201d said Andronico. The goal is to tell stories to the audience that is in their lives.\nUnivisi\u00f3n is able to produce these online-only and mobile reports through their two-year strategy, \u201cJournalism 2.0,\u201d in which it created five teams of people who specialise in online reports, social media, user engagement, and other innovative news approaches and platforms, explained Andronico.\nHis presentation included a few examples of Univisi\u00f3n\u2019s original and innovative online storytelling, and how it is able to present these stories through video. Below are four of the most compelling, each telling a digital news story in their own way.\nUnivisi\u00f3n\u2019s digital audience is not only watching video on mobile and computers; another important platform is social platforms such as Twitter. This is why a video-first approach is crucial for news journalists.\nUnivision Digital developed three guidelines that they call \u201cFirst Principles,\u201d based on the successes of its first news reports:\n1 \u2013 They must always tell stories in an emotionally engaging manner. Andronico cited a news story, \u201cBuried Alive,\u201d that has become a mainstay on Univisi\u00f3n\u2019s YouTube channel, where there now are 59 million total views.\n2 \u2013 They have to create original stories, avoiding recycle or syndicated items.\n3 \u2013 They have to understand mobile consumption habits of Univisi\u00f3n\u2019s youth demographic.\nAndronico showed examples of stories like \u201cTeenager Who Survived a Bullet to the Head\u201d to show \u201cthe kind of stories we report,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are personal, intimate, and always, always mobile.\u201d\nUnivisi\u00f3n also has news reports that take advantage of its partnership with Astral Audience Network, the US television group who helps the Spanish-language news reports become an advertising platform in a new and more relevant way for marketers to advertise on.\n\u201cOur viewers watch all our news stories,\u201d said Andronico. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the difference because we don\u2019t ask questions. We don\u2019t care about who is watching us.\u201d\nUnivisi\u00f3n now has a variety of ways to reach its audiences, all of the them available for marketing companies, from live streams, to reports through social media, live polling, and all of them branded for the advertising campaign.\n\u201cBy combining everything around the news show, we were able to create not only a new way to engage with the audience, but also more value for our advertisers,\u201d said Andronico. \u201c[The news team are] not just creating stories; they become campaigns in themselves. That is what a digital audience is looking for.\u201d\nUnivisi\u00f3n also has a video library of its investigative reports that are now available as a series. These are videos that are created with the intention of creating value for its audiences by showing the best investigative journalism stories they are creating. \u201cThese are our most original stories and we treat them as such,\u201d said Andronico, with 70% of them made by a small group of producers. \u201cThe entire production can take them as little as 36 hours. The idea is to get the story out fast, but with high quality.\u201d\nThe Univisi\u00f3n Mobile team\u2019s \u201cCuentas Pendientes\u201d series, presented", "In 2016, a new entrant in the Australian media market is expected to gain unprecedented levels of consumer insight through the collection and analysis of 360-degree data.\nFour Questions for Panopto CTO Matt Tinder\nWhat follows below is an excerpt of an interview previously presented as a webinar discussing Matt Tinder\u2019s view on what will affect the digital video industry in 2016, including the company he co-founded that will revolutionize digital learning.\nMatt Tinder, CTO - Panopto\nQ. How and why does 360-degree data capture and analysis differ from and complement the traditional approach to insightful research?\nMatt: There is actually a bit of a short answer and a long answer to this question, because while the techniques used by researchers differ quite a bit, the key challenge is to understand that when we talk about 360-degree video, we are not really talking about a particular technology, we are talking about a research process.\nSo you could imagine something like, for example, a 3,000 person representative sample of people that we survey. One group of those 3,000 people wearing a 180-degree camera that just captures their vision for a 2-hour period. Then we conduct the survey and we get lots of insight from the people who said they participated in the 180-degree video survey. That\u2019s one way you could do it.\nThe other thing is you could have the same 3,000 people and just have them record 10-15 seconds of video capture a day for two weeks, and then you get lots and lots of data on what they\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks.\nIt\u2019s very exciting when you can collect data like that, because now you have this huge dataset of literally thousands of very rich, very rich data points per day. Now you can really do advanced forms of data analytics that allow you to get very accurate information about what is interesting to an audience and what is not interesting to a particular audience.\nWith that said, the traditional research techniques that we learned, like focus groups, and surveys like the one-and-a-third minute survey, these still work because they provide researchers with a snapshot of how the world is perceived, how people would act, etc.\nAnd I say that because there are some assumptions about how people perceive things and about how they think about things and about attitudes and all of the other types of qualitative and quantitative research questions that researchers typically ask people.\nThere are a whole bunch of very interesting studies and interesting results that we get out of those types of survey tools, and those will not disappear just because there is an 180-degree camera that can capture hundreds of hours of video footage from a survey subject.\nIt will still be important do those types of qualitative and quantitative techniques. That can give us great insights into how people are thinking and feeling and about what their attitudes are. It is very important to have that rich dataset that\u2019s generated by the research process.\nQ. From your experience as a content developer, what are the challenges facing marketers and producers trying to utilize \u201ctraditional\u201d methods of video capture for market research purposes, specifically video incentives?\nMarketers will ask video testers questions like \u201cdo you prefer to eat it with French style bread or Italian style?\u201d or \u201cWhy would you rather buy a Samsung versus a Sony?\u201d\nWhat will happen with 360 cameras is that we will be able to take a much longer time looking at what people prefer to do with their time. That\u2019s not just what they prefer to do with their time from 9 to 5 on weekdays, but whether they prefer 3D movies, or big screen movies, or matinee movies, etc.", "This hearing will consider the review and\nmodification of the rules for the 1995-1996 school year and\nwill present testimony and evidence in the matters raised\nbelow.

I don't. I think we're more likely to witness a \"doomsday\" date in November, when the Mayan Calendar predicts that the world will end... or when we have another election in the United States. Which one of these dates will make us implode, or explode, depends on who you talk to. Of course, the Mayan Long Count Calendar, which spans the years from about 4000 B.C. to A.D. 6522, has not come to a precise end. But when it does end sometime in 2012, most of the dates leading up to December 2 of that year show the world or the universe coming to an end. A 2009 National Geographic special on the subject called it \"the last great prophecy.\"\nMany Mayanists have said that the \"end of the calendar\" doesn't predict an end of the world; the calendars simply reset themselves to start over. Other Mayanists have said that it's possible that mankind may have misinterpreted the ending of that calendar; perhaps there won't be an end. What is clear is that the Mayan Calendar ends in a rather obscure year with a long count. A new epoch would start; perhaps it's time to change.\nIn any event, it's probably a good idea to expect the unexpected... and to be prepared for the best or the worst. Either way we're going to be affected by what's going on around the world. Since a year has only a certain number of days, it's impossible to predict specific events. But with a certain amount of cogitation and imagination it's possible to predict trends of upcoming events and changes which are more likely to occur than others.\nHere are some trends that are likely to happen in 2010.

The\nsurvey, conducted by Price-WaterhouseCoopers, is\ndesigned to assess compliance practices by globally\nactive companies.\nBribery and other ethics issues have been the subject of much discussion and debate in recent months, and\ncontinue to draw the interest of both governments and\ncorporate citizens across the world. The results of the\nrecent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) are a\nsobering reminder of the risks involved in any activities\nwhich can be described as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinfluence peddling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\nThe survey found that almost three out of four\nexecutives responding claim to have some knowledge\nof the anti-corruption laws and policies for their own\ncountry or for a country to which their company is\nactively doing business. However, the results reveal\nmore bad news if the intentions of the company itself are examined.  For example, at a company level,\n77% of the managers questioned claim to be aware of\nrules prohibiting bribery; of these, less than 60% felt\nthat their company had taken the appropriate steps to\navoid illegal and unethical practices.  This is a worrying indicator of a degree of knowledge existing,\nbut one which is not reflected in practice.\nFaced with this difficult situation, managers are\ntrying to maintain a cautious approach, avoiding\nbecoming entangled in corrupt practices, while also\nrealising that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinning some business by hook or by\ncrook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 might be a reality.  On the other hand, if\nbusinesses are not allowed to compete, the result\nmay be increased prices resulting from an uncompetitive market place and a reduction in the choice\nof goods and consumer benefits which are available.\nThere is little doubt that bribery and corruption\nposes a significant threat to business at all levels.\nNot only are bribes a waste of valuable financial\nresources, they are also a poor advertisement for a\ncompany which is attempting to develop ethically\nresponsible business practices. The results of the recent PWC survey reinforce this conclusion, and\nsuggest that companies should work harder to enforce\nacceptable standards of behaviour in every country\nwhere they do business.\nWhat should be done? As a start, companies\ncan undertake the following:\n1. Ensure that all their business partners,\nsuppliers and agents are fully aware of the\ncompany's own anti-bribery policies. These\npolicies should be clear and precise, should\nbe openly communicated to all employees and\nmanagers, and should reflect the company's\nview that those who seek bribes, offer\nbribes or pay bribes (or are perceived to do\nso) should be fired immediately.\n2. Ensure that full training on bribery is available to those undertaking the day-to-day business\nof the company. This should be reinforced\nregularly, and an ethics hot-line, with guidance\nfor employees as to what they can and cannot\ndo in certain jurisdictions, should be established.\n3. Carry out a clear review of how bribery and\ncorruption can get in to the company, e.g. in\npurchasing and sales activities, and take\npreventive action.\n4. Consider setting up a central register of all\ncompany staff, agents and any business partners undertaking the company's activities.\n5. Implement the guidelines recommended\nabove within the organisation and also ensure\nclear communication of the company's culture\nin terms of standards and ethics which it\nexpects from employees.\n6. Take full responsibility for corrupt activities\nwhich might take place because of a company's\nagents or representatives acting without clear\nguidance or knowledge of the business. This will\nimprove confidence to both customers and\n7. Ensure that employees undertaking the company's activities can be held personally responsible for corrupt practices in the company's name, since this will\nsignificantly improve the company's ethical\nstandards and help it to develop trust and credibility.\nAbove all, a corporate culture which expects employees to do the right thing and which actively\nencourages trust, credibility and transparency with\ncustomers and suppliers, will serve to reduce\nopportunities for bribery to happen in the first", "In this case, the U.S. Navy requests for a determination that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the human environment by proposing to expand Sector Puget Sound's Geographic Area of Responsibility (GAR) to encompass over one million square miles of Western Washington State and Northern California waters.

It briefly describes the work that was carried out to develop the Strategy, some of the key recommendations contained within the Strategy, and its key objectives.\nIt also gives a summary of the progress that has been made to date by the Federal and States and Territories governments in responding to the eight \u2018National Clinical Priorities\u2019 contained within the Strategy. The Strategy describes these priorities within each clinical discipline as key areas for the development of digital health tools and systems to improve patient care, clinical outcomes and healthcare efficiency. Examples of specific activities being undertaken by the National e-Health Transition Authority include: the establishment of Australia\u2013wide networks and systems, and development of e-Health standards; e-Health records implementation support; and evaluation of e-Health tools and services.\nIn 2014 Australia\u2019s eHealth Ministers released a new National Digital Health\nStrategy. The Strategy was developed over a four year period and\nreplaces the 2012 E-Health Standards and Safety Health Standard. The\n2010 eHealth Council of Australia report to the Health Workforce\nStatement, \u2018Navigating Change\u2019, identified the development of a\nStrategic Approach to eHealth was the next priority identified for eHealth\nMinisters. Developing the Strategy involved the creation of national\nclinical priorities that are the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 of the overall Strategy. It sets\nout the actions that will be taken and how these actions will be\nprogressed. The Strategy contains 10 National Clinical\nPriorities \u2013 eight have clear national reach and the remaining two\nprovide a means to support the specific needs of the mental health\nsector. A summary of the eight priorities is in Table 1 below.\nThe Strategy also sets out the goals for the development of eHealth in\nAustralia:\nn 1. The uptake, meaningful use and return on investment for safe and\neffective eHealth solutions that provide clinical\nopportunities for patients and clinicians, and\nenable the efficient operation of the health system.\nn 2. An eHealth system of the future capable of supporting national\ngoals for quality and efficiency within the system.\nn 3. A health system that is flexible and adaptable to technological\nchange and the need for innovation, and that can continue\nto deliver world-class clinical outcomes.\nThere are seven national principles that underpin the Strategy and these\nare shown in Table 2 below.\nImplementing the strategy will take time \u2013 there is already significant\ncapacity to undertake work on eHealth. Over the next few years the\nnational priority activities will grow with new investments and\nactivities. Over the longer-term, Australia\u2019s implementation of the\nStrategy should result in significant improvements in the way clinical\ninformation is used while reducing wasted effort and duplication. This\nwill enable improved health and care outcomes through more tailored\ncare and lower clinical risks \u2013 and will also lead to cost avoidance\nand efficiency gains.\nTable 1 \u2013 Australian National Digital Health Strategy Priorities\nn  n  n  n  n  n  n  n  n\nPriority Description\nSafe Use of Health and Care Information\nopportunities for clinicians and patients to make informed\nknowledge of, and trust in, shared health information and\ntheir own health information.

The CFS has had a complex history as it has grown from a working group into a programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). However, its recent growth has been hampered by lacklustre implementation, limited cooperation with other relevant multilateral organisations, and by a lack of financial resources. The CFS has a number of advantages over other multilateral organisations in the area of food security and could make a valuable contribution to food security. In recognition, in 2007, the UN High-level Committee on Programmes called for the increased participation of the CFS in the preparation and follow up of the Millennium Development Goals and the MDGs review. This briefing paper outlines the achievements of the CFS during its first two decades and focuses on its role in the recent food price shocks. It concludes with a suggested way forward. The key proposals in this paper are: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The CFS should be given leadership of the multilateral response to the crisis of the past year that has shown the relevance of CFS' focus on addressing vulnerability and ensuring sustainable food production. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The CFS Secretariat should increase resources and capacity to facilitate and monitor the decisions of the CFS and to enhance partnerships and cooperation between the different levels of governance (local, national, regional, sub-regional, and global). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The CFS should increase coordination and cooperation with international financial institutions, UN specialised agencies, other UN entities, and other relevant multilateral organisations. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The CFS should engage as a principle partner, alongside states, other actors of civil society, including farmers organizations, private sector, and other sectors.

To provide more transparency and information on the performance of individual providers so that consumers have meaningful information when selecting a health care provider. To eliminate barriers to coverage for individuals who are incarcerated, or released from incarceration or institutionalization and to eliminate barriers to enrollment under existing eligibility criteria. To eliminate barriers impeding the ability of Medicaid and CHIP programs to use all available funding at the state and federal level to purchase community-based waiver services, in particular home and community-based services by increasing states\u2019 administrative flexibility. To reduce unnecessary barriers and costs in the current Medicaid eligibility determination process for working-aged, low-income individuals by adopting a streamlined, simplified process that is based on simple consistent criteria, for Medicaid and CHIP applicants that allows for full Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determination. To streamline the Medicaid managed care program to reduce burdensome requirements that hinder states\u2019 ability to enter into value-based contracts with Medicaid managed care programs. To improve the program by adding a new and optional State Innovation Option (SIO) that will provide enhanced flexibility for states to test value-based payment and care delivery models that provide state flexibility in meeting program requirements while reducing mandatory and condition of payment requirements. To improve the administration of the disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) payment to eliminate inappropriate hospital specific DSH adjustments, increase hospital efficiency in the utilization of DSH funds, eliminate a requirement that has limited Medicaid DSH payments to certain inpatient services, and increase transparency on the distribution and utilization of DSH payments.\nThe Medicaid program provides insurance for low-income persons who cannot afford it and allows hospitals and health care providers to serve individuals without fear of losing reimbursement. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid is \u201cthe nation\u2019s primary source of coverage in health care for adults and children\u201d (http://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data-and-statistics/ fact-sheets/index.html). The program receives funds through the federal government, and by the states in amounts not exceeding a federally set cap on states\u2019 Medicaid spending. The government\u2019s spending for Medicaid and CHIP services is expected to have increased by 9.1 percent to $573 billion in 2015 (https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/677341.pdf).\nThe enrollment of low-income citizens through Medicaid and CHIP has increased in recent years. The program\u2019s enrollment in 2014 is estimated to have reached 62.6 million, an 8 million or 14 percent increase since 2000 (http://www.aarp.org/issues/health/info-2008/2014-health-care-enrollment-charts.html). In FY 2006 the federal government contributed nearly $350 billion to the Medicaid program (https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-770SP). By FY 2010 that number rose to nearly $370 billion. The increase in federal funding is due primarily to the economic turmoil of the Great Recession that resulted in the loss of private sector jobs, declining wages, and the expansion of the Medicaid program as a result of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 (ACA; P.L. 101-144). In 2010 there were 400,000 new Medicaid enrollees each month. Medicaid now accounts for 17 percent of all health care spending (https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2015/07/16/118061/how-states-are-adjusting-medicaid-expansion) . As the enrollment in the program has increased, so too have costs.\nA 2009 GAO report found that Medicaid pays an estimated 28 percent of physician services while private insurance covers less than 19 percent of services for those", "Nortel Networks Corporation (\"NNC\", or \"the Company\")\nNNC was founded by the acquisition in 1998 of Northern Telecom Limited\nby Avaya Inc.(\"Avaya\") formerly known as Lucent Technologies.

(\"AII\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nAvaya Inc.\nIn 2001, Nortel Networks Limited, the operating company of NNC,\nacquired substantially all of the assets of Novell Canada Inc. (\"Novell\")\nand certain employees. Nortel Networks Limited later rebranded this acquisition\nas \"Solutions\", and eventually restructured the business into the Software\nSolutions Business Unit (\"SSBU\"), then later renamed as the Enterprise\nBusiness Unit (\"EBU\").\nUnder the agreement, Nortel Networks Limited acquired the tangible\nassets of Novell, including its customer contracts and customer relationships\nand its tangible technology assets, specifically:\n*  *  *\nNovell's intellectual property portfolio.\nThis Intellectual Property portfolio included Novell's source\ncode license of the \"Vue\" Product Suite and the underlying license agreements\nfor these patents.\nBetween 1999 and 2002, Novell sold its \"Vue\" Product Suite to more\nthan 5,000 customers worldwide. There have been a significant number of\ncustomers that have installed a Novell \"Vue\" Product Suite on more than\ntwo hundred and fifty (250) installations throughout the world.\nThe \"Vue\" Product Suite also includes a customer management\nsolution, customer relationship management (\"CRM\"), and sales force\nautomation solutions, collectively referred to as \"Vue\".\nNovell's \"Vue\" Product Suite included in its bundle \"Vue\nInteraction\", \"Vue Conferencing\", \"Vue E-Business\", and other related\nNovell's \"Vue\" Product Suite was a comprehensive suite of\nintegrated software that provides a single and integrated solution to\nall customer interaction and relationship activities.\nThis suite consists of:\n*   Novell \"Vue\" Web Client\n*   Novell \"Vue\" Interaction Center\n*   Novell \"Vue\" Conferencing\n*   Novell \"Vue\" Marketing Center\nThis Intellectual Property portfolio also included a large\narray of patents, applications, and trademarks.\nNovell's ownership rights are as set forth in:\n*   Novell Patent Assignment Contract\n*   Oracle Patent Assignment Contract\n*   Oracle Technology License Agreements\n*   EMC Patent Assignment Contract\n*   Novell and Oracle Technical Support Agreements\n*   Novell and EMC Technical Support Agreements\nThroughout Nortel Networks Ltd.'s acquisition of Novell's\nbusiness, it maintained the relationship with EMC Corporation. The\nrelationship between Nortel and EMC Corporation was formalized by a series\nof Patent and Technology Support Agreements (See Appendix \"A.\") As Nortel\npurchased additional intellectual property from EMC Corporation, it\nincreased its obligations to EMC Corporation. In 2002, Nortel purchased its\nentire customer relationship management business from EMC, including EMC's\nNovell \"Vue\" Software suite and its intellectual property related thereto\nand its obligations to Novell as a result of the Patent and Technology\nSupport agreements. By the terms of the 1999 agreements, Novell\nreserved for itself certain licensing rights, which included the right of\nNovell to enforce its patents in competition with EMC in some cases. After\npurchasing EMC's Novell \"Vue\" intellectual property, that obligation\nresided with and became the responsibility of Nortel.\nOn November 6, 2002, pursuant to a Merger Agreement dated\nNovember 4, the business of Lucent Technology Inc.

And it is a top source for the mobile audience.\nWhen it comes to news consumption, people tend to prefer the familiar.\nNewspapers have a big advantage when it comes to providing this personalization because more than 70 percent of adults read their home edition daily. And that rate hovers around 71 percent for the 55-to-64-years-old and the 65-years-and-older audiences.\nHowever, the story for the other age groups is different. For those readers who are 18-34 years old, only 54 percent read the home edition. In contrast, those of us that are over the age of 35 (which encompasses more than 70 percent of the U.S. adult population) comprise the largest portion of readers who check at least one additional news brand a day, according to Pew Research Center.\nTo dig deeper, we look at the percentage of audiences that are consuming the news on each of their mobile devices every day, excluding the home edition of the newspaper.\nThis data shows that the over 55 population constitutes the largest portion of daily local mobile audiences. In fact, the home edition of a newspaper is the No. 1 news app used.\nHowever, for our daily national news consumption, it\u2019s the local newspaper\u2019s app that tops the list, and a distant second is the mobile website. In today\u2019s world of mobile engagement, this shows publishers are tapping into mobile readers on a local level. But when it comes to mobile websites, readers want everything at their fingertips.\nThus, it is clear we want to deliver hyper-local content wherever and whenever it makes the most sense, and for most media companies today that means delivering content across all devices. And this is not just true of news organisations; advertisers need to be where their customers are.\nThe fact that we don\u2019t just want to consume the same news every day, but want to consume news specific to our city, gives us, as newspaper people, the opportunity to create more personalised experiences with our readers.\nSo, how do you do this? Well, we at News Corp Australia have developed a new technology called \u201cSmart Edition,\u201d and we have already deployed this for six of our News Corp mastheads (daily newspapers), including The West Australian, The Adelaide Advertiser, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Brisbane Times, The Newcastle Herald and The Canberra Times.\nThis technology is a first-of-its-kind offering in Australia/New Zealand and utilises artificial intelligence to \u201cknow\u201d the individual preferences of each advertising client, and then delivers a personalised edition to their audience that contains advertising to suit that client. In effect, personalised editions are dynamically built from local, national, and regional news sources so their audience only sees news and advertising that are relevant to them.\nFor example, in Tasmania, The Examiner publishes a digital edition built with a content feed from The Sydney Morning Herald. Through the use of \u201cSmart Edition,\u201d The Examiner\u2019s mobile audience is delivered relevant content and advertising based on the interests, behaviours, and activities of its subscribers, making it feel like a personalised newspaper.\nIn Western Australia, The West Australian publishes a second smart edition that includes national and international news. It also has advertising in it, including some personalised advertising.\nBut in the \u201cSmart Edition,\u201d a different mix of advertising appears. Why? Because the AI technology understands the interests, behaviours and activities of its subscribers. While 63 per cent of the readers of the original edition are male, 18-24 year olds and 85 per cent use a desktop/laptop. The other 37 per cent are female, 25-64 year olds, and 17 per cent are using a smartphone. The \u201cSmart Edition\u201d then serves them different advertising because it knows their individual interests, habits, and preferences.\nIt is true that The West Australian has been deploying this technology on its mobile app for nearly a year; however, it will be interesting to see the long-term effects.\nFor example, I asked why The Examiner would deploy the same technology, and the answer really demonstrated what can be achieved with the right technology.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Smart Edition will deliver \u201cpersonalised\u201d news to its audience, but a large chunk of the advertising", "Increasing the proportion on social media who read news on these platforms may be at risk, finds this report.", "Newspaper editors and publishers share their views on digital, native advertising, and paywall strategies that have worked for their papers.\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE BELGIAN HUGE MEDIA PUBLICATION\nNEWSPAPERS & NEWS ORGANISATIONS SHOULD REMAIN TRUSTWORTHY.

The assassins want her to join them and kill the other ninety-eight. Sara thinks she has no choice but to help them, even though she doesn't agree. A few days later, she's shocked when they tell her the truth. Who are the 39 and why do they kill people?\nThe next few days were a blur for Sara. When she wasn't on the job, her mind was on the case, and when she wasn't on the case, she was asleep. She'd tried to stay busy at work, but she knew that she would have to talk to her mother about the 39.\nHer mom and sister were thrilled at the news that Sara had a job and had even invited her over for dinner. Sara didn't tell them anything about what was going on. The job was important to start, but it was only a temporary solution. The biggest priority right now was to keep her mother and sister safe. If it meant leaving her job just a while, then at least they were all together.\nOn Wednesday, after spending a week trying to keep up with all the things that were being sent to her, the 39 approached her, making it obvious that she needed to talk to them. When she did, they told her that she was now working for MI-6. They put her on what was called a 'missions' file.\nSara was stunned. She had actually been working for them all this time. She was assigned a name: Shadown. She was given a code number: 667. Shadown's purpose was to work against the ninety-nine assassins working for the other side: the 'Morts' or 'Mortalmen.' (The assassins were called by many different names by Sara. To themselves they were known by names from fairytales such as The Red Riding Hood and Little Red Riding Hood.)\n'Morts', being the opposite, had tried to kill Sara several times. She was happy to get this job, even with the possibility of actually having to kill someone again. At least it would all be legal. Sara would be able to use her training in combat that she used in her private life in a more controlled fashion.\nAfter discussing things with her mother, Sara was ready to begin her mission. The 39 would have to train her. First, they brought in an old friend: Mia. She knew what it was like to want nothing but revenge, but they needed to make sure that Sara realized that she was to keep her emotions in control. She had to be able to think clearly. Sara agreed and the training began.\nThe next week, Sara and the 39 began to meet with each other, doing missions that they had planned together. Sara was slowly getting stronger in her abilities, and she was beginning to enjoy the fighting and work she was doing. She loved to figure out how to use the equipment, and she enjoyed meeting with such strange people as the 39, but it was a lot more fun when she got to know them.\nSara was also learning what it was like to have an 39. She was having to be careful to make sure she didn't get hurt in the line of duty. But it was fun to be spending so much time with someone who would get along with her and understand her. She was learning that it was possible to be in an abusive relationship and survive, if you just make sure you have someone to speak up for you.\nShe wasn't really in an abusive relationship. They weren't trying to hurt her and that was all they really needed to do to make up for what they were doing to their loved ones. She hated them for what they were doing, but she also hated that her friends and family were so alone in the world.\nThere were more important things to worry about right now, though, and one was making sure Mia didn't die. Her death by the hands of ninety-nine assassins would be easy to hide, but the assassins couldn't do it by themselves. With so many people trying to find Mia, if something happened to her, Sara was afraid the assassins would be the suspects. She didn't think they would do it, though.\nMia felt a lot like a little sister, but since Sara was nineteen and Sara was almost eight years older than Mia, it was the wrong term. Sara hoped she could never be as cruel as the assassins were or she would", "The purpose of this policy is to set out the requirements and associated responsibilities of the Otago Daily Times and its subsidiaries (\"the ODT Group\") in relation to the implementation and ongoing compliance with the Privacy Act 1993 and the Privacy (Unlawful Disclosure of Security-related Information) Act 2002 (the Acts).\n1.4 Object and Purpose of this Policy\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that the ODT Group recognises its legal obligations regarding the protection of personal information, and complies with those obligations.

These are set out in paragraph 2.3.2 below.\n2.3.2 The ODT Group receives personal information from both internal and external sources. Examples of sources of personal information collected by the ODT Group include:\n(a) in order to enable subscribers to receive free (or subsidised) content via online portals, the ODT Group collects information from external data suppliers (e.g. credit reporting companies, subscription services and online partners), such information relates to financial, demographic and contact information (e.g. credit history and account status);\n(b) direct communication with individuals, such as responding to letters that individuals write to newspapers, and collecting personal information such as that required for signing up to newsletters, subscribing to print newspapers and registering online;\n(c) internal communications and transactions between departments and/or between external contractors, and\n(d) when an individual applies for a position as an employee or contractor etc, the ODT Group may collect personal information from resumes, cover letters, CVs and online assessments etc.\nPersonal information is not collected directly from the following types of people:\n(a) individuals whose personal information is not relevant to a particular service/product or communication; and\n(b) individuals who are under 18 years of age (unless the individual has parental consent, or is 16 years of age or older).\n2.4 The General Principles of Personal Information Collection\nAs set out in the Acts - the ODT Group only holds, uses and discloses personal information for purposes for which it is collected, is related to that purpose and is reasonably expected by the individual. An example would be to process an individual's request for a specific service (i.e. newspaper subscription, online services, recruitment etc). The Acts also prohibit the use of personal information for any other purpose unless it is either in the individual's interests or with the individual's consent. The ODT Group is not obliged to provide a reason for processing personal information, but must provide an explanation if", "\"The most significant aspect of the Internet is that it is a disseminator of news. I think it's going to have an enormous impact in the next decade; probably in 10 years' time, it will become a major medium of news.\"\nSo said AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons at the opening night of INMA's World Congress, where Parsons was the featured keynote speaker.\nParsons continued: \"It's interesting how people go about doing it, it's not how you traditionally would do it in print, which is to gather all of your sources, and then you write your story, and then you decide whose side of the line you're on.\"\nHe called it \"a little like democracy -- the idea of having many different points of view.\"\nParsons said that there is more room for new media to have an impact on journalism, since many of the structures that have been created are no longer appropriate for the new age of communications.\nThe CEO said: \"In a traditional world, when you're creating new sources of revenue, you begin with print, and then later you create an online presence. The other way around, which I think is more natural, is starting online, creating a product online, and then determining whether you'll have a print product or not.\"\nParsons said that new media and the old-media world \"can't have a symbiotic relationship, or we will die as a result. We need to interject this notion of new media into the way we begin our stories.\"\nAnd, he noted: \"One of the greatest challenges that faces us as a new organization is to understand what we stand for and what we want to become.\n\"For us in traditional media, it's very easy. It's to serve.\n\"It's to say: 'Is it right? Is it needed? Is it true? Is it important?'\n\"We need to make sure that there is some value placed on all of this and that we do our best to deliver, and be accountable for our actions. That's how businesses have been operating for many years, in a variety of different spheres.\"\nHe said that the best way for AOL-TW to get people's attention is \"to deliver on the promise that whatever we do is accurate, in accord with the facts. If you don't do that and you make some mistake, it's not that important to have one mistake.\n\"As a business person, I'll take 1,000 people coming in on the Internet, and making one mistake and not going back, versus making two or three mistakes and the other 998 people coming back.\"\nParsons admitted there are a lot of mistakes being made in the industry, \"which is why we have to learn from each other -- and that's what this conference is all about.\n\"We are an industry that's in the process of reinventing itself. The biggest challenge any individual, or any company, could possibly face is reinvention. We need to reinvent ourselves.\n\"There's a common thread throughout this: That there will always be people wanting to get information for the next story or the next article that they're writing.\"\nHe told World Congress attendees: \"It is our job to get the message out.\n\"It is our industry's job to inform. As an industry, it is our job to be accurate. And we have to work together to do that. There is plenty of work to be done.\"\nCONFERENCE NOTES:\n\u2022 AOL-TW, with more than 100 U.S. daily newspapers and 78.3 cable channels combined, is the world's largest newspaper company with more than 1,600 U.S. metropolitan daily print and online products.\n\u2022 Parsons said, in Europe, the traditional newspaper business model is going to be \"a real challenge.\"\nIn the U.S., he said: \"We feel extremely confident about our position and our standing. Certainly, there isn't a day that goes by where advertisers aren't calling and looking for access to local markets or trying to figure out ways to cut through clutter and to look for opportunities for synergies within the media plan.\n\"That's a very different environment than that we find the rest of the world. And we would be foolish, to assume that we could just take that in the United States and translate that in a meaningful way through Europe.\n\"The digital environment creates great opportunities for access to markets, but it also creates challenges, because it is a direct relationship between advertiser and consumer.\n\"", "The following is an adaptation of Caryn Mandel's work \"Anxiety, Depression, and the Risk-Avoiding Brain: The Neuroscience of Fear.\" Her original work is published in Nautilus's April 2015 issue, which is available online at http://www.nautil.us/.\nIn her book \"A Short Guide to a Happy Life,\" Anna Fels, MD, makes the case for a scientifically proven connection between anxiety and depression: \"We should know why many of us\u2014women and men\u2014are at risk for anxiety disorders. We should know how to prevent these problems and how to treat them when we do get them. Fortunately, we have a lot of helpful information and more may soon be on the way. If you are interested in this work or in your own health, you can easily access some of it, and much more, just by going online.\"\nAnxiety and depression are related but not the same. Depressive disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia) involve more than the occasional dip in mood, lack of energy, loss of interest in daily activities, and occasional bouts of anxiety; rather, they are characterized by a feeling of hopelessness, loss of motivation, and lethargy that lasts for lengthy periods of time (at least 2 weeks that lift only briefly), along with a variety of other physical and emotional symptoms (weight changes, fatigue, insomnia, appetite changes, feelings of loneliness, isolation, and low self-worth) that are not easily remedied.\nAnxiety disorders are characterized not by a persistent low mood but by constant worry or concern\u2014either about specific personal issues or in a general existential sense. They involve more than the occasional bout of anxiety. In fact, anxiety is typically the central feature of anxiety disorders, with fear being an underlying factor in the majority of forms.\nA good analogy for anxiety versus depression is the fear of flying versus fear of heights. When flying, it is quite understandable to experience a sense of apprehension or unease. In fact, it is not uncommon to receive preflight instructions from the captain to brace for the turbulence that might happen en route to your destination. Most fliers will report feeling a bit nervous in this situation.\nHowever, it's quite another thing if you are a fearful flyer who has been trapped on a flight for six hours with six unruly children kicking the seat in front of you, a crying baby that will not settle, and a flight crew that refuses to speak to you. Many of us have experienced the latter situation.\nSimilarly, some people suffer from height anxiety. For instance, a fear of heights might manifest in the inability to enjoy rock climbing, skiing, or other activities that involve substantial heights or drops. You might enjoy walking through the local sculpture garden, but if the sculptures are on top of tall pylons, this might be the extent of your physical exertion. Similarly, some people enjoy walking the narrow, high trails of the Santa Monica mountains, but perhaps only in the company of other walkers.\nThere are many people, though, who suffer not from a sense of anxiety or worry, but from a more pervasive concern that permeates their lives: a persistent dread of something bad happening, and the concomitant paralyzing fear that it just might. This sort of fear can be a crippling and constant companion, keeping us from even the simplest of daily activities and functions without the constant fear of catastrophe.\nThe feeling of dread can be triggered by a specific thing, situation, or person (the fear of flying might be avoided by sitting out the next trip) or by a more general and vague feeling of foreboding that can be triggered at any time. Some people experience this as a persistent sensation or a vague, nagging feeling of dread that is felt day and night. When the sense of dread subsides momentarily, many of us experience a sense of relief that we can get through the moment and then try to get rid of the anxiety by \"forgetting\" about it. The unfortunate result of this cycle is that the sense of dread lingers into the next day, week, month, or any other period.\nIn this article, we'll explore anxiety and depression in the context of the science on their biology, prevalence, clinical presentation, and treatment. In so doing, we'll identify some of the common underlying mechanisms of psychological distress and disorder.", "If you are the sole shareholder in your family business,\nyou want certainty that your children are going to get paid when they\nparticipate in running the business; you want certainty that you will\nhave help maintaining control over the future of your business;\nand you want certainty that the people and organizations that make up\nyour enterprise will continue to do so post-death or disability.  I\nwill talk about these issues in this article as they relate to\nbusiness insurance.\nWhat is key employee life insurance?\nKey Employee Life Insurance (KELI) has become a very popular way\nto retain key members of the staff and it's the product you've\nbeen hearing about on television, radio, and in the newspapers.\nKELI is a life insurance policy that is designed to pay an employer\na benefit payable when an employee dies within a specific number\nof years after date of coverage.  This benefit is designed to ease\nthe financial burden on both the business and the family.  The\nemployer typically pays all the premiums for KELI on behalf of\nemployees and KELI is designed to compensate the business by\nproviding capital to purchase the life insurance on the employee.\nThe life insurance company will typically allow the employer to\nname the employee as the beneficiary.  The benefit for the employer\nis based on two criteria.  The length of employment and the life\nexpectancy of the employee.   In other words, if employees stay\nwith the same employer over the years of policy, and that\nemployer-employee relationship typically lasts at least 2 to 5\nyears, then the KELI benefits grow.  For example, if an employee\nworks for an employer for three years, the employer will obtain 3\nyears of coverage under the policy.  This first year's premium will\nbe based on the life of the 30 year old female underwriter.  For\nexample, assuming the rate is $2.87 at age 30 the first year's\npremium will be about $7.54.  But for the second and third year the\npremium remains $2.87 but the policy rate increases, assuming the\nunderwriter is 35 years old, to $3.98.  For example, for a second\nyear of coverage at age 35, the premium will be $4.82 and a third\nyear of coverage at age 38 will be $9. 06.  Therefore, the second\nyear's premium will be $2.84 higher than the first year's\nFor older people, the policy rates might be higher but they offer\nvery reasonable rates for people between about age 40 and 54 -\nthe typical age of the manager or key employee.\nThe other criteria is the life expectation of the employee - the\nlonger the duration of the policy, the more the employer saves.\nKELI was created to help keep key employees in their position with\nthe company.  For that reason, the maximum length of coverage under\nthis type of key employee insurance is 15 years. KELI has been\ndesigned to provide insurance to high-producing employees.  Some\ninsurance companies allow the employer to \"pick and choose\" some\nemployees.  This is the preferred type where the employer can buy a\nspecific number of years, e.g. \"2 years & 5 years.\" Others give you\na \"block\" buy - e.g. 5, 7.5, 10 years.  Still others require\nemployees to purchase the KELI policy.  Each company has its own\nThe biggest advantage to KELI is that the employer saves premiums\non the insurance. The employee also has the benefit of knowing that\nthe business can't fire them just because they've earned a large\nbonus or if the business needs to cut costs.  There is also added\nsecurity in having a safety net should a critical employee die.\nEmployees can get group life insurance and a lot less expensive than\nindividual life insurance. If the employee already has individual\nlife insurance, we can convert this policy to a group policy. The\ngroup policy has a lot better features than an individual policy\ndoes. Employees can obtain up to $100,000 in life insurance at\nreasonably affordable prices.\nBusiness Insurance has been around as long as business has\nexisted. It has always been needed.

His hair was bright orange, as if he sat beneath a light bulb, but his complexion was dark and even. His little legs were covered up to his knees in a knitted pinafore and over this he wore his dappled grey cloak. He stopped, tilted his head quizzically and listened hard.\n'Are you sure about this?' he said, looking up at his father, who wore a dark grey cloak over a cream tunic with green and red stripes that ended at his calves. His dark hair was cut short on the sides and longer on top, where it stuck up in tufts. He looked like a gnome. He gave his son a hard stare and raised his eyebrows.\n'Just follow me,' he said gruffly. 'Watch what you're doing. My brother was killed by a boiling-hot pee.'\n'What a horrible \u2013'\n'Aye.'\nA thin stream of frothy fluid washed from the boy's nose and trickled down his chin and into the neck of his cloak. He wiped it away with the back of his hand.\n'Can I do this? Can I kill someone without their knowing it?'\n'You're a warrior now, son,' said the man. 'And you must learn to fight.'\nThe boy nodded and wiped away some more pee. An inky smell came from the forest.\n'I like killing people as it makes me feel tough and taller,' he said. 'I want to feel tall and tough. It will be good. Can I kill people right away?'\n'You haven't practised enough yet. Not really.' The man took his son's hand and strode off into the forest.\nThe boy stumbled along behind him.\nThey emerged into a glade, and there stood an enormous stag.\nTwo other stags stood alongside it. The man raised his bow and arrow, and the boy raised his sword, wiping the sweat and grim from his palms and fingers.\n'I shall fire over the stag's head and then run and cut the other one straight away,' said the man. 'Try to cut the one I've missed.'\nThey took their stance, and the man aimed. He was sure to aim over the stag's head. He fired his arrow, but it missed. The deer twisted its head, looking at the arrow in his heart.\n'Aim it away from the target,' screamed the man. 'I missed.'\n'I... I...' The boy had forgotten. 'I forgot all about this,' he whispered.\nThe man pointed at the other two stags. 'Run after that one. The first thing you must learn is agility, son,' he said. 'Try, you fool. You've got to learn to run quickly.'\nThe man's father had told him exactly the same thing.\nThe boy tried to run, but his boots stuck in the moss, and he slithered across the ground like a mudslide. His father laughed, and the other deer fled through the forest. The boy limped off after them. He was too nervous to even look like he was running.\nThe boy stopped limping and tried to get off the ground. He felt an ache.\n'What is it, son? Can you run?'\nThe boy was breathless, but he managed to reply, 'Yes,' between big gulps of air. His father took his bow and arrows from him and gave him his knife and sword in their sheaths. He pulled the young boy into his arms and wrapped them tightly around him.\n'Run and kill both stags. Go quickly,' he said.\nThe small boy waddled after the fleeting stag, his boots clunking, his knees stinging with a stabbing pain. He came to a large clearing in the woods and stopped behind an oak tree. He took a deep, heavy breath. He began to stalk the stag with big, clumsy steps, breathing raggedly.\nThe stag looked around and saw the boy coming toward it.\n'Stay alert and don't rush.'\nThe stag turned and, with a sudden leap, bounded into the clearing and ran, its hooves thudding into the pebbles.

The Empire had just taken over, and Vader\u2019s mission was the \u201celimination\u201d of all those who stood in its way. But at the same time, there were two major things in Vader\u2019s way: the rebellion and his own son. We now know from the latest films the dark side is a terrible thing, and there was a high price that had to be paid in an effort to join it.\nWhat I would like to do in this article is to talk about the relationship between Vader and his son, Luke, a relationship that started out as one that was full of animosity, but ultimately developed into great father-son type relationships by the end of The Empire Strikes Back. And if possible, I would also like to look at the relationship itself in some different way, and maybe even give one of my own opinions based on what I have seen over the years in the Star Wars series.\nBefore going on, I would like to give a brief summary of what we see in the films and books of Star Wars, and then I will go on.\nAs the story goes, Darth Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, who was trained on Tattooine to become a Jedi knight. He was a powerful Jedi, and was a close friend to fellow Padawan learner Obi Wan Kenobi, who also knew Luke\u2019s mother Shmi. Anakin\u2019s master Yoda trained him to take out the \u201cBalance in The Force\u201d that existed. He was ultimately trained and turned into Darth Vader by the Emperor, who sought to do the same, and become the first \u201cDark Jedi.\u201d\nIn Episode IV, it is shown Anakin had a wife named \u201cShmi\u201d, who died at some point in Anakin\u2019s life, not long after he became Darth Vader. When we hear \u201cDarth Vader\u201d in any form, he is associated with the Dark Side of the Force. Anakin had a son whom he was not aware of, but the son, we know later, was called Luke Skywalker.\nLuke was introduced in Episode IV as a young boy, who grew up on Yavin, which was \u201cThe Base\u201d in IV, and we eventually learn he was the last remaining \u201cJedi\u201d, and was the one who destroyed the second death star, which was being built by the Empire.\nLuke was training with his father in Episode V, who eventually gets killed by the Emperor and Darth Vader, when he had a change of heart and tried to save his son. But what we find out later in the story, is that Darth Vader took his son in Episode V to the Cloud City of Lando Calrissian, whom he knew and used as a tool to get to his son, in order to find out who the other was a Jedi and take him down.\nDarth Vader was very angry with Luke for trying to find a way to rescue his own wife, who was taken by Imperial Forces, and had eventually been killed, as we find out in Episode VI. Luke, at some point, tried to find out where his aunt and uncle lived, who also lived on the planet below Yavin, and ended up meeting up with Leia (Solo), who was being used by Darth Vader. But when Luke confronted his father, his own temper and anger led Darth Vader to almost break down and show him mercy. Vader himself stated he almost destroyed his own son and the new hope they had.\nBut this ultimately did not happen in the end, as we know that at the end of VI, Luke Skywalker was on his way to the Cloud City to meet up with Darth Vader, and his son, to face him in a duel. But when he got there, what he found is that his father had killed every clone, and the people in the Cloud City, and they found Luke\u2019s own wife, who, in the end, turned to the Dark Side. Later, when faced by his own son, Darth Vader told him he only tried to turn back because the Emperor had told him to turn Luke over, and eventually when he could not do it, and Luke fired on him twice, killed him.\nWe then find out what we know from The Empire Strikes Back, that Luke wanted to go out and look for his father, who seemed to be dying, and find out how it was possible to turn to the dark side, and in turn, he could destroy him and bring him back to the light. Darth Vader could not do it, but what occurred was that his father sacrificed himself in order to kill Vader.

A statement of the", "Increasing and improving crossmedia promotion campaigns are important factors in reader loyalty. It might not matter all that much where a reader finds content, but it does matter that a reader finds content within the newspaper organisation or, in a more general sense, within the brand. Promoting brands as content and content as brands.\nMedia content now lives in many different places, especially online. It can appear in multiple formats, on different platforms, and with different business models. So does the promotion of media content still matter all that much?\nEight years ago, I attended a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, about the crossmedia promotion of newspapers. I was still in the midst of developing my book CrossMedia Promotion as part of the CrossMedia Marketing (X2O) project for the Helsingin Sanomat publishing company.\nOne of the X2O executives asked the crowd of journalists and marketing people how many had ever purchased a newspaper without seeing an advertisement in it first. Everyone in the room raised their hand. The point was valid \u2013 and not very different from what you might hear in the USA.\nCrossmedia promotion, the executive said, was a bit like getting married. He made the analogy: Invest in the beginning to have better rewards, not only in the long term but in the very short term. And so do not neglect the crossmedia promotion campaigns, he said, because it does matter. A little extra advertising can boost that first step to the altar.\nAt the time, I wrote a detailed article in the Finnish national newspaper, the Helsingin Sanoomat: The Newspaper-Reader Demand: The Role for Investing in Crossmedia Promotion.\n\u201cA large amount of the media content is no longer dependent on the old physical boundaries from newspaper to radio station to TV channel to Internet portal. The new reader or viewer of media content now finds much of its information from outside of the printed product or the television broadcast.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the most important fact in this whole scenario is that it is possible to access many different sources of media content, and that many of them appear in many different formats. Too few, but still we have many. Many people will not only read the newspaper\u2019s online edition but also use a smartphone or a tablet computer. Some will also watch the TV station\u2019s YouTube channel, listen to the radio station\u2019s podcast, and read the newpaper\u2019s blog.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What the publishing company Helsingin Sanomat has in its possession is the largest advertising platform in Finland, as well as one of the largest in Europe. The publishing company is a major media force with which many small and medium businesses must connect. To these companies this is nothing different than getting married. It may in the short term be more expensive to get into the media company\u2019s advertising platform than it would be to marry without having to go overboard.\n\u201cInvesting in crossmedia promotion is just like getting married: you have to do it from the beginning or just after marriage, and with a bit of luck, it does not matter so much where you find the media content in the first place.\u201d\nThat is exactly right. It may initially matter to the reader if they find content on the web or on television. But in the long run, the reader should be able to access content wherever they find it, as long as it is in a way that adds value.\nThe advertiser should not have to decide whether his or her content or campaign should be on one platform versus another. The decision should be made by the consumer who has the best chance of reading.\nWe will go into this topic and many others in great detail in our forthcoming book, \u201cCrossMedia Promotion.

The results were excellent, 55 per cent higher click-through rates, more leads, and the cost per lead was half the usual.\nWhanganui: Newspaper marketing campaign shows how social commerce works for both marketing and sales\nDATELINE: Whanganui, New Zealand\nAUTHOR: Rod Christensen\nIn our marketing department, I am responsible for new projects that test new technology and new uses for it. One of those involved social commerce, or selling through social media. Our local daily newspaper was a good test bed because it relies on both traditional and new media, and is very keen to expand its digital business.\nThe results were outstanding. The two month trial period produced a 55 per cent increase in click-through rates from the advertisements. The number of leads generated was also double the traditional lead source, and the cost-per-lead was about half a standard lead.\nThe social commerce website is owned by the national publisher of the Sunday StarTimes. To use this vehicle, the seller provides the newspaper with a listing and description, and the newspaper adds its own presentation. The newspaper also provides editorial, which is an important point for the seller because newspapers are perceived to sell for them. The seller pays to advertise in the newspaper, as usual, while the website publisher charges a small fee to be part of the marketing package.\nTo create social commerce, the newspaper needed to create a template to which a seller could add its presentation. The newspaper also had to arrange for editors to produce content about the sellers and their products to go alongside the presentation.\nThe idea behind social commerce is simple. The buyer reads a newspaper article and then makes a sale. We have a buyer. We have content from the newspaper. We have the advertisement to entice the buyer to go to the social commerce website. The seller fills in the details of the product.\nIn one experiment during the trial period, the seller promoted a high-end piece of machinery, complete with photography, videos, background text and graphics and prices. There was even advice from a technical service department about how to use the machine and how to maintain it, to add credibility to the advertisement and increase the perceived value of the machinery. In the background, a company was advertising in the traditional mode, selling the same piece of machinery at about the same prices. With two weeks to go in the trial period, the social commerce machine outsold its competitor by 37 sales.\nWe have had tremendous support from our advertising department in this new venture. They have been very quick to see the advantages of what marketing has achieved.\nThe newspaper has had some success using social commerce in Australia. One newspaper, The Advertiser in Adelaide, has published 125 local car dealer advertisements. In that one month, 95 per cent had leads, and 80 per cent of the sales were as a result of the social commerce ad. We expect the use of social commerce to get even stronger in Australia.\nWe will continue to promote social commerce in New Zealand because it works so well and is so cost-effective.", "\"Social media doesn\u2019t sell paper, but it can be a key component of other marketing strategies that do\"\nMaking Print Work For You: Social Media Is Not The Silver Bullet (Gazette Inc.)\nby John R. Heggestad\nMarketers, executives and others get so wrapped up in looking for the next big thing for their marketing strategies that they overlook the strategies that are actually effective and make the bottom line grow.\nYes, social media is great, and it can be a large component of a marketing strategy, but it is not the end all be all. It is another tool in your marketing arsenal, not a new one. It is another one that you can try, to see if it is of benefit to you, or one that you can try and then set aside. There are different reasons why one might not work right at the moment, and you can try other ones while you wait to see if the one you first picked is going to work for you.\nIt just depends upon how you are using it and what your plans are, but the one thing to keep in mind is that social media isn\u2019t the silver bullet. So while it\u2019s nice that there are all these new marketing tools that you can use, don\u2019t overlook the ones that are old but are proven to work because they do.\nIf you want to learn some more about how you can use social media to your advantage without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, I encourage you to tune in to our two-part episode of The Web Report, which was an interview with social media pioneer and visionary Michael Stelzner, the creator of Social Media Examiner Magazine, and author of the book \u201cLaunch.\u201d\nAs for me, I am going to keep using social media and the tools that I have been using for years with a few more added to the mix to get some more information, and to see what other benefits I can get out of what I do. I also encourage you to try the tools I mention to see if they work for you, while keeping the great tools you have been using for years.\nIf you found what I wrote in Part One to be worthy of your time, which was \u201cIs Social Media Worth The Effort?\u201d, then I encourage you to keep reading about how you can put social media to work for you.\nSocial Media Should Be Part of a Strong Content Plan\nOne of the biggest mistakes that marketers make these days when they start to use social media like Twitter is that they just make a hasty decision that they are going to start doing this without really planning how they are going to use it. If you do that, then you are going to fail, as most people do.\nInstead of randomly throwing out Tweets, you need to make a strong decision about what you really want to accomplish: get a ton of people to follow you, or get a ton of people who will actually buy something from you. One of them takes just luck and patience; the other takes planning and determination.\nTo learn more about how to plan, check out the two- part episode of The Web Report, where we interviewed the leading social media pundit Michael Stelzner, the author of \u201cLaunch\u201d and the host of the \u201cSocial Media Examiner Magazine.\u201d You can find these at http://www.printing-press.com/Podcasts.\nEven though you won\u2019t be able to see them here, you can listen to them in your car, as a podcast or online (or in whatever way you are able to get them).\nYou can also find them on Itunes or Stitcher; just use the search functions of those sites to look for those episodes.\nIf you want to learn more about social media specifically for printing, the articles in the Gazette e-blast, and the links within them, should give you a good foundation for learning. The article \u201cDo I Even Need To Engage in Social Media?\u201d gives a good overview of why you should, and another one called \u201cHow To Create Your Own Blog In Just 6 Hours\u201d gives a good tutorial on how to set up your own website.\nThere are a lot of great tips out there, and there are a lot of people who can teach you a lot more social media know-how than I can. But I can at least tell you that I have found that the two best places to go to learn about social media are the blogs of social media pioneers like Jay Baer, Hubspot and Michael Stelzner; the Gazette e-blast, and the Podcasts I mentioned above. One of these is where I found Michael Stelzner and it\u2019s where I started learning about it, so I\u2019ve got my own personal recommend", "In this case, the Authority finds that the General Counsel failed to carry the burden of showing that the Veterans Administration improperly dismissed an employee for his protected communications to Congress with regard to the Agency's proposed reorganization. The Authority concludes that the General Counsel's evidence did not establish that the Veterans Administration's dismissal decision was predicated on Mr. Sneva's protected communications to Congress.\nJAMES V. SNYVA,\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (the agency) removed Mr. Sneva from his position as Area Director during a reduction in force (RIF). Mr. Sneva was not included in that reduction. As part of a reorganization of the agency's regional offices, the RIF involved 22 employees who were assigned to an expanded regional office to replace regional headquarters with area office. (Footnote omitted.) In April 1995, Mr. Sneva was transferred from area office to regional headquarters, a position that involved approximately the same duties but was classified within a different supervisory level. During the time that he performed the duties of area office director, he began to participate in communications to Congress about the proposed reorganization. In July 1996, the Agency reorganized regional offices to place area offices within the Riverside regional headquarters in place of a supervisory and staff assistant manager position. After this reorganization and before he transferred to Riverside, Mr. Sneva began sending letters to Congress indicating what he characterized as the negative impacts that implementing the reorganization would have on his employees. In these letters, Mr. Sneva urged Congress to take \"corrective action\" with regard to the reorganization.\nIn June 1998, Sneva was transferred to the Riverside regional office as a Deputy Area Director to assist with the implementation of the reorganization. His duties involved some of the same duties as area office director; others were different. Prior to the reorganization, he had been a full time employee. After he was moved to Riverside, he still represented his prior Riverside area office in dealings with Congress about an insurance bill, he attended congressional hearings, and he requested that he be added to a congressional mailing list. He also participated in meetings with two Congressional staffers in which topics discussed included his communications to Congress regarding the reorganization and potential legislation related to health care. The agency sent Sneva to a special training program on the federal budget. On September 5, 1998, the Agency placed Sneva on formal notice that he was unsuited for federal service for failing to comply with the command to remove the word Riverside from his organizational chart without being granted permission to retain that title, and for failing to maintain the confidentiality required by federal law.\nOn October 15, 1998, the agency dismissed Sneva, finding that he was \"unable to successfully perform his official duties in compliance with federal law, rule, and/or regulation because of his unsuitability or inability to perform the essential elements of his job.\" The RIF that removed Sneva was directed to reduce the work force of the agency by 110 employees with no priorities. Sneva was one of the 110 employees. Two days prior to his dismissal, Sneva was notified that his annual performance rating was \"fully successful,\" consistent with his prior annual performance ratings. Shortly following his dismissal, Sneva wrote a letter to Congress criticizing the agency's reorganization without mentioning that he had been dismissed.\nIn August 1999, Mr. Sneva filed a petition for disciplinary action challenging his removal under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(5) on the basis of his protected communications to Congress regarding the reorganization. Mr. Sneva asserted that his comments about the reorganization to Congress were protected and that the agency improperly used those statements to remove him. With regard to the reorganization, he stated that he was \"not convinced that [he] was not correct\" and that he felt the agency's goals could be accomplished though less disruptive approaches. (Footnote omitted.) While he was not convinced that his actions \"would not lead to his success,\" he believed that he had fulfilled his \"duty to tell\" Congress of his opinions. He admitted in his petition that there were some statements that he made that \"could have been interpreted\" as stating \"that it was time for me to go.\"", "The FDIC is correcting references to former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Jo White as \"President.\" The press release and related materials should now read as set forth in this Federal Register filing. The FDIC regrets any inconvenience this correction may have caused the private sector and the public.\nCongratulations to the new Chair of the Commission on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Joseph A. Grundfest.\nMary Jo White has just stepped down as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and I am pleased that I have this opportunity to thank her for her outstanding service, and to welcome Joseph A. Grundfest as the new Chair of the Commission. For a quarter of a century, beginning in 1980, I was privileged to preside with Mary Jo White in a unified judicial chambers over the complex commercial cases that were brought before us from time to time.\nI know, as you do, that Mary Jo White served the nation as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the last 800 days. She helped bring us through perhaps the worst market crisis since the Great Depression. For some years prior to the events of 2008, Mary Jo White observed a number of serious lapses in supervision by the SEC of the financial industry, but until 2008 she did not see a way to deal with them. In the wake of the near-collapse of the financial system during the financial crisis, Mary Jo White and the SEC moved rapidly and effectively to close the regulatory gaps that had allowed risky investments to flow freely into the market.\nEven before the events of 2008, Mary Jo White and the SEC had been working diligently to find the best ways to ensure that the SEC could best regulate the financial industry. The SEC had been limited by a law that was passed in the 1930s and modified in the mid-1970s. Under that law for a number of years prior to the crisis, the SEC had not been mandated by Congress to consider what could be called \"market risks\" in assessing whether issuers of instruments with variable and complex features such as mortgage-backed securities were truthfully representing their features and risks to their investors and ultimately, to the investing public. The SEC, like the banking regulators, had not been able to apply broad-based, uniform standards consistently to risk analyses, and so they were blinded to potential problems.\nWhile at the SEC, Mary Jo White brought about a number of other improvements that would facilitate the detection of troubled areas in the financial system before they exploded and caused serious harm to the investing public. She was able to get these changes into law and into place so that they were available for use by the SEC prior to the crisis. Mary Jo White worked extensively at the legislative level to get these changes passed so that they too could become effective prior to a crisis.\nFor example, the SEC had been limited in its ability to supervise overseas investment advisers, the advisers who help investors decide what investments to make for the purpose of growing their wealth and building their savings. The SEC sought to make the market safer by requiring that registered broker-dealers, when they were providing investment advice abroad, register as investment advisers. The SEC, however, had been prevented by a prior law from giving advisers that were providing investment advisory services to foreign clients the same registration standard that applies to advisers who provide investment-advisory services to U.S. clients.\nMary Jo White worked tirelessly to have Congress pass a new law that would enable the SEC to give the same registration standard to foreign advisers that it gives to U.S. advisers by authorizing the SEC to include the requirements regarding the provision of investment advice to foreign clients in its rules and regulations. She was not able to get this change during the financial crisis, but she did get it passed after that crisis and is now using the new law to improve the ability of the SEC to detect and stop violations before they cause harm to the investing public.\nEven as Chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White continued her service as a professor at Columbia Law School, where she had taught antitrust law and business law. As Chair of the SEC, under Mary Jo White's leadership, the SEC has been able to make major improvements for the protection of investors, and she has been able to work with Congress to get bills passed to give the SEC additional tools to use when it has identified an instance", "The notice of proposed information collection and\nanticipated expenses for this activity have been circulated to the\nSecretary's Resource Advisory Committee (SRC) for Forestry and the\nSecretary's Science Advisory Board (SSB) for peer review as required\nby Section 304 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).\nADDRESSES:  Send email to the person listed under FOR FURTHER\nINFORMATION CONTACT, or call the number listed above.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Ms. Karly A.

That is where I was first introduced to the global newspaper association and to its World Editors Forum, which I've attended every year since. In 2009, the WEF met in Stockholm, Sweden, where I had the pleasure of meeting up with a large contingent of US and Canadian journalists and editors. Our group of 12 met for dinner every night, where we discussed our plans for covering the forthcoming congress in Paris and the 13th World Editors Forum, the global magazine association conference.\nI must admit that when I first attended the World Editors Forum in Prague in 2007, I did not fully realize the global reach of this organization. But now, as a representative of America's Midwest, I understand the critical importance of not only this association, but of journalism and news itself, not just in its global reach, but also the necessity of it to people to be able to understand and communicate their needs to the government and political leaders. In addition, the WEF offers a place where editors around the world can collaborate on important news issues. It is one of the few such venues that editors can have this type of free dialogue with their international peers.\nAs the editor-in-chief of a unique citizen journalism site for Cincinnati CityBeat, I have made it my mission to educate my staff about the value of the media and to encourage them to be active on social media, as well as to keep track of new local stories. And the WEFs have been pivotal in this regard. Every year, I've come away with ideas for better engaging our audience, as well as practical ideas such as the importance of digital storytelling, multimedia story placement, the value of citizen journalism, new technologies for both print and online, the opportunities of news apps, and more. This year, the 13th World Editors Forum focused on the growing importance of local, and its relationship to the global, both on our paper and in the industry as a whole.\nTo that end, as a city with a rich and vibrant cultural scene, citizens want to share their own stories and photos with each other, as well as with our editors. So this year, we launched a unique program that allows citizens to not only share local stories of cultural activities and events, but to also make money when their story or photo is published. Called \"I Got the Scoop,\" our model is an unusual one in which people can actually earn money based on their own stories.\nThe program has been well-received by our citizen community, as well as other newsrooms around the country, because it recognizes the value of community journalism, but also enables the citizen to \"earn a buck\" for their story. We've also found that this type of project is an excellent way to generate stories and content from the city's residents.\nIn addition, at the WEF in Stockholm, we were very fortunate to have representatives from the UN-led World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 2008 meetings in Geneva also in attendance. The WEFs are a great place to network with other news leaders from all over the world and learn their best practices. For instance, many editors had visited these meetings and had great stories about the success stories and ideas coming out of the event. One, in particular, talked about the ability of many developing nations to share ideas and access to the internet through the use of citizen journalism and local news organizations.\nCitizen journalist blog.\nThis led me to attend the WSIS 2009 in Geneva in June of this year. In addition, an additional WEF meeting was held just before the Geneva events, in London. I participated in this as a \"digital ambassador\" and attended to find the latest ways in which the newspaper could integrate the web and mobile content strategies.\nI must admit that I did feel a bit intimidated during these events", "To help journalists, publishers and bloggers report news stories in\nan ever-changing media landscape, News Corp. has unveiled a new site,\nNews Corp.

Under the N L R A, teachers, including n nurses, and other employees in covered organizations have the right to form, join, or assist labor organizations or bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which administers the N L R A, can issue appropriate bargaining orders, compel mediation, and bring unfair labor practice charges. The NLRB can also investigate and act on charges of unfair labor practices by employers and by unions (which includes professional organizations).

The rule also states that nurses are employees covered by the Act when they are considered employees of the hospital, school, or other entity or organization under the Act. Also, under the proposed rule, certain arrangements used to provide education services are not considered to be employment relationships, such as the following: a.) services provided on a professional basis, in the field of education or health care, on or near the premises of a covered entity or organization, by a contractor not under contract with or paid by the employer except for per diem fees or flat fees; b.) services provided by teachers employed in the system\u2019s school(s) or teachers in faculty positions at the college\u2019s institution of higher education; c.) services provided by professionals whose education is incidental and ancillary to providing services on a professional basis; d.) services by professionals who are providing services on a professional basis incidental and ancillary to providing professional services to one or more of the professional association\u2019s members; and e.) services by professionals who are providing services on a professional basis incidental and ancillary to providing professional services to the professional association or organization\u2019s members. The Department will consider for comment additional examples of such services. The proposed rule also states that it is the intent of the Act to provide an inclusive definition of employees covered by the Act, and that employees with duties in an area that falls within the definition of an employee under the Act are considered to be an employee.

With many industry commentators and market researchers expressing doubt about the social network's future, should the search giant be taking lessons from Facebook for marketing success?\nIan Clarke, a Google Fellow and part of the engineering team leading Google+ marketing research, recently wrote a 'fireside chat' in which he discussed the importance of Google+ members using the platform for connecting with others and the successes of the product. Clarke believes that people have been socialising for \"millions and millions of years\", and that the internet is a way to extend these existing social networks to include the wider world. He claims that \"a large part of Google+ is a big experiment. We're testing out new ways of doing things and learning what works\".\nGiven Google's recent history of social networking failures, a number of commentators have been sceptical as to Google+'s ability to gain market share and achieve mass adoption.\nThe market for social networks has been estimated by Forrester research to be worth $3.8bn in 2011 \u2014 with Google+'s overall market share being around 0.25 per cent. Nevertheless in 2011 there were 40 per cent more new members joining Google+ each day, compared with Facebook.\nGoogle+ has attracted a significant amount of attention over the last year. The reason behind Google's decision to launch a social network was the company's belief that \"new products and services should be born from user behaviour, instead of the other way around\".\nGoogle+ has evolved substantially over the past 12 months and has developed a number of highly successful features, including Hangouts and Circles. A key strength of the social network is Google's ability to cross-pollinate information from Google services such as YouTube, Gmail and News. The platform has been developed to enhance the way that information is shared among users and, as such, Google+ members regularly post images, comments, links and content related to other users' Google+ posts. The way that information can be displayed has therefore been enhanced, creating a more personalised and unique experience for each user.\nWith regards to market penetration, Facebook can be considered an established market leader in terms of social network advertising. However, Google+ members can upload more than 15 different types of video files and create their own playlists. Users also have the opportunity to make their posts public or private, making the platform suitable for businesses of all sizes.\nCircles are arguably the most popular feature of Google+ and allow users to connect with people based on what type of relationship they have. Circles ensure that Google+ members can be selective about which groups of people they follow.\nA particularly impressive feature of Google+ is the social network's recent 'Search Plus Your World' update, which allows users to search content posted by people in their networks, including Google products and other related search information displayed within the platform.\nWhat market research can Google+ and Google learn from Facebook?\nA recent survey by GlobalWebIndex found that 46 per cent of US internet users were active on Facebook in the four weeks to 16 February. In addition, the results of a recent Pew study have shown a decline of Facebook's popularity between 2011 and 2012. Whilst the social network enjoyed a peak popularity of 79 per cent among Americans aged 18 to 29 years old a year ago, between September 2011 and September 2012 it lost 8 per cent (now standing at 71 per cent). There were also slight decreases in Facebook's popularity among users aged 30 to 49 (49 per cent) and 50 to 64 (43 per cent) years, and it dropped 5 per cent among those aged 65 and older (34 per cent) in the last 12 months. The drop in popularity in the US reflects the social network's decline in popularity on a global scale. The social network experienced a 10 per cent drop in popularity in the last year in the UK, falling from 69 per cent to 59 per cent (Figure 1) between Q1 and Q2 2012.\nThe social network has also experienced declines in Facebook-friendly countries such as Brazil, India and Russia. According to a recent study by Experian Marketing Services, Brazilian Facebook users have increased the minimum number of friends in their networks from seven to 11 since the", "As of November 30, 20:00 PST, there have been 20,039 participants in this event, sending 132,846 messages.

By using the website www.dragonballcrystal.com and joining the chat room located inside of it, users made decisions that would be carried out in RP battles. In this ARG it was expected that the user playing the part of Goku is in the same chat room, with people making decisions for the events in which he takes part.\nThe first tournament started in late October when the first episodes of the series were released, with a total of twenty-one episodes released before the end of the year. In December it was decided that the next Tournament would happen at the beginning of February the following year, at a time when it could be expected that the first anime would be finished airing.\nThe decision to extend the time span of the tournament was a result of wanting to create an RP arc where the user was involved in the creation of an entire movie. Originally it was not expected the arc would be able to be finished by the time the anime finished, so the decision was made to extend this tournament and finish as soon as the anime had finished airing.\nThis extension was not a major change to the series itself, but resulted in a change to the narrative in which a new and different villain would be portrayed, with each villain taking part in the Tournament in a different way.\nA significant amount of editing effort was put into making the website so that the narrative was not disrupted and users could continue to follow the RP. Instead of starting up as a new website, Crystal.dbsite.net was used as a secondary site to bring together the old website from DB and the new one from ARG, in a way that was easy to distinguish the two. As of 13 November, 2016, CrystalDBSite.net has 2,941 unique views and 57,156 hits. DragonByte Technologies, Inc. hosts the site on a paid-for web-space plan provided by Bluehost.\nCodale had started the RP as a writer for DBSite (Codale, Fandom_Writers). They also wrote a lot of the main content for the DBSite-ARG crossover as well as helping with the overall design of the website, from its start to its final design, and also helping to design the chat-room, the ARG website, and the main site. In fact, they created the overall designs of them all and worked with Ling and Dale on the execution of the designs, as well as helping them learn how to use the new software. As well as this, they also used their knowledge to help create a system for integrating the two systems while", "News media organisations and industry players must stop asking journalists to work for free. As a journalist with close ties to many in the industry, you are often the person people go to or go to first, and asking (especially repeatedly) the same question: \"how are you making your living, and what can 'we' do to help you?\" For the most part this question is said and asked with good intentions: helping a fellow journalist. What the industry needs to realise, however, is that these sorts of questions and the sentiment behind them, does more harm than good. And why?\nNews media journalism today is under attack. There is never any doubt of that. Just one week ago, NBC\u2019s KXAS-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth sent home its entire investigative, or I-team as it is colloquially known, unit. The reasoning behind these layoffs is due to budget cuts, which are also the same sort of reason that many media organisations continue to blame for the current situation facing the industry today. For instance, the recent cuts at the Chicago Tribune is often cited as a reason why newspapers need to find a way to generate more revenue.\nThere are other reasons, and they are many.\nSome of the most commonly heard are the lack of monetary donations from both businesses and civilians alike to make up for, or to simply just counter balance, the dramatically declining advertising revenue. Another reason cited is the loss of subscriptions from both the general public and other companies and organisations like universities. These were once subscription-based newspaper-themed publications run by the likes of Columbia University and the University of Oregon, amongst a number of others, are now available online, for free, and at an ever-increasing volume. This is thanks to technology.\nThe loss of advertising and subscription revenue is due to the simple fact that people no longer believe they need newspapers, and now that they do not believe they need newspapers, advertisers and corporate subscription numbers suffer as a result. Why did they believe they needed newspapers before? Well the first reason was to keep themselves up to date on what was going in the world around them to best provide for their customers, shareholders, or even simply to pass on information from their government or local municipalities to the people. This was the purpose of media in general. In some cases, organisations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could even make their presence known through advertisement. The second reason would be during times of war or severe natural disaster, where people could easily find the latest news on world events in a place that was convenient, and a place where people could get it as soon as possible if they were not able to turn on the tv or listen to the radio. The third reason may have been something else entirely. Maybe people turned to their local newspaper because they simply preferred reading the news in print, over reading it on their computers, their smartphones, and now their tablets. The fourth and final possible reason may have been some sort of combination of the first three. But now that news is freely available on the many media websites, newspaper websites included, people have no good reason to pay. This is an economic issue, not a moral issue, because this has nothing to do with people being evil or anything like that. This is an economic issue and the same goes with the subscription revenue loss at the hands of technology. Why buy a copy of the newspaper in the physical world, when the newspaper, or at least your favourite sections, are now available online, for free? News is everywhere on the internet, and if you can\u2019t afford (or don\u2019t want to pay) for a digital subscription at the Times or the Post, there are plenty of other free options available.

I'm not going to spoil it; for the first time, I'm going to let it be a surprise.\n\"The Times They are A-Changin', Bob\"\nby John McTiernan, August 17, 2011 12:00:31 AM\nIf I have learned one thing throughout this endeavor, it's that change is a good thing. People are resistant to change, and even more resistant to a change they don't know or believe in.\nLet's pretend I'm the bestest thing since sliced bread. Let's just take that as a premise for the moment. Now pretend I write to a small readership of the most dedicated, true-life, real country fans. I'm very lucky to have the readership I do, because if I had a larger readership, I'd probably never post here again.\nWe've been doing this now for I don't know 20 years? Something like that. And there's been only one real major change that I can point to. A long time ago I talked about my first love ever and how he had passed away (Mike Riddle, who I was talking about back then passed away last year so it's no longer exactly relevant). But ever since then my focus, well, shifted. It has been about who I was in love with at the moment, and I'm pretty sure that's the only big change that's happened.\nMy only issue is that I'm an old guy. I've been seeing this woman of mine 17 years. And at the rate I'm seeing her, we'll be together 27 years in a few months. That alone doesn't warrant a change, but it does make it very hard to see a point of change in her, or myself.\nThere's a new woman in my life nowadays. I'm seeing her now. And that's what I want to talk about.\nI'm not going to get into why I broke up with the other one or what that other one is like, or what I did, or why I did it, or any of that. It's a lot more complicated than people think. But that other one and I are officially done.\nSo anyway, this new person is not so much \"new\" so much as \"back\". I know her pretty well, and she knows me, but we're both seeing each other in a whole different light.\nWe haven't talked at all about being together, and I don't really intend to. But being together is where we are gonna go. And the point is going to be not \"being together\".\nI'm sure in another few months people will actually be asking me what I think of the new album and if it's as \"country\" as the last two or not, so I might as well start getting ready for that.\nI haven't really spoken to much about who the woman is or what kind of a situation it is. But it is new. Not everything has changed between us, but a lot of things actually have. And I know as far as \"country\" goes, this is going to be a little bit of a change, but I want to do it right.\nWe'll save all the details for later, including the name changes I'm definitely going to have to make to this blog, because let's face it, this is all still just hypothetical and subject to change. I'm just now talking about it because I want to make at least one change today.\nI wanted to get something out about where I am right now so it doesn't become the latest thing in my life to completely disappear without a trace when I take an extended break. I'm not quitting. I'm just taking a break to give my writing a chance to evolve. So here I am.\nI'm going back to a time when I had less to lose and more to gain.

The book will feature the characters \"Ella\" and \"Zach\" whose adventures will be published in a series of \"how to\" books after the first one is released on 3 March. Grant hopes that these books will entice their readers to write their own stories and share them, which she believes will in turn inspire authors to write more for them.\n\"This doesn't make commercial sense - writers don't usually work on pieces of work that they are not paid for,\" she said. However, it will help her gain access to one of the most important parts of her plan: to get some of the best writers in Britain's children's literature industry to work with schoolchildren.\nWhile the first book, \"The Ginger Bread Man\", is a children's fiction title with a story that was written by a ghost writer, each book in the Ella and Zach range thereafter will be co-authored by a major children's writer. In the upcoming second book in the series, for example, Grant has commissioned a story by Siobhan Dowd (author of \"Treasure Island is my Boyfriend\"), to be illustrated by the well-known graphic designer Quentin Blake.\n\"This is about getting children themselves to write, but it is also about promoting what is possible when you start doing something early,\" Grant said. \"Many children start writing their own stories when they were seven or eight years old. But as they go through school they lose their inspiration, or they start seeing it as a difficult academic exercise.\" The success of the first two characters and their stories depends on the readers and writers themselves, therefore, but Grant believes that this gives publishers a unique opportunity to entice readers and encourage writers. The fact that all profits from the first book, \"The Ginger Bread Man\", are going to the National Literacy Trust will also help.", "A brief update on the status of the FCC's inquiry into the newsprint tariff. The inquiry has been suspended, pending the FTC's release of a report on the matter.\nThe FCC has just released a brief update on the agency's Tariff\nAct inquiry into the newsprint tariff that was set to expire the\nend of December, 1998. The tariff was extended by the Department\nof Commerce, pending outcome of the FCC investigation. The tariff\nwas initially imposed because US newspaper producers believed\nCanada was providing some amount of the newsprint supply not\nreflected in the price of Canadian newsprint. The FCC has just\nfound that the price of Canadian newsprint represents a reasonable\nprice, which would lead one to infer that the Canadian supply is\nmeeting the US demand. In the coming weeks, the Federal Trade\nCommission will report to the Commission on newsprint pricing\nissues under an agreement between the FCC, the FTC and the ICC\n(see our previous summary article on the FCC Tariff Act at\nhttp://www.nwsource.com/nws/1998/0428/newsprint/sum.htm).\nTariff Act inquiry into price of Canadian newsprint\nThe Federal Communications Commission announces the suspension of its inquiry into the price of Canadian newsprint to permit the Federal Trade Commission to complete its inquiry into price of Canadian newsprint.\nThe FCC Tariff Act investigation concerned the newspaper publishing industry's complaints about the price of newsprint purchased from Canada. Canadian newsprint producers claimed that the industry was exaggerating the extent of their price increases that allegedly stemmed from increased tariff rates, and other alleged price increases resulting from the end of a subsidy program.\nThe tariff initially was imposed based on the newspaper industry's\nallegation that Canadian newsprint producers were providing an\nunfair disadvantage to the industry. The tariffs were scheduled to\nexpire the end of 1998, as the end of a two-year extension of the\ntariff that originally was set to expire in 1995.

The new regulations\nchange the method for calculating a utility's cost\nof service and rate of return. The utility must\nidentify the cost of service, both current\nand prospective, that will provide\nreasonably dependable and economically efficient\nservice adequate for the existing and  prospective\nservice requirements. The utility must take its\ncost of service in the order of cost and show all\nthe items of cost in a manner to eliminate the\nundesirable effects often caused by disorder in\nthe classification of expenses and in the placing\nof cost items into appropriate rate classes.\nIn the calculation of the rate of return, the utility must\ndistribute its rate of return over its life, to allow\nfor the recovery of all of its investment and equitable\nreturn thereon and interest thereon.\nFERC: Small Gas Utility Filing\nOn February 12, 1977, the U. S.\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued\na revision to the regulations governing rate setting\nfor small gas companies. The revision is designed\nto make the current regulations more responsive to\nthe needs of small gas companies, which are\ngenerally smaller than the major gas companies.\nAn interim order was issued on May 3, 1977, and\nthis order became effective on September 1, 1977.\nA final rule was issued on September 8, 1977, and\nbecame effective on January lst, 1978.\nSUMMARY OF THE REVISION\nThe revision of the regulations governing the setting\nof rates for small gas companies is necessary to\naccount for changes in energy industry practices\nand a change in emphasis in rate making.\nThe present regulations for small gas companies\nare outdated as a result of:\n1.  Expansion of the small gas utility industry,\nand changes in industrial organization of gas\n2.  An increase in the size and complexity of\nsmall gas utility operations.\n3.  Introduction of new technologies for the\nproduction and transmi~ion of gas.\n4. Increase in the number of interconnection\nA NEW GENERAL PRINCIPLE\nGas companies must follow a \"prioritization\"\nphilosophy in developing their cost of service.\nPrioritization is a method for determining\nthe most economically efficient level of service.\nThe philosophy is to set rates to provide each\nclass of service with the level of service\nrequired by that class with the minimum\namount of capacity and the least amount of capital\nthat is economically efficient. The economic\nefficiency of service increases as the amount of\ncapital decreases.\nThe company must prioritize its different types of\nservice, and must maintain that level of service\nin one order or another. Priority must be\ndetermined separately for each class of service.\nThe priority for service categories other than retail\ndoes not need to be a priority. It is the order of\noperation in setting rates for each class of service\nthat must be determinable to ensure that the rate\ndoes not subsidize some classes of service to the\ndetriment of others or cause undesirable market\nincursions. These priorities are given the following\nmeanings in this regulation:\n1. The \"principal service\" is defined as the\nservice which the greatest portion of the\nutility's revenues is generated.\n2. The \"basic service\" is defined as the service\nwhich is considered essential and which\nthe general public requires.\n3. Other service is defined as service which\nis not essential and which is provided by\nthe utilitv in a competitive, non-regulated\n4. Primary competitive service is defined as\nservice provided by a municipal governmental\nutility which a public utility cannot\nprovide in competition.\nEXPLANATION OF RATES\n1. The method of rate calculation,\nratesetting, and regulatory oversight of gas\nutilities changed. Cost of service\npremised on \"level of distribution service,\"\nwhich was based on the fixed charge premise and\nthe use of all distribution facilities to serve a\nparticular customer, was abandoned.\nThe cost of service was changed to the \"order\nof use\" premise and the use of all distribution\nfacilities (regardless of the service they actually\nprovide) to serve the actual retail customer served.\n2. In prior regulations, the rate of return\nwas based solely upon the cost of service.", "The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama certified a class of all individuals enrolled in the Birmingham City Schools (BCS) in 1986, when they hired Defendant Sodexo USA, Inc., a food services company, to provide and operate their food service program. Defendant also provided food service for the Jefferson County Board of Education, which serves the remainder of Jefferson County. The parties had entered into an oral contract in 1986 that was amended in 1988 and in October 2010 by a two-year agreement known as an Impact Service Agreement (ISA) and a one-year ISA known as the 2011\u20132012 ISA. The ISA stated that the district was the \u201cEmployer.\u201d However, the ISA was signed by Defendant, rather than the school board. Defendant was the \u201cContractor,\u201d rather than the district or the school board. The ISA defined job classifications. In December 2010, the district announced that it was awarding the bid for food services to Defendant. The district explained the bidding process in a letter to employees. The letter stated that the \u201cEmployer\u201d had determined that it had no other choice but to hire the \u201cContractor\u201d because the district could not contract with another provider. In response to an amended class action complaint, the district filed a motion to decertify the class. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class, especially because the case may offer guidance beyond the district to other Alabama school districts. In addition, Defendant was a signatory to the Oral Agreements and ISA, making the case more appropriate for common questions and class certification. Furthermore, Defendant failed to show any injury, such as an illogical interpretation of the ISAs or an economic injury, and thus, the case presented a fact-heavy inquiry in which the class would be required to join in order to recover any damages.", "\"The Pillow Book\"\nby Lady Murasaki\nCHAPTER V: HARMONY\nTheir minds like birds of different varieties\nwill flit from tree to tree,\nsinging in different notes that cannot possibly harmonise,\nbut no matter how it may look,\nonce one of them spies another near\nit is a great delight for them both.\nFew people can keep to harmonious relationships in all circumstances,\nhowever high their spirit and whatever their intellect.\nPeople feel very differently about giving or taking rebukes and about\npunishments and rewards;\nhowever much they profess an interest in correcting their own\nerrors and in improving themselves,\nin matters as different as these they always tend\nto go their own way.

Specifically, it:\nsets forth the procedure by which the Secretary of the Interior must take title to the Colorado River reservoir system storage from the State of Arizona in lieu of the State's water lease, and the steps by which the State of Arizona must be paid for the storage, if this transfer is contested in federal court;\nrequires that the Secretary of the Interior certify that no water will be diverted or withheld from Mexico, pursuant to the decree ending the American war with Mexico, without approval by the President and a joint resolution from Congress, if Mexico makes a claim for water not provided under the agreement in a drought year;\nrequires that the Secretary of the Interior certify that Lake Mead has no greater than 1,075 feet of water above the top of the lowest-low water elevation, if Mexico has made a claim for water in Lake Mead or in other Colorado River system reservoirs, and Mexico does not receive its full share; and,\nprovides for the President to submit a presidential determination, if the Secretary of the Interior certifies that Lake Mead is less than 1,025 feet above the top of the lowest-low water elevation and Mexico is entitled to all or part of the amount of shortage carried over from previous years but has been withheld, for example, due to U.S. storage shortages. The Drought Contingency Plan would then go into effect following certain deadlines and the United States, Arizona, and Mexico reaching agreement on the terms of the agreement during such time as Mexico is entitled to at least 4.4 million acre-feet and the amount of surplus water that Arizona is entitled to under the decree ending the American war with Mexico.\nLake Mead Water Levels and the American War with Mexico: This provision of the Drought Contingency Plan is intended to prevent Lake Mead, which serves as the primary source of water storage for the Colorado River system, from declining to a level that would trigger the terms of the Mexican Water Treaty of 1944 that ends the American war with Mexico. These treaty terms require the United States to provide Mexico with the amount of surplus water on Lake Mead that it would have received had that lake contained enough water to produce 4.4 million acre-feet of water. Thus, should Lake Mead drop below a level of 1,075 feet above the top of the lowest-low water elevation, Mexico would be legally entitled to a portion of what are traditionally stored surplus Colorado River waters.\nMexico's Water Rights: This provision of the Drought Contingency Plan is intended to prevent Mexico from receiving any water if the Lake Mead is below 1,075 feet above the top of the lowest-low elevation. According to the 1944 treaty, Lake Mead must be at or above a certain elevation in order to trigger full water rights for Mexico.\nDrought Contingency Plan Implementation: The Drought Contingency Plan, negotiated in 2017 to address severe declines in Lake Mead, requires the Central Arizona Project, which delivers Colorado River deliveries to parts of central Arizona, to reduce its water deliveries by 90,000 acre-feet per month within five years and to terminate the use of certain water that is typically diverted to Mexico.

After  having  worked  her   way  through school and  obtaining  a Bachelor  of  Science education, she  sought and  obtained legalization benefits by filing an  application with the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS).

Prior to  her  adjustment,  an application for U nonimmigrant status was submitted by Ms.  to the  INS.  After adjudication of her original application, she  was allowed to remain in the United States  upon  her adjustment to  lawful  permanence.\nFollowing  changes to  the  Immigration and  Nationality  Act of  1996  (INA)  which created the  Administrative Appeals System (AAS),  an application for a  green card was subsequently submitted by Ms.  for employment as  an educational assistant for the  San Antonio City  School District.

Whether it\u2019s a large-scale transformation or just fine-tuning the ways you work, you can ensure a smooth transition when you keep one thing at the forefront of all efforts: People.\nEarly this year, while we were finishing up 2016, I started to think about change and its impact. This year will see significant changes for the media and advertising industries, and I wanted to be aware of that for 2017. The more familiar things are with the years rolling by, the easier they are to take for granted. I wanted to be mindful of that, because change can do a number on people\u2019s psyches \u2014 good people who want only the best for themselves, their colleagues, and the organization they work for.\nChange is a natural, necessary part of business, but that doesn\u2019t make it an easy thing to take in. I wanted to work with our people in 2017 to help them deal with change and see it as an opportunity. With the help of our leadership team, we started a discussion about the company\u2019s vision and mission and how we can get better at those, with the people we work with and the people we hire, to make the best of that change.\nBut the thing I realized is, change can only benefit us if our people are benefiting. We can have the most cutting-edge processes for change if we don\u2019t have the right people in place and engaged with those processes. And they have to be engaged for what\u2019s coming, for the future. The biggest lesson I learned was that any change needs to be about our people first, even when the changes are driven from the outside.\nTo get the right things in place in order to embrace the change, we needed to take a look at our leadership team. We had a good team, but there needed to be changes there. People have the right to see our leaders succeed. I couldn\u2019t look to my team and think, \u2018They can\u2019t succeed; they just don\u2019t have it in them.\u2019 So we had to get leaders who would bring something into the organization, who could inspire people and bring value with whom we could work. That is what our team is delivering: great leadership that connects with our employees.\nFrom there, we had to focus on our core values because that was a good foundation going into 2017. I think it\u2019s always important to get back to the core, to make sure our leaders understand what goes into the core and how we should operate. That means we can better help our people engage in our overall mission. We have a responsibility to bring our people to that mission and to bring them together.\nI don\u2019t focus on \u2018mission statements\u2019 as much as I do on our core values, since they are what we aspire to every day. I like to bring up those values in a way that makes each day special for our employees. For example, how do you live up to our value of \u201cempowered leadership\u201d? You can\u2019t just say that you\u2019re going to live by it and leave it at that. There needs to be something \u2014 an internal champion \u2014 to help make sure the right people on the team see and hear about that value in action, not just in word. You can do this in many ways; if you have that, it does drive change. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for most through this change: people stepping up and being role models. Do we have that right here? Do we have people in the group who are leading in these areas, inspiring these values?\nI believe we do, but I also have to be real about it.

The business of publishing continues to evolve as it moves online, with advertising at the core of it all.\nMobile advertising is the way forward\nMobile is growing as the main platform for advertising, and will be the key market for all businesses with the aim to reach new audiences.\nMobile phone penetration in Malaysia has been rapidly increasing over the past few years, with average usage growing from 12.37 hours per day in 2010 to 16.58 hours in 2013.\nIn Malaysia, the share of the mobile advertising spend in national ad expenditure is currently 19.6% (2013), placing third behind television (73%) and online (13%), and ahead of outdoor, print and newspaper.\nThe mobile ad spend in Malaysia is expected to grow from 2.9% of total national ad spend in 2013 to 6.4% in 2016.\nThe key drivers of mobile ad spend growth in Malaysia are expected to be tablets, smartphones and in-app advertising.\nMobile advertising will dominate online advertising, which is currently estimated at 3.2% of total 2013 ad spends and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 49.5% by 2016.\nThere are different ways of distributing mobile advertisements, including banner, full screen, interstitial, native sponsorship, rich media sponsorship, social media and real time ads.\nMobile app advertising has a strong growth potential, with an expected CAGR of 100.7% from 2013 to 2016, placing it as the fastest growing mobile advertising segment.\nThe penetration of smartphones in Malaysia will increase from 72% in 2013 to 75% in 2016, with tablets growing from 20% in 2013 to 24% in 2016.\nThe growing use of smartphones is also reflected in Malaysia\u2019s mobile user base, which is expected to increase from 25 million in 2013 to 32 million in 2016.\nWith mobile penetration rates, Malaysia is comparatively lower than other South East Asian markets such as Thailand (94%), Indonesia (80%), Singapore (75%).\nMobile advertising in Malaysia is dominated by three market segments that represent 88.33% of overall mobile advertising expenditure. These are:\nBanner (64.15%),\nIn-app advertising (29.22%) and\nMobile search advertising (6.52%).\nSmartphone usage has doubled since 2012, with users now spending more than five hours of their total smartphone minutes on consuming digital media.\nDigital ad spend in Malaysia increased 20% to RM4.7 billion (US$1.6 billion) in 2013, compared to RM4.0 billion in 2012.\nThe share of mobile ad spends within the total digital ad spend in Malaysia has increased from 2.88% in 2012 to become the third largest platform in the market.\nThe estimated mobile ad spend for 2013 is RM286.9 million, a huge increase of 237% from the RM86.7 million spent in 2012.\nMobile advertising in Malaysia is dominated by three market segments that represent 84.57% of the overall mobile ad expenditure.

The reason this topic became\npart of the overall discussion was that the group was concerned that the\ncurrent unemployment rate of about 8% represented a real problem and there\nwas a sense of urgency to begin doing something about it now to pre-empt the\nworse to come.\nWhat we were concerned about was the lack of any real prospects for\ngrowth in employment and how this would affect the entire economy including\nincreased unemployment rates. The general consensus of the roundtable was that\nthe 8% unemployment level may not look so bad if it does not begin to rise.\nThe concern here is that if there is a significant uptick in unemployment\nit could create a huge drag on the economy, causing more and more people to\nbecome discouraged and not bother to apply for jobs, and as a result it may\ncreate a ripple effect that is difficult to forecast and which may very well\ndamage our hopes of climbing out of this mess.\nTherefore the discussion shifted its focus from looking back at what\nhappened to understanding what it was we all wanted and why it was we wanted\nthem. The group was divided into smaller subgroups that discussed four topics,\n1. Jobs and Growth (or lack of them)\n2. Regulation and Taxes\n4. Housing and the Economy\nSubgroup 1 had a tough time coming up with any answers at all, which was\nsomething that everyone agreed was not a bad thing, but an important step\ntowards reaching some constructive conclusion. Everyone seemed to agree that\nthe economy was not headed in the right directions, and that we needed to\nlook at all of the different factors that contributed to the current problem\nand how they would affect our ability to solve them.\nJobs and Growth (or lack of them)\nThe current problem of unemployment was felt by all to be a major\nimpediment to any real economic recovery and we all were concerned about\nbeing able to do anything about it. The overall consensus was that unemployment\nwas, and would continue to be, a major problem in the U.S. and that the current\nhigh 8% unemployment level of American workers may not compare unfavorably\nto other countries because there were many more countries in a similar or\nworse situation. However, because this country is so dependent upon its\nconsumer base, any faltering or failure in the economy has a major impact on\nthe ability to borrow or borrow money, which would affect the ability of\nbusinesses to expand or hire additional new workers.\nThere were some who felt that a decline in employment simply due to an\naging of the workforce would not be as disastrous as one based on an\neconomy that had not been able to develop new jobs that would replace those that\nwere lost. There was also concern that a major part of the problem was the\ndecline in the ability of Americans to take pride in their work, and felt that\nbusinesses that developed more productive and more efficient methods of doing\nbusiness should be rewarded, but that at the same time, there needed to be rules\nof fair play which required business to fairly compensate workers in exchange\nThere was recognition that there existed a great paradox in that with the\ndevelopment of technology has come a decline in jobs; at the same time, there\nhad been an increase of the ability of individuals to work for themselves,\nthrough the development of e-bay and similar on-line marketing of goods and\nservices. Therein lied the rub because individuals may not have an inherent\nsense that they were gainfully employed if they were doing their own work, and\ntoo often, we saw individuals getting very little income from a part time job\nand too often, part time work was not enough to generate the kind of income\nthat one needed to live on.\nThe group agreed that the answer was not necessarily in looking back\nat how things used to be done, but in recognizing a need to innovate in new\nways. There was a great deal of sentiment in this meeting that we have lost\nsome of our competitive edge because of our unwillingness to take a chance and\nto be different or better or faster. There was a recognition that a great\ndeal of the American society\u2019s problems could be traced to the fact that\nwe have begun to take for granted our freedoms and what we have inherited as a\nsociety from those who came before us.

this is known as \u2018value based pricing\u2019.\nTypically, an additional 10%-20% of the audience (which corresponds, in economic terms, to approximately 60% of the willingness to pay) will pay up front in the expectation of reduced prices and discounts in the future.\nThe question then becomes: how can an organisation build a true \u2018value proposition\u2019 that will get customers to continue to pay and pay more for its content?\nOne key factor is the context in terms of who the potential paying subscriber is and what the context of that subscription is.\nFor example, the willingness to pay for mobile news content varies considerably from context to context, based on the value proposition to each type of consumer.\nSome of the highest willing to pay for news on mobile come from commuters:\nThis willingness to pay varies widely for different types of commuting context: in a context where you are commuting on local transport, such as a bus service, the value proposition can be as little as news consumption while commuting without being distracted from other people on the bus.\nConversely, in a context like commuting a long distance, the willingness to pay for news increases dramatically.\nSimilarly, the willingness to pay for local news differs when you are the customer of the news organisation you are paying (e.g., a member of a local news organisation where you are paying for an online premium membership subscription) and when you are the customer of another local news organisation, where the content and the payments are being handled by someone else (e.g., a local news organisation that is being paid by Facebook).\nSimilar differences are evident with gender, age, and other psychographic and sociographic characteristics.\nGender is a factor that tends to be over-used when defining and targeting audiences, and to a large extent, it is a function of the type of content and the level of service.\nSimilarly, with age, an 80-year-old man will be similar to an 80-year-old woman in his willingness to pay for local news, whereas he will be very different in his willingness to pay for sports and business news.\nFinally, the context of subscription matters: an individual who has a subscription with Apple Music vs. Spotify, or with Hulu vs. Netflix.\nWillingness to pay is more of a value based pricing issue than an age-based issue, but it is also a function of the level of service that the consumer perceives is being provided and the service level agreements with the organisations the consumer is paying.\nA number of news organisations have launched pay wall models that have worked, and at the same time, a number have not.\nNews organisations that are successful with pay walls are typically able to take the pay wall down in a variety of situations without compromising their ability to close these deals with consumers, whereas news organisations that are not successful often tend to have one pay wall model that is used across all audiences and situations.\nThose media organisations that have implemented variable pricing have been able to capture greater willingness to pay and greater lifetime value from consumers; however, they also tend to be smaller and more nimble, in part because they have less cash", "The FTC brings a federal case against a deceptive advertiser, and the court issues an order imposing a cease-and-desist order, appointing a receiver, banning the defendants from making deceptive claims, and ordering them to return millions to victims.

In this summary, we look at the 3 major players that make up the company that Amazon needs to  acquire. A big unknown is how Amazon's plans for the company will affect the 40 percent of teachers who purchase materials with their own money.  The Newspaper Association of Canada has been trying to get local newspapers to partner with libraries in the country. So far, there are 24 newspapers that have partnered with more than 800 libraries.  The Canadian daily with the biggest social media presence among newspapers is The Globe and Mail.   The average number of tweets produced 16  hours day by Globe journalists is 188 tweets daily.  It is doing this in pursuit of increasingly 12 percent audience shares on Twitter. It recently introduced \"Instant Tweet\" option for readers making comments on the paper's articles.  A group of 16-member media outlets have produced what is called the 'Media Trust',  a digital media consortium. Their purpose? To build a sustainable digital business that is able to offer a high-quality media experience with a variety of content, paid or not.  One unique idea to come out of the trust: the idea of the iPad 'birth' package. They will have the iPad birth package ready for purchase at 238 retailers in the UK for babies born from Jan 1 until July 1, 2013. Included in this package are subscriptions to the iPad/iPhone editions of The Times, Sunday Times, The Guardian, Daily Mail and Metro.  A major trend in the media landscape - digital. The new digital  world may cause newspapers to struggle during the 12 months of 2011 if the  number of newspaper websites continues to decline.   The newspaper industry needs to understand that it is  now a digital industry that requires different expertise, and different ways of doing business.  This year should see more online newspaper ads than those in the print editions of  newspapers. It's good news but in order for newspapers to become digital entities need to understand that if  their content will be more valuable to online readers, advertisers will see the value of the content and ads, and buy it. The shift to digital also means that  newspapers need different skills. If news organizations do not have the requisite skills already, then they need to cultivate the people who do - in-house.  Newspaper industry companies also should be focused on ways to improve adverserial metrics.  Advertisers should be able to have reliable  measures that describe whether ads are working and why.  Newspaper executives, advertisers and users of the news content - and, ultimately, the content itself needs to communicate in an integrated way.  A new idea to come out of a conference in the City of Sydney, Australia is to  integrate the news content with the realm of social media in order for the audience to use the news content around the social networks and then back to the  news content itself. The media as we know it needs to change now! The days of printing words and stories in a newspaper and calling it a day are gone. This should have been obvious  but not all newspapers recognized it.  Today, to be a newspaper publisher, it requires digital expertise;  it has to learn to monetize content in the digital world; and news organizations need to think of their news as currency and the digital platforms it produces as the media itself.  If we focus on our ability to find and tell good stories, the business model may just follow along.  Finally, the question is:  Are newspaper publishers ready to  face change?  Or are they too busy fighting?  Source: MediaBizBuzz.com 18  BUZZ BRIEFS", "Most people who buy products online are there to make a purchase. The rest are just looking for someone to talk to. But to build a conversation, you still need a product to talk about, so when it comes right down to it, the most important thing of all is your offer.\nBut don't worry: we'll be back to basics with some essential tips for your offer \u2014 the bait. First, though, let's discuss the other side: your hook.\nWe'll also be looking at how you can ensure your ads are targeting the people who will love them. And finally we'll be bringing your copy to the surface so that it's just as polished as its target, the product.\n#  Putting on the hook\nYou know how you can make the world stop when you walk down the street in a great dress? Just like that \u2014 but for the whole Internet. The key here is all in the presentation. People make an impression on each other based on presentation, and with Google ads, that means landing pages.\nThese are some of the very basics of presentation. They are the hook that will make the online world slow down when they see you, not just run past you. And they're just as easy to come up with as a great dress. Once you know what to look for, it should be simple to come up with some creative ideas.\n#  A hook for every stage of the sales funnel\nThere are four main types of users:\n  * **Casual Shoppers:** just looking for products to talk about\n  * **First-tier Shoppers:** looking for a reason to buy\n  * **Consumers:** already have shopped around and are close to the purchase\n  * **Repeaters:** who are ready to buy, but just want a deal\nYou will get different levels of engagement from each of these groups. But however you segment your audience, you're always going to face a few hard-hitting questions: Where are your users? Where are _they_ at in their decision-making process?\nSay you have users going to a landing page for your product. But what stage of the purchase process are they in? You may not even know what your product is. That's not too uncommon. But by asking what they want, you should be able to get a pretty good idea of where their head is at, even if you don't know what the product is. Someone may be looking for someone to talk to, for example. So what stage are they at? The early stages of the decision-making process, just like your potential first-tier shopper. So when you're designing a landing page, you need to design around that stage of mind to keep them interested. What _they_ are interested in is often what they know they need, but they may not be ready for what you want them to know or buy: your product.\nThe reason they're on the page should be made perfectly clear in the title \u2014 something like \"You're Not Alone: How to Make Friends at Work When Your Job Title Is _Nerd_!\" Your landing page should be the product that is going to make them stop and say, \"Yes! This is what I need! Now I have the confidence I need!\" It'll be exactly what they asked for, and you'll have their attention.\nA good example is a landing page for the video training site Knowmia, www.knowmia.net. They offer online training and classes that can be accessed online and on mobile devices. Their landing pages are targeted for potential students who are looking for a way to learn, with titles such as \"10 Simple Tips for a Better Brain!\" and \"The Secret Trick to Remember Anything You've Never Even Heard of Before!\".\nBut when you look closer, you begin to realize that these landing pages aren't actually about learning, but about finding out how to sell your class to potential students.\n#  Testing and targeting\nThe first thing you should do with your landing pages is test them \u2014 test with each different target group, test with each different ad set type. The landing page is the very first impression that you'll show people, and it's incredibly important that your test your landing pages first thing to see who responds to them and who doesn't. This way you'll have a really good idea of how the pages will perform for each of your different landing page test groups.\nA good example of this would be an advertiser who is working on a brand for women. They might start with a \"You're Not Alone\" landing page for women who are looking to be a better mom, a better spouse, a better friend, or", "This communication sets forth the requirements and procedures which the\nFederal Housing Financing Board (FHFB) will use to establish the\napplicable premiums which the Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA or Ginnie Mae) (Premiums) shall require all GNMA Direct-Endorsement\nLenders to pay to secure GNMA loans. Such loans shall be secured by\nFHA or VA insured, FHA or VA approved or FHLB-insured Mortgages.\nThis memorandum is for the convenience of those GNMA Direct-Endorsement\nLenders who use the FHFB as a servicer of their GNMA loans. For Federal\nReserve Banks that use an independent service bureau to process and\nendorse Direct-Endorsement loans, please contact the FHFB for specific\nguidance regarding FHFB premiums.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 3, 1995, the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) announced that, as of June 1,\n1995, GNMA Direct-Endorsement Lenders would be required to pay an\napplicable premium for each GNMA loan to secure indemnity insurance. The\npremium rates for FHA loans, as established in Attachment A to this\nmemorandum, will be effective on and after June 1, 1995. However, in\naccordance with the transition process set forth in Section 3.0 of\nAttachment A, GNMA loans acquired prior to June 1, 1995, will not be\nsubject to a premium until June 1, 1996. GNMA Direct-Endorsement Lenders\nwill be billed by GNMA for each premium. Such billing statements will\nbe payable promptly unless GNMA advises the Direct-Endorsement\nLender that it is delinquent in its premium payments or has fallen\nbehind in its premium payments. Accordingly, FHFB has established several\nmechanisms to assist in the payment process.\n1. FHFB has entered into an arrangement with GNMA to service a portion of its\nGNMA loans for the FHFB. FHFB-serviced loans are subject to a service-\ncharge for servicing costs that is currently 36 basis points per year.\nFHFB-serviced loans include loans purchased by the FHFB on or prior to\nDecember 31, 1990. In addition, when FHFB acquires a loan through an\nasset transfer program, the service-charge assessed by FHFB on the\nloan will be 36 basis points per year. On and after June 1, 1995, FHFB\nwill require all GNMA Direct-Endorsement Lenders that utilize the FHFB\nfor servicing to pay an applicable premium to secure indemnity insurance\nby increasing their service-charge assessment for GNMA loans to 44 basis\npoints per year. As of January 6, 1995, these serviced loans are\ngenerally not subject to any service charge because of the\napplication of previously announced servicing fee waivers. Lenders\nutilizing the FHFB for servicing loans currently in default may receive\na 36 basis point service charge for payment processing or GNMA may\nwithhold the servicing fee until the loan is brought current.\n2. FHFB has entered into an arrangement with Mortgage Bankers\nInsurance Company to provide GNMA direct-endorsement coverage. Under\nthis scheme, the insurance premiums for loans covered under this\narrangement are assessed through a quarterly surcharge, typically on a\npercentage basis, that is passed through from Mortgage Bankers to its\nunderwriters and in turn is deducted from each underwriter's account.\nThe surcharge rate for these loans will be 25 basis points per year,\nand underwriters will be billed for coverage at the end of each\nunderwriting quarter.\n3. GNMA has implemented a system in which the underwriters may also\nimpose an additional administrative fee, also typically on a\npercentage basis, on the premium for each loan they underwrite. These\nunderwriter service surcharges are passed directly to the underwriter,\nwho will then submit it to the insurance company for processing.

To compete, newspapers will\nhave to follow two basic strategies: (1) adapting the online format to\ntraditional media, and (2) moving away from traditional products and services.\nThis white paper, based on the survey \"Print and\nOnline Advertising: Perceptions and Prospects\" (http://www.polito.org/white\npapers/e-media_whitepaper.pdf) by the European Newspaper Congress,\nexamines the role of advertising in the market for news online,\nespecially when newspapers are selling services such as lead generation\nservices, data capture, and even e-business. In addition, this white paper\nalso explores the impact of technological advances, such as blogs,\ne-commerce, and e-mail, on online advertising, and it examines the impact of\nconsumer behavior on the use of e-media. The overall conclusions of this\npaper are: (1) advertisers are moving to the Internet because of lower\nmedia costs (in the form of fewer and shorter print runs of classifieds);\n(2) newspapers who fail to recognize these new market requirements will\nlose advertising revenue to less traditional newspaper competitors; and\n(3) newspapers need to focus more on \"content,\" instead of the\nadvertising that surrounds it. In addition to this white paper, the\nEuropean Newspaper Congress presents \"Trends in the Global Classified\nMedia,\" a three-part series (http://www.pressandpublishing.org/trendslc\n_part_1.asp, http://www.pressandpublishing.org/trendslc_part_2.asp,\nhttp://www.pressandpublishing.org/trendslc_part_3.asp). The following is a\nsummary of the three parts of the \"Trendslc\" series.\n- the decline of advertising revenue\nThe 2002 edition of the Advertising Age \"Factbook\" projected classified\nadvertising, the largest category of ads in most newspapers, would\ncontinue to decline over the next five years, to levels that had not\nbeen seen since before the publication was established in 1930.  In the\nsame period, consumer advertising was not expected to increase very much, a\ndevelopment that would put additional pressure on traditional newspaper classified\nads.  On the other hand, internet sites, which were not subject to ad\nrate increases and did not have the costs imposed by printing and paper, were\nexpected to grow.  But internet ads are expected to replace traditional\nclassifieds more and more in a kind of hybrid, half and half mix until\nclassified ads disappear almost entirely.  In its 2002 Factbook, Ad Age\nadvertising rates and found that newspaper classifieds had declined\ndramatically during the previous six years, in absolute and relative\nterms; that while consumer advertising was growing, it was doing so very\nslowly; and that both consumer and classified advertising rates were\nexpected to continue their decline over the next six years.  The report\nexpected growth in internet ads, noting that their rate of growth was\nslower than that of newspaper classified ads, but that their ad rate\ngrowth rate was expected to be much faster than that of both print and\nclassified and consumer advertising by traditional media, including newspapers.\nClassified advertising may decline because new media can be used for\nrecruiting without the newspaper brand in between (the cost and\nhassles of print ads could cost a company a lot of money) and that the\nclassified ads, with their low ad rates, are a drag on the newspaper's\noverall cost structure.  But also as more and more employers and buyers turn\nto search applications on the internet, such as Monster and E-bay, the\nadvertising cost structure of these companies becomes less and less reliant\non the classified ad.  Classified ads, which were once thought to be\nvery profitable, are now just a means of generating enough advertising\nrevenue to allow the newspaper to charge higher prices, and for little else.\nTraditional advertising, like print, is not in competition with new\nmedia applications such as online, but it is threatened by them.

Over the years administrative duties have changed and the Department, now called the Kentucky Department of Taxation (KYDOPT) has diversified its activities beyond property taxation. However, the Department of Taxation remains as primary tax collection agent for all state taxes.\nSection 1 of the Departmental Organization Plan 0000-0000 was issued by the Department of Taxation in 1983 to set forth the organization and mission of the Department. It was amended in June 1984 by section (2), paragraph (ii) to specifically include the Administration of Appraisals and as part of the overall responsibility for tax administration.\nA working subcommittee of the Property Valuations and Appraisals Division of the department was convened in July 1984 to develop a policy to be used to define the appraisal function within the Department. This subcommittee was charged with developing procedures for the following: 1. Statewide coordinated appraisal policy 2. Oversight of local appraisal agencies 3. Oversite of appraiser qualifications 4. Administrative policy for all appraisal activities within the Department\nOn January 26, 1985 the Assistant Commissioner of the Property Valuations and Appraisals Division issued Departmental Policy OM 1.2 to further define the Department\ufffds appraisal policy.\nOn April 11, 1986 the State Tax Commissioner amended departmental policy 9 (Section (2), paragraph (iv) to further define the Department\ufffds appraisal function as a part of the overall tax function of the Department.\nOn April, 11, 1986 the State Tax Commissioner amended Departmental Policy OM 1.2 to further define the Department\ufffds appraisal policy to include the following:\n1. Appraisal Services for the Agencies:\nBillable Services - Valuation and Market Analysis Services performed at the request of various agencies of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or other taxing jurisdictions will be provided in accordance with established agency procedures for all approved services.\nIntrastate Work - Examination, analysis, evaluation and appraisal services will be performed at no cost for any local governmental subdivision, governmental unit or subdivision thereof within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n2. Property Valuations, Sales, Surveys; Records Management:\nPrepare sales comparison appraisals for marketable interests in residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial properties including the development of the appraisal process and supervision of the preparation of sales comparison appraisals for marketable interests in residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial properties, and for the preparation of market studies for large scale sales including the determination of comparable data, and the investigation, examination, evaluation and study of all tangible and intangible elements affecting the market value of property for which appraisals are to be prepared for the purpose of: 1. Examining and making sales of property which is to be sold on behalf of the Department. 2. Preparing residential sales studies and appraisals utilized in the setting of real property taxes with the primary intention of achieving a uniform and equitable distribution of the tax burden. 3. Providing market knowledge and analysis to a variety of local and state agencies.\n3. Assessment Administration - Supervise appraisal activities as they are related to the functions of assessment administration including: a. The review of appraisals and the development of standard forms and definitions as necessary for the performance of these appraisal functions; b. The management and supervision of the use of appraisals as they apply to assessment administration procedures; c. The preparation and preparation of the annual budget for the appraisal activity; d. The review and evaluation of proposed legislation and regulations affecting or concerned with the valuation of property owned by corporate entities.\n4. Special Studies - Examination, selection, supervision", "The Federal Reserve Board, on behalf of its members, is issuing this Statement of Policy to establish a single public rate-setting process to supersede those in effect now in the Federal Reserve System and in individual Reserve Banks. Under the proposed process, reserve requirements and the discount rate would be set on a weekly basis, subject to review at least every three months. In the event of a major disruption in market functioning or a major departure from policies that would undermine the conduct of monetary policy, the setting of reserve requirements and the Federal Reserve discount rate would be the last and most drastic resort in applying the Board's general policies.\nThis Statement of Policy establishes the method to be used by the Federal Reserve System in setting reserve requirements and the discount rate on its own initiative. This Statement supersedes every method by which open market operations, or reserve requirements, or the discount rate have been set, and to the extent it supersedes a Bank's policies, that institution's rates will be governed by this policy as of a date to be determined.\nIn addition to setting the discount rate and reserve requirements on its own initiative, the Federal Reserve System will set reserve levels as needed in the execution of monetary policy and will be guided by the Board's published operating targets for the federal funds rate and reserve requirements. When the Board has taken steps to use its operating targets to set target levels for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve Banks will adjust the amount of required reserves to keep reserves broadly equivalent to the operating targets for the federal funds rate, consistent with the terms of the Statement on Standards and Procedures that are effective at the time.\nThe System will continue to employ all available lending tools that are part of the traditional tool kit of monetary policy to the same extent and for the same purposes that they are used now. For example, the Federal Reserve will continue to use its lending operations, as well as interest on reserves, in effecting changes in its operating targets and the required reserve ratios, with a view toward moving the federal funds rate, in the aggregate, toward the target. In that way, the Federal Reserve Bank will adjust required reserve ratios against the level of marketable collateral in reserves.\nThe System will also continue to use changes in reserve ratios as a tool to ensure that banks have adequate balances to meet payment demands and to maintain confidence in the payment system. Reserve ratios are thus normally higher in periods of heavy settlement activity than in times of less activity, and they may be changed only on the dates prescribed by the Board and after the opportunity has been given to comment on and suggest changes in the proposed rate ratios.\nWhile the Board's operating targets and reserve requirements are designed to be adjusted gradually and transparently, the Board is prepared to use more aggressive methods, including the reserve requirements, to conduct monetary policy if necessary. The method adopted in this Statement will be used as the preferred tool for system- and Board-wide management of the aggregate amount of reserves in the banking system. However, if other tools of monetary policy prove more suitable and appropriate under circumstances, the Board or the System as a whole may choose to use those tools in adjusting reserve requirements; it will provide guidance as to when it is preferable to use such alternatives.\nReserve Requirements and the Discount Rate\nThe main tool the Board uses to control the amount of reserves in the banking system-the reserve requirements-is designed to promote efficient money market functioning. Changes in the levels of the reserve requirements and the size of the discount rate can alter market expectations so that they are consistent with the Board's operating targets and, with those expectations and those targets, the federal funds rate. The effect of changes in the level of reserve requirements depends on where the money market is in its cyclical progression: if the money markets are at an early stage, a change may elicit some change in market practices. If the money markets are at an advanced stage and operating near the targets, a change in the reserve requirements or the discount rate might have substantial impact on market conditions.\nThe Board will review daily the amount of reserves in the system against its operating targets. It will then propose a decision on the size of reserve requirements and the discount rate for the upcoming week based on the balance of factors such as conditions in the money markets, changes in the economy, or developments abroad. The Board will announce the amount of the next step in the target path in a manner designed not to prejudge decisions on reserve requirements and the discount rate. This is to allow the market to prepare for the announcement of the targets' changes,", "The FCC's proposal to regulate the Internet raises concerns about the impact on consumer privacy. In response to such fears, new privacy laws are now seen as a condition of Internet regulation.\nIn his first act as chairman of the FCC, Julius Genachowski, released a notice of proposed rulemaking titled \"Open Internet.\" The rule, if approved in its current form, \"will be the first time the agency has officially taken a stand on Internet privacy and the subject of web service providers' ability to share or limit customers in terms of access, security and more,\" reports The Wall Street Journal.\nFCC press release on the rule: http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-de-regulatory-and-free-speech-proposals-bring-internet-access-more-open\nOp-ed from Gabe Cohen of FreePress.net: http://www.freepress.net/node/23537\nThe FCC and Internet Privacy: http://consumerist.com/339002/fcc-and-internet-privacy\nBrad Stone, a technology consultant and author of Web 2.0, is cynical about the proposal: \"The internet doesn\u2019t need to be regulated to survive,\" he says. Others, such as Michael A. Horowitz, a Harvard Law School professor, express similar concerns. Their fear is that such regulation will curtail their online speech.\n\"The chairman is trying to take this back-door approach of trying to have some rules and regulations that will be more flexible than those on the books, but more regulation for more kinds of services in some areas and in other areas not at all.\" This makes privacy a condition the FCC will regulate the Internet more than the Internet regulating itself: \"If the FCC is going to impose that, then the FCC has to do it for all networks.\" - Michael A. Horowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and co-counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology.\nSuch concerns were also mentioned in a New York Times editorial: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/opinion/l18web.html\nThe concern about privacy was also discussed in testimony to the senate committee: http://commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=4a7789fc-0c3c-4e6a-b3a0-57cc7566815b\nJulius Genachowski: http://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc-commissioners-bio-genachowski\nOp-ed from Brad Stone: http://www.fcc.gov/document/op-ed-brad-stone", "In this second part of our four-part series on the future of brand content, we explore whether brands are ready to put their money behind it, explore the challenges of brand content, and consider some recommendations to help ensure success.\nThe first article in this four-part series on the future of brand content introduced and summarized the \u201cnew state of content,\u201d where the lines between brand and publishing have blurred for the modern consumer.\nIn this second part, we will explore one of the key issues in this new state of content -- how prepared for brand-to-brand content are top brands? In short, not very. The good news lies within brands that are experimenting with this new content type.\nBrand Content: Where Are We Now?\nThere is a pervasive belief that brand content will be the dominant category of content in the future, while other forms -- such as entertainment content, user-generated content, and news content -- will lose traction or become less relevant and thus important.\nBut if we dig into the data and delve into the research results, we see that brands are not ready to spend much on brand-brand content efforts.\nThe Brand Content Maturity Model:\nOur research uncovered that while brand content is an essential part of a brand\u2019s strategy, the majority of brands in our 80-brand sample lack an organized, long-term strategy for their brand content. Most brands have implemented limited-to-no brand content to date.\nThere is a misperception that brands are already investing in brand-brand content. But this is not the case -- the actual reality is that a full 78% of brands in our sample currently do not have any budget allocated to brand-brand content.\nOur research revealed that while brands understand that there are opportunities and challenges related to brand-brand content, in reality most brands have yet to actually implement branded content.\nThe brand content maturity model shows us that most brands in our sample have yet to build an organized, long-term strategy. Most brands have not yet built an in-house team to manage the brand content. Most brands are also not yet experimenting with brand-brand content on some level.\nInstead, many of the brands in our sample are still in the \u201ctesting\u201d phase of brand content in a small way. While experimentation will ultimately be necessary for most brands, the point is that this is a non-optimal state to be in; brand-brand content is more likely to succeed if there is a fully-developed strategy in place.\nIn short, brand-brand content has yet to be implemented on a large or holistic level, regardless of the organization\u2019s level of awareness.\nWhy Is Brand Content More Challenging Than Other Types of Content?\n\u201cBrands are going to have to be very innovative and very creative about their content to be able to break through the clutter and provide a good experience.\u201d\n~ Sapna Chadha, Senior Director, Global Marketing, eBay\nThere is still a lot of confusion around this content type. While brands are becoming more aware of the challenges, they typically focus on the short-term challenges of brand content creation. There is a lack of appreciation for the longer term view of brand content -- how this could drive brand value over the long-term, how it could be useful for driving marketing effectiveness (to the sales conversion), and how this content type could be used to boost brand image.\nBrands are also not thinking innovatively about the use of brand content, which they are used to doing for other content types. They think that branded content is the same as the other types -- in that it is the content that is relevant to the brand itself, that will be relevant to the consumer, that will help the brand build brand identity in the consumer\u2019s mind.\nBut the reality is that branded content, at this point in time, is quite limited in its use-case (which is one of the reasons it is not being invested in with true urgency yet). Rather than being a different type of content, brand-brand content is a way to amplify other types of content, such as promo-branded content, publisher-branded content, or influencer-branded content. It helps to drive engagement for a marketing campaign, and helps to boost the social signals that marketers are after.\nUntil we see brands take brand-brand content to the next level with the focus on amplifying other types of content, and until we see brands start to see all content as a way to reach consumers, rather than just about promoting their products or services, we are not going to be able to say that branded content", "In the early 1930s, when the Nazi government was working full time to create a new breed of animal\u2014the \"super dog\"\u2014it came into possession of a remarkable beagle named Bezerra. This is the story of Bezerra's life and, in particular, his part in the development of the \"super dog.\"\nWhat we know of Bezerra comes to us from the memoirs of Dr. Erich von Holsten, director of the Canine Studies Institute (ISKAN) in Hannover, Germany. ISKAN was the chief research facility specializing in all aspects of breeding dogs and their work for us.\nBezerra was a Beagle of extraordinary talent. He is credited with solving the longstanding problem of how to teach a dog to retrieve. The most difficult part of the problem was teaching the dog to pick up game by running alongside or beside it\u2014not chasing it.\nBezerra was given to the Nazis by a Portuguese diplomat named Dr. Gato. This gift came in 1933 when Portugal and Germany were forming a pact of mutual assistance, and Hitler wanted to impress Gato. Bezerra became Dr. Holsten's star experimental dog.\nBut the Nazis were never one to share credit. Even back in the 1930s, the propaganda machine was working to turn dogs into super humans who would work for us. Their dream came close to fruition in the 1940s, when Nazi Germany went to war: super-fledged dogs were to be strapped into aircraft and sent up in dog-planes to kill our fighters and attack enemy ground troops.\nIt was against this backdrop that the ISKAN team went underground, and with the help of Allied officers, managed to preserve a lot of its wartime data for future generations.\nToday, animal behaviorists all over the world are working to find answers to the same problems the ISKAN scientists were working to solve\u2014the problems of domestication: how to teach a dog to retrieve and how to train a dog to respond to verbal commands from humans.\nBezerra is the first of the ISKAN super dogs. He is the first dog to retrieve a fallen bird, the first dog to heal himself, and the first to learn his way around an unfamiliar house, a car, any place he may have to find a bird.\nBezerra was the foundation of the super-dog theory, and it was a super dog of his making which led the Nazis to the belief that dogs would not only hunt for us, but also do any kind of work we needed.\nERICH HOLSTEN\n##\nDear Dr. Erich Holsten, Director of ISKAN, Hannover, N.Y.\nAs you know, I have been working for a long time in the field of breeding dogs. The German army needs dogs\u2014a lot of them. It has been my personal goal for years to breed a better dog. Since I have also served my country as a diplomat, I have had the opportunity to observe that in some countries dogs do not have a good reputation. Dogs are considered dirty\u2014not a clean animal and hence not a good companion. Perhaps because we have been so concerned about keeping our dogs clean, we've lost sight of the fact that they actually are a very clean animal on a whole host of fronts\u2014mentally, physically, and spiritually.\nThere are many problems in breeding dogs. Some of the biggest obstacles are their training to retrieve. Until ISKAN developed _Der_ _Superhund_ , dogs could not perform in the manner to which they were best suited. They could not perform well for us, or even themselves for that matter.\nFor example, I have been trying to train dogs to retrieve for more than twenty years, but without success. Dogs are very loyal, and the love to work and please people, but when forced to do certain things, they cannot. I tried to train my dogs to \"fetch.\" But this is as difficult for a dog as teaching Shakespeare to a monkey. As you know, this was in the 1930s, before ISKAN came along and developed their theories for how to train dogs.\nMy dogs would always \"drop\" the game when presented with an object, and would not understand or respond to verbal commands. A dog is as intelligent as a person who has been given a good education. He can be trained to do the very same things we ask of him. I have even trained one dog to hunt. But, he always had difficulties when it came to learning to fetch, or even recognize what the object was that he was supposed to retrieve.\nI would", "FMCSA announces its decision to partially grant and partially deny the petition for determination of the FMCSA of preemption of the Illinois ELD program requirements.

Cody Jr., saw the man and woman having sex, then the man fled, according to sheriff's Capt. Brian Gennick.\n\"We haven't been getting complaints that much about the park,\" Gennick said. He said that while park officers occasionally patrol the open spaces along the 16-mile creek bed, they do not generally carry out foot patrols in the park.\nCody was able to provide a very detailed description of the rapist, and with the crime so fresh, local law enforcement expects to catch him within a matter of days.\nSheriff's spokesman Sgt. Steve Conboy said the suspect could be charged today with attempted rape, rape by force, or rape by force during the discharge of duty.\n\"The victim has been interviewed and is assisting,\" Conboy said.\nConboy said Cody saw the sex act as he was nearing the park's northern entrance, and \"it was too late for him to do anything. He just kept watching. He's a good witness. It's a rare thing to have a good witness.\"\nCody told deputies he first saw the black man running along a hillside. The rapist then dropped to his knees and engaged in \"oral sex\" with the victim \"for a moment,\" sheriff's Deputy Steve Scholberg said.\nThe man then stood up, put a hooded jacket over his head, and took off running away from Cody.\nAccording to Conboy, it's unusual for park police to witness a man having sex with a woman against her will--especially in daylight--and so the officers on scene acted quickly.\n\"Because of their response, they are very positive that the rapist will be caught pretty quickly,\" Conboy said.\nBut the man has been described as tall, so rangers cannot easily focus their search.\nThe ranger and several others in the park area continued searching Sunday afternoon for the man, Conboy said. \"They started patrolling. They started asking people if they've seen that person,\" Conboy said.\nThe woman who was raped was treated at Huntington Hospital after the rape.\nOn the Lower Chino Creek trail, which runs through the park, are picnic grounds, open play areas and tennis courts. To reach the park, take the 210 Freeway about 16.5 miles to Huntington Drive, then go north 2.8 miles to San Gabriel Canyon Road. Turn right, then make the first left onto San Gabriel Canyon Road. The park entrance is about 1.5 miles ahead on the left.\nThe Los Angeles Sun-Examiner does not condone, tolerate, nor accept the rapes of women in our society, and we hope for a quick arrest, conviction, and sentence.\nBut if you've ever been sexually assaulted, as have two thirds of all rape victims, you know the aftermath. The guilt and shame you feel when people treat you like what they do to you is your fault, the denial of what happened to you and your body, the raging anger because you've been violated and robbed of your life. Sometimes there is no treatment that can cure you of the aftereffects of rape, and you have to learn to live with these effects the best way you can.\nBut rape is still a serious crime that the victim is never safe from. And nowhere in the world is our society any less accepting of this violent action than it is in Japan. Every rape reported in Japan generates a scandal equal in magnitude and duration to the one that rocked Japan's soccer world when the Yomiuri Sports Newspaper publicized the rape of a soccer player by a teammate in 1989.\nAfter years of", "RENO LIVES\nOn October 27, the National Fisheries Institute, a trade association\nmade up of fish and seafood processors reported that 1997's\ndomestic seafood consumption reached 3.91 pounds per person, up 1%\nfrom 1996's 3.89 pounds. Americans ate much more sushi but less canned\nfish than the previous year. This is the first annual increase since\n1990 and, the NFI said, it bodes well for the seafood industry.\nNFI chief Michael Schreier said, \"With most food spending flat, seafood\nwas the only choice for growing a 1% increase.\" However, Schreier\nwasn't able to offer much explanation as to why Americans are\nincreasingly eating fish or sushi in the same year Americans dine\nout less often, drive fewer miles, and save more.\nEven with the increase in seafood consumption, however, the U.S.\nstill eats less fish than other developed countries. Americans\nnow eat less fish than both the British and the Japanese. We need\nto eat more fish in this country to reach the recommended two to\nthree 6-ounce servings a week. And, as Dr. John Cloud writes in\nthis issues cover story, Americans need to understand that fish\nare food and not fun.\nNFI's Schreier predicted that the seafood industry could have its\nbest year ever in 1998. He said that he and his members are very\nupbeat. In the past, when people thought the end of the world was\ncoming -- SARS, avian flu -- food sales would drop. But since this\nsummer so few people seem to be overly concerned about impending\ndoom, food sales, especially seafood sales, have been quite strong.\nA recent example: For the two weeks following September 11,\nseafood sales at New York's Union Square Greenmarket were up 40%.\nSchreier attributes the sales increase to increased consumer interest\nin locally sourced foods. He told Schoonmaker, \"Consumers are\nlooking for regional. A couple months ago, they were just grabbing a\npizza or a turkey, but now they're asking for where it came from.\"\nThat helps the seafood industry. It's one trend that Schreier\nwelcomes.\nBut is it the only positive trend?\nSomeone, at the National Fisheries Institute, didn't give Schreier\nthe entire picture. In late August, the Washington Post ran an\narticle predicting a collapse in the U.S. fishing industry\n(\"Savior Fish\") because of a 28% growth in Asian import-fishing\nfrom 1995 to 1997. In the wake of the Post article, NFI's Schreier\ncame out firing. He said the article had no credibility and\nmisrepresented the NFI study \"inconceivably.\" An NFI study, he\ntold the press, had predicted that America's commercial fishing\nindustry might be in decline. The problem was the Post's reliance\non a study by economists Andrew Dollery and Philip B. Reid who\nreally predicted the fishing industry in developed countries\nwould undergo the same change fishing underwent in developing\ncountries -- from a labor-intensive industry that provided\nemployment to a capital-intensive industry that requires only a few\npeople to process large amounts of raw product.\nSchreier said the Post had ignored the report's context -- that the\nindustry was not in serious decline and that the United States had\nmore \"catchable\" fish stocks than some of its European competitors\nsuch as Denmark, which he said had fish stocks that can't be\ncaught or fished responsibly. His main point was that the industry\nwasn't in immediate trouble. But the Post article had taken the\ngist of the NFI report and made it sound as though all fishing\nindustries are on the brink of a collapse.\nThe Post piece was wrong? Not at all, Schreier told Schoonmaker.\nBut he still believes there is hope for the industry. The NFI\nreport predicted that U.S. seafood imports should hold steady this\nyear over last. The National Marine Fisheries Service also predicted\nstable imports this year. And the U.S. government has predicted 0%\ninflation, thus making", "The FAA is mandating that beginning February 1, 2016, operators in compliance with certain provisions of 14 CFR part 135 be required to ensure that each required flightcrewmember is a holder of an FAA issued airman certificate with at least the following ratings: flight engineer (except for helicopter air ambulance operators and supplemental air tour operators) or rated pilot for powered airplanes or a rated private pilot for powered airplanes and, as applicable, flight engineer for non-powered airplanes; helicopter or gyrocopter air ambulance, limited helicopter air ambulance, and supplemental air tour operator.

Since September 2016, the share of voice interactions related to news information has doubled, growing from 19.7 percent to 40.3 percent.\nBut that's not as clear cut as it first appears. Over the same period, the share of interactions to ask about news has also doubled, up from 9.4 percent to 19.6 percent. The volume of news information queries has roughly doubled and still only amounted to 6.5 million in the last month.\nTo NewsWhip, the growth in news information queries is a result of people using voice assistants to ask general questions like \"what's in the news?\" rather than getting specific information about a particular news article.\nThere have been some changes in the search terms people use to ask their smartphones to complete certain tasks. From August 2016 to January 2017, \"weather forecast\" was the most popular smart speaker action (11.1 percent). But since February 2017, \"play video\" or \"video player\" has taken its place (17.5%). People appear to have gone from searching for the weather to consuming the related content.\nNewsWhip found that \"who was/won the presidentialelections\" is the most popular search action in the United States. That's true when we look at both Google Home and Amazon Echo combined. For the rest of the world, \"how do I do x\" takes the top spot.\nThe United States also has a more diverse list of news-focused search actions as compared to the rest of the world.\nMost of the top smart speaker actions in the U.S. are associated with news, from \"what happened\" to weather-related queries such as \"weather forecasts.\"\nHowever, some of the top search actions in the U.S. are more specific news-related tasks like finding a particular piece of information (i.e., \"election results,\" \"nfl scores\"), looking for a particular brand (i.e., \"mcdonald's menu\") or looking for information about a particular sporting event (i.e., \"ncaa march madness\") or entertainment show (i.e., \"game of thrones\").\nNewsWhip also found that Google has a commanding lead in both search and action-related smart speaker queries within the U.S. Google Home is followed by Echo and Siri, and Apple TV is next.\nVoice search and voice assistants have become more popular since Google Home went on sale in the U.S. Google Home surpassed 10 million installs in February, but Apple's HomePod, which will not launch until late-2017, is poised to compete in the smart speaker market.\nIf people decide to use Apple's HomePod more than Google's Home, that could have a dramatic effect on how voice assistants are used in U.S. homes. Right now, voice search and voice assistants represent about half of the time spent on mobile, and that's a trend that should continue.", "Scalawagging a murderer could be a woman's ticket out of her dead-end, thankless, dirt-poor life and to fame, fortune, and even a bit of celebrity.

A common theme is that of \"snowed under.\"", "What exactly does content marketing mean? It can be a little ambiguous, which is why it's more important than ever for us to understand it, along with native advertising and the impact it's having on editorial. Learn more about the definition and future scope of content marketing from the leading experts in the field.\nThis is a new era for digital content creators. As we strive towards better metrics and greater engagement in a multichannel world, we still lack a full understanding of exactly what \"content\" is, how to implement it, and how to measure it. So, let's dig a little deeper and discuss the definition of content marketing and its relationship to native advertising.\nFirst, let's define native advertising, which is simply a paid placement that uses a similar format as the content it surrounds. If you're currently using native advertising as a core element of your content strategy, then it's clear that you've already mastered the definition of content marketing - content that works for brands. This can include anything from videos to infographics, in both paid and editorial environments - the point is to create engaging pieces that relate well to the content environment in which they're placed. The native placement should be relevant to the site in which it lives, and you should be working toward creating editorial content that makes as much sense from a content strategy level as it does on a micro level.\nSo, while the definition of \"content marketing\" is still a little bit fuzzy, that's not going to stop us from experimenting in new ways and looking for the formula that works best - the definition of \"science\" or \"surgery\" wasn't always so refined, but that didn't stop people from becoming medical practitioners, nor did it limit them from being effective. Content will be the core element of all content creation and the measurement of its success over the next few years, and it simply remains to be seen exactly how we can best use it to our advantage.\nA panel of top content strategists met up with Digiday, including John Heltman and Caitlin Kerr of Google, to talk about the future of content creation, especially native advertising.\nThe definition of \"content marketing\" for this panel was actually a little bit more clear-cut, and really centered around the idea of creating content for your brand first, rather than creating content for one specific platform, such as a mobile app. Native advertising works when users are already looking for what you've created, and it will continue to work that way as long as content marketing is at the forefront. A core strategy of using video content for your brand is one of the most effective ways to create native advertising that works.\nThe conversation continued with the concept of \"content-curating platforms,\" where brands can work together to produce content that is relevant to a larger group of people. What role can Facebook play in this scenario?\nFacebook, it was revealed at the conference, is already in the process of developing a \"discovery feed,\" where native ads should find homes if they're able to provide real value to consumers. With so many brands competing for consumer attention, and a finite attention span, it's crucial to put content in its proper place and understand how to tell your brand's story from a standpoint where consumers get the experience they're looking for.", "41% of readers are willing to switch brands if publishers offer a branded iPad\nMEDIA: https://tinyurl.com/29k923m (downloadable pdf available at 4:00 PM ET today from\nhttp://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/communications-technology-media/research_reports/advertising-industry-insights.jhtml)\nNEW YORK, March 18, 2010 \u2013 One year after the iPad\u2019s launch, 92 percent of US internet users know about the device, and 26 percent say they will buy an iPad.\nThe first quarter 2010 US Media Forecast, released today by Pricewaterhouse\u00adCoopers (PwC)*, also finds that almost half (42 percent) of US adults have an iPod, and 36 percent are familiar with the Kindle. In all, 9 percent of US internet users have already own a tablet-type device.\n\u201cTablets are one of the most interesting and disruptive computing platforms in years,\u201d said Jon Last, managing director at PwC\u2019s entertainment and media practice. \u201cAs devices continue to grow in capabilities, consumers are likely to experiment with various devices, making them more willing than ever to reorient their spending around the services and programs they wish to access.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition to iPad,\u201d said Dave Bauer, managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 advertising/media marketing industry practice, \u201ctablet consumers also tend to own more general purpose devices, such as smartphones, that are not just used for accessing media but also for running productivity applications such as calendars, as well as accessing corporate email.\u201d\nEarly Tablet Adoption Signaling Continued Innovation\nThe survey found that of more than 1,000 US internet users who use their tablets, three in five (60 percent) say they would like to access media. The survey also found that the device\u2019s ability to perform a variety of functions and the ability to get email for free or at a reduced rate are the most important features to potential iPad buyers and could serve to accelerate the adoption of the new devices.\nEven with the early interest, consumer willingness to switch brands appears to be limited. Respondents with iPod experience were willing to switch if price was right (30 percent), followed by ability to store more (22 percent) or if device offered other features (22 percent). Other features cited by those with less iPod experience include ability to view a wider range of formats (18 percent), price (17 percent), ability to do more things (16 percent), ability to download games or apps (12 percent) and size (10 percent).\n\u201cConsumers will continue to shift from the laptop to smartphones and the mobile PC to the iPad, as consumers seek devices that better facilitate their multi-media/multi-tasking lifestyles,\u201d said Bauer. \u201cHowever, given the limited pool of tablet consumers, brand loyalty and the ability to offer new functionality are still key reasons that consumers will switch brands in this category, at least in the near term.\u201d\nUS internet users surveyed indicated that three-fourths (77 percent) of them would like to use the device to purchase content. This is followed by social-networking (19 percent), listening to music (11 percent), entertainment (10 percent), reading (8 percent), reading for school (5 percent), video gaming (4 percent), playing games (3 percent), and keeping appointments (3 percent).\nFor the current quarter (February 28, 2010 \u2013 May 9, 2010), PwC believes overall advertising revenues for the television, Internet and radio industries are on pace to grow 3.8 percent to $36.1 billion.\nPwC\u2019s US Media & Entertainment Industry segment was created in 2006 to focus on the trends impacting media and entertainment businesses, including Internet-related issues and cross-industry implications of globalization efforts and shifting consumer preferences and technological innovation.", "News companies must take responsibility for the quality of comments on their sites. This is particularly true for companies that own editorial content and those that don't. Failing to do so is a risk to reputation and bottom line.\nFor years, companies have operated with what I'll call a \"hands-off\" philosophy when it came to what others said about them online. That is, if customers left positive comments on a discussion board or in a blog post, great. If they left negative comments, so be it. They've come to expect it.\nHowever, news companies now own more editorial content than ever before. In this new world order, where content is king and everyone is competing with everyone else, it's important to take control of what is being said about your brand. I think it's important for companies to take an active role with regard to customer interaction, particularly given the fact that the comments online reflect on the company as a whole. Some of those comments are positive, and some are not.\nIf those comments are not positive, the news company must step in. It is a brand issue, after all. Some may call that editorial interference. Whatever it is, I think news companies need to be very active with what is being said about their sites and content.\nThat being said, there are some things that should not be addressed in a discussion. These are things that fall under legal requirements. If customer complaints are coming in to the company that the site is not ADA compliant, then there is a legal obligation there, and the news company has no choice but to react. It should be noted, however, that if the site were to be removed from the Web, there would be a problem with that.\nThe same holds true if there were any legal or regulatory issues. If there were reports that the site was having issues with child pornography or any similar type of regulated material, or that it were part of a botnet network, it likely should be removed from the Web. There could be a number of legal reasons why content needs to be removed from this or any other Web site regardless of what the news organization did or didn't do.\nThere is a difference between a legal issue and other issues. If people are complaining that they can't find the site, or that the site is going down, or that it doesn't have its own domain, that is a business issue. But the question becomes whether it is an issue with the news organization because in actuality, the news organization operates under the law that the entire content would be part of the liability of the business itself.\nThe liability for content from a reader's standpoint versus the liability of the news organization for content should be clearly defined and made very understandable to all. If content is part of the public record, then it's the public record of that business, not of the individual. As such, whatever was done, if anything, in the content should be clearly defined and clearly indicated.\nSome liabilities could come from the way the content was presented. That is a liability for the business, but could also constitute illegal advertising. This is an example of content that should be removed as quickly as possible because the news organization does not want the reader to be misled into believing that the website belongs to a particular news organization. If there was a way that a site could be taken down immediately with what would be perceived to be a high degree of authority and integrity to the consumer, that would be a better option. I think a lot of these issues could be resolved by clearly indicating that the site is owned by the news organization and not the reader.\nNews organizations take a hands-off approach and leave it to the reader on that kind of issue. It's just too big for someone to be able to manage at this point. If that is the case, news organizations must be explicit about that. The reader may still have that issue, but at least there is a line in the sand and that line in the sand is the responsibility the news organization has or the liability the news organization has, and that would have to be spelled out.\nThe business issue is different than the legal issue. If the business is to get sued for its own behavior, then that would be the responsibility of the reader. The news organization doesn't want to be responsible for what the reader does, nor does it want to take responsibility for content that it has no control over.\nNews organizations need to take responsibility for what is being said on their sites. If a reader complains, it doesn't matter if anyone takes responsibility for what is said. The news organization will be blamed for the content. If a reader comments, if the content is related to content that the news organization was responsible for, the news organization has an obligation to make a stand.\nI don't", "The President shall designate and direct the Secretary of\nInterior to prepare and submit to each House of Congress,\nsimultaneously on or before February 10, 1974, the following\nreport entitled \"A BILLION FOR A DAY\".\nREPRESENTATION BY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND STATES\nThe President shall prepare and submit to each House of\nCongress a report entitled \"A BILLION FOR A DAY\" which\nshall present a detailed analysis of the funds currently\nreceived by the general taxpayers and paid out by Federal\nagencies for services and goods purchased therefrom.

This rule makes\nchanges to streamline EIA's systems of records that would reduce burden\non parties that do business with the EIA. The EIA will also make\nsubstantial minor changes to simplify the language.\nDATES: This rule became effective on July 24, 2007.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Matthew L. Jorgenson, EIA, Office of\nthe Chief Information Officer, Mail Stop 1I.05D, DOE Headquarters, 1000\nIndependence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. E-mail: [email\u00a0protected] The\nEIA maintains a collection of records in several systems about\nindividuals and entities that do business with or are otherwise\naffiliated with the EIA, its various operating offices, and its\nsubsidiaries. This rule makes changes and adds requirements to the\nfollowing systems of records: ``Records in EIA's Electronic Access\nSystem'' and ``Records in the EIA Staff Member and Executive\nRecords System.'' The EIA will also make substantial minor changes to\nsimplify the language to ensure that the regulations conform to new\nThis rule: (1) Incorporates Executive Order 13524, issued November 1,\n2007, into all of EIA's systems of records; (2) identifies the Privacy Act\nroutine uses in all systems of records; (3) incorporates new and\nrevised routine use categories in EIA's systems of records; (4) removes\na routine use from some systems of records; (5) adds a new system of\nrecords; (6) and makes substantial minor changes to language in the\nnotice to the systems of records.\nExecutive Order 13524, issued November 1, 2007, requires agencies to\ndevelop a plan for implementing the provisions of the Privacy Act of\n1974, to be presented to the President within 120 days of its issuance.\nIn response to this Executive Order, EIA will streamline and simplify\nthe language in the following five of its systems of records to conform\nthem to the statutory requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974. This\nrule removes provisions in the system of records titled ``Records\nRelating to Staff and Office of the Administrator (Admn) Records'' that\nare not in compliance with the Privacy Act. Specifically, this rule:\n(1) Removes section (c)(3)(ii) of the system of records. This\nprovision, which requires written consent to share an individual's\npersonally identifiable information (PII) with any other federal agency\nor a private individual, has become outdated technology. Eighteen years\nlater, EIA has implemented systems that use more modern technology. The\nrestriction of providing information to other federal agencies is\nalready a requirement in a section of the current system of records which\nis consistent with regulations promulgated under the Privacy Act.\nTherefore, this portion of the system of records can be removed as not\nusefully implemented. EIA will be updating this section of the system.\n(2) Removes Section (c)(3) (viii) of EIA's system of records on the\n``Use and Disclosure of Records by Third Parties.'' This section provides\nspecific authorization to use or disclose an individual's information\nwithout the individual's consent or knowledge in some situations.\nHowever, when the system of records was established in 1978, third\nparties were being more tightly controlled. Accordingly, this provision,\nalthough remaining in the system and now incorporated as a Privacy Act\nroutine use, is inconsistent with the current approach. This provision\nwill be removed from the system. As is routine in this system, this will\nbe updated as appropriate. In addition, the Privacy Act routine uses\nassociated with this system of records will be revised to comply with\nExecutive Order 13524, consistent with the EIA's plan. For those who\nrequest that another federal department or agency share their\npersonally identifiable information, EIA will remove those provisions\nand create a new Privacy Act routine use providing that information may\nbe so shared.\n(3) Adds two new Privacy Act routine uses to the system titled\n``Rec", "The OMB\n1. The Information Request\nThe Commission is requesting an extension of the comment period\nto solicit additional public comment on the OMBO 138 report which was\nissued in late February, 2013 concerning the Commission's\ndetermination of the market power of ACC under Section 2 of the\nSherman Act. The extension of this comment period is requested by\nthe Commission following publication of the OMBO report and recent\ncongressional inquiries concerning market power issues at ACC.\nCongress recently requested that the Commission complete an\nanalysis of the OMBO's market power determination, and ACC recently\nsent a letter to Congress questioning the OMBO report.\nIt would not be advantageous to the Commission to delay the\nanticipated August vote on the ACC/Energy Services market power\nproceeding until after the end of the comment period, given the\nshort lead time for publication of OMBO reports. Therefore, an\nextension of the comment period is needed until after the vote on\nthe ACC/Energy Services Report by the Commission.\n2. The Applicant\nThe Commission is not objecting to a 30-day extension of the\ncomment period. The Commission believes that any potential\nprejudice could be avoided with a brief extension of the comment\nperiod to make the comments complete and final before the vote of\nthe Commission on the ACC/Energy Services report.\n3. The Need for an Extension of the Comment Period\nThe need for an extension of the comment period in order to have\na fully developed record concerning the issues under examination in\nthe market power proceedings is a strong basis to grant an extension\nof the comment period. The Commission's OMBO prepares formal and\ncomplete reports to resolve legal controversies and to resolve\ninteragency disputes which raise legal questions, and those reports\nare of considerable interest to Congress. Further, the OMBO reports\nare the basis for subsequent action by Congress or another federal\nagency, and therefore, the OMBO reports are often of considerable\nimportance to members of the public and their attorneys. The\npurpose of the OMBO reports is to provide Congress and federal\nagencies with reports of investigations conducted for their use when\nthey deal with legal questions about agency action and the conduct\nby private parties of business which is under congressional and\nfederal agency review and control. Moreover, in the period since the\nOMB report on market power at ACC was issued, Congress has asked the\nCommission to respond to questions about certain aspects of the\nCommission's market power analysis as presented in the OMBO report.\nTherefore, it is important that the OMBO report be available to\ncommenters for any future Congressional inquiries. Moreover, the\nCommission has asked public comment on the OMBO report, which would\nbe unnecessary if the comment period has ended. A postponement of the\ncomment period until after the Commission takes action on the\nOMBO market power report could result in confusion by the public as\nto the Commission's intended action.\nThe Commission believes that the public interest is better\nserved by allowing an extension of the comment period in order to\naccrete to the record all public comment on the legal issues raised\nby the OMB market power report. Comments on other issues concerning\nACC, including other issues regarding the competitive structure of\ngas markets are not considered part of the market power proceedings.\nTherefore, those other issues are not the basis for requesting an\nextension of the comment period. The Commission is not objecting to a\n30-day extension of the comment period on these issues.\n5.

The Tastemakers' Guide to Wine is the\nfirst of several books that Taste will publish.\nTaste Magazine:\nTaste Magazine, the latest entry in the lifestyle/\nluxury magazine category,  debuted  in  September.\nLaunched with the mission of helping consumers make\nwiser buying decisions,  it  is designed to complement such consumer\npublications  as  Consumer   Reports,   Women's  Day,   and  Parents.\nTaste  was  launched  in  a  unique  format,  allowing  readers  to\nnavigate from one section to the next through the use of an online\nmenu.   The  publication's editors promise to guide the reader along\nwith each issue through its sections that include: Beauty, Food,\nTaste's marketing objective is to attract one million\nsubscribers by the end of the third year.  By the end of its second\nyear,   Taste plans to publish 22 issues including one dedicated to\nwine and one to cars.\nAs in traditional print media, the Taste brand\nwill be extended on the Internet.  In November, Taste plans to\nintroduce www.tastemag.com for Internet users who do not have easy\naccess to the magazine.  Taste is planning 16 Internet sites in the\nnear future,  each of which will be a collection of consumer information\nfrom its magazine and online.\nTo launch Taste,   Meredith  Corporation,  owner of the Taste\nname, made a $5 million investment in the magazine,  spending $2\nmillion on advertising.  Taste also plans to spend between $400,000\nand $500,000 on promotions.   Average  circulation of  this bi-monthly,\n128-page publication was 150,000 in September and 54,000 in October.\nLess than half the pages included advertising,   which helped keep\nthe cost of advertising to $27,140 for a full-page color ad for four\nmonths (Barter & Gerzema  \"The  Future of  Media:  Print  Redefined\" \n1,852 words).  Taste claims that its circulation is about 120,000,\nalthough that number is difficult to confirm.\nIn the future,  Taste plans to expand to Canada,\nEurope, and Japan.   It will be available in 56 of the 58 United\nStates,   including  those where Meredith does not have a magazine\ncurrently.   With the help of Meredith's National Publisher of\nRetirement Living, Taste is also being distributed free with the\nOctober  issue of the company's American Retirement magazine to\na 45,000-copy  run at senior housing communities in 50 cities.\nEditor-in-Chief  and   President  Tory  Schmidt   said\nTaste's   \"focus   on  information  was designed to be of high\nquality.  We've  designed the magazine to help customers make smart\nbuying decisions.\"   Executive Editor  Carolyn  Lamm,  former\nExecutive Editor of Women's Day and former Senior Editor of Parents,\nsaid  \"Taste   Magazine   will  be  a  unique   publication   that\ndelivers  quality  editorial  in  a  compact,  appealing  package.\"\nJ.J.  McRae, Vice President/Group Publisher of Meredith\nCorporation,  said \"the magazine fills a niche by giving consumers\ninformation  they  want  and  need  all  delivered  in  a convenient\nmagazine.\"  McRae believes the magazine will appeal to a\nmystery shopper at a Meredith Corp. division,  the magazine\nis  published   in   a  sleek,   contemporary  magazine\nformat rather than a traditional newspaper format.

On June 17, 2006, a pregnant, diabetic, 21-year-old college student called 911 to report that she was going into labor and needed an ambulance. The dispatcher asked whether the student\u2019s boyfriend was with her. She said he was not, but he would be \u201chere quickly.\u201d\nThe emergency paramedics arrived at the student\u2019s apartment and found her in the bathroom \u2013 on her back on the cold tile floor, laboring and bleeding. The female EMT went to work trying to keep the student comfortable, while two male EMTs began an extensive search of the apartment.\nThey finally located the 18-year-old boyfriend crouching in a corner of the small apartment and asked why he was there. He replied that it was because the girl\u2019s mother was in the hospital. She\u2019d had a stroke. A large one.\nThey asked him to leave, that everything was under control. He said he was leaving.\nLater, prosecutors would play audio of his response in court. The boyfriend told the investigators he was about to leave the apartment when he heard frantic calls for help. But, he explained, in his confusion, he found he wasn\u2019t leaving at all. The paramedics and the girl\u2019s mother were still there.\nHe told them that he panicked and ran to his room. While in the other room, he heard a guttural sound come from the bathroom. It\u2019s unclear whether this was the girl\u2019s gasping or the boy\u2019s scream of terror. He says he looked out the peephole and saw the girl\u2019s body on the floor.\nHer mother and boyfriend had been holding her head in position to catch the child\u2019s arm until the delivery and placement of the umbilical cord. They\u2019d been trying to keep the child\u2019s body raised so the child\u2019s lungs could still take a breath. But the baby boy was already dead.\nA few days later, the body was put in a body bag and left on the doorstep of the apartment where she lived with her boyfriend. There was no funeral. She was buried in an unmarked grave.\nAlmost a year later, prosecutors charged the woman who had been in labor with second degree murder. They\u2019d found that the victim\u2019s blood type matched the woman\u2019s blood type. The woman had no explanation that made sense. She\u2019d left behind a 10-year-old daughter, and the woman didn\u2019t deny the child born into this world was hers.\nBut what was the cause of death? Was it the umbilical cord coming out the wrong way? Was it the mother\u2019s insulin and her diabetes? Was it the result of the mother\u2019s failure to care for herself? There was no doubt that the mother had failed to properly provide for this woman\u2019s unborn child, but what other mistakes did she make?\nThe state\u2019s medical examiners had performed more than 25 different tests on the woman, but had never found any pathology or toxicology that would have caused the child to die. In February 2008, the jury voted to convict, and she was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\nThe editorial in the Kansas City Star was titled: \u201cKilling with birth.\u201d It said that justice had been served by \u201cthe jury\u2019s ruling that Melissa Drexler is a murderer.\u201d This was a difficult case to prove. It\u2019s even more difficult to win an acquittal. The case was hard to explain in simple terms, and even harder to try. But the Kansas City paper was confident that it had reached the right conclusion. And with that, it moved on with its editorial.\nThe judge scheduled a hearing for March 16, 2011, for the possible release of Melissa Drexler, who had been imprisoned for seven and a half years, the maximum possible sentence for her crime plus good time and early release for good behavior.\nThe hearing had a subtitle: \u201cIs imprisoning a mother to death for the death of her fetus", "I love how a few things like the perfect light and an unexpected image can make all the difference in the world. And I hate the hours and hours that go into producing a photo. I'm sure this will go nowhere -- no one knows who I am -- but so what, I still want to document it and share it.\nFollow up on the recent photo post. I'm actually still working on it, though I probably will forget about it by the end of the summer. I'm talking with my friend Chris Epplett about it, as he has some great ideas. He has also helped to make me feel less intimidated by this project; just by being aware of it and encouraging me to keep going. It's really been a great help.\nI've also been looking at some other books on photo projects; books that attempt to distill the history of documentary photography. Some stuff, like the Aperture anthology called \"Photo Documents\" is actually really pretty lame. But others are fantastic. I just went to our nearby library to check out \"Photography and American Culture\" by Richard Bolton (1990). I've flipped through it a few times. The idea is to reconstruct the history of documentary photography, starting with the earliest photos onward, so that it is in some sense an overview of American culture and how it was represented. The premise is fantastic but the execution is spotty. In the early chapters, the author seems more interested in explaining documentary techniques than in looking at the content of the photos themselves or even how the photos were viewed by the public. Still, the book has a great deal of interesting information, such as the historical role and location of the photograph in the 1850s and 1860s. The author claims that these first pictures were seen almost exactly as we see them today; as representations of reality in its most basic form. But at the same time, the idea of realism could just as easily be considered a hallucination, or at least a misplaced illusion.\nWhat's strange to me is the photograph itself, viewed by early Americans. The first time most Americans saw an image from a camera, it must have looked pretty incredible. This was a time before motion study, animation and television. Many people had never even seen live theater before, and pictures as they existed before the 1850s were almost as fascinating as they were eerie and mysterious. In fact, some of them were downright eerie and mysterious. You could take a picture of almost anything, and it would look different every time, as the sun played havoc with the paper and the lens. The picture came with uncertainty.\nAt the same time, the photograph was a lot like the movies; something that, while it had more power of immediacy than theater, was still subject to the same tricks of artifice, theatricality and manipulation. The earliest photographers in America, both amateur and professional alike, were not at all above bending the truth, adjusting and retouching the negative, in order to create dramatic artwork that could be hung and hung; that could impress the viewer. Later on of course it was the professional who did many of these things, and this was when advertising photography really took off in a big way, and with that came the idea that the photograph was something that could be staged, that the image could be manipulated and controlled and turned into something else. And that was the image it left, almost like a movie, in the mind of the viewer.\nAs images were reproduced and put in cheap books and magazines, they were also viewed in the same way as other printed media -- as illustrations, or even propaganda, to a certain extent. And the photograph was just another means of illustration, just like anything else. But it didn't have much of a voice. And the idea of manipulation continued. For example, the first daguerreotypes were extremely lifelike and the public was so amazed at the ability of the camera not to lie; at the image that didn't need to be manipulated with makeup or props. The first daguerreotypes were almost always portraits. But once portraits became commonplace, the public began to see the daguerreotype with an artist's eye, as a thing of beauty, a medium, a way of expression. And so the photo as expression became more and more the norm, and one of my heroes in this story is the photographer Matthew Brady.\nBrady was a pioneer of the photo album; of showing people a visual picture of what they were experiencing first hand and putting their own experience", "Talbott County  \nMarch 17, 2005  \n4:25 p.m.\nIT'S TIRED TO DIE THOUGH NO ONE IS LOOKING; IT'S TIRED TO DIE AND NO ONE'S AROUND.

And what ML actually means for those of us in the industry is that the world suddenly isn\u2019t enough to go after for publishers anymore.\n\u201cMaking sense of content\u201d to provide a positive and valuable user journey to our readers is now a reality and one that is fast being commercialized, even by those who didn\u2019t have the foresight or ability to look beyond traditional routes to success.\nAt my company\u2019s recent European Summit, one of the big lessons that I think many in the industry need to take to heart is that publishers can no longer just assume that they know the best way for a solution to be implemented on their platform.\nAs much as publishers may talk about the importance of data and technology, not all of us may have the ability to actually take the step to the next stage and realize that it\u2019s not just enough to buy the next tech-based solution. The future is all about partnerships and working with the best people to make sense of technology in a way that makes sense to the reader.\nEarlier in the year, the Financial Times set up a newsroom experiment that allowed the paper to publish stories in a variety of creative formats. Not only did the content perform better than the traditional formats, but the story format changed every three to seven days. The FT was able to do this by working with a technology partner to leverage ML.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to just license this technology. It had to be deployed in a specific way to be able to unlock the potential for readers. The story format that changed each week was not something the FT knew how to do in-house.\nWe know we need to look to new technologies to help solve problems that our own companies may not have the means, capability, or even understanding of how to unlock at the moment. We also have to learn to be okay with that.\nYes, we have to be smart about where we go and who we partner with, but we also need to focus on working with businesses that share our values and that can deliver technology in a way that enhances the reader experience. Otherwise, we shouldn\u2019t be doing deals with them.\nAs things move on at a rapid rate, publishers have to evolve and so that might mean we have to leave things we have been doing for 100 years behind us and go elsewhere. Maybe our model has to change, or we learn to partner with the right people so technological advancements don\u2019t create a digital gulf between us and our audience.\nIn a way, the news industry has been late to the game when it comes to looking for new technology solutions.\nNow we have a choice to make with the technology that is becoming available. It is a choice of whether we will be willing to do things in ways that our competition were unwilling to do or whether we want to simply wait for somebody else to come along and tell us we need to make a change.\nOur audiences aren\u2019t going to wait, and in a world that has been digitally enabled, it is probably time we started looking at technological solutions in a more holistic way, or accept that we will become part of the background scenery as things progress.\nTo become immobile is to become irrelevant.\nTo find out more, please visit www.newsroommedia.com\nPREV IAB and Tumblr Hosts \u201cFourth Annual IAB NewFronts\u201d for Video Advertisers in New York NEXT Nielsen: Programmatic Ad Spend to Nearly Double by 2020", "A study by researchers at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business has found that those who follow their passions find their most success.\nJamie Holderby, a clinical professor of\nmarketing at the Sauder School of Business, who led the study, explained the concept behind it. \u201cWhen we talk about \u2018being passional,\u2019 we mean \u2018being purposeful\u2019 in terms of following one\u2019s passions, which is a concept that we and others before us have taken to mean \u2018knowing what you want and going after it\u2019 or \u2018doing what you are passionate about,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2018being passionate\u2019 also means getting energized from what you are doing and being committed to it to the point of \u2018being all in\u2019 and giving it your all.\u201d  While it\u2019s unclear whether passion is a prerequisite, it\u2019s widely accepted as an advantage. According to Holderby, it\u2019s also a trait with which people most associated. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that it came out first in the results,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause people know a lot more about \u2018being passionate\u2019 than, say, \u2018being ambitious\u2019.\u201d\nThe study found that \u201cbeing passionate\u201d is the most common personality trait found in achievers, but the research went further, analyzing which characteristics define the achievement. According to a press release from Sauder, the study also identified that achievers share a number of other personality traits which, in addition to \u201cbeing passionate,\u201d make up the \u201cbeing an achiever\u201d package. They include: being ambitious; being self-actualized; being self-aware; being self-directed; being resilient; and being courageous.\nThose who follow their passions, the study notes, are \u201cmore likely to be self-aware, direct and hardworking,\u201d but also have a \u201chigher percentage of achievers.\u201d  They know when to pursue their passions, they \u201cwork the problem,\u201d and they \u201clearn to persevere\u201d and \u201clearn to adapt\u201d to changing circumstances.\nPassionate people take action, follow their impulses, and seize opportunities. \u201cSo, yes, people who follow their passions and can act on them are more likely to be what we are calling being an achiever,\u201d said Holderby, \u201cbut all of these personality traits are what it takes for people to be effective achievers.\u201d\nThe study also found, however, that the results of the personality traits of being \u201cself-actualized\u201d and having \u201cbeing a resilient and courageous\u201d were \u201cmore than twice as powerful as any of the other personality traits at predicting being an achiever.\u201d\nHolderby said self-knowledge is necessary for success. \u201cKnow thyself, and become what you are,\u201d he quoted Plato.  \u201cDoing what we are naturally suited to do makes us both happier and more productive.\u201d  For self-aware people, he explained, working on being \u201cself-actualized\u201d by understanding their own skills and motivations, and working on \u201cself-efficacy\u201d to strengthen their own belief in themselves, are worth it. He added that the key traits of \u201cbeing an achiever\u201d\u2014namely, ambition and self-efficacy\u2014help people to \u201csee an opportunity and seize it.\u201d For achievers, the process is a three-step process. \u201cThere needs to be a passionate commitment to a worthwhile goal that they care about,\u201d Holderby said, adding that achievers will be guided by purpose and work hard on a goal that they deem valuable and important.\n\u201cAn important personality skill for achievers is self-awareness,\u201d Holderby continued. \u201cEspecially for self-actualized achievers, to know the skills and motivations they naturally bring to an endeavour allows them to see opportunities and seize them and get better at that particular skill, get better at that particular endeavour, or just be more successful generally.\u201d\nA key point Holderby tried to make was that passion is not the only determinant of \u201cbeing an achiever.\u201d  Those who are self-aware have a higher likelihood of success, he explained, and they are better able to navigate their way through their own personalities. \u201cThe skill to be a human being is every bit as important as having the personality to do what you want to do,\u201d he said.\nWhat is Passion, anyway?\nAccording to an article by Forbes, people have been debating about \u201cpassion\u201d for over 2,000 years.

There is a clarity about the music that also reveals the\nplayers. Their voices move from rich and full as they sing in\nharmony to clear and strong as they sing in turn, each one having\nthe power to thrill the crowd alone. The music is as full, alive\nThe performance is also full of surprises.

Their machine learning-driven solutions covered topics such as audience management, audience targeting, and audience development. Publishers want to reach their readers more effectively, and machine learning appears to be an increasingly important tool for doing so.\nThe New York Times\u2019 JP Cauvet, global creative technology manager for The Times, said machine learning is a great tool for audience engagement and audience management. He highlighted the company\u2019s use case for its newsletter app, Topic. The publisher uses the technology for audience targeting, audience management, and audience engagement.\nWhen it comes to audience development, The Times uses machine learning to reach individuals who are known and unknown to them. The company uses machine learning in a three-phase approach:\nTo increase readership of known or known-in-the-abstract readers via the Topic app. When readers access a topic they\u2019re interested in, such as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d machine learning provides The Times with a profile of people likely to enjoy that topic and delivers personalized content from The Times and outside publishers. When users first access the Topic app, they are asked if they are regular Times readers \u2014 the machine learning-fueled algorithm will serve them personalized content. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is create loyal audiences for topics,\u201d Cauvet said.\nTo identify and serve people who may be \u201cknown abstractly,\u201d but not known to The Times. Cauvet explained that machine learning provides the technology, the company, and their audience with a better understanding. He noted that this knowledge gives The Times \u201cconfidence\u201d in the readers and content they serve.\nTo identify users who are potentially unknown in order to \u201cextend the tent to an unknown audience.\u201d The Times uses machine learning to test the waters and experiment with ways to expand their readership base. \u201cIf you just do segmentation and traditional marketing, your market gets more and more small as you go along,\u201d Cauvet said. \u201cMachine learning allows you to put a product out \u2026 to an audience that you do not currently know.\u201d\nHearst Digital Media\u2019s Matt Sherman, director of audience and content strategy, discussed machine learning\u2019s role for Hearst Digital Media in providing readers with more relevant content. The publisher wants to understand who their audiences are and understand them better. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a massive data lake and we don\u2019t have a massive audience,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a massive tech team, but we have the resources to implement advanced analytics.\u201d\nAccording to Sherman, the company does have three data sets they can use to help them target audiences. Audience behavior data help them to understand what they\u2019ve already bought, what they\u2019ve already read, and what they have previously bought or read. The other two data sets are external data sets: first-party data and paid data.\nMatt Sherman, director of audience and content strategy at Hearst Digital Media.\nSource: Digital Publisher Summit\nFirst-party data refers to a publisher\u2019s data, i.e. email data. \u201cI\u2019ve opened an email, I\u2019ve watched a piece of content \u2014 that\u2019s my data,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cFor a long time there was this notion that advertisers, marketers, publishers, that we didn\u2019t know a lot about our consumers.\u201d\nBut \u201cconsumers have always wanted to connect with brands that they\u2019re interested in \u2014 either with digital products or with services,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have incredible data sets where people are opening emails, watching content, and doing different kinds of things online.\u201d\nSherman also discussed the Hearst Digital Media\u2019s use of third-party advertising platforms to target publishers\u2019 audiences where necessary. Using those services allows the company to reach beyond its data sets \u2014 third-party data sets \u2014 and reach audiences who might not have expressed interest in a topic or topic area Hearst Digital Media already targets.\nThe third data set is paid access data. If a reader has paid access to a publisher\u2019s site, the analytics behind the paywall tell publishers a great deal about the individual visitor. \u201cIf you\u2019ve paid, we know exactly when, what you\u2019re reading, what you\u2019", "How to get your kids to think twice before doing something they'll regret.\nWhat follows is my best effort at a \"how-to\" on teaching your children about values and behavior.\nThe topic of my talk last time concerned your personal values, and you can use the same approach for teaching your kids.

There is a difference between sathya and the term svatanthra (that is, what is good, is right or proper). For that matter, the term svatanthra itself has a great number of meanings attached to it. In the Hatha Yoga section in Chapter 6 of Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Yoga Vasihta (the book of discipline), this basic distinction between sathya and svatantha is explained in great detail. This brief article is aimed at providing people with a broad overview and basic understanding of what sathya entails.\nSUMMARY OF THIS ARTICLE:\nSathya literally means truth. This word itself is derived from the Sanskrit word sathya. The term sathya is most frequently used in conjunction with the three other terms discussed in this section, called dharma, artha and kama. These 4 terms, dharma, artha, kama, and sathya, are often referred to in Sanskrit as the four purusharthas or goals in life. Sathya literally means truth, and sathya is defined as the characteristic of being truth itself. It is the ability to stay truthful to one's self and remain true to oneself at all times. Sri Sathya Sai Baba has emphasized repeatedly that the basis of Sathya Sathya, or Truth, is the most important of the purusharthas (goals) in life. In his discourses, when he speaks of sathya, he is often referring to the word in its literal sense. In many instances, Sathya Sai Baba takes the word in the sense of truth, with a very strong emphasis on being truthful to oneself all the time, and on the other hand, being in constant conflict with one's self-will, by resisting any temptation to indulge in any sort of indulgence in the senses and the ego.\nAccording to the teachings of many great spiritual masters throughout the history of the world, the first step on the path to God is self-control. This self-control includes overcoming lust, greed, sensual desires, and resisting in a mighty way, one's ego and the will of the soul, and staying truthful to oneself at all times, which includes also truthfulness to others. This self-restraint and sathya, or truthfulness, is practiced by great saints and siddhas throughout the ages, for it is from the restraint of one's senses and the ego, through the practice of truthfulness in one's conduct and thought, speech and conduct, that one develops true spirituality and greatness in one's life. Once a person becomes a master in overcoming the ego or sensual temptations, only then does a person become perfect in restraint, which is known to the spiritual masters as swadharma, or correct conduct, in relation to sathya, or the characteristic of truthfulness. This restraint, or mastery over the ego, is called maitri or unconditional love, in Hinduism. Love, which originates from the ego, must be transcended, to be mastered and controlled on the spiritual path. This restraint and mastery over the senses and the ego is a very important step in one's march towards spirituality, self-realization and God-realization. Sathya, or truthfulness at all times, involves inwardly and inwardly constantly restraining one's senses and resisting temptation to indulge in sensual desires and thereby acting as a master over the actions of the ego, which are the cause and the result of the mind's desires, lusts, and passions. In a broader and more expanded sense, sathya involves constantly resisting the temptation of indulging in sensual pleasures and the ego's desire for wealth, fame, happiness and pleasure, which are the major obstacles to inner peace, love for others, compassion, and the path of enlightenment, or jnana.\nMany spiritual masters throughout the ages have emphasized the role of the mind or the senses in the process of achieving the realization of the self or God. According to the teachings of these spiritual masters, a person must resist lust, desire for wealth, worldly comforts, fame and pleasure", "\"Innovative companies are re-thinking 'how' we consume information.

Although this story comes from the consumer product world, I think it also applies to the B2B world (the business-to-business world of industrial products).\nAnna worked for a major consumer packaged items (CPI) company some years back as a strategist. The company hired her because she had a particular skill or expertise, if I remember correctly, in the area of branding. The company's marketing research division had just conducted a deep dive into the category (one of the most lucrative categories in CPI), and they had discovered something surprising in their research, which we'll get to later. Anna's mission was to identify ways to capitalize on the information the research had revealed.\nHer research uncovered a series of findings that changed how the company thought about its marketing activities and led the company to change its direction in terms of which consumers it targeted as well as which product segments it targeted to grow as part of its overall brand strategy. But first, let me say that Anna's deep dive into the category uncovered two rather surprising yet very valuable discoveries.\nThe first was that the company was focusing very heavily on what consumers valued in this category. The company had conducted dozens of focus groups, asked consumers to write down their values, and even set up a series of websites and online blogs to get feedback from consumers. All of this was done in an effort to determine what consumers valued about the category, and what they did not.\nThe company then used that information to develop its next product line extension or innovation in the category. And that's what it did\u2014it developed new products based on what key stakeholders (the consumers) said they wanted to see in the category.\nThe problem with the deep dive, however, was that even though the company had discovered what consumers valued, Anna's deep dive also discovered something quite different. Something that the market", "Making the case for the digital marketing toolbox\nA successful editorial operation of today can't just have a solid editorial strategy and strong digital marketing team, but a robust marketing strategy supported by all departments throughout the company, including the sales team. I'll offer some key suggestions from my own experience and from the latest news coming from the advertising and marketing world. The days are gone when editors could claim they were simply in the news \"business.\"\nDigital marketing as a function is more important to the overall company than ever, and it needs the support from the top down. Digital marketing requires a \"marketing first\" mindset, but we're finding these days that some organizations have a digital mindset first -- even though they may be struggling.\nHere's what I think is needed for a successful news organization of today:\n-- A leader who can clearly communicate the company's mission from a marketing point of view, from both a short- and long-term view.\n-- A \"marketing\" strategy that outlines what the company stands for and what product the company provides (news, community information, classifieds, etc.)\n-- A \"digital marketing\" strategy that outlines what types of marketing are required to keep a loyal audience and acquire new ones\n-- Team members who focus on the end goals of selling the reader experience, engaging the reader, serving the reader or simply making the reader feel good\n-- A \"marcom\" organization that thinks holistically, where the marketing team truly thinks like a sales team, and where the online editorial team thinks like a marketing team\n-- A \"communications\" organization that supports all of this by sharing information about the mission and goals throughout the organization and with the company's shareholders\n-- A leadership style that encourages innovation and risk-taking\n-- A culture where good storytelling is encouraged, rewarded and supported where necessary.\n-- A culture that is flexible enough to adopt new tools, concepts, technologies and strategies when necessary.\nHere are some ideas from other sites about making the case for digital marketing, and how digital marketing has to be a part of the newspaper's mission statement:\n-- Adweek: \"There was something audacious and even naive about a print publication trying to connect with readers online...The truth is that the news business has been very slow to grapple with the technology and marketing challenges of online. This is in large part because few editors and publishers realized the importance of digital marketing until very recently...But as the economic situation has worsened...and more publications are cutting back on newsroom jobs, it's become more important than ever to generate demand.\"\n-- TechCrunch: \"All publishers have been at this point before: The revenue models that worked in the past stop working; there simply are not enough classified ads to make ends meet; there is pressure throughout the company to cut costs to stay profitable. They usually wind up taking an editorial retreat -- making cuts to staff and expenses in an effort to become lean and mean again. The hope then, if it can be justified, is that they'll be able to reemerge into the marketplace in a more profitable position.\" (I hate this post, but love its title -- the writer, Evelyn Rusli, explains how the Wall Street Journal has cut back to a leaner model).\n-- The Economist: \"If nothing else, Mr. Bezos (who also owns the Washington Post) has managed to get Amazon, which employs fewer than 5,000 people today, to start thinking more like a media company than it used to\"\n-- Adweek: \"As newspapers continue to slash newsroom and production costs, they are cutting into their ability to produce, report and cover news in a way that competes with their free-wheeling digital competitors. \"The digital marketing function needs to be fully engaged from the start of every editorial assignment to drive the desired audience experience to the desired media product,\" said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief digital strategist at Publicis Groupe.\"\n-- The Atlantic: \"In the long run, we will be defined by our ability to compete in an environment where new products are introduced on a daily basis and new business models are launched on a monthly basis. The traditional media business strategy of developing assets and then extracting revenue from them at a pace incommensurate with the pace of market changes is going to be challenged, at best, and will be obsolete in a few years. The new business model for newspaper companies, broadcasters, book publishers and magazine publishers will be centered around rapidly developing assets, quickly monetizing them", "In a time of diminishing advertising return for newspaper\nwebsites, and with the explosion of Web 2.0 and user-supplied media,\nnewspaper journalists are well positioned to extend their reach into a\nbroader array of channels, including podcasts, online multimedia,\nand a range of other user-generated content. They not only have the\nskills and the know-how to generate this content, but they also\nhave a unique set of skills that allow them to manage and maintain\ndigital content and integrate it with editorial content.\nToday these tools are being offered for free to those who could not\nprioritize such an expenditure in their budget, including individuals,\nsmall to midsize companies, and even non-profits and government\nagencies. In some cases, individual journalists have stepped up to\nthe challenge to meet this new demand.\nBut what can be done to harness this new and growing demand?\nPerhaps nothing more than an evolution of the existing business\nmodel.  Companies that have made the transition from being solely an\ninformation provider to a digital service provider have reported\nprofits from a variety of revenue sources. Their methods for\nproviding journalism content have been so innovative that they\nhave redefined the market. It will, however, require taking off the\nrose-colored glasses and a willingness on the part of news organisations to consider the fact that not only is the news an \"industry\" but so too are the\n\"products\" of that news.\nWith the arrival of Web 2.0, the internet has evolved into a platform for content creation, and newspapers have had to adapt to that\nreality.  What better way than to utilize the talents of their\njournalists to create these new products and services?\nIn a survey of top news organisations from December 2005 to\nJanuary 2006, it was found that two-thirds of the organisations reported more than 20 percent growth in website traffic from a year ago, with The\nNew York Times and The Washington Post reporting over 100 percent growth in such traffic1. The survey also revealed a 39 percent\nyear-over-year drop in banner ad revenue from news sites, and\nrevenue from banner ads dropped by 38 percent at The New York\nTimes2.\nAccording to a recent report by eMarketer, online advertising spend\n(excluding search marketing) in the U.S. is projected to grow\n5 percent to reach $16.4 billion this year from $15.5 billion in\n20053. The spending for online advertising for the newspaper\nsegment is expected to be $865 million, a 12.7 percent increase\nfrom last year.4\nNot only have online advertisers failed to generate high\nreturn-on-investments, but they have also continued to divert\nresources away from traditional media budgets for ad space. To\nmeet the needs of the new Web 2.0, newspapers may have to generate\nadditional revenue for the content that readers are eager to access\nthrough new and innovative means. This revenue could come from new\nproducts or services they create, or new ways of presenting their\nexisting content. It would be impossible to provide a blueprint for\nhow to do this. Each news organisation has a different set of\nresources, a different set of needs, and a different set of\nreaderships. But what news organisations should examine closely is\nhow they have successfully achieved such success and what they can\nlearn from each other from that experience.\nOn June 23, 2006 Forbes will premiere its \"Forbes on Podcasting,\"\na weekly podcast.

Those users are active, and engage with content on social media, sharing, tweeting, and posting on more than 300,000 topics every three seconds. Facebook alone is the number one driver of site traffic across news publishers, with 29% of traffic being driven to publisher sites directly from the social ads, reports Parse.ly.\nAccording to Zenith, digital advertising on social channels should reach an estimated 35% share of ad spend by 2019, with 28% share of ad spend spent on search, and 26% on display. While search will still account for the most share of search, social is set to remain the fastest-growing ad platform.\nFor publishers, social offers real value, with the potential to build strong, more direct relationships with more consumers. And that\u2019s where the true power of social lies for publishers \u2014 its potential to allow publishers to form one-on-one connections with people, building relationships and providing custom content.\nWith its billions of data points that allow publishers to see into the lives of their users, LinkedIn is leading the way in using data to offer newsrooms more personalized connections. The company is using its \u201cData Investments\u201d team to transform its news offering from a machine-based product to an intelligent, personalized, humanized experience for its users.\nThis has been driven by the growth of subscriptions \u2014 where it is increasingly becoming crucial to differentiate a publisher\u2019s offer and the content it provides \u2014 and the growth of publishers\u2019 data capabilities to deliver a more personal experience.\nData plays an important role, with more than 400 million members using LinkedIn daily, while publishers have access to their data to understand more about consumers, which helps them form deeper, more meaningful connections with them. Using data as a force that drives consumer engagement is transformational. However, the need for high quality data is crucial to this process, and in order for the newsroom to be effective, it needs to understand this technology.\nPublishing has always been a people business, relying on individuals to select, recommend, and distribute content to the audience. In an industry that has spent the last few years on cost reduction measures, there is a renewed belief in the importance of the human side of news, and the importance of newsrooms.\nThe way that digital advertising is spent should change too \u2014 with greater investments in the right teams for publishers to ensure that this technology, which is so easy to implement, is really harnessed for maximum effect. Newsrooms need to understand that machine learning and data analytics can change the way that editors, journalists, and data scientists interact with each other. Not only will it help them improve the value of the content, but also allows them to have a better understanding of the context and reach of their content. It\u2019s critical that you understand how these tools apply to your own content and your specific audience, and don\u2019t think that there is a one-size-fits-all solution.\nFor example, Facebook and Google are the two major platforms that provide the biggest reach for publishers, but they offer different tools for publishers \u2014 Google helps publishers to create rich content, while Facebook helps build the publishers\u2019 audience. Facebook also has more direct relationships with their users, but Google is the one that has more analytics expertise.\nSocial offers publishers a way to build brand affinity and loyalty, while giving people the opportunity to engage with a publication, and to share the content they like. That should give publishers the tools to make a bigger impact and encourage loyalty.\nFacebook has had 15 years of experience in understanding consumer behavior and understanding what kinds of content people want to consume. With LinkedIn and Twitter, the key is understanding data insights and what kind of content people are interested in.", "Sneak in just enough knowledge to create interest and make your customers want to know more.\nTo some in publishing, a \"native advertising\" story is one that has a \"native\" company -- like the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, or The Washington Post -- as the advertiser.\nBut \"native advertising\" is different from a news organization's sponsored content. In the latter, a corporate entity -- say, American Express, HBO  or Ford Motor Company -- pays for an article to publish on its own website or a media site like the WSJ's Marketplace.\nWhether the article is promoted to the WSJ's audience, however, is completely up to the media organization.\nIf you're just now hearing about native advertising, there's a good reason:\nIt's new. At least as far as the word.\nWhen native advertising really took hold was in April of 2013, when the WSJ ran a piece that discussed a new trend of publishers running sponsored content on their mobile sites, paid for by marketers, including Pepsi, Ford, and Coca-Cola. The article called it a \"native ad.\"\nThe idea for a sponsored article on the native brand's site was born sometime in the mid- to late 2000s, in advertising jargon.\nThese articles were called \"branded content,\" because the brand actually \"owned\" them. They ran on the site of the publisher but had a corporate logo.\nIn July of 2013, the Times ran a sponsored video feature on Facebook that promoted a new fragrance for men.\nBut while there is some debate whether consumers know what they're reading, what everyone does agree on is that native ads perform better -- which is why so many brands are pumping money into them.\nFor every $1 that native advertising costs to make (e.g., the cost of developing video in-house), it brings $6 in value, according to a June 2014 report by the IAB and White Ops, a digital advertising measurement firm.\nWhy Are They In Your News Content?\nBut you're not doing native advertising! You're doing advertorials, and sponsored content!\nNative advertising uses techniques that are actually foundational principles in storytelling.\nSometimes you have to sneak in just the right amount of information. Intrigue your users, but don't tell all of your story in the first five seconds -- that's amateur hour -- and don't tell all of your story in the last five seconds, either. You'll lose momentum.\nWhen developing native content, there are a few rules that publishers and advertisers should follow:\n1. Don't tell consumers that they're reading or watching advertorial content -- they'll ignore it.\nInstead, they have to find the words \"native ad\" in the middle of a story and know to look at it differently.\n2. Tell readers what they want to know, first.\nDon't tell us that you are going to \"cut through our clutter\" or \"informing consumers\" (who really wants that?) -- tell us about our products. Tell us about our services. Tell us about how we can help customers -- what the value is is in the end product.\nYour content should tell a complete story while at the same time giving the reader information about the company.\n3. The more content-like it is, the better.\nThe most successful native advertising stories are stories. There are three aspects to a great native ad: good content, good design, and proper linking.\nTo create content that is most effective, publishers should focus on three things:\n1. Finding an angle that connects to audience interests.\nYour users want to come across a story that they will enjoy reading or watching.\nMost consumers today still read or scan the titles of articles. They may read the headline, a first line or two, look over more headlines on the same page or topic, and then click away for their next page \"visit\" if nothing catches their eye.\nTherefore, it's important for publishers to include an \"angle\" or a \"hook\" in their content.\n2. Creating a story that is compelling enough to keep them reading or viewing the \"story.\"\nIf there are no story elements that intrigue a reader -- i.e., conflict or curiosity -- they will not read on.\n3. Providing readers or viewers with a natural \"end\" to the story.\nThis means that a story that you write should always have an \"ending\" -- one that", "G.J. McCarthy, who wrote the best-seller \"Six Years in Tibet,\" was denied permission to join a 100-person press corps permitted into China to witness the opening of the Winter Olympics by President and former general Jiang Zemin, who is said to have vetoed the author's application, citing his criticism of Chinese policy. The Chinese embassy in London, the British government, and press organizations strongly urged British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to overrule the president. In a bizarre twist, Chinese authorities have since agreed to allow McCarthy into the country upon arrival in Beijing -- but without press credentials and in a group that cannot have any contact with China's foreign reporters.\n\"McCarthy will be permitted into China but will be denied access to official events as he had requested,\" reports the BBC. \"He will travel to Beijing for the Games and leave on the first available flight after them.\"\nMcCarthy said the move was unfair. \"I have always been in favor of openness in my reporting and hope that others will not be discouraged from entering China as a result of this decision,\" he said in a statement.\"\nThe International Federation of Journalists, based in Brussels, says that China's restrictions on western media during the Olympics represent \"the worst ever violations of press freedoms and the right to access to information in the history of modern China.\"", "A person can suffer in a number of ways.

News publishers have not matched this\nrecord and have been struggling to find a similar model for news.\nNews Corp. has done deals with Barnes & Noble and Amazon for \"subscription ebook bundles\" that will include both its books and online content for a monthly fee.\nBut while publishers have recognised the advantages of electronic ink, they are having a hard time coming to terms with revenue and profitability models that work across industries.\nAs a result, ebook strategy remains a major challenge for publishers and booksellers, although the market is moving quickly.\nThis week saw the launch of Google eBooks and the introduction of a new version of the Kindle reader for the first time in two years.\nThere is an opportunity for publishers in the mobile space, as evidenced by the continued popularity of The Guardian for mobiles, but mobile and tablet content can only be a complement to newspaper and magazine print versions, not a replacement.\nFor more on ebooks, go to: http://www.digital-publishing.com/2011/10/news-corp-ebook-publishing-deal-is-just-first-step-for-online-books/\n_._                                                              _._\n(c) 2011 Digital-Publishing.com - The Newspaper and Magazine Publishing Newsletter                       _._    _._\nhttp://www.digital-publishing.com/", "The European Commission (EC) approved a request by Google to block search results in Poland of a commercial website offering discounted flights. The French data protection authority (CNIL) issued an administrative fine of \u20ac150,000 against Google for failing to delete all data collected from its Street View cameras.\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect on 25 May 2018. As you prepare for the May deadline, some important facts on the key articles and the potential fines are included below.\nThe Google search result blocking request was reported in July 2015, when it originally sought approval to block the results. This request was for two flight comparison sites, including:\nSkyscanner.pl.\nGoogle stated the information on the websites could have an impact on the competition rules for the airline industry. Google also argued that Polish law does not allow search engine operators to block search results.\nGoogle\u2019s request was approved by the Polish president on 14 August 2017 because it claimed that the requested blocking interfered with a decision of the Directorate General for Trade (DG Trade). Although the EC decision does not include details on the nature of the specific competition dispute, it seems Google\u2019s request is not new.\nOn 5 December 2017, Google updated its European site search information pages to include the EC intervention.\nThis case is part of an internal dispute with Polish tax authorities, after Google and the Polish authorities signed a tax information exchange agreement in 2010. This agreement allows Google to store payments data in international servers based in Ireland. In 2014, Google Poland filed a complaint arguing that the Polish tax authorities cannot retrieve tax data from Google\u2019s international servers, as the data privacy agreements between Google\u2019s Irish and Polish subsidiaries make it impossible to retrieve tax data.\nThe CNIL is the French regulatory body responsible for privacy and personal data protection issues. The CNIL stated its investigation found that Street View vehicles violated the French Law of 6 January 1978 for Information Technology, Files and Civil Freedoms (ITF and CF Law).\nThe CNIL determined that Google had failed to delete the data collected by the street view vehicles and notified them of its decision on 19 December 2016.

With mobile phones in the growth of Western Europe and North America slowing down, the company announced that global mobile phone growth will come from developing countries, such as India, Indonesia, and China.\nThis is not only driven by the rapid development in India and China, but driven by the fact that people in these countries have less money. A $100 (USD) mobile phone is a large budget item, and one people may not spend, but instead will buy a cheaper but almost as good phone.\nNokia has struggled to keep up with these cheaper handsets made by Chinese firms, such as ZTE and Huawei, as well as Indian company Microman. Nokia\u2019s margins are dropping quickly, while they still enjoy healthy market shares in these countries, although it has to share the market, as well as fight against cheap calls using messaging apps.\nMeanwhile, Nokia says the new business model at Nokia in future will focus on offering customers software rather than hardware, as well as the company will try to make sure that consumers can take advantage of the Internet on any mobile phone, regardless of the manufacturer.\nSo far, Nokia has done a good job at keeping its core customers happy. Since its mobile phone market share has dropped significantly, the company has a large share of its loyal customers, with some of them switching away to cheaper phones.\nNokia has always been a very good company with a highly reliable brand. Because of this, while the company\u2019s share price is around the same as in 1999, I believe there will still be a strong market for the company. Nokia is good for this market and will have a strong future.\nSome analysts say Nokia might have to lower its margins to try to keep up in this changing world. I do not agree. In fact, Nokia does have one clear competitor in this market, one who has not had big margins from the beginning, but has managed to improve its margins and market share in recent years. This is Apple, which has had a very strong start of 2006 with the popular iPod MP3 player.\nAnother strong competitor is Motorola, which has a large market share and a strong brand. Motorola has been successful in the global market, in part because it has had very strong margins, due to its higher prices. The company has had some difficulties in the recent quarters though, due to its high prices and aging design.\nThere is no sign of another company like Nokia today entering the market. One would need a large portfolio of brands, where every model can have good margins, which is not likely for a small start-up. Nokia is one of the few companies that would be able to achieve this, but so far the market has shown Nokia is making the right moves.\nMore important is a change in the mobile phone market itself. I think the big screen trend for mobile phones will grow in the coming years, not necessarily in a new higher size phone.\nMobile TV is a prime example of what is needed. For mobile TV to work, it would require the screen on a mobile phone to be at least as big as a small TV screen. I have personally tested the technology, and it worked very well with an iPhone, iPhone 2, and iRiver MP3. However, as the screen size is not nearly big enough to support mobile TV, it has made me a bit disappointed.\nOther examples on the mobile phone market include Internet browsing, which works much better on a bigger screen. If you buy an iPhone today, you will probably have to wait for software updates of applications, since currently the resolution that is used in the iPhone is far from optimal.\nApple\u2019s iPod is also a good example where a wider screen would mean that consumers would be less able to press the menu button when navigating through applications. The iPod has a nice screen but is too small to use.\nThis would show that a large size but narrow screen are not as advantageous anymore as the smaller screen and broader size that is the trend right now.\nI think mobile phones may even be more successful if manufacturers could make their products a more integral part of our lives.

With demolition and clearance of existing buildings on part of the site, there would be a certain level of impact on the surrounding historic built environment, with some of the remaining buildings having an historical significance. A large area of the former site is open and provides no landscape amenity value or habitat value.\nTrees on the proposed site include predominantly young exotic trees and older native trees, primarily located at the west end of the site and in association with an existing heritage listed dam. The proposed site on the west would accommodate a range of exotic timber trees and scattered young deciduous species.\nThe remaining areas within the site are predominantly natural grassland within the flood plan or low ground. Trees of historical interest are located on the north-east corner of the site, which is located in association with an existing dam. This building has been identified as a contributory heritage structure.\nThe dam is noted as being integral in the development of the area\u2019s history in both the past and present. In relation to the impact of the dam, the locality would be deprived of an amenity resource. However the dam provides habitat for a number of bird species, the most important of which is the threatened Glossy Black Cockatoo.\nThe area would accommodate a number of low-density uses including a quarry, freight facilities, container storage and recycling depot, and waste transfer and processing.\nProposed site and nearby sites.\nThe current industrial site is located directly south-west of the existing suburb of Rochedale. The site is bounded by the Western Freeway at the north, Main Street at the south, and a disused rail reservation at the eastern boundary. The former rail corridor forms the eastern boundary of the Rochedale Industrial Estate. The Rochedale Industrial Estate provides direct access to the Western Freeway, Main Street and Park Road via the rail corridor.\nThere are two main industrial areas within the locality, namely Northside Industrial Estate and the Rochedale Industrial Estate. Both areas are located at a distance from the Brisbane CBD, however there is significant employment and industrial activity in the area due to their close proximity to the Rochedale Industrial Estate. The area is located between Brisbane Airport and the port of Brisbane, while the Rochedale CBD provides access to a retail centre and Rochedale railway station. The Rochedale Industrial Estate facilitates the Rochedale area and its surrounding suburbs.\nThe Rochedale Industrial Estate provides close access to Brisbane Airport and the Port of Brisbane via existing infrastructure. This area provides potential for industrial development, including: the Rochedale Industrial Estate, the Northgate Industrial park and the Gateway Regional Industrial Park.\nThe Rochedale Industrial Estate includes a number of industrial sites that were either planned or under construction at the time of Brisbane City Council Inventory in 2006. These properties offer both land and warehouses at different price ranges. The area provides potential for industrial development, including those sites within the Rochedale Industrial Estate itself. The area also provides potential for", "How is a company to measure its social media success when KPIs or even a metric set is missing? We at Sysomos did some research and we came with a step-by-step measurement framework to measure social media. It\u2019s not the end-all, so it\u2019s just a small framework to help you assess your social media campaigns by looking at your engagement score and also at the volume of traffic, or the number of fans. That\u2019s your number one metric that you should try to improve throughout all your campaigns. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not only about volume and engagement, it is also about value and, of course, brand mentions. We have a KPI section, which should ideally be measured using a social media platform. It was designed for an enterprise company or a corporate or brand that would want to have a systematic approach to measurement across all platforms, but also with multiple objectives. I will share some examples for each of these objectives to help you figure out what you should set yourself to. Finally, I will go through the methodology and help you with your measurement planning. This will help you with not only setting your KPIs but also to identify your measurement framework, so it will give you a full view on what you can really measure in social media.

In terms of the future of media, Zupan thinks publishers are going to look more like broadcasters in the short-term and need to be quicker to adapt as the audience changes.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a media company to tell us what to read.\u201d\u2014Cathie Hanlon Zupan, Forbes Magazine\nPRESENTED BY: Cathie Hanlon Zupan, Editor-in-Chief, Forbes\nTITLE: \u201cMedia and the Financial Economy\u201d\nHistorically, Forbes has served both as a financial trade publication and a news magazine which featured finance as a topic, like business news, political stories, and investment. The two were separated a few years ago, but as a result of its business coverage over the last 20 years, Forbes was recognized as a serious business news publication by Wall Street journalists, Cathie Hanlon Zupan, Editor-in-Chief, explained at Newspaper Next 2009.\nTherefore, when Zupan heard the headline that Lehman Brothers was filing for bankruptcy, she already had a good idea what the subject of her news team\u2019s first story would be. \u201cAll of a sudden it wasn\u2019t so funny anymore,\u201d she said to an audience of senior leaders representing nearly 40 different news organisations.\nFor example, Forbes published a story about how the country\u2019s two biggest brokerage firms had lost billions and how it would impact their ability to buy and sell stocks and options. While it is hard to know if this was the first story that Forbes Magazine published at that time, it is fairly safe to say that the publication was the first to publish about these topics.\nThe credit crisis proved to Zupan that the magazine actually has two audiences: business-people and media. She stressed that they must be addressed as two different groups. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to write for businesspeople and then to write for journalists. Investors are both.\u201d\nOne recent article on the website, called \u201cWhy It Is Possible to Retire Early,\u201d highlights this challenge of addressing each group. While the article is written for investors, the title is clearly headline-based to catch the attention of media people.\nFrom an editorial standpoint, Forbes is a news organisation for business executives and entrepreneurs, and its goal is to inform its readers in clear, direct and compelling language in a way that is as useful to a generalist as it is for a specialist.\nFor a number of reasons, business news is a challenging category for newspapers. One study in particular showed only 9% of readers paid more attention to a story about business and finance than a story about crime or terrorism, while 79% of readers pay attention to stories about politics, according to Zupan. As a result, news managers may be inclined to put business stories towards the end of the paper.\n\u201cThat may not be the best decision. What has to be recognised is that these business stories lead with the biggest idea in the world, which is money,\u201d she said. This is true in the case of Wall Street. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a media company to tell us what to read. That\u2019s like asking you to tell us what colour to wear.\u201d\nWhile Forbes is the first business publication to launch a website, the publication still has a print edition. \u201cThe Internet is an essential tool to expanding our brand\u2014it\u2019s been an additional channel of business, not a replacement of it,\u201dZupan said.\nForbes.com averaged 200,000 unique visitors per month prior to the financial crisis. Although the site did not grow in absolute terms, the site achieved its goal of reaching more investors at the time when they were most receptive to its content.\nThe website features video embedded on the blogs, audio slideshows, and an interactive map with a clickable list of the wealthiest people in the world.\nForbes publishes about the same number of video clips as text stories on its website every week. In fact, the magazine did an experiment where it released a video but no written story on the same subject. The videos had more views than those stories with only text.\nZupan believes that video is more suited for a story with a strong visual element than for a traditional business-analysis story.\nZupan also has a mobile platform for Forbes that reaches nearly 2,000 devices each day.

The future of health promotion\nlies in the promotion of health through environmental\ndeci- sions and health promotion at places where people\nchoose products and services.  There is a need to\ngive more emphasis to non-intrusive behaviour\nand environmental decision making as the tools\nof health promotion.\nINTRODUCTION  There is growing awareness of the\nimportance of health promotion.\nThe World Health Organisation (1) has noted that\npromotions of health and development of health\npromotion methods have been gaining ground.\nFurther, the 37th World Health Assembly in 1984\nstrongly advocated the implementation of health\npromotion programmes as an effective approach to\nthe maintenance and improvement of public health\n(2).  Health promotion aims to foster self-care,\nself-reliance and social contacts through intersectoral\nco-operation and to change environmental de-\ncisions and behaviour (2).\nThe importance of health promotion is widely\nrecognised by the general public.  In many countries,\npublic opinion regarding health promotion\nprogrammes has been overwhelmingly positive\nand encouraging.  In the United States, a public\nopinion poll (3) was conducted to study the public's\nattitude and awareness of health programmes and\nissues confronting the health community in the\n1980s.  The study was part of an ongoing research\nproject that gathers public opinion information\nfor the Institute of Medicine's National Task\nForce on the Future of Public Health.  The respondents\nwere adults (age 20 or over) who had been\ninterviewed as part of three National Opinion\nResearch Center (NORC) surveys conducted in\n1980, 1981 and 1982.  The study showed that\nhealth promotion, disease prevention, nutrition\neducation and personal health care concerns should\nreceive attention from government and industry as\nwell as society in general.  For example, people\nwere receptive to programs that stressed health\nmaintenance and prevention of disease, with an\noverall support for these programmes of about 80%.\nThe study included the question, \"Do you think that\ngovernment, industry and society should place\nstress on health promotion, disease prevention,\nnutrition education and personal health care concerns\nor on curing people who already have a disease?\"\nThe results indicated that about 83% of the sample\n(N=1,756), 80% of the low-income group (N=765)\nand 77% of the unemployed respondents (highest\nlevel of support in that group of all questions\nasked) favoured health promotion over disease\nIn Finland, the popularity of health promotion\nis indicated by the high attendance and enthusiasm\nin the health improvement classes organised\nby the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\nHealth-promotion seminars and classes have been\nattended by about 30 000 people on a monthly\nbasis.  The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health\nalso sends questionnaires to all Finnish women\nage 10 to 29 to inquire their views concerning\nhealth-related issues (4).  A study of 564 young\nwomen age 10 to 29 from the general population\nof Finland was conducted in 1982. The question-\naires were sent to the respondents (N=97).  The\nmajority of respondents were educated up to\nsecondary level in school (32%) or had completed\nvocational education (53%) or technical\neducation (14%); 82% of the respondents were\nemployed; 66% of the respondents indicated that\nthey were health-promotion conscious.  Among\nthe respondents, 42.5% (n=n=202) were interested\nin health-promotion education.  Many respondents\nthought that the Ministry of Social Affairs and\nHealth paid too little attention to health promotion\n(Table 1).  The respondents gave their reasons for\ntheir discontent with the Ministry.  Among\nthe respondents who were employed, health and\nsafety at work and health promotion at the\nworkplace were most important reasons (Table 2).\nAccording to health consultant I. A. Yliperttula\n(5), the", "As many of you know, we got our little family house in the country, or as much as a one-family townhouse can be called country, and I have really been loving our back porch, which gives us amazing views of fields and woods. However, not so far away is a large commercial solar farm, as well as a bunch of other solar farms that are being built around us. And, of course, they all have towers. But the towers on our solar farm are only about 100 or so feet tall, and it has never seemed to me that they were doing any threat to anyone's view. Until now.\nThere has been a very large wind farm that is being built in Massachusetts not too far away from us, and they are also building the most massive tower yet right off our back porch. The whole thing has just taken such a different look.\nI don't want to sound like an enemy of the industry. Quite honestly, I am not. This is good for the environment, it is good for a lot of different businesses, and I am sure that, with a lot of the other work being done in clean energy technologies, we are slowly making headway in helping ourselves to survive as a species for a while. I am totally for it.\nBut that doesn't change the fact that some of them are way too big, they are getting bigger and bigger all the time, and there just seems to be no end in sight. And, believe it or not, I am not the only one who feels this way. I haven't really talked to anyone else about it, much less taken a poll or anything like that, but you do have to admit that it might be a little bit scary if we keep losing sight of the sky. And, quite frankly, I feel like there are ways to reduce the height of towers and the size of their footprints, and we still can make a ton of money off of these things.\nMy husband actually said that I might not be alone in this, which was a bit surprising. He is always trying to figure out the perfect balance, and I think that he saw my point pretty well.\nWhen our family was little, and I was still working as a writer at a big magazine, my husband worked for about 12 years as a firefighter. And his job would take the occasional turn into saving lives, whether they be people, pets, or things in the house.\nSometimes, people have to take things off of themselves to save their lives. Like, if you are on fire, you would have to throw the flaming thing off of yourself rather suddenly. But I had a friend who got married once who was really into collecting dolls\u2013like, really into it. She had so many of them, and she had them displayed in glass cabinets and things like that. She spent all of her own time with them, and she thought that they made her house feel more homey, and even a bit feminine. Then, one day, she caught one of them on fire and it burned so fast it was just like this inferno that ate the whole cabinet right up until there was nothing left but a black glass box inside of which the remains could be found later in the ashes.\nI believe that there can be a certain logic to this at times. People do need some privacy, they do need some time to themselves, and in order to be most efficient with the time they have, I guess that most of us really don't have a need to look directly up at the sky all the time. I am sure that I would be less likely to be a part of the problem if I were to say that they are fine as long as they stay out of my sight.\nHowever, I do believe that we could come to a better balanced solution if things could be designed so they could also still be a part of people's view at times, like at dawn and dusk when the most rays of sunlight touch the Earth's surface\u2013and possibly in between, when people look up at the sky and feel like no matter what, they'll see something different and a lot more intriguing than what they get to see when they're indoors working their lives away from nine to five.\nMaybe we could find some good compromises out there\u2013but that doesn't seem to be the way it is going.\nLONG ISLAND SUMMER\nBY PAULA KLASSEN\nWESTMINSTER, NEW YORK--The last sun had slipped behind the trees on the lawn, and the neighbors were calling it a day, or at least calling it a meal. The windows overlooking this small gathering had been opened for some time despite the cool night air. There is", "It's a simple question, why doesn't he call?\n\"Don't you miss it all every day then? This place, I mean?\"\nTom stared out the passenger window at the passing urban landscape as we approached the freeway on the outskirts of Sydney, a city whose size and traffic congestion always seemed to astound me. As we moved closer to the city, Sydney Harbour came into view with its famous \"coat-hanger\" bridge, towering on our left into the clear blue sky. He shrugged.\n\"I suppose I do. Every time I come home I'm reminded why I got out in the first place. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and end up here. Some partners took me under their wing, gave me the opportunity, and the next thing I know I'm in England.\"\n\"And you've never been back?\"\n\"Not since 1997. The next time I come home is in September and it will be for only a week, a wedding in Queensland.\"\n\"So, this won't be a return visit. Just a drop-in?\"\n\"Yes, I guess it's just a drop-in.\"\n\"You could have flown to Brisbane,\" I suggested. \"Less of a chance of being recognized.\"\nHe gave me a strange look. \"Why?\"\n\"You think you'll be recognized. You might be. They still talk about you as a hero. Maybe a little less these days, now that people have had a chance to move on. But the press still talks about you every once in a while, when there's a news bulletin or something. And the press has never let a story die. It's their job to find the new angle, isn't it?\n\"Now you have a name, a face, and a reason to come home. They might get to you, you know. They might get out the story all over again and it could be bigger this time. Worse. People might find out about your family, your life, stuff out there on the Internet. They'll dig in and do something about it, don't you think? It's the least you could do. Or have you got more money to hire the press off and keep this story from happening?\"\nTom sat back in his chair and ran his fingers through his neatly trimmed graying hair, his eyes on the on- ramp to the freeway.\n\"You haven't been here long, have you? It's not like that. I haven't been recognized, you say? I don't think I've been recognized since the trial was over.\"\nI nodded. \"Well, it's not like I've been running around, not in Brisbane anyway. You know, it's been nine years. Nine years. They'll be onto something else by now. Look at what some of these TV shows do to stuff that happened months ago these days. If I thought that was going to happen, believe me, I wouldn't be doing this.\"\nTom considered what I'd said over the last few minutes. After some time he said, \"Nine years, you're right. They might be onto something else. And they don't need me to find out about it. Maybe the story's run it's course, maybe it's time.\"\nI could hear the words but didn't look at Tom, choosing instead to stare out the window where the traffic seemed to be moving faster than it had on the streets leading into Sydney. Tom was quiet for a moment.\n\"Maybe it's just time,\" he said finally. But when he glanced in my direction, his eyes were looking out the window. \"It's the same question, you see. Why didn't he call? What was he thinking? What was I thinking?\"\n\"The day he told me about it, that day we drove through Sydney, I was confused, I was torn. I wanted to know everything about it.\"\n\"You asked that question that day?\"\n\"I suppose I was trying to understand it, maybe even excuse it,\" he said, looking back out the window. \"He had gone to New York to help with the relief efforts, he says. He'd called me from the hotel phone. He was frantic, scared, upset. He'd told me he wanted me to be with him, we'd been married four years, and then he'd hung up. This was before cell phones so I ran a check on the hotel phone. It was in New York, no doubt about that. I called back. No answer at the hotel so I drove to", "Too many publishers do  what the book tells them to do,\ninstead of  listening to what the audience  wants, or even asks for. It\nmust be remembered that the audience is not interested in\nbook-production technology;  it is interested in the  story, the\nwords, and the  art -- in what  brings happiness,  comfort and\nescape. A technically perfect  book can  only  fail if  that book\ndoes not  connect with its audience.\nThere are several  common errors that  are made  by\npublishers.  Two of these are discussed  below.  First, a  brief\nlook  at why  technically  \"perfect\" and technically \"flawed\" books\nThere is  no \"technical\" excellence;  there are only\nmoments of excellence. One must distinguish between  the book that\nis \"technically perfect\", or \"technically flawed\";  and then must\ngo  further  and  evaluate  the  \"artistic\"  excellence, or lack\n\"Perfect\" books, even if flawed,  are the result  of \"excellence\"\nin the  \"art of  printing\".  \"Flawless\" books are the result of\n\"excellence\" in  \"creating a book\". In both cases,  an important\ncriterion of  excellent book  production is  its relation to its\naudience. There is  no single criterion  of \"excellence\"  -- the\nexcellence  of  a  given  aspect  of  a book's  production  may be\nobvious to one person;  its importance  is not  to another.\nFor most  book  production  technologies, a \"perfect\"\nbook,  however \"flawed\" in  its \"art\",  may be worthless;   but an\nexcellent  book  with  flaws  can still  be \"perfect\".\nBooks that are \"perfect\" but \"flawed\"  (and thus of\nno value to anyone  but a few \"print-geeks\") are usually the\ndirect  result  of  the  publisher's  belief  that  to  achieve\n\"technical perfection\" he has to  first have a technophile on his\nboard of  directors  (and a  technophile in  the top management\npost of  editorial director or publisher).  When these \"technical\nperfectionists\"  demand   \"perfect  books\"   they  are  the ones\nresponsible for them; they decide that a \"perfect\" book should be\nthe only book they care about;  for such a publisher book production\nis a game of  \"purity\";  its \"only two types\"  (i.e.,  \"techno\" and\n\"art\") are of only the slightest interest to their readers.\nIn cases such as these, the books are \"technically\nperfect\", but they have little or no relevance to the book-buying\nTo go further:  for a publisher who does not care if\nthe book is technically \"perfect\", book production is a game of\n\"impurity\". A \"non-\"purifier, in the absence of quality control,\ncan be as sloppy as he or  she wants, as long as  they know  what\nthey  are  doing and  do it  right.  Purifiers   (technophiles and\nthose who have  no interest in book  production)  can be as\npuritanical as they want, as long as they know what they are doing\nand do it right.\nIn cases such as these, \"technical perfection\", \"artistic\nperfection\", \"impurity\", and \"purity\"  may be an endless cycle,\neach  leading  to  the  next.  For  example,  a  great  book  with\nexcellent  artwork  that  uses  high  quality  \"non-purified\" raw\nmaterial, using only technologies that have  passed the purity\ntest, can have an infinite shelf-life -- it will still be seen as\na \"classic\". The question is,  \"what book will the next edition\ncome from?\".\nIt is  the purity of raw materials  and production\nmeasures that ensure \"perfection\",  both in \"technical perfection\"\nand \"artistic perfection\".\nWhen quality  becomes the primary  concern,  \"technical\nperfection\" can only happen as a result of \"purity\" --  and\n\"", "A woman from the U.S.A. who became involved with a woman from Japan.\nThe article is about 3 pages long, so only excerpts will be presented here.\nTHE OLE BAR\nBy MERIANNE KEEL\nThere are some bars you visit once (perhaps) and would never go again; others are frequent gathering points from which one may eventually move on. The Ole Bar is one such place. The atmosphere is not intimidating: the walls are bare, the floor is cement, the windows are closed and boarded, the ceiling is a little low, and the furniture is not much worth looking at.\nIf you go there one day, you may find it just about empty. The day before, it may be overflowing. It does have a little karaoke machine, which they used to play on a regular basis in the days of the Japanese-American women community, who seemed to prefer to sing at the Ole Bar--until we decided to sing anywhere else.\nYou may think the Ole Bar boring; others may prefer it. My preference is for the Ole Bar because of the people who may, or may not, be there. I have come to understand this place, where the women congregate.\nYou will never meet the same people twice at the Ole Bar. When a group of friends who work, live or hang out together start coming here, you will eventually get to know them--and that's about it. At this place, you're not supposed to stay around with the same group of people. You are supposed to mingle with others if you want to meet someone else.\nThere are many people at the Ole Bar that I don't know, but I will probably get to know sometime. Some are Japanese: they may come here just once--or many times--on their weekend. Some are not Japanese; they may come here to celebrate a weekend, a big holiday or just to unwind. Some do not even look like I can relate to them. There are men and there are women, young, old, old-young--whatever I think of when I walk through the door.\nIf you look at the women in this place, you will notice that many are in various states of dress. There are some who get a little dresses, very little--or get no dresses; to wear dresses, one would have to be a little more of a lady.\nThe dresses don't mean much here, for one can see that the women of the Ole Bar are quite comfortable with themselves.\nThe Ole Bar does not provide a stage for performance. Most of the karaoke songs are not performed here. You won't find any karaoke machine because the women have learned to sing without it.\nTo tell the truth, I don't like to see women performing in public or on any stage because I don't want to see any more women perform than I do not mind to see men perform. There are several people who like to watch women perform, whether they sing, dance, makeup, etc. I am not one of them. But I understand the reason: women are beautiful in public.\nWomen are not usually performers. In my experience, women only seem to perform when they are trying to catch someone else's eye, and they only do so when no one is watching.\nIf two women walk into the Ole Bar, you will see one of them make an effort to get attention. The one that wants attention will do a little something for the other to look at, in order to capture her gaze. Then, she will look away and, if possible, make herself look a little better. But she will never try to grab the other's attention, lest she become the observed instead of the observer.\nThe other woman will just stand there, looking at nothing. She does not need to. She knows what the other is trying to do. When the other does not notice her, she will either leave or continue to wait.\nWomen will observe one another, and will do so in this kind of manner--without anyone noticing. They will do just about anything to attract an observer, but I will tell you a truth. The attraction is not for the other woman.\nThere are many women who are not attracted to other women to be their lovers or sexual friends. If women are to experience sexual fulfillment outside of the male sex, they have some unfinished emotional business on their minds. That unfinished business is with the old, rejected men in the women's lives that they were forced or encouraged by society to get away from.\nThere are certainly many gay women in the world, but I have found in my experience that many women are lesbian by choice, not by necessity. You see, what", "Selling a paper may be a new idea.\nSelling a Paper May Be a New Idea\nSome people think that newspapers can't make a profit unless\nthey charge more for papers.  This might be a new idea, because\nit's like saying there cannot be more than one source of power\nif you want more power than that which is generated by the\nSun.  Of course, if you're not very good at marketing, you might\nnot get all the buyers that you need, and it might take a lot\nof time to develop that \"market share\" that will generate the\nrevenue stream you need.  The good thing is that it seems as\nthough the newspaper business in general may be a new breed of\nbusiness in that it is truly a \"service business\".  That is,\nthe paper (or the news channel) doesn't offer something to the\ncustomer that he can't obtain elsewhere.  That said, it looks\nas though newspapers can benefit from the same marketing\nstrategies that work in ANY consumer-based \"service\" business.\nTo read more of this article and learn more about the newspaper\nindustry, see:\nhttp://www.paulabrown.com/marketing.html\nPaulabrown@aol.com", "Two major dailies, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Wall Street Journal, are using RSS feeds to enhance their online offerings, while the remaining five -- the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Chicago Tribune, New York Times, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer -- have yet to experiment in this new realm of online journalism.\nRSS feeds -- Really Simple Syndication -- can deliver news, blogs, and other content from the Web to computers, cellphones, and other gadgets.

Now, The Wall Street Journal and The Philadelphia Inquirer are taking the next step, by adding RSS feeds for their classified advertisements.\nThe two newspapers are experimenting with RSS for classifieds, which represent a revenue stream that's traditionally had a high barrier to entry because of the cost of developing the Web site infrastructure.\nA Journal spokesperson told E&P, \"We're trying it out and seeing how it works in that category. So far, it looks great.\"\nThe Inquirer is using Movable Type, a popular blogging platform, to deliver its RSS feeds. Classified RSS feeds are placed next to newsfeeds on the newspaper's site, so readers can see both at the same time.\nRSS feeds are growing more accessible every day. In the past few months, companies like Yahoo Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have stepped up production of software to make it easy for ordinary folks to create and use such feeds. At the same time, companies that make it possible for people and organizations to publish feeds on their own Web sites are finding new ways to make money, such as through ads, premium services, and paid subscription feeds.\nWith these advances, it's a matter of time before other newspapers begin to experiment with RSS technology for their classified advertising sections.\nMarc Gunther, a visiting professor of business journalism at Columbia University's School of Journalism and a consultant to media organizations, says he would like to see RSS used for other functions at newspaper Web sites, such as to deliver all of the paper's real-time breaking news. He says many newspapers are too in thrall to their content management systems to consider this option, though the Journal and the Inquirer, are not. RSS, he says, is \"a technology whose time has come.\"\nSome newspapers are experimenting with RSS, but most news providers are not. \"It's like the new car smell -- it's not that attractive,\" Mr. Gunther says of RSS. \"The best way to sell newspapers and other news content is to print it and put it on distribution racks. Selling newspapers is an emotional decision, so we know what to expect: We know the news is going to be there tomorrow and we know the price is going to be right.\"\nBut new technology sometimes forces a rethinking, even radical rethinking, of what's expected. Mr. Gunther said that a decade ago, people might have said that newspaper sales would never be affected by the introduction of newsstands. Such comments sound ridiculous now, he says.\nRSS technology is likely to be the next big thing in newspaper publishing, which is at a time of deep transition from print to the World Wide Web.\nThe Seattle Post-Intelligencer began to experiment with RSS more than a year ago. \"We wanted to keep readers up-to-date with information about the business of newspapering -- what the [paper] industry was doing and what it was like to work in a newsroom when the Internet is changing everything,\" said Alan Diaz-Shepherd, assistant managing editor of the newspaper.\nAs part of that experiment, the newspaper began publishing two RSS feeds, one for blogs, the other for breaking news. The paper was publishing about 260 RSS feeds a day covering various beats, staff features, and various news stories.\nIn mid-April, the newspaper's", "This document makes minor wording changes or editorial corrections to a number of sections in subpart I in order to conform to the general revisions to 49 CFR part 571, and updates references to the standards incorporated by reference. These changes are intended to make the regulations easy to use. No substantive changes to those sections are intended by this document.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Maryann Wack at (202) 366-0330; Email: mwack@ce.gov.\nSection 571.207 of 49 CFR contains the list of equipment with frontal protection requirements (i.e., side impact requirements). Section 571.207 lists the specifications for each piece of equipment covered by a final FMVSS rule. The specifications are grouped by the type of equipment (for example, light duty trucks, medium duty trucks, light duty truck vocational service vehicles), and then listed alphabetically by the name of each equipment manufacturer's model. The wording of subparts I and III were extensively revised by an NPRM, published on January 23, 2012 (77 FR 3271) (65 FR 10714, March 8, 2000; 65 FR 59139, October 4, 2000; and 69 FR 8275, February 23, 2005; modified on February 23, 2012, 77 FR 8228). Minor corrections to the tables are being made to subpart I (571.207-Equipment with Side Impact (FMVSS 214)), including the removal of redundant equipment manufacturer model titles, removal of obsolete equipment, and minor editorial corrections.\nFMVSS 214 Side Impact Test is effective on vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 1981. FMVSS 214 Side Impact Test was amended by FMVSS 214a (Head Restraints) and FMVSS 214b (Child Restraint Anchorage Systems) on August 9, 2001, but was extended on or after September 1, 2001, to September 1, 2003, for vehicles manufactured with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) and meeting the standards of FMVSS 208a. FMVSS 214b was extended on or after September 1, 2001, to September 1, 2003, for all passenger cars. FMVSS 214a was extended on or after September 1, 2001 to September 1, 2004, to vehicles manufactured with the standards of that rule. In addition, FMVSS 214b required extension through September 1, 2009 (amended September 1, 2012, 77 FR 9015). NHTSA issued a final rule extending the application of FMVSS 214b (Head Restraints) effective September 1, 2010, to all vehicle categories; the last category was passenger cars covered by FMVSS 214a (Head Restraints Standard Extension).\nFMVSS 214a is effective until September 1, 2012, for all vehicles manufactured or remanufactured with the standards of FMVSS 214a, except passenger cars. For passenger cars, FMVSS 214a (Head Restraints Standard Extension) effective September 1, 2010, applies until September 1, 2014.\nFMVSS 216 Side Impact was amended by adding new testing requirements for occupant intrusion in side-impact crashes effective September 1, 2003, for vehicles manufactured with the standards of that rule.\nThese amendments resulted in the revision of the equipment model's side impact test requirements and the date by which FMVSS 216 compliance was required. 49 CFR 571.207-29 requires a side impact test for the standard equipment model beginning in the September 2003 quarterly production. The FMVSS 216 side impact date of compliance was amended several times.

Following its request submitted on 24 July 2012, the applicants produced a declaration by one of their members from 6 March 2011 whereby he explained his role in the case at hand.\n THE GENERAL SECRETARY: Access was refused by the Commission and upheld by the Board of Appeal.\n THE APPLICANTS: By a summons dated 2 October 2013, the applicants sought review of this decision.\n THE GENERAL SECRETARY: Access was granted by the General Court in its judgment in EQB 7974 on the basis that a declaration had not been submitted by one of the persons suspected by the Commission of having provided the applicants with a certain set of information relating to the products in question. The General Court also deemed it necessary to grant access under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 on the grounds that the declaration submitted by the applicant only concerned a single individual.\n THE GENERAL SECRETARY: Following its decision in EQB 7972, the General Court held under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 that the confidentiality of those persons who had been cited as sources by the parties concerned ought to be the subject of a declaration. However, that Court did not request access as regards their names and professional relationships, stating that the purpose was to protect them against possible repercussions and to avoid retaliation.\n Since the applicants' application is to be treated as an application for review of the Board of Appeal's decision, the General Court found, in any case, that the Board of Appeal had failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the third party concerned could be identifiable as the source referred to in the documents in question.\n THE APPLICANTS: In the appeal hearing on 4 July 2014, the applicants stated that they had been able to identify the member of the staff suspected of being an inadvertent source through the declaration submitted prior to the review proceedings with the result that the information concerning the source and the documents concerned could be disclosed. As the Board of Appeal had not referred specifically to the fact that the applicants had been unable to identify the source concerned to support an argument in defence of the refusal to disclose the requested documents, that Board of Appeal did not have sufficiently well-founded reasons for its decision.\n THE GENERAL SECRETARY: The General Counsel undertook to submit observations in writing to the Board of Appeal and the applicants.\n THE GENERAL COUNSEL: In his observations accompanying the summons to appear at the hearing on 16 July 2014, the General Counsel made reference to the fact that the applicants had been able for some time to identify the suspected staff member of the Commission Services who had been an inadvertent source in the case at hand on the basis of the declarations submitted previously. The General Counsel undertook to submit observations in writing to the Board of Appeal and the applicants.\n THE GENERAL SECRETARY: In his observations accompanying the summons to appear at the hearing, the General Counsel provided extensive reasoning for the General Court's findings concerning the Board of Appeal's decision. In its judgment in EQB 7628 of 18 September 2014, the General Court first underlined that the question as regards", "This rule modifies the regulation on information reporting by sponsors of qualified defined contribution plans. The regulation requires sponsors of these plans to make additional reporting to the Internal Revenue Service (Service) on behalf of retirement plan participants. This rule provides the information used to reconcile a qualified plan's account balances with data provided to the Service each year by the sponsor.\nDATES: Written or electronic comments must be received by August 11, 2003.\nADDRESSES: Requests for a public hearing must be received by July 8, 2003.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Publications Unit at 1-800-829-3676 to request an electronic copy of the regulations. The final regulations and related instructions can be found at RIN 2120-AF71 and 2140-BK08.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background and Purpose\nSection 6047 establishes information reporting and recordkeeping requirements that apply to account holders (including participants) of most retirement arrangements. Section 6047(e), as modified by section 832(c)(1)(F) of the Small Business Job Protection Act, Pub. L. 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755, requires annual reporting of participant balances for these retirement arrangements. Section 6047(e)(5) requires the balances on which the reporting is based to be supplied by qualified defined contribution plans. Qualified defined contributions plans, for purposes of these regulations, are defined benefit, profit-sharing, and money purchase plans in which the participant elects to have the plan use reasonable methods to calculate the participant's account balance. Section 6047(b) and (c) set forth the information reporting requirements.\nSection 6621(c) provides that the information return, Form 5498, will be issued on or before the due date, including extensions, for participant's tax returns, provided that the information is received by the administrator of the retirement arrangement on a timely basis. Section 6621(d)(2) requires the administrator of the retirement to supply the information, upon form, to the Service.\nIn 1990, section 422 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Pub. L. 105-4, provided additional information reporting requirements for administrators of retirement arrangements. Section 422(b) provided for an additional information return, Form 5498, on distributions made from a qualified plan. Section 422(d) provided for the revised Form 5500. The original regulation implementing these reporting and filing requirements was published as a temporary regulation in 1990. However, final regulations were issued in 1995, amending the temporary regulation. See Amendments to Information Reporting Regulation in Part 1.5.\nOn December 12, 2002, final regulations were issued under section 6047 requiring an administrator to disclose plan type and identify qualified defined contribution plans on the form used to supply the information return, Form 5498. The regulation also revised the time for furnishing Form 5498 and created new rules to treat certain arrangements as a single plan for purposes of Form 5498. These regulations were issued with a request for comments in response to the statute's application to qualified defined contribution plans for section 6047(e).\nSection 416, the Technical Corrections Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-603, 92 Stat. 2986, provided some additional modifications to the reporting requirements. First, 92 Stat. 2986, amended the form of the information return.\nSecond, section 101(d)(1), 92 Stat. 2986, limited the amount of information an administrator is required to provide to the IRS with respect to each employee. The regulations adopted the changes in section 101(d)(1) to reflect that an employer was to report this information. However, the regulations did not implement one significant aspect of section 101(d)(1). Specifically, the Service will not request or require from an employer information as to the amount or value of assets allocated in any plan to any individual for any plan year.", "An EPA document indicates that the agency will consider whether to regulate the chemical formaldehyde to mitigate its carcinogenic effects and to protect children.\nThe agency has not yet made specific health-based risk assessments on formaldehyde that would help to address the issue of acceptable formaldehyde levels under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) with regard to the chemical. The agency will first focus on possible ways to curb exposure to formaldehyde to better protect children. EPA is considering whether to require warning labels on formaldehyde-containing products.", "\u201cThe Mummy\u201d had an amazing start, but fell short of expectations.\nThe Curse of the Mummy is a unique tale in that a lot of the marketing was done on internet video. The whole Mummy saga has been tied in to the \u201cLost\u201d series, which just started its second season. A lot of people were looking forward to it. The sypnosis was just awesome. The marketing and anticipation were just sky high. We knew it was a unique tale, with a lot of great looking effects. We were very optimistic that it would do well. Unfortunately, the opening weekend came and went. Although it made a lot of money, we as a society failed to give it our undivided attention and as a result, it fell flat.\nThe one thing about \u201cThe Mummy\u201d is that you don\u2019t have to see the original movie to get the whole story. Because of the shortened run time and the quick pace, you can catch up to all of the story pretty easily. There are a lot of neat twists and turns, which I can\u2019t comment on without giving anything away.\nIt has a very slick, action filled pace to it. The story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It\u2019s nice because you aren\u2019t waiting around to find out what\u2019s going to happen. I know I was always annoyed by films that had an action story that just wouldn\u2019t get there already. Although a lot of people were happy with the film, because it was so action packed, the ending wasn\u2019t strong enough to match the pace.\nThe story is a well woven tale that has many twists and turns to surprise you. It\u2019s a great way to introduce the classic movie. In addition, it also leaves a few threads for the second movie to weave into. The character arcs go in several directions and you really don\u2019t find out anything completely. There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered but thankfully, they are going to be answered in movie two.\nSome of the characters are underdeveloped because they need to leave some wiggle room to work. You get a sense of who they are and what there plans are but some things still leave a few questions unanswered. A few things are just dropped completely. I could sit here and ramble on about the rest of them but you get the idea. If there is a sequel, there needs to be another chance to delve into the other characters a little deeper.\nSome of the characters seem underdeveloped, because the story is so fast paced, but that\u2019s necessary. There are a few things dropped that just feel like they are left to do for the sequel but if all the story gets a sequel. A good example is a character that leaves to go on a quest but never turns up again. Another example is that the love interest in this film is barely developed. She gets introduced, has a few things thrown at her, but really isn't as fully fleshed as the rest of the characters in the movie. This is disappointing because in most movies the main character and the love interest have a lot of their own character development. In The Mummy, you never get any real time with her. She is introduced, you spend a couple minutes in her headspace and her journey is over. I was hoping for a much bigger arc there but it never really happened.\nAlthough, there were good looking monsters, there were not a ton of them. The best looking ones are still not as good as the ones in the first \"The Mummy\" movie. This is an action filled film and monster filled movies are a rarity nowadays. When they do it, expect the monsters to be a little less than top notch. They could probably save the CGI monsters in the sequel. I\u2019m sure this movie cost a lot of money and a lot more attention to detail probably could have been applied to the monsters. It wasn\u2019t a deal breaker but with the amount of awesome CGI, it would have been nice to see something a little more than just a head that rolls and maybe a few feet sticking out of the ground.\nThis film is a fun ride that doesn't really go anywhere. The pace is so fast that I was having trouble keeping up with the characters, especially since I never have time to get to know them. They throw so many scenes at you that you are bound to miss a lot of them because of the pace. If you don't have a lot of time to see it, it's probably best to wait a few weeks for it to hit TBS. There will be another one in a few years, but for this one the hype out weighed the movie when it comes down to it.", "Leading your own newspaper is like walking a tightrope\nbetween heaven and hell. You stand there alone in an ethical\ndilemma, and you must decide quickly which way to jump.\nIn my 25 years at the newspaper, I have never been involved in\nso many ethical struggles. I think about where I have been,\nand I see that I have arrived at where I most need to be.\nI see what is needed.\nWhat has happened to me is a wonderful opportunity.

But all the Kryptonite\nis right under my nose.\nAll I have to do is look out the window and see the front\nyard.

I see coffee cups and\nplastic spoons that are never in their proper place and usually\nlittering the tabletop in the dining room. I see the dishes\nclogged with crusted-on food when I should be having my breakfast\nin my chair and looking at the daily news. I see my children\nrushing madly in all directions because nobody is helping them\nget on their school bus; or because my wife is still getting ready\nto leave for work.\nI see the front door is open, and outside I hear children\nhowling. Or maybe they are yelling and screaming at one another,\nbecause I never know when they leave for school who is supposed\nto open and close the front door. Maybe it's one of the kids. But\nit isn't always my kids. As I watch the children play and laugh, I\nwatch a car zoom away as my daughter runs on the sidewalk and\nbecomes invisible to the back of my car until the car gets to the\nstreet. It's my youngest son. He stands there and waits until the\ncar has passed before he finally sees a big brother coming\nanother way. Then he realizes the game is up.\nIt's almost time to go to work, and my wife is going to be\nlate, and my daughter is a few minutes late, and my older son\ntakes almost an hour to get going. And then he gets stuck in\ntraffic because someone is having an accident, and then he decides\nto run an errand before he gets to work. Meanwhile, the little kid\nis still on the street waiting, and the school bus rolls slowly\npast just inches away and the door doesn't open.\nIt's a tough call, because I do not feel like doing what\nhave to do. I want to get away from the responsibility and the\ndifficult choices and the challenges to my professional\ncharacter to just let somebody else try and do it, but I can't\ndo it, and I finally realize I have to be a man about it, and I\nhave to confront the mess in my own house.\nThe problem is that when you feel powerless and stressed\nabout what to do and feel incapable of dealing with it all, you\nend up giving up. I think my wife gave up on me a long time\nago, and maybe she was right to, and maybe I haven't seen that.\nI don't know anything at all because I don't see anything.

The company, which will be paid 60% of the\nrevenue generated by its new e-paper platform, claims the move\nis a sign publishers can make money in the digital space. The\nmove comes as the newspaper industry's focus shifts towards\nthe digital space.\nThe company, News.com.au, has become the first news publisher\nin the world to launch a fully paid-for digital edition of its\nnewspaper. The online newspaper, which launched six months ago,\nhas a circulation of just over 50,000 and claims to have\nattracted more than 37.5 million page views a month.\nThe company believes it has made the move at the perfect time,\nas circulation revenue has been declining.\n\"Print is clearly in a difficult place at the moment,\" News.com.au\ngroup editor Joel McGrath explains. \"It has been clear for a while\nthat people have been losing interest in the print product.\"\nThe website is set to charge readers around A$70 per year for\nfull access the website, with the first month of access offered\nfree. Users will also have to register their details to use\nthe site. The site has been set up using technology that allows\npeople to pay for access using PayPal and credit cards. The site\nwill continue to offer readers a certain number of pages of\nthe newspaper each month free of charge.\nMcGrath concedes it was only a matter of time before the newspaper\nindustry moved into the new area. \"Online journalism has emerged\nover the last 10 years as a potential cure-all, however there was\na time in which it did not seem to have any economic viability,\"\nhe explains. \"Then, as the global financial crisis hits, and as\na result the advertisements in the print version of the newspapers\nhave dried up, and the online newspapers have the potential to\nmake real money.\"\nThe introduction of a paid-for online version of the newspaper\nfollows a trial run of charging readers for a single article.\nMcGrath acknowledges that many users will be unwilling to pay\nfor access to newspaper content online.\nBut, by introducing a paid-for online version, News.com.au\nis hoping to generate further revenue. \"Most revenue is advertising\nbased. If people pay money to access the website, it leaves the\nadvertising open for other potential users,\" McGrath comments.\n\"We can also offer more sophisticated analysis and business\nmodels to our advertisers.\"\nThe company, like most of its competitors, will continue to offer\nits content without charge to a certain number of users every\nday. But McGrath, believes it does not have to compromise its\nstandards to do so.\n\"In the old media model you were forced to compromise, but that\nisn't the case in the new one,\" he explains. \"At the moment,\nthere are only 240,000 unique users on our site per month, so it is\npossible to have a number of free users per day.\n\"However, we are confident that our news journalism is\ncompelling. Even in this tough economy, it is still a great place\nto be and we want to continue to offer to the best quality\njournalism in the digital space.\"\nThe move comes as publishers search for new, and lucrative,\nopportunities on the new media space. Media companies have long\nbeen searching for ways to monetise their online audience\nbecause advertising prices have slumped in recent years and there\nhas not been a big uptake in the readership of the industry's\nproducts online.\nNews.com.au, which is a subsidiary of News Ltd, said the\nadditional stream of revenue would be vital for the\ncompany as advertising revenues slumped.\nAs a result, it claims, the newspaper is one of the few left to\noffer its content for free while, at the same time, paying its\nstaff and delivering a profit to shareholders.\nThe company is convinced the current state of affairs offers\npublishers little to lose by offering a digital product for a\nnominal fee. McGrath explains it hopes to persuade users that\nofferings, such as a paid-for e-paper, \"make great value.\"\n\"We can't survive in the current advertising model as there is\ntoo much choice now,", "Might well be a first, and most likely won't see it again for aeons. But then, it was the first time we'd come here.\nThe night had been long. We had started early, but it had taken time to navigate the jagged coast of the Tiger's Eye. My father and I had played a game of chess, one we had learned together when I was but four. I had just turned eighteen, not that I could move to the chips as he had -- though he no longer played as he had once done when he did not have a son who insisted on challenging him at every turn.\nBut I did not let that prevent me from beating him to end the game. I was still proud of myself the next morning as we watched the sunrise.\nTiger's Eye, I had learned from the ship's crew, was a place of beauty, but one that also offered a harsh, desolate landscape. My father had told me many times that it had not always been that way. The Tiger's Eye Clans had been prosperous; they had traded in goods and services with Clans across the sea. But that was long ago, my mother had said -- after all, she was born in the desert, she claimed, and had never seen the ocean.\nWe were now close to the edge of the great expanse of the ocean, where the red sand had blended with the sea, and the great waves beat against rocks that had once been the buildings of the great clan. It was beautiful; it was sad, for what remains of the past is seldom truly past.\nThere was one clan left, from what I had heard from the old tales, and so the old stone that once had been the clan's home remained. But there were no people there anymore; the clan had fallen into history. It had been a while, but the stories still remained. Perhaps that is how life continued -- in stories. Perhaps those stories are the foundation of the human race, and from them all is derived.\nThe water was quiet; the rock on land was not. I sat up and dried the sleep from my hands, trying to move quietly so to not disrupt either, trying to let them remain in the past of the past. But I could not get the past entirely out of my head -- I always thought of the chess game we had played. I always thought of the words he had told me.\nAnd perhaps as I grew this grew too, but I could not remember. And perhaps this, too, had been the past of the past, so perhaps that had been forgotten long ago too. It was all the past -- everything that had brought us all to the Tiger's Eye was. But it was a part of our human history, and of what we as humans had become -- what we could become. We should remember that.\n\"It is a shame,\" my father had stated in the early morning light, \"that the Tiger's Eye Clans have fallen. They were great traders in their time, and made their fortune from the trade they had done across the world. And in doing so they never fought. But it is all forgotten now, and soon will be for all.\"\nThere was a sound of movement from a few rows over, as if whoever had been sleeping was now staring at him.\nMy father said the clan was like all other clans. There were clues to what had changed all of them. There were pieces to the puzzle of why they fell and how they had become destroyed. But those pieces were not found simply; it took effort in remembering. My father remembered more than most.\nBut the clan had always had one son that followed in his family's footsteps to find those pieces. I had heard that many of those parts to the puzzle existed; it would have not been something my father had not seen firsthand. I had heard it was in the clan's vault. Perhaps I could find out for myself. I had heard it was near the old stone.\nHopefully, I hoped, I would be able to find them. There would be more than one reason to return to the Tiger's Eye if I found that it was true.\nThere was a sound of movement to my right as my father turned to face me.\n\"No, not everything is forgotten,\" he said to me. \"Some things are lost; some have been lost for eons. But some things are remembered, and will always be remembered.\"\nMy father turned back then, to the sunrise on the Tiger's Eye, and watched the light play on the great red rocks and the land they were once a part of.\nSome things, I had thought, are", "The U.S. Commerce Department has filed criminal\ncharges in the \"Operation Plato\" counterfeiting and\npiracy case.

You can find them every now and then. And, there's a bunch of people that have this idea that social media are taking over your life (which is obviously crap, and you see this in other areas) while others say no, it's just a medium, like any other. These are the two sides of the coin, and one should not forget there is a third: Media do change. The medium of expression changes - this is why the idea of \"old\" media is a myth. What is not changing, as pointed out in the post, are people and their behaviors. I also like how the post points at the fact that it's not that easy to know which way people will go with the new media - some people go for the interaction while others may simply be too intimidated by the media they find new (and who can blame them?). I'm sure there are other points to make too.\nHowever, there is one more point that I think is rather important. And it's really simple: it depends on the context. People respond differently to different situations and different media. For instance, not that long from now, I read a post wherein a person said that texting her boyfriend was like talking, \"almost\". It was like a communication form which meant they would have a conversation, or at least share things and talk about it. They weren't going to text that they love each other. Or that they can't wait to see the other. This was the context.\nThe context is what creates situations in which people don't bother to actually talk. They don't need to. So, we have \"new media\" (whatever it may be) creating contexts in which people communicate differently and this creates behaviors - or I suppose \"ways in which they use media to communicate\" is a better statement. But the important thing to stress out is if this is really a \"new\" media or simply a change.\nI really don't think this medium is so new. Maybe a change, to you, but it's not new as a medium - in fact, it's not new at all. A medium is a social act used for sharing information. And that's all texting is. Not new at all. It used to, at one time, be called snail mail, but it's still a medium. The same could be said about phones and face-to-face communication (like this post).\nThe point I'm trying to make is that there is a difference between \"new uses of old media\" (e.g. texting) and \"new media\".\n(I would say a lot more, but I'll try and come back on this.)\nEtiquetas: culture, media, news, newspaper", "The NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project aims to improve understanding of underlying brain systems and mechanisms of psychological function in healthy individuals and in individuals with mental health challenges. The RDoC team is currently developing an infrastructure of coordinated experimental and computational resources that can support open-ended, exploratory research using behavioral, imaging, genetic, and other data. One critical component of this infrastructure is the Common Data Element (CDE) specification for the RDoC project. CDEs provide a common structure to facilitate sharing of data between projects and reduce the burden of data-sharing, particularly when the same data may be shared between multiple investigators for the purpose of conducting comparative analyses. A CDE schema for the RDoC project comprises 79 high-level concepts and 6030 term definitions. The schema serves as a repository of commonly used terms, including terminology and standard definitions for the RDoC concepts. It includes a detailed glossary of terms developed by a standards development team, a list of approved synonyms for RDoC terms, and links to other standardized vocabularies such as the American Psychological Association\u2019s DSM-5 terminology and the National Library of Medicine MeSH vocabulary. As part of the NIH RDoC project, the CDE specification will include multiple components that assist with the design, implementation, and evaluation of the RDoC project. The CDE specification has now been released for general use and the NIH RDoC team is planning for the eventual transition to a community-managed and controlled process. The CDE specification is being made available through a dedicated website to support researchers and other stakeholders in working with the RDoC CDEs as well as research projects and informatics tools.\nAshmore, J.

Even though 21% of the misdiagnosed diabetics died within a year compared to just 7% of those correctly diagnosed, this is not a call for a return to symptom-based diagnoses, and is an excellent reminder of how well physicians (and medical students) are trained in the science of disease.\nA study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 15% of diabetics are misdiagnosed. [1] Even though 21% of the misdiagnosed diabetics died within a year compared to just 7% of those correctly diagnosed, this is not a call for a return to symptom-based diagnoses, and is an excellent reminder of how well physicians (and medical students) are trained in the science of disease.\nThe NEJM paper looked at the diabetic population of Kaiser Permanente Northern California to determine the proportion of correct diagnoses. Using an algorithm designed to identify diabetic patients with 97% specificity [2], the authors compared this results to self-reported symptoms for diabetes.\nResults showed that 69% of these patients were correctly identified. 67% of the study's 564 patients reported at least one symptom of diabetes. 79% reported at least one, and 86% reported two or more symptoms. But only 58% reported weight loss, the most commonly-reported symptom. Of those who did present with weight loss as their first, second, or third symptom:\n59% had previously received a correct diagnosis\n88% had received a diabetes diagnosis within one year\n59% were women\n51% were non-Hispanic Caucasians\nThe study also found that diagnosis by symptoms or family history (which are the two most commonly-used methods of identification in the world today [3]) led to misdiagnoses of 14% and 15% of cases.\nWhile the paper was careful to note that these results did not show what proportion of clinicians actually based their diagnoses on self reported symptoms or family history, the authors seemed to suggest that patients may be more comfortable presenting with symptoms of diabetes than those with weight loss or high blood pressure. Perhaps, then, this can be a starting point for a new discussion about the need for better, more-sophisticated diagnostic protocols.\nDoctors have become highly skilled at identifying diseases [4], but for diabetics, these new results indicate a return to the dark ages of symptom-based diagnosis. Diagnostic errors are the fourth leading cause of death today, after cancer, heart disease, and strokes. [5] The paper, however, states that because of misdiagnosis, diabetic patients have an increased mortality rate. In the misdiagnosis group, diabetics died at a rate 2.4 times as high as those with confirmed diabetes. While 7% of patients in the study population (of which 2.4% were misdiagnosis) died within a year of diagnosis, 18.9% of the misdiagnosis group died, a rate about 5 times higher. But while this may seem like a call to return to symptom-based diagnoses, the data should instead serve as a reminder of how well we educate our young doctors. (Perhaps this is a reason for doctors to return to the use of symptoms.)\n\"The majority of these erroneous diagnoses occur because the presenting symptoms were insufficient or inaccurate for correct diagnosis,\" the article's authors note. While weight loss might seem like the obvious candidate for a diabetes diagnosis \u2013 it was ranked as the most-reported symptom of both diabetes and hypo-glycemia and accounted for 4% of the error-diagnosis group \u2013 only 4.4% of the correct group patients reported this as a symptom.\nThis may also provide an answer as to why the two most common symptoms for diagnosis of type-2 diabetes are lack of physical activity (14%) and obesity (15%). But while it may seem easier to diagnose diabetes based on signs and symptoms, the evidence suggests that diagnoses based on symptoms are not only unreliable, but also dangerous.

The drug, a TNF-alpha antagonist, is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, alone or in combination with methotrexate, in patients who have responded inadequately to disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Treatment is initiated and maintained based on clinical response, and may require dose adjustments. When this drug was available only by intravenous administration, the approved indication was the same as the approved subcutaneous dosing indication. However, FDA previously recognized the limitations associated with intravenous administration that could result in delayed therapeutic benefit and lack of tolerability that may result in treatment discontinuation, as discussed in the FDA approval history. FDA believes the approved subcutaneous dosing schedule of Cimzia may enable patients with rheumatoid arthritis to receive the potentially beneficial clinical outcomes provided by Cimzia when administered subcutaneously, despite these limitations, as discussed in the approval history. If the subcutaneous dose causes localized adverse reactions, such as localized edema or itching that persist and are not sufficiently managed by the recommended dose reduction, patients could potentially receive therapy. This drug was granted orphan drug designation to treat rheumatoid arthritis until the new drug application (NDA) for this indication was filed, and later received marketing approval for severe chronic, inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis.", "The proposed rule would impose a variety of conditions and limitations for each of the\nsix categories of facilities regulated under the regulation (newspaper, publishing\ncompany, other periodical, commercial printing, directory list printing, and cooperative\ndirectory printing).\nDATES: Written Comments: In commenting, please refer to ``NM-534,\nExemption from the Presentation or Display Requirements for Certain Entities'' and\nsend comments\nin the following e-mail address:\nNARC-Exemption-comments@nara.gov.

Today eCommerce solutions are commonplace. Businesses offer the option online to pay bills, purchase products, schedule appointments, create a service or join a class.\nEliminating friction in the customer journey with an online payment option to make it possible to complete an action in one step improves satisfaction.\nWhen a customer can complete a purchase using a credit card online, payment options include a credit card and a debit card, which is tied to a checking account, and is often used by merchants.\nA debit card is a safe and relatively inexpensive payment method for a merchant. When a debit card is used to process an online sale, the customer\u2019s checking account is debited at the time of checkout for the cost of products. The debit or check card can be made by the processor or directly through the customer\u2019s bank.\nWhen a purchase is made with the debit card, the issuer of the debit card will initiate an authorization request.\nThe issuer of either credit or debit cards, the customer, will have an account with the debit issuer and their funds will be made from the customer\u2019s (debit card) checking account.\nWhen a customer debit card is swiped at a retail point of sale, the credit card machine will either:\n1) Complete an authorization or decline an authorization if there are insufficient funds in the customer checking account,\n2) Accept the transaction and place a hold in the customer\u2019s checking account for the amount of the order.\nWhen a debit card is swiped online, it is treated the same way. The processor will accept the authorization request of the credit card machine and, in turn, process the authorization just as it would in the brick-and-mortar establishment. However, the authorization must be declined if the funds are not available in the customer\u2019s checking account. If the transaction is approved, the processor places a hold (like it would for a brick-and-mortar establishment) on the customer\u2019s checking account. The hold will be temporary, usually up to 14 days. Funds may be debited from the holding account only by the customer\u2019s discretion.\nWhen the holding account is full, the holder of the debit card will receive email or text alerts to tell them the account balance is low and that the funds should be released soon.\nAt this point the customer may decline to release the funds. If the funds are not returned, the debit machine will decline the next authorizations by alerting the processor the funds are not available. However, the transaction will not be declined at the retail point of sale.\nThe processor may also hold all of the customer\u2019s payments on file until satisfied the debit card holder will be able to cover future authorizations.\nWhy not just release the payment back into the checking account automatically, you may ask. This is to avoid merchants from releasing funds into an account that is not replenished by the customer.\nIf the consumer requests the funds back, they may be released to the customer\u2019s bank.\nUnfortunately, the customer may not remember the funds were released, thus creating an ongoing negative charge.\nBanks will sometimes put a hold on the funds in addition to charging a penalty fee of as much as $35-$50. This is done to recoup the cost of a checking overdraft fee.\nMerchants will need to create a better communication channel for the debit card holders to understand when their funds will become available again. Sometimes reapplying the funds is the best way to avoid additional late fees or overdraft fees.\nIf funds are not successfully released, the authorization may appear as a decline and the customer will not be able to complete the transaction. It will be declined at the retail point of sale.\nAlways consult with your processor or acquirer to ensure your debit hold and release policies are up to regulation and complying with regulations.\nDebit Card Processing Solutions\nFor customers, the pay by debit card feature is great. It eliminates the need to carry around cash or checks. This method also ensures the customer does not incur additional fees or fines for overdrawn accounts.\nThe eBANK Checking account allows users to make debit purchases, transfers, or bill payments. By transferring funds from eBANK Checking, users will be able to make instantaneous payments and will not be charged a fee for transferring funds.\nTo obtain your account number and routing number for the debit cards and transfers, please contact your bank directly.", "The agenda for the Board of Directors' meeting of February 25, 1999\nSPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS: The following motion was moved by Linda M.

The motion also requested that a two\nnotch reduction also be forwarded to the ratings agency. Finance Director Joseph W. Larkin explained that the General Government Stabilization fund balance as of January 1, 1999 is $175,271 and would be reviewed during the Town Administrator's monthly reports.\nDebt Service Fund Balance: A motion passed that two notches be reduced\nfrom an Aaa down to a Aaa from an Aa1 Rating with a negative outlook. The\nmotion directed that a two notch reduction also be forwarded to the ratings\nagency. Finance Director Joseph Larkin explained that the Debt Service Fund\nBalance as of January 1, 1999 is $1,398,624 of which $1,150,000 is\ndesignated for debt service. It was added 14.5 FTEs. A review of general\nfund budgetary performance shows a $5,028,834 operating surplus\nappropriated as follows:\nEducation Fund: $1,796,037\nHealth Insurance Reserve Fund: $1,162,250\nGeneral Government Stabilization Fund: $405,678\nDebt Service Fund Balance: $1,398,624\nTreasurer's Office: $41,875\nTown Clerk's Office: $40,435\nDebt Service: $398,585\nFund Balance: $2,123,934\nIt was added $500,000 of the Education Fund Surplus to the Debt Service Fund Balance for a total ending balance of $3,123,934 for FY 1999. This is a positive balance", "At an international workshop, an agency publishes reports in digital form, providing greater value for less cost using an open-source e-reader platform.\n\"If I was to do it again, I wouldn't take any payment [for my time and expertise as facilitator].... We were all motivated and happy to attend. The value to me in being part of it, in the contribution of the ideas and the discussion--I'm not going to take any payment for that.\"\n- Michael Duffus, e-G8 conference member\nA few weeks ago, I had the honour of attending an international workshop with the G8 Summit in Huntsville, Ontario. The summit was part of a major international effort to bring awareness of key issues facing the planet, including an international focus on water. The workshop provided an opportunity to discuss the role of science in developing innovations and technology to respond to water resource challenges. It was held in cooperation with G8 member leaders from Japan, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada and the United States.\nIn a traditional, closed-off context, this gathering might have been difficult to take part in, but because the format was open and free to all, it attracted participation by a number of experts in the field. Many of the participants had never met before, yet, on the day of the workshop, we developed an agenda and quickly set out to determine where the greatest needs were in Canada and internationally.\nAt the core of the development of this event was an emphasis on the use of communications technology, particularly a digital platform, including an e-reader created by PediaStream.\nThe platform, an open-source system, is free to use and works on PC and Mac systems. With this technology, participants could download the reports and PowerPoint presentations, view the presentations in full-screen mode, and interact directly with the facilitator and conference presenters.\nBy developing a digital, open-source platform, the e-G8 could easily develop its own agenda and materials, tailoring the event to suit its needs. No longer confined by existing material, it had the ability to create its own content. Using the platform, the e-G8 developed a set of digital reports specific to the goals of the event. As reports were added, attendees could easily download and annotate them on their notebooks or PCs. Some attendees did this through a dedicated e-G8 website and some did so from within the presentation system itself, taking part in discussions and leaving comments to contribute to the development of the event. In this way, an expert from the Netherlands participated in the event on his own computer from his home. The e-G8 was able to tap into the expertise of researchers around the world.\nThe eG8 set out to provide a better platform for the sharing of information, which helps create a better way to manage these issues. At the e-G8 event, we discovered that, with this format, we were able to add greater value and efficiency. We were able to reduce the cost of the event, as well. With the ability to quickly change the way we communicated with participants, we did away with the need to create a large printed report containing all of the information. Rather, the agenda was added online, along with the reports. As new content was developed, such as presentations, it could be downloaded and instantly added to the agenda. For those who may have preferred an audio-style presentation, the audio files were also easily added to the digital platform.\nFor this year's e-G8, the G8 Secretariat set out to organize an event to create awareness about the importance of having a strong science-based infrastructure in order to develop innovations. With that in mind, it was interesting to note that they took advantage of the e-G8 format to help build their own platform, as well. By using the technology, and by involving all participants, they were able to save significant amount of money which was then available for putting this information in a digtial format in order to provide more value to the people who are working in this field. The platform provided by PediaStream in its open-source e-reader worked at an affordable price to the group, saving it a tremendous amount of money.\nDuring the discussion, it was clear that the idea of using this digital technology to organize events was attractive. The platform is more efficient, but it also allows the participants to interact, to use digital tools to build their own material in a completely new context.\nThe ability to quickly and easily interact on a digital platform provides real possibilities for the future of this type of meeting. It was interesting to note that the e-G8 was not", "Thiery Vachey was being interviewed in the wake of the discovery of the remains of an unborn child at the construction worksite at the Riverside Centre. He was standing in front of a microphone trying to convince the interviewer, whom he disliked, that the child had been found not buried under the foundation of the new building but in a skip, on the other side of what would become level 2. It was hard to explain to the media, with their obsession with everything having to make sense that he did not know why the child was dumped there. But what sense did it make that a child might be murdered for, or what significance could the death of his or her mother hold for anybody, and why, he was constantly asking himself, should he be the only person who had known nothing about the pregnancy, or who did not know the mother?\nThe microphone caught every word; it was one of those microphones from the future, with built in noise reduction, sophisticated filters for all frequencies, and dynamic adaptation. Only a handful of people knew about these devices, which were so expensive that Thiery never mentioned the fact that someone else must have got his for him. He had always liked listening to his interviews, both at the time and later on his audio recorder, and so he had got a microphone in order to avoid having to depend on the audio recorders of others. It was a good investment; it had led to his being chosen by the French journalists as the spokesperson for the Riverside construction site.\nWhen they arrived at the worksite, Vachey had been able to hear his daughter's heart beat for the last time in her mother's womb. But a month later he never went back to the hospital, just as he had never gone on visiting the family of his wife's lover. The two men were working side by side on the scaffold; their wives' children were also at play on a nearby tree trunk, a tree that would soon vanish under the asphalt.\nDuring that month his wife had only once called his home telephone, and only then to threaten him with a divorce if he did not stop asking and insisting that she find out who her child's father was, and only after being told she could not afford the divorce, and she could not afford a job either, had she then agreed to call the father to tell him he had a baby to pay for and had not bothered to call again.\nTwo weeks later the husband of the child's mother told Thiery that he'd had to go to work and would not be able to say anything for a few days. And it was two weeks later then that his wife died in hospital. It was no accident; the doctors had no idea what had killed her, and in her condition her husband found it difficult to arrange to take her to hospital and so had not been there when she was rushed into emergency care.\nEtienne Dufaux, who had an uncanny knack for being in and around the place where events occurred, had also found out the child's name: Sophie, but there was nothing he could do then or afterwards. The police were not interested in a girl who had never been in their system. No doubt they had many cases of missing girls, and most of the time not even a full DNA profile was available that might help identify them.\nVachey had been called to the hospital by his daughter's mother. He and his daughter had not known each other very long but it was enough to be frightened stiff by her absence.\nWhen he found out the truth about the father of his daughter he'd not asked him for anything, just to pay for the funeral and the child's medical treatment. And yet he had been the one who had looked after her so well. It was only right that something more would be done of course but it was enough that the poor woman's husband had given his wife and their daughter a helping hand while she was sick. His daughter had found out that he was the father of the child for her own reasons. Her mother needed money, but she also needed money to pay off the debts that the woman she loved had left behind. Dufaux found it strange that a young man should be paying for the funeral, and when Vachey had gone on to help the other daughter, Sophie, with the medical bills, he realized that the husband would have to do something about that too, so he had helped Dufaux to get the police information that would help him put pressure on the father so that he paid for everything.\nHe was at a loss for what to do with the newborn child; it was not in his nature to just", "The FHWA announces the availability of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the\nI-390 Corridor Transportation and Land Use Study (CTLS) Project for the development\nof an alternative to relieve existing congestion on the southern end of the I-390\nCorridor and improve access to key commercial/industrial areas in the City of\nLakeville, Town of Mendon, and the Town of Rush.

It also maintains a presence in Europe, the United States and Hong Kong.\nPrior to deploying Qubit, the bank had struggled to find a way to engage its visitors effectively, especially those who were looking at product pages. In many cases, visitors were confused about which products to choose, and found browsing the site tedious. According to Qubit\u2019s customer satisfaction index, site visitors gave the bank a 7 out of 10 rating, with the average satisfaction score being a 6/10, indicating they were largely happy as users, but would not recommend the bank to anyone.\nQubit was given the task of helping the bank to drive user engagement and improve its revenue and customer satisfaction metrics.\nTo find out how the bank could increase site engagement, the Qubit team undertook both qualitative and quantitative research using A/B testing. The bank\u2019s content strategy team provided a list of key metrics to track throughout the process, such as how quickly users were scrolling through a page, the length of user sessions, and how much time they spent on product pages.\nThe A/B test\nA/B testing is a statistical method of finding the most effective approach in a campaign through a series of variations. Qubit used its A/B testing to find out what content and offers users preferred by testing variations.\nThe bank and Qubit tested two strategic hypotheses:\nHow can the bank increase its revenue by making its product pages more shoppable? The test found that users who scrolled through the entire product page were more likely to add an item to their basket.\nDo users trust the recommended product? If users add a product to their basket directly based on their needs, they are more likely complete the task on the product page.\nQubit tested the same content on two different pages, each with slight differences to the layout: one featured a shopping cart, with a simple, green checkmark beside the product the user has added. The other had no shopping cart, and instead of a green checkmark, it had red stars, which represented the number of products the user had added to the basket.\nTest 1: Shopping cart\nTest 2: Products added to basket\nResults: Shopping cart\nThe shopping cart test proved effective, as the green checkmark proved to be more intuitive and easier to understand. As the study was able to measure the results in a relatively short timeframe and demonstrate a considerable return on investment (ROI) from Qubit\u2019s A/B testing, the bank decided to fully deploy it across its 400 stores.\nFor two reasons, Qubit suggested a long A/B testing period:\nConfusing user experience. If users weren\u2019t sure what the checkmark was, they may be confused as to whether the checkmark was clicked or not (this is known as the \u2018double-click effect\u2019).\nProduct recommendations. If the site doesn\u2019t recommend a product, users may assume that they can\u2019t buy it online immediately. Since people tend to be proactive, this would reduce the likelihood of their purchasing the product in-store.\nAdding to the bank\u2019s engagement efforts, Qubit introduced a series of personalised recommendations based on both the visitor\u2019s web history and previous purchases from the bank.\nResults: Recommendations on product pages\nThis feature proved to be very successful, as users were 4 times more likely to add a product to their basket, and 7 times more likely to add a product, if they had a personalised recommendation.\nTo see the full case study detailing the Qubit A/B tests that achieved the following:\nA 110% growth in revenue\nA 7% increase in the average sessions per user per day\nA 50% reduction in daily site visits\nTo view the article, click on this link.\nThis information has been taken and reproduced from Qubit for its own marketing purposes.", "The National Highway Technical Research Program is\ninviting applications for the next round of projects to be\nfunded under the 1993-1998 National Highway Program\n(NHRP).

The portfolio should always contain high-profit risk instruments as part of any asset mix.\nWhat Are Financial Instruments?\nFinancial instruments include physical money, such as coins and paper currency, as well as instruments that are bought and sold, and that have not yet realized value, such as bonds, stock, and currency futures.\nThose who invest in financial instruments purchase a part of a company whose stock is at a certain price. Thus, by purchasing their shares, one investor becomes a part of the corporation.\nStocks are also referred to as shares, equities or equity, and are one of the largest types of financial instruments, valued as a percentage of a company\u2019s total value.\nStocks are often traded on a stock exchange, where traders can buy or sell shares at a designated time and place for a set price, which is the same as or different from the stock\u2019s value at that moment in time.\nStock ownership does not entitle anyone to any control over the company whose stock they own. The value of the stock is typically determined by the market, which is based on supply and demand.\nThe price of a stock is determined by a number of factors, including the value of the company, how well the company is doing, as well as expectations of the company\u2019s future performance, and what the stock might be worth in the relatively near future.\nTrading stock is not for the inexperienced investor as there is large amount of risk involved; while on the other hand, profits can be potentially great because stocks are generally priced to move within a range of 10% of their price.\nStocks can move 100% of their range in as little as one day. This can make it challenging for the risk-adverse investor who is looking for a more stable, lower-risk return. In turn, the risk-averse investor is less likely to make large profits.\nStocks, bonds, and funds are examples of financial instruments and are all used for the purpose of building capital.\nAn investment bank is a financial institution whose primary function is to create and sell financial instruments for companies and governments, such as stocks, bonds and various other types of debt instruments, as well as, for a fee, manage an issuer\u2019s money and securities.\nAlthough different in function from investment banks, mutual funds serve the same overall purpose as investment banks, in that they raise money from investors for a fee and invest those funds on the open market.\nBy pooling investment dollars, they are the largest type of financial institution in the U.S. The most common mutual funds are known as open-end mutual funds which are available at a fixed price.\nOpen-end funds are an open investment, not only in terms of price, but also in regards to the number of shares that can be purchased. As mutual funds become more popular and successful, the capital pools have become larger and as a result the funds have increased their investment activities.\nFor instance, 401(k)s, which were initially only available to large organizations as a way to encourage and incentivize more investment employees, have become much more common. Mutual funds were once only available to high-net-worth individuals seeking high returns on a large investment, but now have become very accessible for individuals.\nMoney market funds are similar to mutual funds in that they pool investment capital together, but instead of buying financial instruments, they lend money to firms who are in need of short-term financing through such means as short-term loans.\nMoney market instruments are also considered low-risk investments in part because they are backed by the value of the firms holding the assets to be collateral, which in turn makes them more secure than other types of investments.\nA 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows you to save an estimated 30% of a portion of every paycheck before", "I'm in the car on a road trip with my sister and my stepdad, going from Ohio to North Carolina, when my phone rings. A text tells me Mom is sick and to call the hospital. Of course, it's an emergency. My sister is going ballistic. I call Dad, who hasn't answered his phone, so I try his cell. My mom is in ICU. The text message says this is an \"emergency,\" but how bad could it be? I text her a question but don't get a response.\nI stop in Illinois to speak with a hospital friend who is a nurse. She seems pretty sure this situation isn't so dire. She suggests I talk with my stepdad. We both call him. Mom has a stroke, and she is on life support. If I get there before the doctor performs surgery, she will be transferred to St. Louis, maybe even saved. After the doctor does surgery, she is going to die \"like a dog\"\u2014Mom, the nurse, the guy from work who calls to send his condolences.\nAwash in a tide of grief, I drive through a hailstorm. I'm in denial. I call to check on my mom. I find our pastor at church and ask if all this is real.\nIn the parking lot of the hotel, a couple of my mom's best friends come outside.\n\"Come talk, hormones,\" someone suggests. The door to my sister's room is open. There are four women there. All are grief stricken: \"We were too good,\" someone mutters. We are all in a fog of loss, trying to make sense of life after this \"foreign\" tragedy. There is no way a nurse would say this is a \"dog\" situation\u2014or not this bad\u2014and be right.\nIn her first week of ICU, my mom was a model patient. She never complained, she was gracious, and her hospital friends were loving, tender, and very much there during each long, sleepless night. It was hard to leave her bedside to go to sleep. She was always in a state of deepest relaxation, her mind soft after the ordeal of major brain surgery. With that relaxation came a strange, deep, hypnotic, and profound feeling of oneness and well-being, a feeling she had not felt in her entire life.\nBut after her brain injury, she woke up\u2014not physically but neurocognitively\u2014and in a matter of a few days, her neurological deficits set in, and she began to go downhill. The reality of her new existence became clearer in her new and sometimes bewildered state. She would ask what happened to her in the hospital and what was wrong.\nIt was this shift, this loss of a new state of relaxation and happiness, that was so profoundly difficult to witness.\nI have spent many days pondering my loss, thinking about grief as a kind of unfinished business. It's true that my mother lives on in me, in our family, and is a shining memory, one that inspires me to think of the best in people. But she is also gone. In some ways it doesn't seem possible at all. How can we get over this loss? How can we be good parents? What will we do? The question I really want to ask is: How is this possible? How can she, in some sense, \"not be\" anymore, and yet, in another sense, be ever-present, because she lives on in me and my sister? This is a paradoxical set of truths so confusing that I feel I need to spend some more time pondering. After my mom's death, we went to her funeral. It was a very difficult and disorienting process. The day after the funeral, my sister and I were driving, listening to music, and I remembered a song that really resonated at the last wedding we went to, before everything happened. The bride and groom danced to it, and I remember thinking, \"This will make a great funeral song.\" So we turned to the tape (remember, this was way back when) and drove for several blocks and stopped at a red light. I hit rewind and played the song again:\nI won't find you\n'Cause you'll always be a part of me.\nI won't need anyone\n'Cause you'll always be the one.\nI won't need anyone\n'Cause I'll always be the one.\nYou'll never fall from my touch.", "As the _New York Times_ 's long-time Washington Bureau chief, David Sanger has had the good and bad fortune to witness, firsthand, the complex evolution of American foreign policy and the presidency over the past few decades.\nPresident Bill Clinton's personal popularity spiked soon after his 1992 election, only to drop precipitously shortly thereafter. Sanger reveals the hidden truth behind how Clinton's political demise began with an affair that had a lasting effect well after the 1998 impeachment.\nPresident Clinton was viewed as ineffective, and Sanger explains how Clinton was ultimately undone by the foreign policy failures of the day, including an American pullout from Somalia, a botched peace plan in Bosnia, and a failed UN Security Council resolution on Iraq following the Persian Gulf War.\nPresident George W. Bush began his presidency with an approval ratings of 90 percent but left office with an 80 percent unfavorability rating. The Bush administration's foreign policy \"legacy\" includes the war in Iraq and the global financial crisis.\nWhile President Barack Obama's administration has its own share of foreign policy missteps, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Agreement stand as some of its greatest accomplishments, both of which Sanger chronicles in _Myths of Empire_.\nSanger weaves together the strands of American foreign policy to reveal an evolved American approach towards the rest of the world, where America is just one nation among many. His work also shows how presidents have struggled to define, and to change, traditional notions of American power\u2014and to what extent they have been successful.\nCHAPTER 1\nThe Death of a President\u2014and the Birth of a Foreign Policy\n**_The President in the Roosevelt Room_**. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)\nMUCH OF DAVID SANGER'S EARLY careers involved watching presidents of every stripe in the Oval Office. In his years as a political correspondent\u2014from the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations through the first eight years of the Obama presidency\u2014he witnessed the evolution of American foreign policy with the nation's leadership. While that time was filled with both crises and relative peace, there was one day that will stand out to anyone who covered international events during that time. It was January 22, 1993, and President Bill Clinton was on the floor of the Oval Office greeting a visiting British prime minister, John Major, when the president collapsed and hit his head.\nAs a correspondent from _The New York Times_ who had begun making his way through the White House press corps and was soon destined to replace Thomas \"Mike\" Barnicle as the White House bureau chief, this day would have to loom large on the map of his political career. The event was both startling and chilling, and it was a scene he has, not surprisingly, never forgotten.\nThe event was startling, to say the least, because the president's collapse and subsequent brush with death was unexpected and out of nowhere. While the Clinton presidency was in full swing, there were no major international events that led Sanger to expect such an occurrence, and there was certainly no hint that something so potentially dire was about to happen that day.\nThe event was chilling to say the least because Sanger knew what the consequences could be. Though he was covering stories at the time, the man who would soon head the _Times_ Washington Bureau was also taking steps to enter the profession, and what was about to happen was an illustration of why \"foreign policy\" and \"reporters\" are two words that should always be spoken together.\nBefore he arrived at The Times in 1993, Sanger spent nearly a decade at _U.S. News & World Report._ That's where he witnessed some of the more memorable foreign policy moments of the day. This includes the first Bush Administration's efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the beginning of the first President Bush's plan to have American forces leave Iraq after the Persian Gulf War. While he was covering those crises, Sanger was also going through the process to become a national security correspondent at _U.S. News._ So not only were the issues of global importance, but they also were a huge opportunity for someone who aspired to cover national security, and Sanger saw the chance as one that was impossible to miss.\nSanger became the _Times'_ National Security Correspondent", "Finding that no genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether respondents are journalists, the court denies petitioners' motion for summary judgment and petitioner's counter motion. Plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion for summary judgment indicates the absence of any doubt that the request for an injunction against the publication of any information obtained in violation of the Shield Law is moot. The case is dismissed with prejudice without costs unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n[**]  On January 27, 1997, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an opinion, [*1]in which the court dismissed with prejudice a First Amendment challenge to the application of the Illinois Shield Law to petitioners, an association of reporters and news organizations, and the individual journalists of the association, including plaintiff, Jeff Kass. The court ruled that the Illinois Shield Law, which provides for immunity for journalists, does not contravene the First Amendment. On May 8, 1997, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Kass, et al v. United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 522 U.S. 1007, 118 S.CT 648 (1997). Petitioner has moved the court for costs and fees pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d), but has requested a stay of the proceedings to allow the Supreme Court time to rule on the jurisdiction of this court. The court granted this motion on July 23, 1997, and ordered a status hearing on September 10, 1997, at 10:30 A.M. counsel, however, have been unable to reach an agreement regarding this hearing. Therefore, the court, sua sponte, is issuing this opinion. The issue before the court is whether counsel for all parties should appear at a second status hearing in this matter or proceed to briefing and argument in this matter and argue the issues in conference with the court at the appointed time for such arguments. The court finds that plaintiff has an interest in having this court render a final advisement of this matter in the interest of bringing resolution to this litigation, and a motion has been filed regarding the filing of the briefs regarding that motions in this case, [*2]although no further action has yet been taken by the court on this matter. The court, therefore, herein orders all counsel to appear in argument about this motion on October 24, 1909 at 9:30 A.M. The remainder of this memorandum order follows.\nThis court was presented with both a First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the Illinois shield law. In his memorandum decision, the district court ruled that the Illinois Shield Law does not contravene the First Amendment, finding that the Illinois Shield Law is a content-neutral law regulating speech of journalists and is subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard. The district court also ruled that the Illinois Shield Law does contravene the First Amendment, finding that the Illinois Shield Law is a content-based law regulating speech of journalists, which is subject to Second Amendment scrutiny. With respect to the Fourteenth Amendment, the district court ruled that the Illinois Shield Law is an exaction which was not authorized by the Illinois General Assembly, and does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because this court has exclusive jurisdiction over First Amendment challenges to Illinois laws. The district court, having rejected both the First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges, entered judgment in favor of the defendants.\n[*3] Both sides have moved, unsuccessfully, for summary judgment. The First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to the Illinois Shield Law [***1]are moot and the challenges to the alleged constitutional violation have been rejected, but the court now finds that some of the procedural questions in this case remain open. The court also finds that plaintiff's failure to oppose petitioner's Rule 54(d) motion is tantamount to a waiving of the proceeding, as his failure to participate in the on-going procedure has been detrimental to this court. The court also has received no response to its Order to Show Cause, and has not received from petitioner any request for the court to vacate the entry of the Order to Show Cause, despite the fact that petitioner's", "The ICT sector in Malaysia has a well-developed market and, in total, contributes RM52 billion towards Malaysia's GDP. It generates an estimated 8% of Malaysia's total export growth and accounts for 32% of the total export value of the country. Malaysia is in the midst of achieving several key milestones such as creating a competitive regulatory environment and promoting technological development that can benefit Malaysia's economy and its citizens.\nWith a strategic vision to transform the ICT landscape and create a competitive environment which facilitates ICT business growth and development, the Malaysian IT industry has also evolved significantly as one of the major contributors to Malaysia's growing economy.\nSince the turn of the Millennium, Malaysia's national IT ecosystem has significantly expanded, benefitting from a range of initiatives such as the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), MSC Malaysia, the 13th Malaysia Plan, the National ICT Strategic Road- Map, High Performance Computing, ICT for Oil and Gas Sector and ICT for Agriculture Sector as well as enhanced infrastructure and skills development.\nSeveral key milestones have been achieved to date; these include:\nThe successful launch of the Government's initiative, the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). In 1996, the\nMultimedia Supercorridor (MSC) was launched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed as a strategic vision to transform the ICT\nlandscape and create a competitive entrepreneurial eco-system that would benefit Malaysia and its citizens.\nThe MSC was established as a high growth investment zone where new and leading-edge ICT applications and services development could take place on par with the Silicon Valley. It had a strategic focus on six main development clusters of:\nContent Development and Information Communications;\nEnterprise Computing and Software;\nEnterprise Data Processing;\nKnowledge Processing (KPOs); and\nNew Media.\nIn 2007, the new administration led by Prime Minister Mohamed Najib Tun Abdul Razak unveiled a National ICT Strategic Road Map, a technology-based economic growth plan aimed at making Malaysia a\nsuccessful ICT hub in ASEAN by 2015, thereby, building on the momentum from the MSC. The plan was focused towards achieving three strategic goals: (1) to achieve world-class standards in the development of the ICT industry, (2) to create a fully developed digital society with world-class telecommunications, and (3) to maximise Malaysia's potential as leader and a centre of choice in the ASEAN region.\nSolaris Education Sdn Bhd\nMentari International School\nTeknokom", "\"Nu\" has become a prefix to so many of the buzzwords that describe mobile platforms, publisher strategies, and user experiences. The industry is now abuzz with \"mobilizing\" content, creating \"mobile-optimized\" products, and exploring \"mobile commerce.\" So what defines a \"mobile-optimized\" product? What makes it \"mobile?\"\nWhat constitutes a mobile-optimized product?\nA mobile-optimized product allows users to access a mobile application, a mobile Web site, or a \"mobile-optimized\" application.\nWhen I speak about mobile apps and native applications, I'm referring to those applications that can, for technical and business reasons, be only available in their dedicated app store, to only a subset of users accessing that store or those users meeting the technical criteria required to even access the store. In that case, \"mobile-optimized\" refers to an app that is \"form-factored\" so that the screen and user interface will scale down to smaller device screens, without altering the app itself.\nNative apps are not the same as mobile apps. For more on the difference see our July-August 2011 report Mobile Is Now.\nA mobile Web site also allows users to access the same content in a mobile device context, and is often viewed as a lower cost and less risky way to launch a product. Mobile Web development generally uses some of the same techniques as a native application would use: CSS media queries to adjust to different screen sizes, for example. And mobile Web sites can often be easily \"mobilized\" by simply shrinking the desktop Web site's size.\nHow does a mobile-optimized product differ from a responsive design?\nResponsive design is a technique to make a \"desktop\" Web site compatible with mobile devices. It is not a design or a technique reserved for a \"mobile-optimized\" site.\nIn many cases, a \"mobile-optimized\" site can also have a responsive design\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, can work well on mobile devices.\nA responsive design is simply a technique of optimizing Web pages, which means that the same file and the same content may be accessed by mobile devices using different screen sizes. The content within a responsively \"tailored\" site may look slightly different than that of a site designed to work entirely on a tablet or only for a mobile phone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut still use the same HTML and CSS techniques.\nThe difference here is whether mobile devices are the primary context in which the product is accessed. This means the same HTML and CSS can be used, but the way the content is displayed or manipulated is dependent upon the specific form factor of that device.\nFor example, if a user is browsing a magazine's Web site on a tablet, the content displays differently than if that user was accessing it on a desktop computer. This is because the larger screen allows for more content on the same screen area, and as more content is allowed to share the same screen real estate, the more content needs to be displayed by the browser in a way that makes it attractive and accessible for the user.\nAt Newsweek/Daily Beast, we used responsive CSS to control how the content displayed on a screen size, then used native app features and mobile-optimized sites to build a \"mobilized\" experience. This was accomplished by using native device capabilities to determine the form factor of the device on which the content is accessed and using that information to alter the content that is delivered to the device.\nNewsweek/Daily Beast began to create mobile experiences by mobilizing the user interface of Newsweek's Web site using CSS media queries to change the Web content based on the context of the device on which the experience is accessed. Content was rendered in HTML and CSS as \"tile-based\" and scaled to fit the horizontal screen, as most Web users access the Web from this orientation.\nThis was followed by the creation of a native application to provide a tablet-optimized experience for readers of all digital devices. Tablets provide a screen and resolution that allows for a more immersive experience on the screen that enables one to engage content in a much different way than any Web or mobile experience. To accomplish this, Newsweek/Daily Beast used JavaScript and native Web services to access Newsweek content, with a goal of delivering content in a fluid way that allows readers to interact with news in its original and natural form.\nThe native product allows for a more flexible and rich-looking display of content. It also allows for a greater degree of interactivity within the content. These two elements allow for a more immersive experience, one that is in line with what we expect of applications outside of the Web browser, and one that is not reliant on a set of Web standards for interactivity.\nNewsweek/Daily Be", "In the year 1982, the world is plagued by an unexplained virus pandemic that has taken millions of lives. Those who survive are not immune to the effects of the epidemic, but a mysterious group from China sends the Doctor, Sarah, and Harry to Hong Kong to help investigate the cause of the pandemic. There, the Doctor and Sarah discover an elaborate plot involving the Nestene Autons and two people in particular: a man named Raston, and a man named Fendale. Back in Great Britain, an elderly man named Lord Gray is in deep need of financial assistance, and he agrees to help the Doctor and a team of UNIT soldiers in exchange for money. The Doctor and his allies soon discover there is something to this virus--something sinister that has the Autons helping in the planning. But who is the real mastermind behind this worldwide scourge? What do the Autons and Gray have to do with it? And how does the Doctor's old friend K-9 fit into this scheme of things?\n\"The Black Curtain\" is a rather interesting story, and one that I really enjoyed reading. The plot is quite intriguing as the Doctor, Sarah, Harry, and a team of UNIT soldiers do battle with both the Autons and Chinese agents on a mission to Hong Kong, on the hunt for more information about the virus that has seemingly brought the world economy to its knees. Along the way, the Doctor does some sleuthing to figure out that it's not the virus itself that he has to worry about, but an intelligent mastermind who's manipulating the whole situation using the virus. The virus itself poses a threat to humanity as well, though--and one that the Doctor and crew have to stop as well.\n\"The Black Curtain\" is a story that I liked very much because it kept me guessing about who the mastermind was until close to the very end. The entire story is built on these multiple layers of mystery--the virus pandemic itself, the Autons, Gray, and the mastermind behind it all. I love to see so many plot elements intersect and tie together on the page, and \"The Black Curtain\" was a great example of a story that did this exceedingly well. I also really found this story to be very thoughtful about the characters of Sarah and Harry, and I really like to see that in stories. Sarah and Harry have been a great addition to the team, and it's always great to see their relationship get closer and better defined.\nI'm not sure how much I can say about the Doctor and Sarah's investigation and their meeting with Lord Gray and his niece in China, because a lot of it remains a mystery, but I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot in general. It's another story where we see the Doctor and Sarah and Harry all interacting and doing battle with Autons in this adventure, and their personalities and quirks are all very nicely highlighted in the story. It's fun to see how their skills and personality work well together as a team, because they're definitely a group of people who can balance and counterbalance each other well. I also liked how the story played with multiple characters and how that all came together and tied together into this intricate plot.\nI think one of my favourite things about the story was how it really made me wonder who exactly was the true mastermind behind this whole thing. I thought the author did a great job with the revelation about the real mastermind at the end of the story, and this story definitely kept me hanging on that count. I loved trying to figure out who did what--who was behind the virus epidemic, who was behind the killing of the Auton workers in the factory, and who was trying to get the Doctor to make a particular deal. This story had a lot of pieces to it, and I liked how they all came to play out and how the author worked to make sense of it all at the end.\nI also have to mention that it's been so nice to see more of Harry's and Sarah's characters developed even further. They both get to do important things that make sense for each of them personally, and that's always great to see. The more each of them gets to develop their characters, the more that we can all connect with the characters--and the more this is a great fit for them as companions. I love that we've gotten to see some development between Harry and Sarah too. They've always come across as great characters, but I liked getting to see them come even closer in this story.\n\"The Black Curtain\" is a nice story with a complex plot and mystery behind the true mastermind, as well as multiple other things to puzz", "A study by University of Maryland researchers found that a 10 minute\nwalk a day for 150 days resulted in an approximate 5 percent\nreduction in arterial pressure and resulted in about 91\ncentimeters of mercury decline.\nThe study's goal was to study the effect of a safe and inexpensive\nform of exercise, which could be administered at a hospital, and\ndetermine how much of the total reduction in the measured\narterial pressures (Systolic and Diastolic) could be related to\nThis study evaluated 36 moderately overweight to obese individuals\n(BMI - 27 to 37.2) who had their blood pressure monitored at the\nbaseline and then 4 additional times over the next 5 months.\nEach participant was given a Pedometer to monitor his/her steps\nduring each waking hour for a period of 150 consecutive days.

Pearce, Global Video Editor, and Multimedia, Hearst\nWhen is a news story not a news story? When it's video! In the past, Hearst Corporation, one of the world's largest multinational media, information, and services companies that includes newspapers, TV and radio broadcasting, magazines, and websites -- has used video to support its text-based news content. In fact, video was sometimes relegated to the bottom of the article for whatever reasons.\nNo more, said senior managers in the company's Global Media Operations Department. As the saying goes, \"A picture speaks a thousand word.\" Hearst is working to re-define this old adage.\nFor instance, when the newswire reported that Apple's latest iPhone would be announced in three different models, one with a fingerprint scanner, one with a bigger battery, one with more memory, we took the story and added video and produced it as a five-minute online video package. As soon as news of the iPhones was released, we could add in graphics and b-roll, and we were publishing our five-minute video by early afternoon on the day of the announcement.\nVideo for Hearst is not just about the breaking news.\nOur strategy is to think of unique and compelling formats to augment the written news, not in a separate channel, but within that mainstream article. For example, a profile of a newsmaker may be enhanced with a video interview. The video could consist of a series of interview questions, some of which the reporter asks, and some of which the audience asks. In this way, we make the written story come alive and make the journalist look like a more experienced interviewer who asks the most insightful questions.\nWe use video to illustrate complex news stories, but we use video that doesn't just illustrate how good (or bad) things are -- the reporter asks three smart questions to get a smart answer.\nIn the above example, the story is illustrated with video questions and answers: The reporter in this case was the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza who has an incredible ability to get really important answers about politics and policy. He's become one of the most important interviewers in the country because he's able to ask the hard questions to people who otherwise wouldn't answer them. This is a very important example of what we can and should be doing with multimedia content online.\nAnother example is a profile of a sports hero who has achieved great things in his life -- we can capture something of that greatness by putting together a compelling, multimedia story, combining interviews, an infographic, timelines and great video that will attract the audience and that make their story feel a little more special. The more that we put multimedia elements, the better for the article.\nThe video-on demand team is also working to integrate the video with the text and to provide unique access to the story for readers. In some cases, a breaking news story may be accompanied by a live video stream of the action so people can hear first-hand what is happening to know the situation as it is unfolding.\nIn another example, we are looking to add an audio-visual interactive element to our coverage of the presidential election, and we are also using social media and mobile to amplify our video coverage.\nOur mobile team will be using the video capabilities such as Facebook and Google+ to share the content as much as possible. They can do live video that anyone around the world can join.\nAt Hearst, we are focusing on finding a unique and compelling form to augment to the story in an attractive, multimedia package. We are trying to use technology to create content that enhances the text in the story. We believe multimedia is a powerful medium on which news can be told in different yet compelling ways.\nInnovations in multimedia online content are still at a nascent stage, and a lot of the elements that we will use today may not exist again in two years. For example, we may be using 3-D video and holograms next year.\nPRESENTATION NOTES:\nWe want to make the story come alive for the reader. There are now lots more video channels online to share this story. We are focused on creating content that enhances how the story is told, on creating video that people will want to share, on creating unique videos that no one else may have yet.\nWe believe that multimedia is a good way for newsrooms to tell their story online.", "The Board discussed a letter from Lt. Col. Mike Jones dated December 20, 2005. This letter concerns a complaint filed against Officer Shane Coffin by Ms. Jane Doe. She alleges he used his police power to intentionally create a disturbing situation, cause an embarrassing or oppressive situation, and created a reasonable apprehension of disturbing intrusion into the enjoyment of a private zone of seclusion. Jane Doe alleges that an unknown person made a 911 call to dispatch concerning an alleged domestic violence incident at her residence in April 2005. Coffin and Officer Eric Gore responded to 911, and an ambulance was called. Jane Doe alleges that after her husband was taken to the hospital via ambulance, she was told she had to leave the residence or he would be arrested on a domestic violence charge. After her husband returned to the residence, a report was taken alleging domestic violence, and an Emergency Protective Order (EPO) was received by law enforcement. According to Jane Doe, her husband was arrested as a result of the EPO and charged with domestic violence. Coffin was the arresting officer in this instance. Jane Doe alleges in the complaint letter that Coffin and another officer entered her bedroom and removed her personal property from the residence. Jane Doe alleges that her husband was falsely charged with domestic violence and that he was never given a copy of the report or allowed to know his rights concerning the domestic violence investigation. Jane Doe alleges that she did not know that her husband committed this act and has never given him permission to do what he has done. Coffin and Gore did not return with a copy of the report until a year later, and a copy had been retained by Jane Doe at this time. The report was made available to the couple under the Uniform Disposition and Disposition of Law Enforcement Records (UDDLER) Law. Gore allegedly also made a threat to arrest Jane for refusing to turn over her rights under the UDDLER law. After a number of complaints were filed against Coffin and Gore, the police chief ordered Coffin to attend ethics training. Coffin allegedly told Jane Doe that the ethics training was mandatory; however, it is not mandatory. Coffin told Jane Doe that he was not giving her a copy of the report because all other reports had been returned to them and that she could have her copies if she found copies of the other reports. Coffin allegedly told Jane Doe that she needed to make prior arrangements with dispatch to have a copy of the report sent to an alternative location or picked up by her. At dispatch, dispatch informed Jane Doe that they do not have copies of reports on hand and that a copy of the report would be available after three weeks. Coffin and Gore allegedly told the couple that they would not release the copy of the report to them; however, they allegedly released the report to dispatch. In her complaint letter, Jane Doe alleges that Coffin abused his powers as a police officer. In a response letter to Board members, Lt. Col. Mike Jones dated January 27, 2006, stated that the allegation of police abuse contained in the Jane Doe Complaint was unfounded. The case against Coffin was reviewed by Sgt. L.W. Mays. On January 6, 2006, he sent information to Lt. Col. Jones concerning the case. In his letter, Mays stated, \u201cThere is no probable cause to support charges of domestic violence, false arrest or police abuse that can be presented against Officer Coffin, pertaining to this investigation.\u201d Lt. Col Jones stated that she did not think the letter was conclusive because the case could go to court. The Board discussed other issues pertaining to this case and asked Sgt. Mays to review the case again. This is to advise Sgt. Mays that the Board does not want him to look for a reason why the report was returned later than reported, but to inform him that if he cannot determine that there was no abuse, the case needs to be referred to the Police Chief. The Board wishes to thank the District Attorney\u2019s office for responding to this complaint. The board does not know if a prosecutor has been assigned to this case, but a follow-up is in order with the Deputy DA in charge of domestic violence. It is understood that Lt. Col. Jones would be responsible for this follow-up, but if it means she takes the lead on that issue, it would be a waste of", "Rejecting appeals for leniency\nA 24-year-old man in Kuala Lumpur is believed to be the latest\nMuslim man to be arrested for apostasy from Islam for allegedly\nconverting to other faiths.\nFeb. 18: A man believed to be Riduan Masmud, 24, was sentenced\nto a mandatory death sentence in Malaysia's first known case in\nwhich an alleged apostate was charged under a special Islamic\nlaw that outlaws Muslims from abandoning their faith.\nMasmud was sentenced to death under Section 126 of the Malaysian\nPenal Code, which was implemented to protect and preserve\nreligion in the country where the Malay-Muslim population\naccounts for nearly two-thirds of the country's 24 million people.\nThe section says that a person shall be sentenced to death if\nhe or she commits the offence of apostasy or the teaching of\nanything contrary to the established muslim religion by force, by\ninducement, by threats or by any kind of fraud which makes that\nperson an apostate from the muslim religion.\nThe section was inserted into Malaysia's penal code in April,\n1988.

In May of this year, NABA formed a\nsubcommittee task force at the national level to take\nmore aggressive action.  Their mission is to focus\nefforts on establishing, in cooperation with industry,\nscholarship programs to attract minority students and to\nprovide incentives for accounting educators to create\nprograms on financial literacy, with an emphasis on\npreparing students for their careers in the accounting\nThe ASA has previously\nsupported various NABA endeavors, including the\nestablishment of the Scholarship/Internship Fund\nSponsored by the NABA, which made awards available\nto deserving African American students or to those who\nare eligible to become members of NABA.  To be considered\nfor the award, an applicant was required to\ndemonstrate a commitment by performing a minimum of\n15 hours per week in an accounting related field.\nThe most recent awards made by the fund were for the\nfall 1994 academic semester.\nThe ASA has not yet committed financial\nsupport for the establishment of this scholarship fund.\nHowever, the ASA is optimistic that with the\nparticipation of the accounting profession and others\nsupport can be forthcoming.\nIn 1994, the ASA joined a number of other professional\nassociations and organizations as a minority member\nassociate of the Minority Scholarship Fund of Accounting\n(MSFA), an affiliate of the American Institute of\nCPAs.  Through grant funding from the American Institute\nof CPAs (AICPA), the MSFA provides scholarship funding\nfor minority students enrolled in accounting programs\napproved by the AICPA.\nThe Minority Scholarship\nof Accounting ( MSFA ), was formed in 1985 by the\nAmerican Institute of CPAs Minority Task Force to\naddress the concerns of the growing number of American\nIndians, Hispanic Americans and African Americans in\nAmerican industry, as shown in the statistics presented\nin the 1994 U.S. Census Report.\nStatistics show that the U.S.\npopulation grew by 7.9% during 1991 and 1992, and the\nmajority of this population growth was due, in part, to\nfaster than expected birth rates among Hispanic American\nwomen and Asians, primarily from Korean women.  The\nrate of growth for minority populations was much higher\nthan the non-Hispanic white population.\nIn 1993, according to the Minority Educational\nOpportunities Service ( MESOS ), more than half a\nmillion African Americans will enter higher education for\nthe first time seeking careers in the accounting\nprofession.  The MESOS estimates that for African\nAmerican accountants, the job market is projected to\nincrease by one million from 1993 to 2002, resulting in an\nincrease of approximately 41% by 2005.\nFrom an analysis of the\n1990 U S. Census, there were approximately 19,936 African\nAmerican CPAs who were working actively as partners,\nemployees, independent contractors or business owners.\nThe average age for entering the accounting profession\nis late 20's, early 30's, and the gender of the majority\nof participants, in both practice and industry, are\nmale.  There were very few females and\nminorities in management, partners", "WIT and WAG members joined on June 5th at The Coffee Factory to celebrate International Museum Day 2015.\nA number of art critics from the Cradle of Art were invited to lead discussion on the current art scene at the Coffee Factory.\nThe day was kicked off with a keynote address by local art expert, art critic and curator Mr Nafasi Shihabu, who highlighted the fact that Dar es Salaam has \u202fbeen host to \u202fthe most dynamic art space in East Africa \u2013 if not even in the rest of the African continent. It has been a hub for artists and art collectors for over five decades.\nMr Nafasi reminded us how in \u202f21th centuries, art has become much more accessible to people in Dar.\nIt\u2019s possible to be an art connoisseur without any art background, as art is now everywhere. We have museums like Arusha Gallery and The Coffee Factory as well as many outdoor and public art spaces in our city.\nThroughout the talk it became evident that the Cradle of Art is a key to understanding the past, present and future of Dar es Salaam.\nOn May 13 we welcomed six of the most passionate art lovers in the city to our WIT and WAG art day at The Coffee Factory.\nThe Coffee Factory is a leading art space in Dar es Salaam, and for this event the owners opened up the entire venue so we could enjoy the view, as well as the extensive collection of art at the coffee shop.\nWe had a guided tour around the current exhibit, and art was discussed by some of the most influential art critics in the city \u2013 Mr Nafasi, Mr Bokwa , Ms Samburu and Dr Bado, as well as a few members of WIT (myself and Ms Ndee) and a few WAG members.\nThe art critics gave us a guided tour around the current exhibit, with Ms Samburu being our tour guide \u2013 she\u2019s very knowledgeable about the art on display.\nThe tour highlighted the history between Africa and Europe since the late 14th century when the first Portuguese explorers reached the African coastline, right up to the modern-day works by a local Dar es Salaam artist who show the growing urban areas that are rapidly replacing traditional African lands.\nThe Cradle of Art exhibition ran from March to May 2015, and featured local and international work from the TAZ Collection, local art studios, artists-in-residence, the Kili International Auction and the MUMA (Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art) collection, as well as an ongoing collaboration with local art centers such as Arusha Gallery, Art Space, Nafasi Art Space, the Tanzanian National Museum, the University of Dar es Salaam, the Tanzania Museum Society and local art colleges.\nA number of art critics from the Cradle of Art were invited to lead discussion on the current art scene at the Coffee Factory. And while we had a group of about 40 people who were mostly Tanzanian members of the WIT and WAG groups, the event was also open to the public and the general manager of The Coffee Factory \u2013 Mr Rene \u2013 told me that over 350 people attended the event and looked at the art.\nIt brought a lot of people together that can enjoy the art as well as enjoy the coffee at the coffee shop at the same time! If any more art exhibitions pop up near the WIT and WAG locations from now on, Mr Rene told me that he was happy to open his coffee shop up again to host WIT and WAG\u2019s art group!\nThe day was kicked off with a keynote address by local art expert, art critic and curator Mr Nafasi Shihabu, who highlighted the fact that the Cradle of Art is a key to understanding the history of Tanzania. Without the Cradle of Art, it would be very challenging to understand Tanzania\u2019s history in the modern day.\nThe Coffee Factory art exhibition brought a lot of people together that can enjoy the art as well as enjoy the coffee at the coffee shop at the same time!\nAs the art critic, when we are at an art gallery, we\u2019re more likely to be asked a question that we feel like we\u2019ve asked before: \u201cWhat\u2019s on display here?\u201d\nWell, what\u2019s on display is nothing at all!\nInstead of the exhibition space being full of work, we see white walls around \u2013 and we", "As the world enters a new Millennium, one of the key\ncharacteristics of its news organisations becomes more and more important: the ability to move\ntowards a more local and more personal model of the future, while still taking a global\nThe impact of the Net on news companies' business models is still not understood by\nmost of the industry, yet it is not surprising that the ability to use the Internet as a\nmedium is one of the first steps publishers around the world are taking in developing new\nbusiness models. Local news companies are at the epicentre of this trend as they move to\nreach the large and fast growing Net news consumer market - the Net Generation - that is\nappearing in ever increasing numbers in most developed countries.\nThe Net Generation is characterised by what can broadly be called a low attention\nspan and a general lack of patience with long-form \"journalism\". Because today's Net\nGeneration has such a short attention span, news organisations must also build shorter, more\nlocal and more personal news stories, and give users as much choice as possible, even at\nthe expense of quality and expertise.\nIt appears that local news sites are already the most popular on the Net. For a news\nsite, this brings a considerable opportunity simply because these are the most likely news\nusers to start reading and staying with such a relatively new form of news, and the more\nthey stay, the better the chance for commercial success.\nBecause of the Net Generation's short attention span, there also appear to be opportunities for news organisations'\ntraditional offline channels - print and broadcast media - to adapt their online strategy,\nespecially considering that the Net generation was born before these channels were ever\ninvented. It's too early to understand the exact commercial opportunities, but news\norganisations could start to develop a strategy that is based on giving some of their news\na \"digital soul\" - the ability to work \"online AND off\".\nBecause of its relative immaturity, one of the toughest challenges for news organisations\nusing the Internet as a medium to reach the Net Generation is building a sufficient\ndatabase of local online consumers.\nThis is not a simple task since many news organisations are not that adept at\norganising these consumers. In fact, one of the challenges for many traditional news\ncompanies may very well be a lack of staff with substantial skills in Net technology. It\nmay be important for them to consider a possible partnership with other companies having\nthe expertise they need, especially considering the current lack of technology skills in\nmany news organisations' editorial departments.\nThere seem to be various interesting directions the Net Generation is taking the news\nbusiness. Perhaps the news business will no longer be dominated by large, global news\ncompanies or perhaps it will. All is, of course, a matter of time before the industry can\nreally determine how effective these new business models are in reaching the Net\nGeneration and its \"demand for personal stories\".", "1917\nWhen he heard the sounds, first he just stayed still.\nBullet or shrapnel?

Above him, he looked at the blue and the flames, and the sky and the sky. He looked at the flames and the smoke and thought of her, of his wife.\nSuddenly it didn't matter what he was or who he was and that house going up in flames didn't matter, and his face didn't matter when he looked up and thought of her. The machine gun was closer and fire closer and the flames hotter, and he still didn't move. He still didn't take a breath. He still just lay there.\nThe Germans sang to the houses burning, the French in their yard, the ones with the machine guns. Just a minute later, just an instant later, they'd shot him.

The study as presented was unsubstantiated by research data and an editorial comment regarding the study's ethical issues. A review of the scientific literature on using cloning to create living animals indicates that the technology has not yet been perfected and will take years before the technique is practical. Cloning is not a substitute for proper breeding techniques that are already being successfully utilized in farming and animal husbandry. Re-creating Woolly Mammoths is a political issue and not a science issue. Further, the article fails to mention that the proposed mammoth-cloning process would also entail the use of cells from a live elephant.\n\"Laboratory clone of mammoth,\" a news article by Charles Choi, posted to Scientific American, October 7, 2010 (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id= labs-new-mammoth).\nIn this article, Japanese scientists reported that they cloned and grew a partial elephant (Jurassic Park 2-style) from an elephant frozen in 1974. (They did not claim that DNA from the frozen samples would make a complete elephant, however.) Apparently these scientists are also working on creating a clone of the extinct Woolly Mammoth. While it's good that scientists are trying to develop cloning technology, and a new technique would be a step forward, the story isn't ready for publication.\nIt may take some time before a complete clone could be produced. The frozen DNA samples used by the Japanese scientists had some errors in it. Dr. Ross Hoffman, an expert on genome regulation at the University of Arizona, told the Associated Press (October 7) that they might have errors of 10%-20% because the cells may have been damaged or some of the DNA information may have been disrupted.\nThe article also fails to mention that creating a clone or a living being from someone's DNA is a politicized and religiously charged process. The article quotes Peter Duesberg, a leader of the HIV denial movement, as having pointed to the fact that scientists at several institutions had been trying for years to clone Woolly Mammoth tissue from elephant material in the 1990s without success. His quote, \"I do think the mammoth will be cloned in three to 10 years,\" should not be quoted without a clarifying sentence that this is not a scientific opinion, but a political statement on the current scientific paradigm.\nDr. Jonathan Weiner, a professor who studies reproductive technology ethics at the University of California at San Diego's department of family and preventive medicine, said in a press release, that his team \"tried to find as much information as we could about the people involved, and we could not get a definitive answer to a fundamental question: How much are these people going to profit from this?\"\nThe article contains several other scientific statements about the technique used to clone the mammoth that are without any supporting evidence in the peer reviewed scientific literature.\nSUMMARY/CONCLUSION: The article does not report on a breakthrough in genetic engineering. Instead, it is political propaganda. The article may be true, but that is not the question. The purpose of the article is to promote a political agenda and generate publicity.

And those people who believe in this test and use it, also believe that in the United States there is over 3 million people with HIV--HIV--AIDS.  We also have over 42 million people in the United States today living with one of 13 different sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). Why? Why is this true?\nTo find out, let us look at what these HIV tests are, were and are being used for according to some of the people that have used it, and then apply this knowledge to the numbers being published nationally over the last 15 years. Since these tests are used by the medical industry, how is it that a medical professional would give a HIV test without any testing of the patient for what they are supposed to be testing for? What would it accomplish? And why?\nAccording to this National Cancer Institute [NCI] paper:\n\"The HIV test panel is a multiplex immunoassay. It is a combination of two immune-based assays: ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] and western blot. Both assays measure antibodies to HIV-1 and -2 surface proteins.\"\nThe HIV test assay was the first commercialized immunoassay to be used at a large scale for the HIV antibody diagnostic test. ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] tests are known to be unreliable for diagnosis of a disease, because they are known to produce numerous unrelated false positives. The ELISA test used by the NCI is just one of the many ELISA tests being used, most of which are used in conjunction with other tests including the Western Blot test, in an attempt to produce more accurate test results, but they are still unreliable because they are all prone to producing false false positives as well as unrelated false positives, which produce no more accurate test result than the ELISA test used alone. The ELISA test has been around since 1977 and was first commercialized for the HIV antibody test by an anonymous entrepreneurial genius.\nThe problem with this ELISA test is that it does not discriminate between antibodies to any of the retroviruses [retroviruses are not viruses and cannot be tested for with an HIV antibody test] that have the capability of producing the symptoms associated with what is now called AIDS [also not a viral disease] and those that only have the ability to produce a transcription error (which can be done by virtually anything we eat in normal quantities, including the foods that most Americans eat). We also have several papers that indicate the problem of viral cross reactions in a host population. In 1980, before HIV testing became available, I went under contract as a consultant to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] where, from 1980 to 1986, I worked closely with the HIV test, especially the ELISA test, as they were attempting to test the antibody titers in patients testing for possible exposure to or infection with HIV. We also have some papers discussing and comparing the different tests.\nAfter over 20 years and over $10 billion spent on research, the FDA's AIDS advisory panel recommended at their meeting on July 15, 1985, the use of the antibody [antibodies are also not viral] tests for HIV-1 and HIV-2 as an aid to screen out blood donors for donating blood to AIDS patients, as well as to determine if a transfused patient had either HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, or both, at the time of his/her blood transfusion, even if they had a negative test for HIV-1/HIV-2 at the time of the blood transfusion before the AIDS virus became evident within them--it is a post test, where most physicians are testing patients before the post test to look for the antibody titers and if they are positive then they are labeled with the", "The PSC is requesting bids from publishers interested in serving as printer of the newspaper.

This has occurred, because information technology has become an essential tool that needs to be used, in order to achieve progress, success and efficiency in their processes, productivity, and production. This technology is associated with the use of computers, hardware and software. It is used to manage businesses and provide more efficient services, which also helps in saving money and time.\nHowever, with the advancement of information technology, a number of new changes have occurred in many business sectors. These changes have occurred, because information technology has allowed organizations to save more money, increase security, and also to improve overall productivity. These are the factors that have made a significant number of these organizations, to use the services of an Information Technology consulting organizations that are in the specialized field of information technology. There are also organizations that provide information technology outsourcing services. In order to get such services, it is very important to analyze the advantages of getting these services and also the disadvantages that are connected to getting these services. This essay will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of information technology outsourcing and will develop conclusions on the information.\nIn today\u2019s business organizations, information technology outsourcing is becoming the most common practice in the industry sectors. It is becoming very popular because of the number of advantages that associated with this particular service. Outsourcing Information Technology can help to lower the operating costs, it will help to increase productivity and quality of services, and also the most significant advantage is, that it can save a lot of time and money for organizations, which need to get such services and have little time to do. These can be achieved by hiring a person or an organization that will provide a wide range of different IT services. It is also becoming an efficient business strategy and is becoming more and more popular in the business community. This can also give the organization the flexibility to use their services and expertise, without having to purchase these services and they have the disadvantage of having to purchase such services.\nThe advantages of information technology outsourcing to a specialized IT consulting company include the significant increase in productivity and efficiency. When an organization outsources the IT services to a specialized company, which provides complete services to business and to the organizations, the organization can reduce the time that has spent on doing these important tasks. These are time consuming tasks and can be managed more efficiently by such a company, as they have specialized knowledge and expertise. In the business organization, most times, many employees may get involved in the IT tasks, which can increase costs. This is because these IT tasks are time consuming or complex tasks. However, the specialized company may reduce the time that it takes to conduct the IT operations and even to solve the problems of the operations. This can save the organization a lot of time and can save costs. Even the time that may be saved by certain employees of the organization may save time for them to complete other tasks that need to be performed in their organization. It can also reduce the costs related to training and management. When organizations hire companies to provide the IT operations, they do not need to hire staff for such a task and they do not have to train them or manage the individuals. All of these can help to increase efficiency, as well as to reduce time and costs. A specialized company that is experienced in providing IT services can increase the productivity of an organization. They can provide quality of services; their expertise in the field will help. At the same time, in hiring such companies, organizations can focus on their area of expertise and they can concentrate on their own work. This method, of focus on their area of expertise, allows organizations to increase their productivity and efficiency and also by using specialized information technology companies, they can be able to increase quality and quality of products and services of the organization.\nInformation technology outsourcing has certain disadvantages too. Although it has advantages, it has disadvantages too. Some of these disadvantages can be reduced and others cannot be. But organizations have to think of these consequences and it can be useful for the companies. First,", "CMG\u2019s local media assets are the lifeblood of its business. And that\u2019s not changing.

The traditional media companies that have led advertising historically lack a comparable grasp of the digital space and have not yet built any viable digital revenue strategies to counter this challenge.\n\u2022 We are not only the largest local media operator in the industry, but we are also the only national operator that has the opportunity to reap the benefits of our unique local marketplaces and brands that are embedded in our markets nationally.\n\u2022 Digital advertising has proven to be a viable business, and we are committed to building a world class sales organization that can service our brand\u2010focused customers and create compelling content and experiences for consumers. We see the digital space as a great opportunity to continue to enhance our local media brands.\n\u2022 As the local marketplaces we serve evolve, we must also evolve. Digital offers an opportunity to create new products, services, and experiences that can lead our local communities. It also offers an opportunity to optimize performance and enhance the core value of our local media brands.\nOur transformation from a traditional media company to a digital transformation has not been uncommon. In fact, the largest technology companies in the world have used this approach to re\u2010engineer traditional industries and create a new industry category. We are embarking on this opportunity for the same reason: to maximize performance for our local marketplaces and drive a new era of value for our stockholders.", "The U.S. Department of Commerce is publishing this Request for\nApplications RFA# 5-823 to solicit applications to conduct research under the New\nApplications RFA# 5-823.

This is about so much more than data journalism.\nA New Opportunity for J-Schools\nWe're seeing an explosion of data being generated every day on a huge range of topics. Think how much information journalists can take in - and then they have to make sense of all of it. This is an important thing to do, for journalists and media organisations as a whole. As we explore new approaches to what we do, how can we ensure we use data effectively as we do it?\nAs the Web evolves to give us more and more ways to search for and interact with information, we as news organisations are also increasingly being called upon to make sense of that information and present the information back to the consumer in a form that's useful for the news consumer. This is about a lot more than data journalism.\nIn the short history of my working life I have seen many examples of traditional journalism having this capacity, but very few examples of data news being created. This means there's a lot of things we're still exploring and learning about - how to think about structure, how to define what makes something newsworthy, the implications of new structures on the journalism craft. News organisations today also still struggle with issues of verification, accountability, security, and the business model of the future.\nBut we're rapidly learning how to do it, thanks largely to the emergence of the modern newsroom as a place where the creative and technical skills of journalism meet the tools and methods of computer science and information technology.\nData journalism and the craft of storytelling\nFor much of my career as a professional journalist, I was a practitioner - part of a team that put out a newspaper, made television, and on the surface did something different to, perhaps, most other people in journalism. It was only a few years ago that I started to realise what we were actually doing was crafting stories. That the stories we were crafting were simply more complex than those other news organisations were able to craft. In short, it's time to start viewing us as part of a much wider craft, with some of its skills and capabilities still very much to be learned. The craft of data journalism is to harness the incredible power being given to us by the explosion of digital information.\nFor journalists, data journalism has to be more than just the gathering of raw facts, the sizing up of numbers and other pieces of information, which then have to be passed on to experts who know the technical methods of making sense of information through a variety of quantitative methods but with only limited understanding of information gathering from narrative sources. Instead, it should be seen as a crucial job in news organisations, the job of making sense of the new data, and presenting the information to news consumers in a new form.\nNews organisations are, as a rule, not used to making sense of information in this way. It's a whole different skill set. For those of us outside of a newsroom, we're usually trained to think about the narratives, the stories, the craft, the language, the imagery and the art of storytelling that is crucial to news organizations. A new generation of journalists, perhaps we can say for the first time, is coming through that is being trained in both narrative journalism and in data journalism. That gives us an opportunity - and a mission.\nCrucial job in news organisations\nIt's a crucial job in news organisations, and the skills are transferable to many other sectors. There's a real need for this kind of approach in science and technology reporting, where the complex story often spans multiple disciplines and requires the skills of the narrative journalist to make sense of it for the audience.\nAt the Guardian, we are now experimenting in the creation of journalism from raw data - from the mining of data, we have put together pieces on the best cities for students, where people are moving and dying around the world, how many women die in childbirth, migration patterns, what the impact of Brexit might be, for example.\nBecause we have the journalistic and storytelling skills we now have a much broader set of tools to work with.\nIncreasing numbers of data analytics departments are being established in journalism and across the industry, often to help find new trends, new stories, and new approaches to existing work. These are often people specialists in the data analysis or with experience in statistics", "With the help of technology-savvy partners - like\nReachLocal - and advertisers, we'll build a stronger brand\nand give readers relevant content every time they turn to a\nHearst newspaper.\nNEW MEDIA DIVERSIFICATION:  This year, as more media consumers\nlook online for local news, you must provide more content\nwhere your audience is.

FDA developed the proposed definition of advertising to help ensure that information conveyed by the advertising of food products is accurately reflected on the Nutrition Facts label (labeling), which would help consumers make informed and healthful dietary choices. It defines \u201cadvertising\u201d as a representation disseminated in any media (including labeling and promotional labeling of the product) for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or use of a food product (including a dietary supplement or dietary ingredient of a dietary supplement) or encouraging the use of or the membership in a chain of retail stores that offers the product for sale; and as a representation disseminated in any electronic means (including labeling and promotional labeling of the product) for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or use of a food product.\nFor the purposes of this rule, the definition of advertising also includes a representation on the labeling of a food or in any electronic means if the representation is made with the intent to promote the sale of a food product for which the representation appears on the product's label (including a dietary supplement or dietary ingredient of a dietary supplement), or with the intent to promote the use of or the membership in a chain of retail stores that offer the product for sale. In addition, this definition also includes a representation disseminated in any\nelectronic means, such as text messages or social media, to promote the use of food or dietary supplement products (including dietary ingredients); or that the use of any food or dietary supplement product (including dietary ingredients) may result in a benefit to overall health. By establishing a regulatory definition of advertising, the rule will provide a consistent regulatory framework for FDA, the public, and industry to assess which statements on the labeling, including the labeling of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients that are marketed separately or in combination with food, constitute a food ad that requires disclosure of the required nutrients and is subject to the requirements of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels and Nutrient Content Claims. FDA determined this definition is necessary to provide a regulatory framework for making accurate and consistent disclosures of label information to help educate and empower consumers to make informed and healthful dietary decisions.\nBecause advertising is defined in this rule as a representation disseminated in any media, the proposed rule would apply to statements that are marketed separately from the product. FDA has previously issued a statement of policy that the Nutrition Facts and Nutrient Content claims regulations apply to dietary supplements and their label statements, e.g., claims made separately from the product label on the product itself (71 FR 60267 at 60288, November 2, 2006). Although the proposed rule would clarify advertisements that are not included in the regulatory definition by clarifying that the advertising of a food, dietary supplement label, or dietary ingredient label, e.g., statements marketed separately from the product (e.g., statements on the product's labeling, media advertisements or statements on a manufacturer's website), would be considered outside the scope of the rule if the advertising is not a representation disseminated in any media for the purpose of promoting the product, the proposed rule would not be amended to include labels of dietary supplements that marketed separately from the food product itself.\nIn addition, the proposed rule would clarify the existing prohibition in the advertising regulations by defining the term ``advertisement.'' The rule would define advertise as any representation disseminated in any media for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or use of a food product (including a dietary supplement or dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement), or encouraging the use of or the membership in a chain of retail stores that offer the product for sale.\nThe proposed rule would apply to statements that promote the use of a food product, or of any food category, that are made across a variety of media (including on the point of sale display), including product images and testimonials that may appear, for example, on labels, containers, cartons, inserts, shelf tags, or point of sale displays, as well as on company websites, social media sites, and any other", "A summary list of the major highlights of the\nU.S. Bureau of the Census' 1960 population censuses.\nThis list is followed by 10 pages of historical\nnotes (one each for the following subjects: U.S. Census\nDivision, American Population, Population-Housing\nRelations, Population, Population-Migration-Housing\nRelations)\nI .

According to the results of this survey, many Canadians are taking them. Some key areas to ensure the industry continues to grow include stocking products that target the different demographics of Canadians and working with physician customers to improve access to nutraceuticals.\nThere is no denying that Canadians are becoming healthier and healthier, not just physically, but financially as well. Consumers are becoming more aware of the cost of prescription drug plans and are actively searching for ways to stretch their dollars. This has caused many people to turn to natural health alternatives, such as vitamin c, and nutraceutical products such as probiotics and herbal extracts. It can seem a little overwhelming for many of these people who have never used \u201cnatural medicine\u201d to start choosing the right products. This is where Canadian pharmacists come into play\u2014by providing unbiased information along with a selection of these products from their pharmacies. As a result of the pharmacist\u2019s role in helping to educate patients and the general public, the number of nutraceuticals in pharmacies has grown dramatically. Although the popularity of the category has increased exponentially, it is still considered a relatively new development in pharmacy settings. The Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal, in fact, recently released its April 2004 edition, an annual special edition devoted to the topic of \u201cNutraceuticals: Opportunities and Challenges for Pharmacists.\u201d\nThe Pharmacy Practice Study Group, with the help of a group of pharmacists with experience in managing natural health products, carried out a survey to determine why pharmacies in Ontario chose to stock these products, how nutraceuticals were being sold, and how these pharmacies were using and planning to use the products.1 The result of the survey was eye-opening, to say the least; it is important to take a further look at why nutraceuticals are doing so well in Canadian pharmacies.\nFirst, we must know who is using these products and why. The data from a 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey showed that approximately 61% of Canadians between the ages of 12 and 79 use some sort of alternative medicine (e.g. natural health product, herbal con\u00adtent supplement, or dietary supplement).2 Although the numbers are higher for certain age groups, it is quite clear that 60% of Canadians are at least interested in nutraceuticals as a healthcare option.1,3 This level of consumer interest does not seem to be slowing down in Canada either. Although the numbers have not changed much in recent years, the general public awareness of the availability of natural product has increased dramatically. This, in turn, has encouraged more Canadians to seek alternative medicines.\nWhy did Canadians take the survey?\nHow often does a consumer use nutraceuticals?\nHow are nutraceuticals purchased/paid for?\nAre there certain demographics that use nutraceuticals?\nWhat is the consumer\u2019s attitudes towards nutraceuticals?\nWhat has changed in the consumer\u2019s use of nutraceuticals?\nIf using a nutraceutical, is there a relationship between the nutraceutical and the doctor?\nDo consumers receive the advice from their pharmacist regarding nutraceuticals?\nWhat nutraceuticals are Canadian consumers using on a regular basis?\nDo pharmacists recommend or prescribe nutraceuticals?\nHow were nutraceuticals used in the past 12 months?\nWhat are common conditions that Canadians with nutraceuticals?\nThe survey showed that a whopping 80% of respondents aged 18 to 69 had used some sort of natural or botanical product, including vitamin and mineral supplements.\nWho was taking the nutraceuticals?\nAs per the 2002 data from the Canadian Community Health Survey about the frequency of the use of different types of alternative medicines, the top three self-reported reasons were: \u201cwishing to become healthier\u201d (26%), \u201cfelt well\u201d (14%), and \u201cscientific or logical appeal\u201d(12%) (figure 1).\nFigure 1: Reasons for taking a nutraceutical\nFigure 1: Top three reasons for taking nutraceuticals. Reprinted with permission", "If you were only as busy with other people\u2019s projects as you are with your own, you would have done little of note in your lifetime. You would be spending your days doing things that are not very important, you would be trying to please people who do not appreciate you, you would be saying \u2018yes\u2019 to people who do not understand you, and you would be doing things that you do not really prefer to do.\n1. Life\u2019s work is not about how much you do, but about how much you understand by being selective about what you do and focusing on a few big things rather than a large number of small things. The fewer projects you work on, the more time you will have to make each of them bigger, better, stronger and simpler. Life is not that long; you might as well make each project count. A man who does nothing to transform the world is a man who has no impact at all. He has wasted his time by choosing to do things that make no impression. This applies to every man, whether he works from home or elsewhere. It applies to people in every industry. Don\u2019t be a victim of small jobs that don\u2019t make a difference. Have the courage to only take on the major projects that you actually understand. If you work every day of the year, without a holiday, and do a great amount of work, so that people begin to appreciate you, but you are not satisfied with your life\u2019s work because you do not understand or know what you are doing, you will not get any satisfaction from the praise that you get, no matter how well you get it. Your ambition will remain unfulfilled, because your work will always be incomplete.\n2. Every project should be the primary project in life. Don\u2019t allow any other task to over-shadow any of the important things that you have to do in life. The first and foremost rule of work is to get some work done on a task every day. If you are working on one project from morning to night, you are making progress. If there is another project you are working on that occupies half your waking hours, then you are getting nothing done on the primary project. No matter what you or others might say, these are the facts of life. There is no second opinion here. You will have to take action on anything you want to achieve. This includes your personal life. The most important thing is this: When you do any project, be sure that whatever its objective was when you started, you must fulfil that goal. Work can be difficult, but its purpose is to make things easier. You must use work to get you back to the right destination.\n3. Doing work with no idea of where or what progress you are making simply because you are not motivated for the project is not working at all. It is just procrastinating. A man who does nothing but procrastinate throughout his lifetime is just as wasting his time as any man who never does anything at all. If at your best, you are still merely avoiding work, it might be better that you never began doing work at all.\n4. The difference between a man who does nothing but procrastinate and a man who is busy doing work that is of any value to him or anybody else, is that the man who always delays is a victim of the status quo. He works hard at keeping the same old status quo, without the slightest intention of improving or changing it in any way. He knows the truth, but he will never alter it because it offers no reward for him and only makes him uncomfortable. Because he is more concerned with the results of his work than he is with the work itself, he prefers to sit down and wait for circumstances to do that work for him. What he is doing is working out his future through the current state of affairs he is experiencing, knowing that he can never change that situation. He doesn\u2019t know how to improve, so he sits and waits for things to improve with little effort on his part. These people are never happy and are victims of circumstances. They live with their circumstances and allow them to control them.\nWhen a man becomes unhappy with his circumstances, he knows he will not change his position through his inaction, but that he must take action. If only the man who does nothing could see that, he would be able to help himself right away. However, when he puts his mind to work, he knows that he must make sacrifices in order to get what he really wants. He gets motivated, and he does the little things that others can\u2019t be bothered to do. He does the little things that other people don\u2019t have the patience or the grit to do. Through his grit, determination and focus, he achieves the things that others only dream of.", "**1.** Some of the information shared in this chapter is highly technical, such as information about the new HTML standard and web standards. While it's not essential reading for the average reader, it's important to understand. So, I provided an entire section called \"Getting in deeper.\" You are free to skip this section, but to truly grasp how this technology was able to help solve the issues we've discussed, I highly recommend you at least skim it. The same goes for Section 3, \"A bit of a tangent... and perhaps an answer?\" \u2014 I'd suggest you skim over it and get an idea of how we solved the issues, as I don't want to assume that you know much about the new website standard.\n**2.** I tried to make the entire section, \"Design on the mind,\" as simple as possible to understand. It could be viewed as a how-to section, and it does a good job of outlining the key design principles we used and why these principles were important. However, if you're new to designing a website, this section could also be a bit daunting. Even so, I believe it's important to get these design principles in front of you, because if you can't see it, you can't do it \u2014 or at least do it well, as understanding is the first step when designing. For us, a lot of our work was done with the use of tools like Adobe Fireworks (which unfortunately doesn't support the latest version of CSS) and I can't tell you how many times I used Photoshop as a visual aid. A good rule of thumb: if the software isn't helping, the designer probably isn't helping. If something isn't accessible or doesn't work, the designer should be working on fixes, not trying to find excuses.\n**3.** We discussed design at great deal throughout this chapter. The reason is that while we discussed HTML 5.0 code during Chapter 9, I wanted to make sure the reader understood the importance or how design principles are communicated (or not) in code. I strongly believe that design and accessibility have to go hand in hand. For me, they are equally important, because design and accessibility go hand in hand. Designing a website, which is not accessible, makes its user experience a poor experience. Why would we want to do that?\n**4.** While I do love code and CSS, for the average internet reader, this section was a bit tedious, which is why I suggest you at least skim it and then come back to it when you decide you want to become more familiar with the new HTML code.\n1. GETTING DEEPER\n###### **WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS A RESPONSIVE SITE DESIGN CAN ADD VALUE?**\nOne advantage of a site built on HTML5 is its ability to easily scale up or down for different screen sizes, whether it's larger televisions or  smaller mobile phones. If you have a site that automatically resizes itself for a variety of screen sizes, you won't need to invest as much in time or money in developing several versions of your websites for different platforms.\n##### **1. What is a web browser?**\nWeb browsers are just like the programs that users install on the main computer. They have a wide variety of features that make it easier to connect to the Internet. Examples of web browsers include:\n  * Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)\n  * Netscape Communicator\n  * Firefox\n  * Safari\nWhile certain companies, such as Mozilla, provide an open source version (Safari), other major browsers such as Firefox, Netscape, and IE are created by for-profit companies. If you notice, all browsers pretty much look the same. If you do a bit of research, you'll discover that Internet Explorer is the only major browser in which Microsoft does not participate in any standard-setting organizations such as the W3C. Instead, the company participates exclusively in setting standards in the ISO. While many people believe that Internet Explorer is less stable than other browsers, we'd argue that such opinions come from users of other browsers \u2014 not the people creating or testing for the company. According to one user of the latest version of IE, some of the benefits of this browser include:\n  * Improved security\n  * Better browser customization\n  * Better RSS reader (allows you to easily check your favorite blogs through a single browser)\n  * Ability to synchronize calendar with Outlook\n  * Improved performance and reliability\nInternet Explorer is an excellent browser and offers many benefits over competing browsers. However, the reason why people prefer one browser", "A well structured newsletter is more likely to succeed than a poorly structured newsletter. It should be easy to read, be visually appealing, be concise and to the point, have a title that is catchy and relevant, and focus on your target audience.\nI\u2019ve been editing and designing a new newsletter for AAP News & Notes. I\u2019d like to write about what I\u2019ve accomplished and what I\u2019d like to accomplish next. This is my first week, so I don\u2019t really want to critique the job that was done previously, but I have an idea for improvements.\nI had the most difficulty with the first issue. The newsletter was published on September 19th and it has not yet been available in electronic format. It is 6 pages of text, and the margins seemed to get larger as I progressed in the document. Also, there were several ads mixed into the newsletter and the ads were not clearly identified because the newsletter was so heavily laden with ads. It was difficult to see the articles because of the number of ads.\nI had difficulties with the article selection. I know I did because there were things I had seen that had already been covered in the newsletter. They weren\u2019t relevant to the intended audience; in fact, the newsletter was mainly for faculty, so articles should focus on faculty. I think maybe the editors could try to solicit articles from the general library audience or the faculty audience so that the content is varied.\nI\u2019ve started off the newsletter well with the next issue so far. The editors have taken my suggestion to put articles from the first and second issues in separate files in the next newsletter. By doing this, I think the readers will be able to see that the newsletter was published weekly as opposed to every two or three weeks as it had in the past. It will also be easier for readers to see what was printed in previous issues and they\u2019ll be able to choose the topics that interest them. The editors also responded well to the way that an event is listed. They list the event under the date and the name of the organization sponsoring the event. Another improvement is that when the newsletter is printed, there is space around the main articles and the ads. The newsletter is not too cramped and it\u2019s easy to read.\nThis is an example of a newsletter that is fairly successful with its design and structuring. The main sections are well organized, easy to read, and well focused. The main sections are: the front matter, articles, calendar, job bank and ads. The front matter explains, briefly, the role of ALA News, explains what the newsletter is about and gives the contact information for the editor. It also contains a letter from the editor, which explains the mission of the new ALA News & Notes, that they have started to publish in October 2006. The next section introduces this particular issue and the other editor(s) or assistant editor(s). The third section lists the articles with a brief description of each one. The fourth section provides a short preview of the upcoming issue. The fifth section gives ad rates and deadlines. The final section is the calendar that shows conferences. There is an ad at the end of the newsletter that gives upcoming conferences.\nI found that the other sections of the newsletter were organized well and seemed to address the audience well. The articles are generally targeted to people who are going to be attending the conferences and workshops and the contact person for the articles is often the contact person for the conference. So many of the articles are about upcoming conferences; the advertisements are for services that are often used when attending a conference. This newsletter focuses on the specific type of people who will want to read it: faculty members attending conferences. It also follows a theme, which is \"Faculty Favorites.\" All the articles are about favorites with a faculty focus. Somehow it seems to be a little more successful than other newsletters, even though it is still being built on how the editors interpret ALA News & Notes to people.\nThe newsletter appears to be a success. The newsletter is well designed to be user friendly and it seems to be well received by the target audience, so it certainly has room for growth. I guess what could be done with this newsletter? I would suggest that the editors give attention to their ads. All the ads were mixed in with the news of the ALA but there wasn\u2019t a specific section to advertisers. In fact, the ads seemed to not be focused on the faculty at all. So I think that it would do well to have separate ads (probably not from this issue", "A case of a 21-year-old female with severe ataxia and hypotonia was diagnosed with a homozygous NB gene deletion, spelling out the absence or a part of a gene resulting in a loss of function.\nCASE", "In a world rife with distrust and misinformation, newspaper websites that employ a variety of native newsroom and outside experts become the trusted source that consumers rely on for credible information.\nIf the first question you ask from your audience is not \u201cWhat\u2019s in your wallet?\u201d it probably should be.\nThe American public is desperate for trustworthy information, and that\u2019s something most newspaper websites can help to fill. But the newsroom needs to play a key role in creating that trust. The industry needs to think more about the fact that journalism as practiced in newsrooms \u2014 and especially when that journalism is enhanced with other kinds of content from the news organisations as a whole \u2014 provides a sense of integrity that the Internet and its myriad sources of news, many of which have a primary interest in clicks and pageviews, lack.\nIn today\u2019s media environment, we cannot depend on our media partners to provide us with trustworthy information, we need to provide it ourselves. And if we don\u2019t fill that void, someone else will.\nConsider the current economic environment in the United States. There are three key concerns of the American public. 1) Unemployment remains high and is stagnant, so many people have no real income. 2) The stock price of companies in the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 has declined by more than 50% in the past two years. 3) Even basic household items are getting more expensive.\nThis means that at least 50 million Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. They don\u2019t have room in their budgets to spend money on things like food, shelter, clothing and transportation because it just goes back to funding those bills first.\nThey have no money to save or invest and little room in their budgets for spending on things like leisure activities.\nThey have no money to put away for a rainy day. The unforeseen might hit for the better of them, and the worst might happen.\nSo what do the unemployed and poor have if not money? Time. In a recent article, \u201cTime Well Spent,\u201d Forbes\u2019 Bob Helft observes that time is currency, and \u201cthe average American is earning 25% less each year: 25% less than his parents did 40 years ago, that is.\u201d\nSo they\u2019re looking to newspapers as trusted sources of information that will not only inform them but help them save time. They want a newspaper to provide the information they need to do the things they know they should to improve their lives without wasting precious free days of their time.\nTo get there, newspapers should create, curate, and connect content for readers of all levels, helping people to save time, save money, and be smarter consumers.\nThe newspaper website can help by:\nCreating trusted credibility by identifying itself as a news organisation that values integrity over profits and puts accuracy over speed.\nProviding trusted information about financial services, insurance, cars, food, appliances, health care, home maintenance and repair, relationships, home life, consumer electronics, home entertainment, and many other areas.\nProviding trusted information about community, world and national news.\nMost consumer information on the Internet is created \u2014 not vetted. The result is that information may be outright inaccurate, or it may be incomplete or lacking in full context. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that people do not have very low expectations for the information they find on the Internet. But that\u2019s another story for another day. Suffice it to say here that the majority of the media that people consume is still produced by professionals working under professional guidelines, as opposed to bloggers working on their own time. And that means that professionally produced news content on a news organisation\u2019s website, when fact-checked and vetted by experts, is still highly trusted \u2014 and a key resource for any news website. That information might be articles by your own newsroom; columns written by columnists, writers and experts; articles from syndicates or licensing partners; or any kind of story or piece that you think your readers will need.\nYou need to help your audience by showing them how to look for trustworthy information and where to go on your websites to find it.\nI was recently chatting with a colleague who works for a large news organisation, and we were comparing notes on how our sites have changed over the years. He told me that the newspaper\u2019s consumer advice section had been moved from the back corner of the site to a main page, giving more visibility to the key stories it includes. This is a prime example", "The U.S. Department of Commerce has received requests to conduct surveys of certain domestic paper sectors to collect data necessary to carry out the statutory requirement of section 1203 of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended by title VII of the Trade Act of 1979.\nDATES: The Department of Commerce shall publish in the Federal Register the name, address and contact person for each requestor.

If you ask a mobile news consumer what their idea of \u201cnormal\u201d is for their favorite news source, the answer in probably going to be \u201cfast and current.\u201d\nThat\u2019s according to the results of an Adobe Research and Poynter Institute study released last June. We interviewed 2,638 respondents from North America, Japan, Australia, Germany, India, the United Kingdom and Spain. Their top mobile news consumption habits were:\nAsking for a \u201cquick news brief,\u201d or \u201cnews to-go\u201d\n\u201cSkimming news snippets\u201d\nStaying focused for a \u201cbrief\u201d time period\nThe Adobe Mobile News Consumption Study sought to identify consumer habits, determine why they behave in the particular ways they do, and why certain consumer groups consume digital content differently. The research, conducted by Poynter/eMarketer in collaboration with the Adobe Digital Index team, found that people expect to consume news more quickly on mobile devices, and more than in any other medium.\nFaster news consumption on mobile devices isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d everywhere around the world. In some cities, there is still a strong need for print newspapers, as well as the Internet.\nOne reason for slower news consumption in some markets may be connected to where and when the news is being consumed. People have the biggest hunger for news first thing in the morning, and some groups are in the habit of being at home in the morning to read or watch the news, while on a mobile device or a notebook PC at work during the day. In other markets, people want to be mobile and access news from anywhere. People in India, for example, like being able to read news content wherever they are. We found people use mobile apps to read news when they are waiting for the subway, or in line at the grocery store. They also want to access news from home, in bed, late at night. They want to be able to read news, or watch a video clip from a favorite news site.\nPeople are getting used to speedier news consumption on mobile devices. The desire to read news quickly on mobile devices is driven by the mobile devices themselves, not the network connectivity. This is consistent with another recent study by comScore around consumption habits on mobile devices.\nWe also found that there is a strong correlation between the speed with which readers are willing to read news content on the web and the speed at which content has to be available to them.\nFor example, readers who are very loyal to their online news site will more quickly turn their noses up when a news site fails to provide content quickly. This applies to all digital content, whether it be news content or sports live feeds, or video news content. Faster is better for the mobile news consumer.\nWhile there are many reasons that mobile news consumers access their favorite news sites via a mobile device, the majority of news consumers cite \u201ca short attention span\u201d as a main reason, followed by \u201cspeed,\u201d \u201cconvenience,\u201d and \u201cportability.\u201d\nMichael Teetell is vice president, Digital Strategy for Adobe.

The issuance of such Purchase Bond Series 1999A Bonds as\neligible for designation as FQEPA Bonds was the first series of such\nbonds to be issued as FQEPA Bonds.  For purposes of the Federal Tax Loss\nRedemption program only, $758,520,000 of Purchase Bond Series 1999A Bonds\nwere designated as FQEPA Bonds pursuant to the resolution.\nPrior to this time, only the Series 1992, 1993, and 1994 Series Bonds\nand a portion of the Series 1996B (in the total amount of $893,000,000)\nhad been designated as FQEPA Bonds.\nThe Series 1996B Bonds, issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of\nDirectors of NYCTA, were not available for designation as FQEPA Bonds\nuntil after June 30, 1996.

On\nJanuary 12, 1996 (the \"Initial Agreement", "In 1525, German monk and adventurer Johann Tetzel wrote a book about his journeys entitled \"A Traveler's Guide to Paradise.\" It was a work of fiction that was inspired by his actual travels to the Americas, Africa, and Asia in 1517. Tetzel intended his book to reveal to the world the hidden and miraculous secrets of a mystical East that could grant the reader an afterlife filled only with joy and beauty.\nIn his work, Tetzel describes an unbelievably beautiful paradise, where the weather is perpetually warm and sunny, and food and drink flow from rivers and fountains as if they are falling from the heavens. There are all manner of wonderful creatures living in this utopia, including talking beasts and a race of giant women known as the Amazons. But perhaps the greatest gift of all is the city of Damascus itself, which is full of beautiful women, luxurious palaces, and vast treasures beyond imagining.\nThe book was completed shortly before Tetzel died in Africa in 1525. It was a great success and went on to become a bestseller, even in German lands, which had not yet seen the printed word. But once Tetzel's book was published, the word spread quickly through the Muslim world, and some two hundred years later, the \"Traveler's Guide to Paradise\" was being used as a textbook to teach Islamic students the correct and acceptable ways to treat Christian captives. A captured European Christian woman, in an effort to ingratiate herself with her captor, used the book to try to teach the new language of her captivity, the \"language of the infidels.\" This was a frivolous attempt by the woman since her captor had spent all his life learning the language of the infidels.\nThe lessons in Tetzel's \"Traveler's Guide to Paradise\" included the methods of sexual intercourse for infidel women, and were meant to offer a new, more gentle approach to the \"art of pleasing a man.\" Some of the more erotic sections of the text were based on the accounts of European women who had been captured by Turks and transported to the Turkish cities of Damascus and Aleppo in the mid-1500s, and had managed to escape a grisly fate through sexual submission. The woman who had written the lessons in the manual was herself from the Ottoman realm and had firsthand knowledge of the Turkish customs and rituals associated with these lessons.\nIn Damascus around 1550, the \"art of pleasing a man\" had become an important part of Damascenes' culture, something that was openly discussed and actively practiced. Most women in Damascus in the first half of the 1600s were already familiar with lessons 22, 23, and 24 found in Johann Tetzel's \"Traveler's Guide,\" even if they had only been able to learn the lesson from word of mouth from a friend or other female relative or maybe from a few letters they'd received from European captives. Lessons 1 through 21 were used to teach European male captives the Turkish language, and so were not of much use to European women.\n15\n# THE ROMANCE OF TURKISH WOMEN\nIN HIS BOOK TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO PARADISE, JOHANN TETZEL WROTE A CHAPTER entitled \"A Lesson on How European Women Should Behave, In Order to Please Her Captor.\" Tetzel suggested that Europeans who were captured by the Turks should try to please their captors by becoming Muslim in order to receive a better condition of captivity. This was a dangerous lesson to teach his readers because it would put European women and captives of war in even more terrible situations. According to Tetzel, there were two methods of pleasing their captors, one known as the \"art of the infidels,\" or infidel's arts, and the other known as the Turkish art, or lesson. Tetzel suggested that the most important part of a lesson, or even a lesson on the lesson of pleasing your infidel captor, was whether the lesson had been completed successfully. He also wrote lessons on women's lessons regarding pleasing their captors.\nIt should have not been surprising to Tetzel that many Ottoman women had already learned the infidel art well.

Hopefully, we will be hearing from them soon.\nI told them about the PCC proposal and that I think it would be a good project\nfor SHARE to get involved in as our first Internet business.\nMid-range systems will be the hot item for 1998.  Not the big mainframes, but\nthe smaller systems, like pSeries, Power4, and Alpha's.\nThe 21st century is going to be the century of IT.  It will be business-driven in\nan IT environment.  It will be the IT people who will have to deliver the good\nstuff.  IBM is looking to a lot of new technologies that will change computing.\n- AIX-Linux on SMP Systems (IBM has been testing AIX, Linux, and RS/6000's as\nunix servers.  One of the key things they are doing is how to integrate each)\n- MPI, the message passing interface, how to work together with MPI to build\nparallel programs\n- DB2-400, a 64bit mainframe with 8 virtual systems (V7R2 or later), will have\nDB2 running across all 8 systems.  Will have 3 TB capacity, running in real\ntime, and do it for pennies)\n- Future hardware in which 100,000 RS/6000 modules will be plugged into VP\nclustered with Alpha's.  This is not new.  It was the idea for the\nSupercomputer last year.\nIBM is creating an enterprise computing architecture, ECA.  In this system, it\nrequires the ability to share data, applications, and information.  This will\nbe done through a common technology base and a common platform.\nFuture of mainframe is SMP\nThey are currently running Windows systems on RS/6000's and it costs two times\nmore than it should, and only runs 58% of its processing capacity.  The\nfuture of the mainframe is small.  I know that our audience is more interested\nin Linux than Windows, but what does that do to our future?  A high-profile IBM\nemployee went to RedHat (Mike Burr, chief analyst) and told them that Linux will\nbe able to run on an SMP system.  It will still have to have a special kernel\nfor that, but it will be able to do it.  With that knowledge, RedHat has changed\nto become a full-service support vendor like IBM is.  If RedHat were to move to\na small platform and become big-time, we'd all be out of work.  AIB says, with\nthe 58% issue, we're already there.  (AIB, a leading IBM mainframe consulting\nfirm in Canada, said this with a smile. :>)\nThe question then becomes, if Linux runs on SMBs, why would anyone continue to\nbuy a big box?  It would make sense to buy SMBs.  The only reason to buy a big\nbox is for shear performance, and that's what we're seeing the RS/6000 for.\nIBM knows it needs to expand into the small platform to survive.

One, is to get a part time job on the side so you can\nhave some spare time to devote to your business.  For example, you\nmight be able to get enough hours at a second job to quit your\nfull-time job.  Some jobs pay better than others.  Another\nalternative is, to work on the weekend, when you are not busy\nwith your full-time job.\nThe third way to work on your entrepreneurial business is to have\nhours during the time that you do not have a job.  The reason\nthat you probably would still do your job is because having a\njob provides a form of security.  However, as you know, life is\nnever guaranteed.  When do you decide when its the right time\nto jump into entrepreneurship?  Many people never take the leap\ninto entrepreneurship unless they become absolutely desperate.\nSome people become tired of making $20,000 to $30,000 per year,\nand they decide that they want to get rich.  Since most people\ndo not have $30,000 spare income with which to invest, then they\nneed to get the money from somewhere else.  The number one problem\nthat people fail to achieve success is that they are impatient.\nThey think the way that they are doing it now isn't working, and\nit will never work, and they then give up.  When I first\nbecame employed, I was making $12,000 per year plus a bonus.  I\nwas tired of working for people who did not pay me properly.  My\nsecond job made me $15-16,000 per year.  I felt so lucky, I\nbecame a professional speaker.  The first couple of years, I\nmade about $7,000 for each speech.  When I had the chance to go\nbe a full-time employee for $30,000 I didn't take it.  I stayed\nin business.  A year later, one of my businesses produced my\nincome for about the same figure.  I didn't have to report my\nincome from speaking to the IRS.  That's why I decided I was\ngoing to stay a one year professional speaker and then quit my\nother job.  I never intended to work a regular nine to five job.\nThe second reason I didn't work full time was that my employer\nwas treating me fairly well, so I was able to put in about 25\nhours a week.  The third reason that I chose not to work a full\ntime job was because I have had such great results with a part\ntime business, it has given be greater motivation on doing more\nbusiness.  I have a tremendous incentive to work my part time\nbusiness.  Instead of having to rely totally on my full time\njob to provide my income, I have a wonderful supplement from my\npart time business.", "This is a notice of the President's intent to\nremove the Bone Bar, Oregon, from the National Wilderness\nPreservation System.

The paper is a regional newspaper with significant competition in the social sphere from rivals including USA Today, he said.\nFacebook pages are a tool for newspapers to create and publish content, and they can make it easier for readers to find what they\u2019re looking for, Sturgulewski said.\n\u201cEven if our local Facebook page gets 10,000 views, that\u2019s only a fraction of the people who are reading the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just people who follow us on a per-day basis, and I\u2019m not going to get into the data-science portion of that \u2013 I\u2019m just using a very simple, common, very obvious, basic metric \u2013 but if a story on our Facebook page gets 10,000 views, it\u2019s 10,000 views for free.\u201d\nAnother benefit to Facebook pages is the ability to track, not just in aggregate, but for each individual post, the number of people who have read it, shared it, liked it, and any comments or actions they have taken on the post, Sturgulewski said.\nIf you are going to put in the effort for content creation, you may as well get as much exposure out of it as possible, Sturgulewski said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually started putting more money into that, but I\u2019d argue we\u2019ve gotten more value for that dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to experiment with different ways that we think we can put in the effort at a higher level to get more people out of it.\u201d\nA recent example of that would be the Sacramento Bee's partnership with Gannett's Digital Content Next to launch SacRep3, a mobile application that provides Sacramento-area news, as well as scores, standings, blogs, and tweets in one place. Since the app launched in mid-April, it has had over 1,400 downloads, he said.\nSturgulewski believes there will always be competition for viewers and the attention span of the average reader, especially among the digital native generation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s that battle we have all been fighting,\u201d he said.\nPREV Making Sense of the News: The Importance of the Local Context in Global Reports NEXT \u2018In-Content Video Viewers\u2019 Most Receptive to Video Ads, Cox Media Survey Finds", "To the Editor:\nIn September, 1918, I took charge of an 18-year old patient who was\nblind in his left eye (his right hand being paralyzed). The paralysis of\nthe left arm was already well advanced.  His right eye was also\nblind.  He had received several injections of serum, and had had\nseveral days of pneumonia.  The chancre remained undilated, and was\nabout the size of a large pin head.\nHe complained of constant, severe headaches and was in great\npain.  This was aggravated every morning by severe retching, due to the\nheadache.  The patient had never before suffered from any trouble.    I\ndilated the chancre and prescribed a general treatment and special\ntreatment consisting in the use of iron, manganese, cuprum, sulphur,\nand mercury.  The patient felt much relieved and the pain subsided.\nWith the help of his father he came to my consultation room on two\noccasions.  One month and four days after starting treatment the\npatient returned with his father and an assistant surgeon (actually a\ndrafted army doctor).  When the assistant surgeon found that the\ninjection was impossible he informed his father that he did not believe\nthat the doctor had any influence over the disease, and that he\nproceeded with the injection himself and that the patient was blind in\nhis left eye and deaf in his left ear.   Upon examination for myself I\ndiscovered that the pupil was dilated and that the chancre was\nIn order to be sure that it really was my patient and to know\nwhere he stood I examined his right eye which was normal and that the\npatient was deaf and blind in his right eye.\nFive days later the doctor returned again, accompanied by another\nsurgeon and they had a lengthy argument with me.  At the end of it,\nthe surgeons told me that the treatment was of no use and they asked\nme to stop the treatment, and on the next day they performed an\ninjection.  I started again immediately.\nAfter five days (September 30th) he came again, accompanied by his\nfather and an assistant surgeon. They informed me that the patient had\nreturned to his usual state of health.\nI told them that it was a matter of indifference to me whether they\nbelieved or not, but if they did not want to believe, why couldn't they\njust leave, and that I would continue my treatment and that he would\nreturn whenever he wanted to.\nSeven days later the patient returned again and his father informed\nme that his eye which had been covered with a patch was no longer\ncovered and that it was fine.  And furthermore he told me that he had\nbeen told that he should be thankful to the surgeons for having given\nhim back his sight and his hearing.   He told me that if he did not feel\nthanks enough, that he should call his sons-in-law, who would have\nanswered me like the surgeons.\nI told him that the surgeons had spoken about him like a snake had\nspoken about an egg.  Also I told him that I had made a mistake in not\nhaving spoken to the patient himself, and that the patient must not\nbelieve that I was blind, and finally I told him, that the man behind\nthe curtain was not the doctor, because he always spoke behind the\ncurtain. Also I explained to him that he must not believe other people,\nbecause they usually made stupid mistakes.\nI continued the treatment as I had been told, and a little later\nthe patient again complained of severe head pain.  When I heard that\nit seemed like I had been hit in my heart with a hammer. (Note by E.O:\nthis patient always complains of severe head pain.  In the past nine\nyears he was treated many times for this headache.  He is never sick\nwith any other illness).\nI told the surgeon that he must be insane, because I had often\ntreated him and told him exactly how I went about the treatment.   He\ntold me to leave the man's fate in God's hands, and that he might not\nhear me.\nThe day after I examined this patient again.

The rule also makes technical amendments that are intended to clarify, update, and make the regulations consistent with FDIC regulations applying to other federal savings associations. The final rule implements these changes by removing cross references to State Nonmember Banks that have become obsolete and deleting outdated provisions.\nDATES: This rule is effective October 1, 2007.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia McMahan, Manager, Special Supervisory Issues, Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSCB), by telephone at (202) 898-6718 or by facsimile at (202) 898-8981; or\nJohn M.

Executive Summary-Part 1: Overview of Bank Powers Regulation (Bank Powers Regulation)--Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act) authorizes the FDIC to issue regulations that relate to the powers and activities of institutions insured under the FDI Act. These regulations govern the operations of State Nonmember Banks and Federal Savings Associations, the only insurance institutions created under section 19.\nSpecifically, the regulations implementing section 19 authorize insured institutions to: (1) engage in the business of making real estate loans, including purchasing and selling real estate as part of a real estate investment program, as established in part 345 of the FDIC's regulations; and (2) acquire, control, or hold an interest in nonbanking organizations, as established in part 347 of the FDIC's regulations.\nIn 1999, the FDIC established regulations implementing section 19(a)(2), which authorizes State Nonmember Banks to acquire, control, or hold an interest in nonbanking companies that provide insurance, financial advisory, or fiduciary services if the Board of Directors of the Bank, in consultation with the FDIC, determine that: (1) The activity is consistent with the financial, economic, public, and national objectives of, and (2) the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the deposit insurance fund.\nEmerging technologies and developments in the financial services environment have altered the landscape of financial services in the United States, as well as globally. As a result of these developments, the FDIC has amended part 347 of its regulations to accommodate the acquisitions of nonbanking entities by State Nonmember Banks. Most recently, the FDIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on May 21, 2007 (72 FR 28916) (the Proposal), seeking comment on proposed amendments to part 347. In the Proposal, the FDIC suggested some minor alterations to part 347 that it believes will enhance the protection of the deposit insurance funds by ensuring that any State Nonmember Bank that engages in the acquisition or control of nonbanking activities must do so in a safe and sound manner.\nThe FDIC did not receive any comment letters in response to the Proposal. Because of this, and in light of the fact that State Nonmember Banks may need to modify their current investment policies in light of the amendments to part 347, the FDIC is implementing the amended part 347 provisions in an unmodified form by publishing this final rule.\nThe FDIC is today issuing this final rule (the Final Rule) to amend and update the Bank Powers Regulation in order to authorize State Nonmember Banks to acquire, control, or hold substantial interests in nonbanking companies, including companies engaged in the financial, legal", "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will report the largest annual net profit in history \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $4.6 billion, 4% above their previous full-year record of $4.4 billion from 2011.\nThe $4.6 billion net profit was forecast by IATA, which represents some 260 airlines, citing the cost-cutting benefits from jet fuel prices remaining among the lowest in recorded history. The organization attributed the results to robust demand and relatively benign inflation.\n\u201cAirlines have been operating under one of the most profitable and fuel-efficient business cycles in history and the outlook reflects further improvements in profitability,\u201d IATA Director General and CEO Tony Tyler said in a statement released by the organization.\nThe forecast, which represents an 8% increase over 2011, marks the third straight year of growth for the global airline industry. It is the culmination of a \u201crelentless\u201d focus on efficiency and cost reduction, Tyler noted.\nTyler added that the industry\u2019s financial recovery in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u201cfrom the crisis low of $4.6 million in 2009\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the result of a 25% reduction in average jet fuel prices from their peak in 2008 and the industry\u2019s investment in more efficient production practices. Those efficiencies, which included a shift toward more fuel-efficient models, have reduced fuel costs for each flight to just 28.4% of industry revenues, almost half of the cost percentage of 53% in 2008.\n\u201cThe industry is in excellent health. As the forecast shows, we are poised for growth. But in 2012 the focus must be on profitability over sales,\u201d Tyler stated.\n\u201cThe airline industry continues to work hard to earn its way to a stronger, more resilient position,\u201d added Tyler. \u201cThe industry has worked tirelessly to restore its financial footing in the last four years. It is essential that the industry now invests in the profits we have made to further improve our resilience to future shocks.\u201d\nIATA\u2019s annual airline outlook, the first in this annual cycle, provides forecasts by region and by category of operation. Regionally, it predicts net profits will hit $2.4 billion in the European Union, $1.5 billion in North America and Africa, $610 million in Latin America, $550 million in Asia-Pacific but $1.2 billion in Middle Eastern carriers.\nForecast details for these regions by category of service for 2012 are as follows:\nFull-service carriers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North America, $2.7 billion worldwide; Europe, $1.7 billion worldwide; Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $520 million worldwide each.\nLow-cost carriers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North America, $1.9 billion worldwide; Europe, $0.9 billion worldwide; Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $555 million worldwide each.\nPassenger revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North America, $0.3 billion; Europe, $2.6 billion; Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $0.3 billion each.\nCargo revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 North America, $0.4 billion; Europe, $0.1 billion; Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $0.02 billion each.\nThe organization expects the U.S. airline sector to post a net profit of $1.8 billion, which would represent its first annual profit since 2007. \u201cThe U.S. has done remarkable work in the last few years to get back to something like normal profit levels after a very tough downturn,\u201d Tyler said\nThe International Air Transport Association forecasts the global airline industry will report a net profit of $9.5 billion in 2013, which compares with the $10.3 billion forecast for 2012 (the biggest annual profit in history of the commercial aviation industry).\nIATA expects the U.S. airline sector to report a net profit of $5.0 billion in 2012, which would represent the first annual profit for the carriers in the last five years for the country. It was the first positive annual result in six years in the United Kingdom, the organization added. And IATA predicts the European Union carriers will report a net profit of $3.4 billion for the year.\nC", "Includes:\n1. 92-21 (Fed), 21-03(Tenn), 61- 10(CA), 36-17(KY\n2. 55-39 (Pa), 75-02(NJ-S9075)\n3. 96-136(NJ-S441)\n4. 98-209(MD)\n5. 01-0937(PA)\nThe Maryland RPS requires that 2% of retail electricity sales must be generated by renewables by\n2022.  The requirement increases to 10% by 2020, with an option to comply with an\nalternate standard of up to 15%.  New generators that sell power into the state must use\nrenewable energy sources or other technologies that reduce emissions relative to those\ngenerated power plants.  The generation of new renewable energy capacity is incentivized\nin terms of a Renewable Energy Credit that is based upon MWh produced by the generator.\nGiven the requirement that 2% of sales are generated by renewables, the cost recovery clause\nfor new renewable energy capacity can be set high enough to equal or exceed the cost\nrecovery for an existing fossil-fired plant.  A renewable energy facility that has been\napproved as of November 1, 2008 is not subject to a Renewable Energy Credit adjustment\nbut new generation facilities that are not approved prior to November 1, 2008 must be\nsubject to the Renewable Energy Credit adjustment.  Since renewable energy resources\ngenerally cost more to construct than fossil-fired resources, a state may choose to limit\nthe growth of renewable technologies or the amount of renewable generation capacity by\nlimiting the cost of renewable generation.  To mitigate this risk, the law requires that the\nstate Public Service Commission determine the \"impact\" of the credit adjustment to\nrenewable energy generators at an intermediate rate, with subsequent review and\nadjustment at the maximum or minimum rate.  The Commission determined in a final order\nthat the Impact Assessment could be performed using a $250 MWh as a proxy for the\nImpact Adjustment.  Several parties challenged the Intermediate Impact Adjustment,\narguing that the method for determining the Intermediate Impact Adjustment was not\nreasonable or consistent with the goals of the RPS.\nIn Md. State Bd. of Assessments & Taxation v. PSC, the Court of Appeals concluded that\nsince the law explicitly excludes from the Impact Assessment certain renewables, certain\nrenewable technologies used for certain purposes, and certain combinations of renewable\nand conventional energy technologies, the Commission did not have discretion to deviate\nfrom the Intermediate Impact Assessment method.  The Court therefore confirmed and\nordered the Commission to implement the Impact Assessment.  In a separate order, the\nCourt also confirmed that a Renewable Energy Credit is an allowance, and that its value\nis the sum of a unit value and a transmission cost component value.  Further it\nconfirmed that the unit and transmission cost component values shall be adjusted by the\nImpact Assessment determined by the Commission.   The Court denied certiorari.\nDocket:      Cite:  Record No. 4, September 26, 2008\nIssues:     (1) Whether the Maryland RPS required the State's Public Service Commission\nto establish an Impact Assessment to measure the impact of the credit adjustment.\n(2) What is the methodology for the Impact Assessment.\nCause No. Heard:\nSep 15 2008 Petition for a Writ of Certiorari or In the Matter of the Impact Assessment for State Public Service Commission v.

Although over 80% of advertisers are in compliance, there remains thousands that still have work to do.\nA recent report from The Law Firm of BakerHostetler, indicates that there is a wide variance in how prepared businesses are to comply with the rules. The report indicates that 17% of 175 CMOs were actually unaware of GDPR. The percentage of advertisers that were prepared ahead of time actually fell short with 45% of advertisers stating that they had complied within three months prior to enforcement. Only 37% of advertisers met GDPR rules the day of in May.\nThe most disconcerting findings indicated that 80% of GDPR-ready advertisers found no issues in the first 24 hours but the report states that the following day, those numbers dropped to 60%. The days of being able to just slap up privacy policies and adhering to some cookie policies is long gone.\nThe report indicates that, unfortunately, the majority of advertisers (62%) are having difficulty with the GDPR compliance program and cited lack of funding, management, knowledge, and technology as the main reasons. The report also indicated that over 60% indicated they were being penalized in the first days of GDPR, so advertisers better get their act together.\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework\nAlthough the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield has been in place since August 1, 2016, it became effective as of August 31, 2016. The agreement allows U.S. firms to provide \u201cadequate protection for the personal data received from the EU.\u201d\nThis past summer, the European Commission approved the new program called \u2018Privacy Shield\u2019 which is designed to better protect personal data of EU citizens transferred to the United States.\nUnder the new agreement, the United States has agreed to a set of new principles in a form that is broadly similar to that which was outlined in the old Safe Harbor. Some of the key agreements are the following, although all in full are listed at 23 pages.\nUS-EU Privacy Shield Framework\nThe Article 29 Working Party has assessed the effectiveness of the Privacy Shield to confirm EU data privacy rights under the framework can be protected at all times, irrespective of the company involved or the size and type of the activity in which they engage.\nThere are several key privacy elements within the new agreement:\nUnder the Privacy Shield framework, companies would commit to comply with the Privacy Principles for Processing Personal Data. In addition, companies would commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. The DPAs can conduct robust investigations and take enforcement action when companies fail to comply with these commitments.\nThis agreement can provide adequate protection for personal data transferred from EU to U.S. companies that have self-certified to the DPAs. If a DPA has reason to believe that the commitments are not met, the self-certified companies will be subject to enforcement action in the relevant EU jurisdiction consistent with applicable national laws, policies, and judicial procedures. The Commission will provide a mechanism for DPAs to consult with each other on decisions regarding enforcement.\nFurther provisions, outlined in Article VII, include commitments to cooperate with the appropriate DPA, publicize an external dispute resolution mechanism (EDR) accessible to individuals in all states in the U.S., and publish specified information online regarding compliance, enforcement, and liability.\nKey elements of the Privacy Shield are as follows:\nPrivacy Principles for US companies.\nCommitment of the DPAs to ensure effective enforcement.\nPrivacy Shield Framework commitments.\nEDR mechanism, which the Commission intends to develop together with the DPAs.\nCommitments of EU-US Privacy Shield participants regarding the liability.\nIn a statement given to Reuters in March of 2017, European DPA Chief Andrea Jelinek pointed out that the \u201cU.S., under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement, is subject to rigorous monitoring by a new dedicated Ombudsperson and EU data protection authorities.\u201d\nThe", "After all, how can you know if you love someone or something--or not--if you do not test it out?\nMy boyfriend has asked about my feelings for him and is suggesting we go on a date. I do like him in\nhis own right, but I can't seem to get myself to say that I love him--even when he asks. I don't know\nif what we have is love, or if he is just a friend. He has tried his best to be nice, but I cannot tell if that\nis for me, or another friend of his. Maybe this is why I have trouble getting there. Am I just a\nlittle slow or just not good at this?\nLet me explain something: if you are to love him, you would have to find out if he is in love with\nyou. As far as we have heard, we are supposed to be in love. But what does that really mean? It\nmeans loving him, not \"loving\" him. You must want him, not to say, \"Oh, yes, he will be mine forever!\"\nbut to find out if he wishes to be yours forever.\nYou might say that love is more than just wanting him or feeling the urge to be with him. Yes,\nbut wanting him is a part of it, too. In other words, you want him, too. To tell the truth, you might\nfeel a certain way for him, but if he is not in the same way for you, then love will not manifest\nitself. However, there might be a little bit of love in there; you could love him or, at least,\nappreciate him. That is all.\nI have found, though, that what some people call \"liking him a lot\" can turn into a deep\nfeeling, that you want him to be there whenever you need him. \"Loving him\" simply means\nthat you consider him important to you. You consider whether he takes care of you or not, to a\nsometimes greater or lesser extent. You enjoy his company. Now, here is what could cause you to\nfall in love with him: you are happy that you have him. You want him to stay with you. That is\nwhat love is for. If he does not want you, though, then, it's all over. You will be unhappy. That\nlove will be gone, which is why, sometimes, it is not love at all even though you think it is love.\nAnd now, here is a way to test out true love. All you do is see how much he wants you. That is\ntrue love. But what is not true love? There are things I really do not want to become like \"my love.\"\nIf someone tells me that I belong to them, then I think this person does not belong to me. When\nsuch a person dies, I consider him dead to me. I do not care so much about somebody else\nbecause he or she is gone.\nLove, then, is a question of two hearts. One is the heart that you have for someone. It is the\nheart you feel for a particular person. Or it is the thought you may have for someone. Or it is\nthe desire that you share for a particular person. Whatever it is, it belongs to you. It is your\nheart that belongs to you. If you are not in love, if you only feel an urge for someone, that urge\ncan change into real love. But it has to start with the feeling you have. Someone else could\ntake that feeling, make it mean something else, and say that it is love. But it might not really be\nlove at all. It could be something like lust. True love is much more than the physical union of\ntwo bodies that are attracted to each other.\nWhat does \"true love\" mean? To start with, it means this: one has to be with someone one\nwants to be with. That is why the very first step is to like him or her \"a lot.\" You must have a feeling\nthat \"I really like him a lot\" or \"I really like her a lot.\" Why? Because, this is the beginning of\nlove. This is what you think about that person. \"I really like her a lot.\" It must be there, in your\nmind. When you have this feeling, then you can say that you love him. You really like him, and\nthat's important. The very first thought that we have about someone else should be that we\nlike him or her. If we do not really like someone, if we like the person only a little bit, then it\nis not love. It may be lust. It might even be a desire that we have to have the", "ASSIGNMENT AND OPERATION\nA. \tThe   Town  of   Stow   agrees  to  accept  for  the  sum   of\nTWO  HUNDRED  DOLLARS,  ($200.00), for an assignment of a Covenant   and  Condition,  running  with  the land,  in   the   Town  of  Stow and County of Middlesex at  Stow, within which   the   Town   of   Stow is contained, wherein  said Town  of  Stow   agrees  that  the  said Covenant and Condition  shall  run with the land in which   the  same  is  situated  forever,  to  in  lieu of, or in lieu of and in lieu of all other  Covenants   and  Conditions  running with the land thereof whatsoever,  and to in lieu of, or in lieu of  and in lieu of all other Covenants  and Conditions made by the said Town  of  Stow affecting the said land thereof whatsoever, all which  Covenants and  Conditions   said  Covenant  and  Condition  shall be  binding on the  said  Town  of  Stow and their Heirs successors and assigns forever and in their   lawful  being,   with   power  from time to  time to alter, amend,  or repeal the same and to provide for their  enlargement,  and the exercise of all rights and remedies hereinbefore granted in case of a nuisance or of a breach of any of the terms or conditions or this assignment or any amendment thereof of the Town of Stow, as now amended, revised and extended and as the same  may  hereafter  be amended.

However, with an estimated $2.5-billion renovation, and a 5,474-seat performing arts theatre, it was important that the venue's first public performance was a show that would demonstrate the facility's capabilities and potential, as well as reflect the history and tradition of the theater, and the arts. On October 21, that show will come to life, as the venue reopens with A Concert for New York City. In the summer of 2002, 15 months before the 25th anniversary of 9/11, the 20-minute \"A Concert for New York\" was broadcast as part of a telethon raising money for victims and families of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Now, 15 years and many millions of dollars later, A Concert for New York City will be performed again.\n\"If the JKF Center was going to showcase their new space, this was definitely the way to do it,\" says Richard Steinberg, President & COO, WorldStage. New York, N.Y.-based WorldStage is the exclusive technology sponsor of the JCFP, producing the visuals for the opening event.\nThe grand reopening of the JKF Center will mark the first time in 15 years that a live concert for the public will take place in New York City with its original configuration of stalls and balcony.\nThe restoration and renovations were spearheaded by renowned architect, James Hacker, in collaboration with the Theatrical Design & Production Alliance, a consortium of the world's most prestigious firms in theater design and production, from the Broadway stage down to the regional theater level.\nTo accommodate the new stage layout, WorldStage used Christie Spyric laser projectors to produce a custom video system that enables the seating bowl on all three levels to be a visual canvas for the artists and show's lighting designers.\nAfter the restoration of the seating bowl and its original proscenium and fly tower, WorldStage chose to use 22 Christie HD21K-M 21,000 lumens 3-chip DLP projectors to create two video walls to allow for an enhanced, detailed, and full-color video canvas for stage scenery and lighting effects. One video wall consists of a series of Christie HD10K-M HD10K DLP 3-chip projectors which span out from the fly tower to the proscenium arch, and the other runs the length of the balcony, giving the audience the sensation of being in the center of the stage itself, and allowing the audience to feel they are a part of the show.\nThe Christie HD21K-M is a full-range high-definition DLP projector with 3-chip optics designed and built with 20,000 lumens of brightness and 1080p resolution for 16 x 9 cinema and commercial screening applications. The Christie HD5K-M is a full-range DLP projector with 5,000 lumens of brightness providing true to life HD clarity, rich color, and amazing optical accuracy.\nWorldStage chose the Christie projectors due to their unparalleled image quality and reliability. They chose the Christie Spyric as the laser engine for long distance imaging.\nThe technology package includes an array of media servers, including two Catalina and one Profiles Plus from Video Server, allowing any show to be shown using whatever the designers use \u2014 high-resolution still images or video files of any size and resolution. Two Panasonic AG-HDD50 5\" HD DVCPRO field monitors are also installed and used to test the video signals, as well as to run the concert, which is being transmitted to a temporary transmission studio that is being erected in Philadelphia for the occasion.\nTo keep the audience entertained during the lengthy pre-show concert, Christie HD10K-Ms, each individually running 6.22-meter screens, were placed around the lobbies.

He's\nhis name.\nThe girl -- with the white hair and deep, mysterious\nblue eyes -- is called Alex (by him). When Daniel meets her, he is nothing. No home, no\nname, no money, and no identity -- but she knows him as \"Daniel.\" Alex offers comfort in a\nworld he doesn't understand, a world where the borders between real and unreal shift\nback and forth.

Her sleeping\nparadise was a dark and mysterious cavern, one where a boy named Daniel could be found\ntucked in a corner. He was huddled up near two boulders, his clothes soaked, his skin cold,\nand his hair wet -- but not a drop of rain. It was a humid summer night, but Daniel was\ncool, so cold that she wondered if he'd ever been\nwarm. Alex could never see the boy clearly, only in an eerie\nsilhouette. He always wore the same outfit as well, a blue T-shirt with the sleeves cut\noff, pajama pants, and black converse shoes. His head was often buried in his right\narm, the left twisted behind his back.\nShe did not recognize this man, but for some reason\nshe could help him.\nAlex remembered her dream, but this morning's\nmemories were foggy. A dark and mysterious cavern? A man with a white robe and a glass\nface? She remembered nothing except the boy, and her dream did not help with the\ndetails. At first, she suspected her dream was nothing more than a\nnightmare. When she recalled the sensation of seeing and remembering in her dream, it told\nher otherwise.\nHer mind began to retrace its thoughts back to\nyesterday. Yes, she did dream...in her mind. Not last night, not today, but\ntwo days ago. What is this? Why the hell do I have to go through this again? I remember\nwhat I dreamed, and that's all I remember.

Race/Culture:\nA variety of races and cultures should be represented within the director body and committee membership;\nDiversity should be reflected throughout the board in terms of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age and geographical location;\nDirectors should bring a variety of perspectives because all groups do not have the same interests or needs;\nAt least one director should have at least one or more ethnic minority groups as her/his primary ethnic group;\nSituations will arise in which specific cultural expertise will be important and useful to the organization and the board as a whole.\n3. Gender, Race, Culture (Involvement, Influence and Experience):\nWomen and racial/minority candidates are encouraged to seek positions as board directors. The diversity of the board membership will enhance the ability of the governing board to create and sustain change and ensure accountability to the diverse constituents of the AAUW community;\nThe board should also seek directors with a broad range of expertise and experience that will contribute to sound decision-making to ensure effective board functioning.\n4. Career Interests and Experience:\nIt is the responsibility of the board of directors to recruit, orient and advise directors on the nature of the organization's mission and goals;\nThe board takes into consideration when recommending candidates the director's knowledge of the nature of the AAUW's programs and their relationship to the mission of the organization;\nBoard members should provide diverse knowledge and/or experiences to the board committees on which they're appointed to serve;\nIt is not the responsibility of the board of directors to decide which areas an individual director should focus her/his knowledge, interest, and/or expertise on within the scope of the AAUW board's mission, responsibility and goals;\nBoard members should have experience in other social change organizations or agencies to understand the environment in which the AAUW operates;\nIncreasing access to higher education and equity is not the primary mission of the board. However, increasing and strengthening education for all women and girls is, and it is important for the board to remember that the AAUW is an education association.\n5. Diversity Experience/Consciousness:\nA high degree of sensitivity, a strong interest in and knowledge of a multicultural environment characterized by diversity and different values are important for an effective board of directors so that it is more sensitive to cultural differences and can work more productively in dealing with diverse constituents;\nThe board of directors should ensure that no person serves longer than any other person on the board as to avoid domination through long tenure;\nThe board seeks individuals with a high level of sophistication regarding diversity principles and practices.\nThe board will consider as part of the qualifications of a candidate whether there is an appearance of a conflict of interest and/or a relationship that would impair a director's ability to represent the best interests of the AAUW.\nIn view of the fact that any of the qualifications listed above may not exist in a particular individual, the candidate may still be appropriate for service as a member of the board. In such circumstances, the board may rely on its overall judgment of such a person's suitability as a member.\nThe board seeks individuals with a high level of sophistication regarding diversity principles and practices with experience and competence in dealing with diverse constituencies and being a part of a board.", "To help newspapers cope with the new\ndisclosures in the wake of Sept. 11, the AFL-CIO\nwill post on its Web site an article by New York Times\nreporter David Sanger that appeared in that newspaper's\nSunday magazine.  The story discusses America's long-term\ncapabilities to respond to a terrorist attack.\nAUTHORITY:  The union has a First Amendment\nright to distribute this article, which had already been\npublished previously in hard copy and online.\nREASONS:  The AFL-CIO is distributing this\nstory to its membership through the newspaper as well as\nthrough a link on its Internet site.  It does not appear\nthat the distribution constitutes copyright infringement,\nthough the AFL-CIO does not own copyright to the story in\nthe first place.

It appears that the\nplaintiff's complaint seeks a remedy that the AFL-CIO\ncannot provide and thus cannot be held liable for.  There\nis no indication of a \"direct connection between the\ninfringer and the defendant, meaning that the plaintiff\nwould likely be unable to \"hold accountable\" the AFL-\nCIO, even though the AFL-CIO may have \"access\" to a copy\nof the copyrighted work.  Because the AFL-CIO does not\nown a copyright in this story, the AFL-CIO could distribute\nthe story without violating copyright law.

The veteran`s back disability was previously denied service connection because the Board of Veterans` Appeals found in 1988 that the veteran lacked the ability to recall the exact date, time, and location of the fall that he claimed to have disabling injury. The Board also found in 1988 that the veteran was able to recall general features of the fall that provided sufficient material to reconstruct the events in enough detail to conclude that the claim of the incident in question was exaggerated. Accordingly, the Board found that any subsequent statements or recollections by the veteran did not meet the liberal reconsideration standard for service connection for a condition that was not of record.\nBy the DAB decision, the veteran is entitled to service connection from November 21, 1975, (the alleged date of the fall, plus the period of delay required to obtain the Board of Veterans` Appeals review of the veteran`s claim).", "In late March of 2008, 125 million Chinese travelers, 10 million of them headed for the United States, had just boarded an aircraft to fly home after their Chinese New Year vacations, but what they didn't know at the time, or in the near future, was that they had accidentally brought on board with them 80,000 copies of the _Wall Street Journal_ , a 15 percent increase in the paper's circulation. The previous year\u20142007\u2014the airline, China Eastern Airlines, had transported a little less than 100 million travelers to destinations like New York City, Hawaii, and Australia, and at least 84,750 of them had accidentally brought back with them a 1.3-ounce journal of American news. There is good reason for my quoting you the number of Chinese travelers in 2008. It will help you establish an understanding of the magnitude of the problem that our paper, the _Wall Street Journal_ , is about to encounter, and ultimately helps to convey the very reasons why we had to do the things we did to solve the problem and regain control.\nThe airline China Eastern Airlines was only one of many. In its wake came a host of other carriers who wanted in on the action. All of these carriers knew that they had gotten lucky, so they began to follow the China Eastern Airlines lead and \"liberate\" from their cabins any _Journal_ that may have been brought aboard as part of the luggage of any passenger, whether or not the passenger was a Chinese traveler. Within a month, the airlines began to report to us that they were experiencing problems with their cabin crews when confronted by a 1.3-ounce paper, called the _Wall Street Journal_ , as having just accidentally dropped off a Chinese traveler's packed luggage.\n_But I wonder how many of you would have been able to recognize the dimensions, let alone the dimensions from the perspective of what was at stake, of the problem at hand? And had you been able to do so, you would have recognized that only a small fraction of the Chinese travelers who were about to fly home were responsible for the increased distribution. But once we realized that China Eastern Airlines was merely a harbinger of all that was to follow, we had to find a mechanism to correct the situation, so a solution had to be found_.\n_We knew that we were facing an \"emergency,\" so the company wasted no time in launching a multipronged solution. First, I had to decide how to get the Chinese travelers to stop bringing home what they had brought aboard their flights. I knew that any number of things that we did would cause them to stop doing this, but it wasn't clear to me exactly what the most significant of those things would be_.\nWhat follows is the story of how we decided to take the battle to the Chinese national carrier, China Eastern Airlines. My presentation today is not intended to teach you the lessons of marketing or business strategy that could have helped us to avoid such a costly marketing gaffe. There are many sources of information\u2014textbooks, Web sites, or just about anything that has ever been written in an English-speaking country\u2014that will teach you various ways of getting yourself out of jams using marketing know-how. And even the best-written texts are generally not very effective in that they usually fail to teach you the nuances of a situation, which in any case are generally unknown to you.\nFor you to be able to truly learn the nuances of the situation I will be describing, you need to have a complete understanding of the story I am about to tell you. So let me begin by telling you that you are about to learn the following, all of which are factual and not in doubt:\nChina Eastern Airlines had no problem with having a Chinese passenger, or for that matter any other passenger, accidentally take a _Wall Street Journal_ aboard a flight. What it had a problem with was a 1.3-ounce newspaper that had 4.4 million subscribers. China Eastern Airlines is one of the largest Chinese airlines, and by no means was it alone in its problems. But that brings me to the next point:\nIn the second week of March 2008, the Chinese New Year, approximately 127 million Chinese people were either on vacation in foreign lands or were returning to their home countries.\nAbout 105 million (eighty-three percent) of them flew by plane.\nAbout 81 million (about 64 percent) of them were on international", "Newspaper Web sites are a great source of advertising revenues that are relatively easy to attain. They also help build and keep a brand\u2019s audience and create a loyal readership. As publishers increase their presence in the digital world, they are also looking internally to develop sites and apps that are optimized for mobile delivery.\nPublishers are moving to multi-platform delivery in an effort to serve their audience with content that is timely or, more accurately, as soon as the audience wishes to receive it. That means meeting audience demand for customizable content in a range of platforms that can satisfy their needs wherever they are, whatever their circumstances (being online at work, at home, or on the go), and where they want to receive the information. In other words, wherever they want us to deliver it.\nThe challenge for publishers is to understand that they no longer need to be dependent on the print medium to produce revenue. They need to make the effort to create the platform in such a way that they can maximize the use of audience reach and data, build audience loyalty, retain audience connection and build incremental revenues in this new era. One way to do this is to deliver content directly to the audience, or to those people who the publisher thinks are the closest to the audience.\nThe ability to deliver content directly or indirectly to the audience can be driven by three main pillars \u2013 content and data, connection and community, and incremental revenue opportunities \u2013 and has three clear and immediate benefits to publishing companies.\nFirst, a Web site with user-generated content, including both reader, sponsor, partner content and social media, can be in direct contact with the readers. It can also be in direct touch with what is happening in the worlds of the audience, and it can drive the future direction and the range and type of content as well as sponsored content. It can also act as an aggregation and curation tool. It\u2019s also becoming more and more important as it is becoming more and more clear that readers have developed a strong preference to consume content via their personal online devices regardless of the platform.\nSecond, the opportunity to serve a broader audience, across a wider range of verticals, and drive their use of the content on an ever-increasing range of devices makes this the best time to re-examine the content strategy. Aggregating and curating content in the same way as a search engine makes it easier for publishers to do their jobs well and find quality content to present their readers as part of the mix, to bring them into the fold and to keep them as brand advocates.\nThird, the Web site of the future will become a place where the customer and the reader can be more directly involved through social media and other user-generated content. For example, with the increasing role that mobile devices are playing in both the reading and the creation of content (iPad has no keyboard, so some things are much easier to do on a touch device), the use and the importance of a well-run Web site can only increase, not decrease.\nToday\u2019s content strategies should not simply focus on publishing content on their Web sites, but instead look at how that content can be curated and developed in parallel across a variety of different audiences. The result will be to create a more direct relationship with the customer as the Web site becomes less a place to post content and, in addition, becomes more of a platform to engage, connect and build loyalty.\nPublishers and content providers who make a strong effort to create a more user-centric, direct relationship strategy will be well-placed to grow their online audiences and, as such, their advertising revenue streams as the digital world continues to grow at a rapid pace.\n(This article is excerpted from the session, Audience Engagement 2.0, from the Newspaper Next CEO summit.

They are all wearing\ntropical shirts which are open to reveal a strip of tanned tummy. The stripes of\nthe shirts match those of the volleyball court, and the men look like the ball.\nThe men are all in a relaxed state, laughing and chatting and being generally\nreceptive to one another's advances.  They are having a good time.  There is a\nlone, lonely man on the left side of the picture.  He is not doing any of the\n\"lazybones\" things the others are.   He is holding his head in his hands as\nif to say, \"what am I doing here?\"  His stripes look like they are from a\ndifferent color volleyball court.\nA BRIEF COMMENT:  In this country, it is common for men to wear shorts that are\nabove the waist.  These shorts, however, do not reveal too much skin, so the\nbodies in these photos are all very lean and toned.  The men's faces are not\npuffy from fat, but are defined by their cheek bones.  In this way, these\nmen look more European than American or African.  If it were not for the\nsagging pants, they would look like men from a 1950's magazine.\nTEXT QUALITIES: There is no doubt that these are authentic photos.  They are\nshot in a studio setting, and the lighting has been perfectly adjusted.\nIn almost every photo, you can see the texture of the fabric which the men are\nwearing. The details have been caught, and every photo has a \"high-quality\"\nIn the photos of the stripes on the men's shirts, you get a perfect idea of the\nstripes that are on the volleyball court surface.\nThe photo from the waist up of the man is very strong.  You can tell the difference\nbetween his stripes and those around him.  His shoulders are rounded\nin slightly forward, and his neck is long and strong.  His arm is out\nas if to say, \"wake up, world.\"  He looks like an artist or painter.  It\nwould not surprise me if he had attended an art school in Boston, San Francisco,\nor West Virginia.  He looks like he has the soul of an old gentleman\nwho has long been forgotten by society.\nThe bottom half of the photo looks like it was taken on the subway.  The\nlighting was off, and the flash was only partially triggered.  The camera\nhad to have been held by hand.  The photo lacks focus, and that part of his\nbody is blurry.  This part of the photo looks out-of-focus.  It shows a\nperson who is just going through the motions of life and not really living.\nHE IS GIVING YOU EVERYTHING HE HAS.  It is as if he is saying, \"I can give you\nall the love I have.  How come you are not interested?\"  His body may be at\nrest, but his heart and soul are very much alive in every shot.  He has\nsoul, he has guts, he has life.\nTHE HAPPY ONES:  The man on the far left is grinning.  He has the look of a\nman who is enjoying his time.  To him, having fun is as easy as breathing.\nHis eyes show happiness, and he feels secure in his position in life.\nHis smile will linger long after he is gone from this world.  His smile is\na true smile, the perfect smile.  It does not remind one of a Hollywood\nactress's fake smile.  No actor could muster up the guts to do the\nexpression justice.  It is a true, natural smile, and it does not hide\nthe fact that he is feeling pretty good about himself.\nNOTE:  If you are in a ditch, a good smile can get you on your way again.  It\ncan be contagious, and it can really make a difference.  When a smiler is\naround, it makes others want to smile.  Smiles make the world go 'round.\nTROUBLING:  There are just two men to the right of the grinning man.  They\nlook like they are having a conversation, and are quite friendly.\nThey probably know each other quite well.  The man on the right has\nmore of a square smile.", "To ensure consumers have access to the content they want, news companies should look for ways to partner with the biggest Internet advertising platforms to drive new revenue from digital advertising opportunities.\nHow to Tackle the Opportunity of Digital Advertising\nBy Katie O'Reilly\nDirector of Emerging Market Development, New York Times\nLast summer, Pew released a report that claimed that only 26% of the population reads newspaper content every day or at least several times per week, a decrease from 2012. This, of course, is a major concern for news organizations. And, if that\u2019s not enough of a challenge for you, the Pew report also showed a 30% drop in newspaper readership among adults ages 18-29, 33% among 30-49, and 31% among those 50-64, a demographic that\u2019s traditionally held the majority of our readership.\nThis data is eye-opening for us at the New York Times given that a large majority of our newspaper readership comes from the coveted 18-49 cohort.\nOver the past 20 years, digital has been a major growth area for this group. In fact, we see more of an adoption of digital in the 18-49 demographic than any other age range. Last year, there were six unique users accessing the website for every print user (5,973). And while there was a slight drop since 2010 (151%), that still means that at our peak, we had 2,878 print users per digital user\u2014compared to 294% today.\nOne of the reasons we think print has held such significance to our readers is that our readers have developed habits around print\u2014and these readers are the same 18-49s that are the most likely to be avid digital consumers.\nAnecdotally, we also know that these young readers expect to be able to take a digital presence with them when they consume our brand and content. They expect to see our content appear and be easily accessible to them wherever they go, even in their pocket. They are savvy enough to know that the same content could be accessed anywhere on their smartphones. Thus, digital is no longer just a supplement for print, it is a must-have. So, how do we solve the dilemma that we have both a print and digital reader in one person? The answer is that we need to deliver the same content and service across all devices. And we know that doing so requires a deep understanding of the consumer\u2019s behavior across multiple channels.\nTo achieve this, we know our newsroom and advertising sales teams need to work collaboratively to meet the needs of modern readers. One of the ways we\u2019re achieving this is by creating cross-disciplinary teams focused on driving subscriber revenue through the use of digital advertising.\nThis initiative is a direct result of some of the recommendations that came out of the \u201cNext Generation Business Models\u201d conference held in July 2012. The conference, hosted by the Reuters Institute and Google, gathered senior and mid-level executives of national and major metropolitan news organizations, and discussed how to capitalize on the digital advertising and online content market.\nWe came up with three new roles: a head of ecommerce, a head of business development, and a cross-functional team consisting of a mix of digital ad operations and media buyers.\n\u201cThe head of e-commerce is responsible for defining and delivering our strategy to grow our digital advertising revenue on all digital platforms,\u201d said Jeff Heller, the Times head of strategy. \u201cOur business development head will help drive additional value with the traditional advertising clients.\u201d The cross-functional team combines the strengths of both teams so that the New York Times is using their advertising skills to drive revenue and increase consumer engagement.\nThe teams at our news organizations have always been very focused on the audience. And when you think about new product development, it has always been the audiences\u2019 needs that drove the development of new products. But I think we see an opportunity to shift our focus away from the traditional print audience to the new audience, the digital audience. And we\u2019re making this opportunity a priority. This new role puts this audience at the center of the strategy. And I think this idea will bring new audiences to our print and digital product.\nIt is important that the new roles are cross-functional. We need people at the media group, the business development function, the audience development function, and at the ad product group to be able to come up with new products and ideas for readers and advert", "The agency issued its decision in\nthe final rulemaking on the proposed rule revisions\nto its nutrition labeling regulations in the federal\nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.

The purpose of this revision is to eliminate the requirement to collect, process, store, and disseminate noncovered information where the requester provides specific assurances and agrees to bear all costs.\nDATES: Written comments should be submitted on or before February 9, 2000.\nAUTHOR: Jana Kemp, FOIA Officer, or Mandy Katz, FOIA Officer, Department of the Treasury, FOIA/Privacy, Eighth Floor, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220, (202) 874-4448.\nINFORMATION COLLECTED: Currently, we collect tax return information to determine whether it is necessary to collect, process, store, and disseminate taxpayer return information under the FOIA. We must also determine whether an exception to mandatory disclosure applies. In this process, we request that the requester provide a written assurance. We ask the requester if the information requested is taxpayer return information that is excluded from the disclosure requirements of section 6103(a) and if an exemption to the disclosure requirements applies, and, if so, which of the exemptions applies. The Treasury Department currently processes over 9,000 FOIA requests annually.\nBACKGROUND: Publication 1, General Tax Rules (2000 rev) explains to persons inquiring via the mail or phone about their tax liability where to file. It provides information on how to avoid delinquent tax liability as defined by ICDR 11. In addition, Publication 17 applies to the Department of the Treasury information disclosure obligation under the Freedom of Information Act. Finally, Publication 4460 is a publication designed to give the Department the opportunity to explain Treasury's position on specific issues pertaining to the Freedom of Information Act.\nRELEVANCE: Releasing information collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on tax liability for each individual under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), would impose an undue administrative and financial cost on the IRS. The IRS currently assesses fees, and does not have sufficient time or facilities to respond to FOIA requests from non-requesters. By publishing this proposed rule, the IRS has the opportunity to decrease government expenditure while still processing FOIA requests. Publication 1, General Tax Rules (2000 rev) explains the position of the IRS regarding whether a taxpayer is, or will be, liable for tax. It also specifies what information relating to taxes on income, gift, estate, etc., might be appropriate for disclosure. Publication 4460 is designed to give the Department the opportunity to explain Treasury's position on specific issues pertaining to the Freedom of Information Act. Publication 17 applies to the Department of the Treasury information disclosure obligation under the Freedom of Information Act.\nPURPOSE: This revision eliminates the requirement to collect, process, store, and disseminate noncovered information where the requester provides specific assurances and agrees to bear the costs of providing such information.\nSOLICITATION OF COMMENTS: The Director of the Executive Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. The Director also determined that the requirements in the rules that remain after this revision will have an impact on and affect persons or entities of types identified in the categories set forth in 5 CFR 1320.3(c).\nThe Treasury Department believes that the revision of this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RFA. Rather, this rule is intended to have a beneficial effect on the affected small entities.\nIf the Rule is withdrawn, the information collection would have to be resubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). For each new application a separate information collection would have to be developed. The Treasury Department expects to save time and money by eliminating the mandatory data collection from non-covered entities and the attendant costs of designing the data collection system, data entry, validation, training, testing, program management/auditing, and data analysis. Also time and money will be saved by eliminating manual review of the data. The Treasury Department expects to be able to respond to information requests in a shorter amount of time and with", "In the wake of the New York Times\u2019s successful cross-platform push to promote Op-Ed Columnist Nicholas Kristof\u2019s new book, \u201cHalf the Sky,\u201d this new report offers three cross-platform success stories to inspire innovative thinking within your organisation.\nIn April 2011, The New York Times ran Op-Ed Columnist Nicholas Kristof\u2019s new book, \u201cHalf the Sky.\u201d The promotion of \u201cHalf the Sky\u201d spanned multiple platforms, in both print and digital.\nThe push to sell Kristof\u2019s book was promoted on the top of the front page of the print edition, and included a book trailer video clip with Kristof and his daughter at the top of the home page.\nThe book\u2019s launch pushed the online version of The New York Times to its own record, with 10.6 million online visitors \u2013 beating the previous record of 10.4 million.\nIn addition to The Times\u2019s cross-platform push, Kristof and several New York Times journalists hosted Twitter chats focusing on topics and issues within the book, including women in Afghanistan and the global fight against maternal mortality, which were promoted through the use of the hashtag #HalfTheSky.\nThese steps helped make this a very successful book launch for The New York Times, but where can your organisation go from here? This report offers three cross-platform case studies to help inspire innovative thinking within your organisation.\nCASE STUDY #1: VIDEO CLEAR CHANNEL INSTITUTE\nThe Clear Channel Institute has introduced its new digital media initiative through a cross-platform, video-heavy strategy.\nLeading with a print effort, The Clear Channel Institute\u2019s magazine, \u201cThe Catalysts,\u201d was delivered out-of-home at media hubs such as airports, trains, subways, parks, and college and university campuses across the US.\nThe print issue included 42-inch video ads on the facing pages, each of which promotes a series of short videos that are exclusive to the print edition.\nThese videos, which have played on a rotating basis since launch, include interviews with innovators, a look inside the institute\u2019s newest initiative, and several others. As a result of this strategic multimedia approach, The Clear Channel Institute has seen a steady stream of online traffic at www.theclearchannelinstitute.org and an increase in its Twitter and Facebook audiences.\nCASE STUDY #2: THE NEW IBERIAN EXPRESS\nPublisher EiTB has rebranded its morning magazine as The New Iberian Express \u2013 or as many are calling it \u2013 TNIX.\nAlthough TNIX is aimed at an English-speaking audience, the print edition still focuses on news specifically related to Spain, but the website \u2013 including the home page and story pages \u2013 is written in English and promotes a cross-platform multimedia approach.\nStories on the website are accompanied by video, music, and often still images in a single layout. Users are encouraged to follow stories through links, social media, or email. The publisher has also made the site platform and language-neutral, allowing stories to be translated into English on the site.\nTNIX\u2019s multimedia approach to its digital edition is a fresh and inventive way to increase engagement.\nCASE STUDY #3: CRYPTO CRAFTY\nCryto Crafti.com is an online publication that offers a creative cross-platform multimedia approach.\nAt Cryto Crafti.com, users can read an in-depth interview with cryptographers, which includes full text and a video from the interviewees. Video comments from the readers accompany the story, which is presented on the interactive website.\nTo increase user engagement, the content is broken down into 150 second chunks on the Cryto Crafti.com website. This allows users to easily share the short clips online (via Twitter and Facebook) for others to see and discuss. Although the publisher allows users to view the interviews and commentaries on any platform, the main focus remains mobile and tablet access, which allows users to quickly watch the interviews and commentaries on TV. Cryto Crafti.com has also made sure the video and the text go hand-in-hand. Users who want to look back at the full interview and comments will automatically display when the videos are running. Readers can watch the video in full screen on Cryto Crafti.com, and follow comments below.\nCryto Crafti.com is innovative with its unique style of multimedia. It is simple and easy-to-use, and the content is", "As part of the \u201c100 Things To Do Before You Die\u201d campaign, we asked readers: \u201cWhat do you do that you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\u201d\nESSENTIALS: The first of our series of \u201c100 Things\u201d stories looked at the idea of adventure.

But it was a 1997 merger that created the modern-day Hearst\nCorporation, which is comprised of a collection of media companies,\nthat cemented Hearst's role as a power player at Berkeley.  Under\nthe new structure, both Hearst Corp. and its newspaper arm would\nreceive increased support from Berkeley, which had already provided\nthe University of California with some $5 million by 1999.\nAs for individual Berkeley publications, their ties to Hearst and\nHearst Corp. have gone through three distinct phases - with\nparticipation increasing during an important period of history for\nboth the Hearst Corporation and the California campus.\n1963-1984: First of two 11 years of Hearst-funded projects with\nBerkeley. Most notable was a weekly news program, which also\nreceived funding from other outside corporate sponsors. Over those\n11 years, a wide variety of organizations from outside the media\nindustry - including KPFA radio, and Pacific News Service among\nothers - were able to apply for funding at Berkeley, and it's\npossible the university played an indirect role in Hearst's\neventual merger with Pendulum Publishers in 1978.\n1984-1996: Hearst Publications drops off radar screen; Cal TV\nreceives $167,000 from the corporation's Foundation in that final\nyear. Hearst donations are overshadowed by state funding.\n1997-2004: Hearst Newspaper chain provides money and staffing\nsupport to new Cal TV and also to the university newspaper the Daily\nCal, which in 1999 received $75,000 from Hearst, which is more\nthan any other Berkeley news organization during that decade. Over\nthe entire period 1997-2004, Cal TV, UC Berkeley radio station KALX,\nand the Daily Cal are the primary beneficiaries of funding given to\nUC Berkeley by the new Hearst Corporation. During all three periods,\nit seems possible the Hearst Foundation's support was significant to\nUC Berkeley, with the potential to create stronger ties between\nthe corporation and the university, a goal the University of\nCalifornia and Hearst have already signaled a strong interest in.\nHearst TV\nUC Berkeley  $515,00  $71,000        $0        $0\nCal TV\nKALX\nThe Daily Cal\n*Hearst's contribution in the first period was spread out over\nthat same nine-year period, compared to the first six years of\nits second contribution period (prior to funding going to Cal TV\nand the Daily Cal) in the second.\nCal TV\n*Hearst donations increased dramatically after Cal TV was funded in\nOctober 1997, and after the Daily Cal reorganized its editorial\nboards in 1999 - a move that may have been driven by both internal\nand external factors.\nFurther Details on How Money Was Allocated\nHearst's $75,000 contribution to the Daily Cal in 1999 ($70,000 of\nwhich was allocated to the Daily Cal's news section and $5,000 to\nits sports section) was part of its larger three-year contribution\nto the campus' newspaper. The 1999 grant, according to a Daily\nCal editor, \"was specifically in recognition of the merger of the\nDaily and the California (the paper had been published as both\non alternate days).\" A 1997 Hearst spokesman said the $110,000 grant\nwas intended\"to assist the paper in its efforts to grow in both\nscope and quality.\"\nHearst gave $71,000 ($67,000 of which was given to the news\nsection) to Cal TV in 1997, which the student group used to\nupgrade its equipment, from VHS to digital. According to\nCalTV'", "Blog as community\nIn the end, blogs are communities, so don't make one for\nthe hell of it. Build blog communities that add a voice, a\npoint of view, an energy to your overall communications.\nThat might mean inviting different thought--it might mean\nbuilding community around the kind of issues you might ignore\nin most publications. If you've got a very focused topic\nand lots of people who come to it (newsletter readers,\nmeeting attendees, or just customers), have a simple blog\nfor them. If you have a broader audience but your product\nand message are pretty simple, a blog with multiple\ncontributors, and a blogroll (more later in the chapter)\nof relevant related sites, could work. The point is to build\nan area on your site where you can \"be conversational\" and\nbehave like your people would.\nThat means:\n - Put up your content--if it's textual, then by all means,\nwrite it or record it and get it up out of the way\nquickly. A lot of our content-intensive sites are being\nreplaced by blogs.\n - Don't make things too editorial or too heavy--people come to\nyour blog to see your stuff, not to hear about yours.\n - Make it a conversation--that doesn't mean just linking\nout to other conversations, it means engaging your reader in\na conversation, and contributing when you can and when\nsomething makes sense for that piece of content. It's a\nlittle more work, but it creates a much better relationship\n- Make good use of the comment area. A blog is a conversation, and one of the best ways to keep that conversation going is to leave your own comment within the content. And make sure all comments are moderated--it's really easy to find ways to spam the whole blog and most of them can be prevented just by being a little careful with what you do.\n- Keep your eye on the community--it's a little hard to predict\nwhat you'll see from the community--not all of it will be useful, but you should try to monitor it to see what the community is thinking about your content. And you might do the occasional poll.\n- Be aware of what you do with your blog--it really is a\npromotion tool. It's a place to have fun; it's a place you can go to talk to your friends; or it's a place you can go to just watch friends talk. (And most likely, a little of all of them.)\nAnd so what, you ask? Well, that's what I have here, a community. And I do my little part of the conversation as often as I find it useful to do so. I don't always comment on everything I see, nor do I always respond to all of the comments I get. But that only means those people either haven't left something \"too good\" for me to respond to, or, if I feel it doesn't fit into this particular conversation well, that the conversation is going somewhere else.\nSome blogs don't have the conversation (and some conversations probably wouldn't have the blog).\nBlogs are like communities, which means you have to create one to have one. They also tend to have a life of their own.\nIn the end, blogs are communities, so don't make one for the\nhell of it. Build blog communities that add a voice, a point of\nview, an energy to your overall communications.\n1.    In the end, blogs are communities, so don't make one for\nthe hell of it.

And we need to listen.\"\n**  Cybergeneration **\nCybergeneration and the digital revolution could have a profound affect on\nhow we will do business in the future.\nThe Cybergeneration is a generation whose parents were all 'digital immigrants'. In\nfact they are the ones whose parents and grand parents were in their late thirties and early\nforties as the Internet came on stream. They are in their late teens and early twenties now.\nThese techno-savvy, connected and informed young people are already running their own\nwebsites and chatrooms, and are the latest generation to hit the streets. As the\nMillennium approaches, they are about to become \"the generation\" in terms on\nbusiness and industry.\nBut Cybergeneration is much more than a generation of online youth. It is\na 'cultural' movement. Just like the hippies in the sixties and the ravers in\nthe late eighties, this is a group of young people whose interests include music,\nmedia and fashion.\nIt is a group of young people who are connected and informed in ways\nthat their parents could only dream of.\nThe internet has revolutionized the way that people do business. In fact\nthe internet - combined with the internet of things, wireless connectivity and other\ndevelopments in technologies has meant that business can now be conducted on the\nmove from anywhere, at anytime.\nWhen it comes to mobile phones business is moving far and away from simple voice\nphone calls to text-messaging and the use of emails to conduct daily business.\nBusiness can now be done online and many businesses are finding the new technologies\nessential to do so.\nTechnology and the internet is no longer the exclusive preserve of businesses and\nenterprises and the white-collar professional. It is changing the way that ordinary\npeople live their lives and do their shopping.\nThere is the added bonus that many of these technologies can make life easier\nand more convenient for them. Many people spend more and more hours 'connected'\nusing mobile phones, the internet, emails and satellite navigation. They are\ngambling that the future will bring more connected gadgets and services that\nwill save them time and make life easier.\nBut the Cybergeneration have grown up in this world. They have always\nknown about the internet - perhaps they even helped to install it in their homes. They are\nused to this technology which is so much part of their everyday life. So it is not surprising\nthat for Cybergeneration it is just plain \"normal\" to have a mobile phone, watch movies\non line - or even do their shopping online.\nMuch of Cybergeneration 'chatter' is done via 'chatrooms'. Some of it is serious,\nsome of it not so serious. Some of it consists of 'shopping' where people\ncompare the best prices for goods online.\nCybergeneration are different and they are doing things in a different way.\nThe Cybergeneration has the chance to alter the way that business is done in\nthe future. For many businesses, Cybergeneration marks the last chance to\nensure that their business has a chance of success amidst such changes.\nAnd for some people, those who have never heard or seen the benefits of the\ninternet, it means that they are in danger of being left behind in the rush to\nThe future belongs to the connected.

To do this, from the CM/ECF browser, click on the document number (the 10-digit number that follows a \"Doc. #\" line) in the document window and type ^x in the \"Save as bookmark\" name box that appears. Then just make sure the bookmark is set to open with a single mouse click and you are all set. This feature works for both parties in a case where the original party is not an attorney but the copy of the document is being accessed by an attorney. This feature works the same way for all parties.\nA number of people have written to let me know that they have found that they can't generate a copy of a public document using the ^x trick, and the problem is that someone has selected the docunment to print/download rather than opening it. The CM/ECF system can make a copy of it after you select print/download.\nIt is important to note that the ^x trick can be used with a document that is on the docket, that is assigned a case number after its filing, and which is not an advanced matter matter/case. For example, you cannot click the ^x on the docket or on a filing that becomes part of the main docket after it is filed using ^a. The ^x only works with an original document.\nThe ^x trick can be used to copy and then post a document that is not part of the main docket or a docket. For example, if you don't have access to the scanner at work at 9 pm and you want to make a copy of a document to use for a filing the following morning, it would be perfectly suitable to use the ^x trick to copy the document.\nSame thing with copying documents that a party is attempting to use in opposition to an advanced matter filing. A party typically sends a filing to attorneys in support of a position a party is taking and that will be used in an opposition to be filed to the court. That advanced matter filing will not have a docket number by the time the filing is received (this can be a day or two later). Before filing, however, one would normally save the document in a file so that later when making the opposition, one can use it in its own filing. The ^x trick will do that.\nIf you need to make a copy of a public document that is a page(s) in the main e-dockets (i.e., a document that is part of the docket and to which at least one other party has had at least 30 seconds to see) the ^x trick won't work. It's a little known secret but there is a reason for that, and it's because (1) all docs on the docket have a control number, and (2) there is a way for the filer of a new public filing to obtain a copy of the document.\nYou can obtain a copy of a page on a public filing by clicking the 1-line number of the page. That 1-line number will produce a dropdown list of the pages in the document. If you need a copy for a filing you are preparing, right down that 1-line number and type the ^x into the address bar of your browser. This will place a ^x to open with a single click on the original document.\nThe ^x trick works because the public document in the court's e-dockets actually has a file name and when you try to open the file you get the original document. A control number isn't a file name but a number associated with the document number. If the file number isn't associated with a particular document, the CM/ECF server will give you the control number instead.\nSometimes CM/ECF will take back a copy you have saved even though the ^x technique has been used to save it. That is a mistake you have to correct in the CM/ECF browser. Click on the ^x to make a bookmark for the document, and then click on the ^x to open the document.\nEPIC FILENAME\nThe other important thing to know if you are a filing party and need to save a copy of a document that has already been filed is that the first 3 characters of the document name, \"doc\" are for the EPIC system only. That leaves 9 characters remaining for filers' use and all of those are important because all filers can use the first 9 characters for bookmarking and filers can also use all 9 characters to organize filings themselves after the", "Aggregated audiences, big wins, and the importance of branding in newsletters.\nThe digital transformation of modern communications is no longer just a nice-to-have: It\u2019s imperative. From the ability to publish content for any platform at a moment\u2019s notice to the use of algorithms and other software to produce highly individualized audiences, we\u2019ve finally reached a point where communicators have tools that can turn average content into extraordinary results.\nYet one area continues to hold organizations back: newsletters, says Sara Miano, Director of Marketing and PR at Lumen5.\n\u201cNewsletters are the holy grail of B2B inbound marketing strategies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are consistently the No. 1 outlet for leads because you can easily add links to other content like white papers, videos, and infographics \u2014 while providing valuable insights in each issue.\u201d\n\u201cYou can also use social media platforms to expand your reach, and the data gathered for each newsletter will tell you exactly who is opening your newsletter and when.\u201d\nWhile the appeal of newsletters is easy to understand, many organizations have yet to effectively employ them and get the most out of them is what they are missing, Miano added. She discussed recent trends in the marketing world at the TMRE 2017 conference in Orlando, Florida, and provided tips on crafting successful newsletters.\n\u201cThis is a challenge that communicators are beginning to face across the US,\u201d she said. \u201cAccording to SalesForce\u2019s State of Marketing 2018 report, 61% of customers are dissatisfied with the content they receive from brands. If you are publishing content that doesn\u2019t provide value, your brand will be diminished in the eyes of potential customers \u2014 and that\u2019s why the importance of a quality newsletter cannot be overstated.\n\u201cIf you want to use newsletters to promote your brand, you can\u2019t just slap something together and expect a huge return in results. You have to make it clear who you are, give readers a consistent look and feel, and use data and analytics to create a quality, relevant product that provides a consistent value. Here are a few of the things I recommend doing to do that.\u201d\nNewsletters are increasingly common among B2B organizations who know how valuable their content can be when it connects with the right people. There is a strong business case to be made for using newsletters, and that has only strengthened as digital tools have become more accessible.\nFrom there, the key is to maximize the impact of newsletters, both by using high-quality content and creating newsletters that are personalized to fit your brand.\nThe Impact of High-Quality Newsletters\nTo start, newsletters need unique and compelling content that speaks directly to specific target audiences, said Miano. This could include topics of industry interest as well as a focus on customer engagement and other topics. She compared newsletters to the more basic e-newsletters distributed as a static PDF.\n\u201cMany people feel nostalgic for email newsletters in the same way they remember listening to music from a cassette tape,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might be simple and even convenient, but they also don\u2019t give the same kind of experience as a well-designed, high-quality audio or video production. Newsletters are a lot like that.\n\u201cWhile newsletters are great ways to distribute marketing content to audiences, they can sometimes fall short when it comes to offering a well-designed experience that meets the standards set by your audience, your organization, and your brand,\u201d said Miano.\n\u201cYou need to create a visually appealing and engaging experience that makes content look more like something that you\u2019d be more likely to share on social media than an e-mail blasting from your inbox. This can be done in a variety of ways, but it all comes down to having the right tools to create a polished and compelling experience that stands out among competitors.\u201d\nMiano gave the following example of how technology can be leveraged to make digital newsletters more interesting and engaging while at the same time being convenient to implement.\nNewsletter personalization can take many different forms, from customizing the user\u2019s name in the subject line and/or the content\u2019s headlines to hyper-targeting e-mails to the right people. However, the more personalized a newsletter is tailored towards the individual, the more the reader feels as though it was actually meant for them. When this happens, it feels tailored and personable. This can help increase the value of a newsletter by", "HR is at the centre of technology\ntechnology and human resources - the role of HR is set to\nA recent survey for HR magazine found that over 80 percent of\nexecutives believe their company can achieve success at\ninternet speed. That's because HR is the business, and the business\nis using technology to stay on top.\n- in a fast paced economy, HR's role is becoming increasingly vital,\nHR's profile in many organisations has changed since they\nentered the information age.\nthe internet has changed the way you recruit and manage the work\nforce, the way you deal with performance issues and the way we work\nat work. However, the internet was not built just for you.\nit was built for all employees - both present and future.\nThe internet is also a means for managing human resources.\nhave all become internet employees.\nthe internet has opened up a whole new world for HR. One in which\ninformation and communications technologies give you an\nopportunity to make the difference.\nyour first step on this internet journey it is vital to take the\ntime to learn a few basic concepts.\none of the most basic principles to master is the internet itself.\nthe internet is not just another application, it is not a business\ntool, and it is not an IT application. It is the global information\nrevolution. It is a way of communicating information. It is a way\nof organising, archiving, retrieving and storing information. It is\na way of sharing information. Most importantly, in the early years\nof internet technology it was considered to be a tool for\neverybody. One in which everybody would be equal and the playing\nfield would not be uneven.\nis another concept HR must understand - information technology.\nnot a business tool and it is not an IT application. It is the\nbasics of communicating data and information. It is the way we\nshare information as people. This is fundamental - the internet is\na medium to the business community at large, not a business itself.\nincreasingly, HR has a role to play in the\nintegration of the internet into the workplace technology. Not\nbecause HR is technology, but rather it is because HR is the business,\nand the business has integrated technology into all aspects of its\noperations. It's time to wake up and smell the information age. If\nyou are having trouble coping with the new reality, the fast pace\nof things, the increasing complexities in business life, you must\nfirst understand that we are on a new playing field. The internet\nis a medium just like the telephone and fax is a means of\ncommunicating. We all know faxes and telephones are tools, and tools\nare utilised to complete a task. But when you add the internet into\nthis mix, it also has a functional purpose - speeding up communications\nand business workflows.\nare two steps HR must take to understand its new role - 1. HR must\nunderstand business operations and workplace strategies. HR must\nunderstand how business operates - how it is organised, what\nfunctions exist and how things are delivered. In the internet, it\nis not enough to understand the technology. HR must also know\nexactly what the business is doing and what it is going for. What\nis the business strategy? Where is the business going? The answers\nto these fundamental questions will determine what technology is\nneeded and what technology is already in place.\nsecond step for HR is to integrate the workplace strategy with the\ntechnology we have in the office. HR will be asked to come\nup with ideas of how information access is used as a strategic\nasset. The new frontier for employee benefits is information\nservices. HR must be a part of an organisation's competitive advantage\nand help the organisation stay ahead of its competition - which\nalso means staying ahead of the market. HR must understand that\nHR is a strategic function - and not everyone's problem. HR cannot\nbe a back-office function. HR must be engaged in the strategic\nplanning and management of the organisation. IT strategies\nbecome company-wide policies that are part and parcel of overall\nbusiness strategies. HR must not only know this process will\nprobably take place, it must be a part of it because it will help\nHR define its new role and the organisation define its needs\n- because people are on your mind, but the economy is on the\nthe most crucial function of HR is to manage human capital. That's\na big role and in today's internet economy it becomes", "The Department of Finance,\nHuman Resources Administration and\nLicensing (HRA) is proposing to amend Chapter 23 of Title\n24 of the Rules of the City of New York to establish the\nProbation and Probationer's Compliance Fund and transfer\nfunds from this fund into an existing city reserve fund, the\nFederal Reimbursement Advance Contingency Reserve. In\nestablishing the new fund, the Probation and Probationer's\nCompliance Fund, the Department proposes to amend certain\nprovisions of Rule 23-09.7. Under this rule, HRA seeks\nauthorization from the New York City Board of\nEstimate cost as\na special\nApproval of the Probation and Probationer Compliance Fund - A411-3-001\nIn 2012 the City Council authorized HRA to establish the\nproposed Probation and Probationer's Compliance Fund to\nreimburse the costs of probationers who, for example,\nviolate the terms of their probation, and require them to\nleave the City or their current residence. The City\nCouncil authorized HRA to transfer up to $25.0 million\nfrom the Probation and Probationer's Compliance Fund into\nexisting city reserve funds, namely the Federal Reimbursement\nAdvance Contingency Reserve to reimburse probation\ncompliance costs incurred during a limited period of time\nbeginning April 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. HRA has\nincurred such costs and is authorized by this amendment to\ncharge and assess the costs to probationers who fail to\nmeet the conditions of such probation.\nThe proposed rule amends Rule 23-09.7, which sets out\nthe procedures that HRA follows for the implementation of\nthe Probation and Probationer's Compliance Fund when a\nprobationer is in need of compliance services as noted\nabove. The proposed rule change would: (1) increase the\namount of the probation and probationer's compliance costs\ndeposited in the Probation and Probationer's Compliance\nFund from three percent (3%) to five percent (5%) of\nprobationer's bail, in lieu of or as a supplement to the\nexisting two percent (2%) of probationer's bail currently\ndeposited, and would (2) delete the three-year\nprobationary period cap required for deposit into the\nFederal Reimbursement Advance Contingency Reserve as the\nFederal Government may cease reimbursing the city for\ndeposits into that fund.\nThe proposed rule is estimated to have an estimated 10 to \n135 annual economic impact of <$10,000 for costs associated with\nthe establishment of a reimbursement fund. Approximately one hundred seventy\n(170) individuals are expected to be served, with 20%-40% of the\ntarget individuals being low-income. This action would directly\naffect 10 to 15 individuals at a cost of approximately $7 per\nindividual for a one-time out-of-pocket payment.\nThe Department requests rule amendments to clarify the\ndeposit and disbursement of funds from probation fees and\nviolation fees. This rule will affect approximately 2,170,000\nNew Yorkers living in New York City and approximately\n220 probationers. The amendment of Rules 23-09.7(c) (F)\n(1), (2) and (4) and Rule 23-10.6(f)(1), (2) and (4) by the\nDepartment of Finance will strengthen the integrity of the\nDepartment and will contribute to making the City safer by\nreducing recidivism for the individuals on probation and\nholding them accountable when they break the law and when\nthey fail probation. Requiring probationers to pay for\ncompliance services and the cost of community service when\nthey are assigned to provide community service as part of\ntheir probation, will increase the City's ability to support\nthe individuals on probation and hold them accountable\nthrough the Probation and Probationer's Compliance Fund", "In the world of the future, only one person can uncover a conspiracy to\ndestroy the world.

They spend time at every\nlevel analyzing needs, and then developing\nsolutions that address those needs. Through\nconsistent delivery of value, they have built\ntheir brand equity year after year.\nCompared to marketing organizations, the\nmedia industry has a much more rudimentary understanding of its business.\nWe often don't spend the time at the forefront of\nthe process of developing value messaging.\nWe tend to be reactionary, focusing on\nproblems, not solutions. The result is a\nweak marketing message.\nThere are some media companies that have\ngreat value messages, and a whole\ncategory of media companies that have\nno value message at all.\nLet's look at four elements of an effective\nmessaging system that could add value to\nhow the media industry perceives its business.\nWe know the industry's messages are\ntoo generalized and too narrow, but\nthat's often due to a basic failure to\narticulate our value. We need to\ncommunicate what's unique, what\nno one else can do, what we uniquely\ncan provide. We need to be able to\ndeliver the unique value a\nconsumer receives from\nour products (both physical\nproducts and services).\nA key to effective marketing is a\ncompelling promise, which focuses\non benefit. The promise is the core\nfor the value package.\nIn a marketing message, what's offered\nshould be stated in an advantage statement.\nIn a media message, the product, service,\nor feature is stated in the advantage statement.\nWe have lots of media products, services,\nand features. The problem is we don't\ndefine the advantage of each one.\nOne advantage statement for a print media\noffering, for example, could be as follows:\n<\"The ___ does this to attract the right advertisers and\nreaders that will attract the right advertisers.\"\nThis statement provides the value to the customer.\nIt differentiates our product from competitors.\nIt makes us unique.\nIf the product or service we offer is\nsomething that the customer wants,\nthen the next step is to build value\nthrough quality or delivery. When\npeople want something, we want\nthem to have the best. Our\nmessage should emphasize the\nbest in our product or service.\nThe media message must deliver the\nquality of content, the quality of\nreaders, the quality of the experience\nfor that specific piece of media.\nAdvertisers and consumers want to know\nwhat the product will deliver.\nSo the media message must\ndeliver the message, the quality,\nthe level of trust, the experience\nthat consumers are looking for.\nIf we sell and package our product\ncorrectly, and then add the delivery\ncomponent, we know, with certainty,\nthat we're offering some quality\nof experience. This\nmessage could read as\n>    The _________ delivers a high quality\nexperience to get the advertiser in the\nright place at the right time.\nFor digital media, we're talking\nabout the level of service and quality.\nThe message could read as:\n>    The _________ provides a high-quality,\npersonal, and responsive experience to\nthe consumer in all forms of media.\nThis is a very important part of an\neffective message:\nDeliver the solution that is going to\nhelp the customer.\nPeople don't buy a problem.\nThey buy a solution.\nOur message should be:\n>    The _________ will help advertisers solve\nproblems and be more persuasive with their\nconsumer audience, allowing them to build\nmeaningful engagement in today's media\nenvironment and beyond.\nTo summarize, we can use the following four-step process for media message creation:\nDeliver Value + Differentiation + Service = Solve Problem\nIn closing, let's look at one word: \"quality.\"\nMarketing guru Seth Godin wrote that: \"In the\nend there is only a choice between quality\nand quantity.\n\"That's the fundamental\nmarketing decision we all must\nmake.\"\nThere are", "If a media outlet isn't taking advantage of the opportunity to connect with an engaged audience who is interested in its content, that outlet's content is likely to be stale.\nBy now, most media outlets have created or are in the process of creating social media accounts to help them increase engagement with their content.\nAlthough some social channels may be more popular amongst consumers than others, each channel can provide content producers with opportunities to find new audiences and share additional types of content in addition to the type of content for which traditional media outlets were known.\nI like to take the \u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d route. By creating a presence and a following on social media and publishing thoughtful, creative, and informative content on all channels, I encourage audience engagement and development. When you take time to develop a presence with your audience, you can share additional types of content including content that you may not have had the time to produce in the past but now can because of the audience's participation.\nMost social channels are good channels for news, information, and analysis. Depending on the topic, some of the content that you share may be more suited to a particular site. For instance, the social site Snapchat is not the best place to share breaking news, although you may want to provide information on where the reader can obtain the latest updates.\nIf it's important information, you will want to be where your readers are. Depending on your audience and the topic of the content you are sharing and creating, you can decide on which social channel to use and how frequently to use it.\nConsider the following case study regarding the use of social media at The Charlotte Observer.\nWHEN THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA BECAME AS BIG AS THE OBSERVER'S NEWSPAPER\nThe Charlotte Observer and its newsroom have embraced all of the opportunities that social media presents. It's not just about creating a Twitter account; it's about creating a social media presence that includes engagement with the consumer. The Charlotte Observer's decision to create a presence and to take advantage of the opportunity to connect with an engaged audience who was interested in its content was a wise one; it resulted in greater audience engagement.\nThis was particularly important once the newspaper was about to print its last issue. While the newspaper planned the transition to an online-only format for the morning edition of its Sunday newspaper, its Twitter followers were posting questions about the transition.\nThis type of interaction is a typical occurrence on social media. People want to ask questions or share information and comments directly with you. Don't disregard these communications. The Charlotte Observer provided thoughtful and direct answers to all of the questions it received during this particular event. Its followers were able to read how the newspaper and its staff were handling the impending cutback.\nSeveral reporters became celebrities or local news personalities in their local communities. These individuals, because of their Twitter accounts, were also able to interact with their readers. For instance, when a person needed more information on a particular topic, that person reached out to the reporter via Twitter and received the answer.\nThe Charlotte Observer is a strong local news organization that has created a Twitter account for its employees rather than one to represent the newspaper's perspective. For example, instead of an account titled @TheCharlotteObserver, it's @TheCharlotteObs. This choice provides the reader with the identity of \"the observer.\" Its employees are the news source. As a result, its followers feel as though they are getting the news from an observer, and not as though they are reading a newswire account or a marketing copy.\nAnother interesting use of social media is the Charlotte Observer's use of YouTube for publishing videos that are then shared on social media. The newspaper also has a Facebook page, although its Twitter account has more followers than its Facebook account.\nWith the publication's final print issue being available on Sunday, April 7, 2013, it's difficult to make predictions for the newspaper. However, we can't discount the impact that the presence on social media created through its Twitter presence and the impact of the publication's change to a digital-only format.\nIf the newspaper was going to make this type of decision and take this type of action, it needed and wants to be informed and involved with its audience.\nThe Observer was one of the few local news organizations that made a decision to engage readers and then to take action. This type of decision required the newsroom to be innovative. These newsroom decisions were not made in a vacuum. The information gleaned from social media outlets allowed the Observer to become aware of", "Brian Westhouse had lived at 834 East 83rd Street his whole life. His father, Charlie Westhouse, had bought the house for its current owner when it first went on the market, and Charlie then lived in the house as the single bachelor owner until Brian, his only son, was born. The house, in its two-family form\u2014Charlie had, from the time the house had been built, employed a woman in the downstairs apartment as cook and housekeeper\u2014sat on the corner of 83rd Street opposite the apartment block that housed Brian's own school, and was right over the street from a row of large one-family houses. At an opportune time, however, a widow had come a-looking for a suitable house, intending to rent a number of rooms to college students; the house had been too large and Charlie's wife, Hilda, who was the school principal at P.S. 83, thought it would be a suitable arrangement for Brian's schoolmates to live in, and so Brian, who was just approaching eight years old, moved with his parents, his brother, and his schoolfriend, George, down on 83rd Street for the first time.\nThey moved in on a Saturday, in the early evening, and went up to bedroom number 2, which Charlie and the landlady-to-be later named Rover Street\u2014\"Rover Street,\" Brian told John, \"because you rove around\u2014you see? Rover Street, the home of the Westhouses!\"\u2014in order to settle in. When Brian awoke the next morning, the house was empty; George and his parents were moving in on Pugsy Street.\nThe rest is easy. I've lived in the three-bedroom house, alone\u2014my father passed away when I was nine years old, and my mother passed away a year ago last October\u2014with five hundred pigeons. Not pigeons, cooies, and not like there were a thousand of them, but I think, maybe, a thousand cooies lived at 834 Eighty-three Street. I took in the first ten, free, and then word got out that I had a lot of cooies in my house\u2014the neighbors came in and let themselves in with keys to get my cooies to come with them to their houses; the police gave me the keys to their houses; I got a dog that would scream like he was being raped when he saw a cooie, and a woman's neighbor said he could get her cooies when she was on her vacation if she got the one-family house for herself; there were people on stilts running in and out of my house as if they were doing a play, except it wasn't \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" at all, they weren't the main characters, and the only woman playing was me\u2014\"Eh,\" said one of my neighbors on Pugsy Street, \"if she doesn't play, why should they?\"\u2014and, to complicate the whole mix of people and pigeons, some of the neighbors kept cooies for themselves, even when their houses were filled with others' cooies. And every morning when I woke up, it was with the cooies who were living in my house, and I was the only one who knew about it.\nBrian worked for the U.S. Postal Service, at the Penn Station Post Office. He was a supervisor there, the head of all the night shifts and overtime hours. He was responsible for sending all the parcels from all the different branches of the Post Office, from the mailbags of people on stilts, which went directly to the people who played them, and then to the actors who played the actual mailmen and pigeonners of the city\u2014and of all New York\u2014from the different streets of the city, and from the people who played the people, and all the way back into the people's street.

If\nI should be selected, I would attend and graduate from the Air Force Academy.\nI was born and have grown up in Los Angeles, and I am a Senior in the U.S.\nCoast Guard Academy Class of 1990.  I graduated Number One in my class in\nmilitary science from the Academy, and in the Coast Guard have achieved and\ncompleted my training and advanced my career to the rank of Third Mate.  I\nhave received an appointment as a Flight Cadet in the United States Air\nForce which will require me to fly 23.5 hours of additional training, which I\nhave begun in order to meet the prerequisites for Flight Class.\nI will be applying the basic knowledge and experience that I have\nacquired with the Coast Guard;  including:  maintenance of powerboats and\npowered aircraft, maintenance of small gasoline and diesel engines,\ncommunications, navigation, seamanship, leadership, character, and\nsports.  I have also completed my initial Coast Guard Boatswains license\ntest and I have passed my first test on the Fundamentals of Naval Science.\nI have completed a two week assignment as a member of a Coast Guard\npatrol boat which has tested my ability to handle all the responsibilities\nwhich go with being in charge.  As a Coast Guard Flight candidate I have\nbegan my study of the airmanship and flight requirements, and am beginning to\nlearn and master the fundamentals of instrument flight, a required part of\nmy training.\nThe Coast Guards Academy motto in part is \"Semper Paratus\", meaning\n\"Always Ready\".  Since the formation of the United States Navy in 1775,\nwhen the Coast Guard has been a part of it, the Coast Guard has always been\nable to respond to any demand for naval service with trained personnel,\nmaintaining a high state of readiness at all times.

But then one of the other clients was asked to help their friend with their move into their first home, so back to the client who was ready to leave and that was not the last of the moves for the family as another relative sold her home and moved to a new region as well.\nWe saw changes in our own home and we got some new furniture, though we have already decided to sell what we no longer need once the time comes to head to our move.\nWith all of the moves and the end to a long-time relationship, what does the Tarot hold for this couple?\nWe start with a 5-card Lenormand spread from the Crystal Visions deck by Ciro Marchetti:\nTop row left to right: Nine of Hearts (change),\nEight of Cups holding another Eight of Cups (moving),\nEight of Clubs (new beginning in a home)\nBottom row left to right: Nine of Pentacles (moving is a good choice for this couple),\nAce of Clubs (family support),\nTen of Pentacles (he is ready),\nAces are cards that stand alone in a reading so that gives this reading a 9-card reading based on the Lenormand tradition.\nThe Aces mean new beginnings, and I am seeing here a man who is ready to start a new phase of his life. But it is not the life he leads right now, so that speaks to moving. The last two cards in this spread reinforce that message, but there is also a choice to be made between the two Eights of Cups. It is almost like a marriage of the future choice. I would suggest it must be a choice of what is best for him as he will see that over and over from what the other two Eights of Cups say.\nThe cards then hold the message of where to begin the new phase.\nNext, we add the 4-card Pythagorean Tarot spread (based on the 5-card Pythagorean spread by Elyse) from the Pythagorean Tarot deck by Robert M. Place (Destiny Books, 2005):\n(top) The Fool,\n(bottom) Three of Pentacles,\n(right, in center) Two of Swords,\n(left, in center) Seven of Cups\nWe start with the Fool. Here he has been given an important decision to make based on the new beginnings card (Ace of Clubs) and the Nine of Pentacles (family support) so he has a strong support base behind him in his marriage.\nThe next two cards are the same pair of Cups cards showing marriage (from Seven of Cups to Two of Swords). I was thinking at first of a couple that was considering living together, but I also thought of another couple who had been together for a very long time and did live together. Perhaps it was a move, maybe they bought a house together but their family situation meant they would be married. It was an unknown, as the cards are unknown to me, but at the moment I would say this is a couple of the married kind, though not likely living together at this point in their lives. In most readings this is the last card, but for this couple it is the second to last card from the first position. This couple may have more of a choice about the move or the marriage then they realize in this reading.\nWhat is in their way, though, is the final card, the Third of Pentacles. The woman is working hard for them and trying to find them a place to live. It was likely the woman who sold their previous home, so perhaps that was where the decision came from, but she is holding them back from moving forward in their lives and that might mean a change for each of them.\nIt could get worse before it gets better or they could both make this marriage work. The two Cups cards are always difficult and in this case there is no way that I can see to read one situation over the other.\nThe only thing I would say, the last card in the spread (the Four of Swords, which is the Four of Cups in the Tarot) speaks to rest and maybe some health issue to the man in this couple. It is as though he has pushed himself too hard or allowed something to drag him down while his wife has had to make all of the efforts for them. I do not think that a move is necessary, though it may be what each needs.\nThe Lenormand cards suggest that the man must focus on his health and the woman must focus on her career and the couple, in that sequence.", "The media industry is going through a crisis. News organizations are having to reinvent themselves to adapt to the new consumer reality.\nNews consumption has changed dramatically due to the abundance of news sources provided by our digital infrastructure. Our news consumption habits have evolved away from the more passive, one-way relationship with a singular news source.\nThe evolution of news consumption to an \"always on\" relationship, where consumers get news on multiple devices from different sources, has been fueled by the widespread availability of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, and the proliferation of news applications and social networks that keep news consumers connected to news stories and alerts.\nThis evolution is dramatically changing consumer perceptions of news organizations. News organizations that seek to thrive in this new environment of news consumption should do the following:\n\u2022 Focus on developing a digital strategy that puts the audience first.\n\u2022 Create a continuous, integrated publishing approach that gives users a consistent experience across all devices and platforms.\n\u2022 Develop news products that give them an experience that is easy to consume and to share.\n\u2022 Use metrics to better understand how people are consuming their news.\n\u2022 Acknowledge that the competition will be more than just other news organizations.\n\u2022 Understand the role that data and information will play in the future of news consumption.\nTreat the audience as your most important asset and focus on continuous innovation.\nThis revolution in news consumption makes it critical that news organizations find ways to reinvent, and make themselves more valuable to a new generation of consumers.\nThe digital news ecosystem\nBefore the rise of the Internet and social media, getting the latest news was usually a one-way transaction between the person creating the news and the person reading it.\nWhen I turned on the radio, a radio anchor told me what was happening in the world. When I picked up a newspaper or magazine, a journalist told me what was happening in the world. When I opened my evening TV newscast, a TV reporter told me what was happening in the world.\nIn the past, we could only consume news when or where it was broadcast. We had to be in a certain place at a certain time to hear the news, or read the news, or see the news.\nNow, because of the ubiquity of the Internet and new digital technologies, you can get the latest news no matter where you are or what time it is. You can consume news on your computer, tablet, smartphone, and any other device you might want. You can also consume news from any brand or channel of your choice. You no longer have to only go to a few sources or publications. This is a radical change in consumer expectations.\nIn this digital age, \"traditional\" news organizations are now competing not only against other news organizations, such as TV stations, newspapers, and radio stations, but with Facebook, Twitter, Huffington Post, BBC, and every website with breaking news.\nThe digital news ecosystem is shifting away from a linear model to a more fluid, interactive model. This has forced news organizations to think more strategically about the way they create and distribute content. The ability to distribute content to multiple channels and platforms is becoming more important than the creation of news itself.\nJust as in the music industry, news content is now much more valuable in digital form than in its original, physical format. News organizations are in search of new business models to keep up with the changing reality of where the audience is.\nAlthough we think of these as new business models, news companies have experimented with some of these concepts historically. For example, radio broadcasters have always been in the business of selling advertising based on how many people heard their broadcast. In the early days, broadcasters only calculated audience size based on Nielsen ratings, meaning that they would only pay advertisers once and how many people heard their broadcasts at the time that they aired. In the digital age, broadcasters now have the option of using metrics to calculate audience size based on the number of times their audio content is viewed, played, listened to, or downloaded.\nThe digital era is also allowing news organizations to experiment with new ways of monetizing their audience. An example is Bloomberg's Bloomberg Businessweek app, a free app that gives its users \"instant access\" to all of the magazine's articles and stories. Bloomberg uses a number of different monetization strategies including sponsorships, native advertising, digital magazine sales, and live events.\n\"One of the reasons behind our move to subscription is that even after we cut the number of print subscribers down from 400,000 to 72,000, we could", "This is an interim report of the first two years of work of a committee that was convened by the Government to study ways of ensuring that a better quality of life could be expected for every New Zealander, and that the quality of life that was so prized and enjoyed would also be cherished and valued for as long as possible.

But the current media crisis mirrors what happened to mainframe IT 10 to 15 years ago.\nMainframe-based computing infrastructure was a central component of large business and government systems of the 1980s. In the '90s, companies started moving away from the old mainframe infrastructure and towards smaller distributed systems. They invested heavily in technology platforms, many of them \"new\" platforms or services.\nToday, we're seeing print newspapers and magazines go the same way.\n\"Distributed computing\" is now the buzz phrase and a technology that promises a significant reduction in cost and complexity.\nThe trouble is there is still much legacy infrastructure to be dealt with from the pre-Internet years.\nIt'll be a little while before all the dust settles. And at the bottom of the heap will be the traditional publishers. And the worst news for them is that once a brand name is lost \u2013 it's lost.\nAustralia is not alone in this dilemma.\nNewspapers, and even magazines, are under tremendous pressure globally. In Australia there are 90 newspapers but no more than 60 will survive. And some of the smaller ones may not make it.\nPaper-based information is going to follow the trend in other media. The Australian government is going to do what it can, but we have to prepare ourselves.\nI believe online media are going to dominate the market. In a few years online and traditional print media will be a \"duopoly.\" What's sad is that many of today's journalists may not work for traditional media but, rather, the online media.\nAnd it's a bit of a myth to say that, just because people have gone online, they're not interested in other platforms. The more interesting aspect is that consumers are interested in media. They want a combination of the two platforms \u2013 the traditional press or magazine and the online platform. Publishers have to think globally.\nIn Australia, many newspapers have done very well online, but they're going to have to go further. Most newspapers are trying to do something with the media in their hands \u2013 whether it's a digital reporter, camera phone pictures, or a live-blogging event.\nA lot of media companies have a problem on how to leverage their content online. They don't really know what to do and how to go about it \u2013 but they will have to make a decision.\nSo the media companies have to decide how they want to be online. They have to think what kind of distribution they want (e.g. on their own platform or a third-party platform). The media companies will need to decide whether or not they can be profitable by just having their own platform or if third-party platforms (such as Myspace, Facebook, or blogs) are worth using.\nBut this is all easier said than done. Media brands are built over time and it's a painful experience. And for media businesses, losing a media brand online is a bit like tearing your heart out \u2013 in a business where success is based on a name.\nMedia companies may be starting with an investment in their own brand, but we'll probably have to go back and reinvent how we present ourselves, as well as how we actually deliver media.\nWe'll have to go back to basics in terms of media-making. In fact, we'll have to start all over again.\nIn Australia, the major newspapers have lost a lot of their subscribers. It's hard to believe that this could occur. But this is the reality that we are experiencing, and it has nothing to do with us or them. There are just too many choices as to what we can consume online at the moment, we don't need to take the time to read the daily newspaper.\nIf one of the traditional media companies loses a brand (say Rupert Murdoch's newspapers), they will have to start again \u2013 as if the company didn't even exist.\nBrand equity is key. And some newspapers are being challenged as to how they could even survive the digital age.\nIn Australia's daily newspaper market, there are five companies \u2013 News Corp, Fairfax, Murdoch's company, APN, and Seven West Media. Murdoch's company \u2013 News Ltd Australia \u2013 is the market leader in print", "The ITC concluded there were three reasonable foregoing alternatives for the 2000/01 market.

Overall, the alternatives lead to different levels of operating profits for the 2001/02 market for the three different scenarios.

Native ads may represent the future of content monetization.\nWith the rise of eCommerce, publishers are looking for new ways to monetize their digital content. Native ads may represent the future of content monetization.\nThe New York Times, Wired and many online publishers have been creating a new generation of ads.  Native ads are designed to match the experience of the content. In Wired's words, native ads are \"sponsored stories that flow seamlessly and naturally with their enveloping themes and moods, [making] them far less obtrusive and, according to marketers, more valuable than traditional display advertising.\"\nNative ads don't just look better, they also work better too. They may result in a 5 to 10x increase in engagement time. The New York Times states that their native ad units increase site visits by 50% in comparison to standard display ads.\nNative advertising works especially well with content monetization because publishers use it to enhance the content experience with brands. Advertisers are able to connect with a very narrowly targeted audience. As a result, the audience engages with the ads because brands are telling stories that resonate with them.\nIf you're interested in publishing your own native ads, a good starting point is SmartMarket (http://smartmarkets.com) - as they provide high-quality in-house support and guidance for setting up and managing your native program.\nTo learn more about native ads and how you can monetize your content, check our our on-demand webinar, \"Native Advertising: The Future of Content Monetization.\" For more information, read also our blog \"Native Ads: The Future of Content Monetization.\"\nHow are publishers monetizing their content?", "A number of media companies are experimenting with various social media efforts.\nSocial Media: The Media Industry Gets Serious\nBY RELEVANCY MEDIA\nA media industry with a very high-cost production environment and a\nreputation for not being tech savvy is getting serious about online\nThe world media industry has traditionally been regarded as slow to\nembrace the Internet and slow to create online content.

General.\n1. \"HVAC equipment\" means the components of and apparatus installed for each heating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit.\n2. When required by this code, \"heating and cooling equipment\" is defined as \"heating equipment and/or cooling equipment and/or HVAC equipment.\"\n3. \"Heating system\" is defined as either heating equipment or an HVAC system for both heating and cooling, provided it does not serve other mechanical systems.\n4. \"HVAC\" means heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.\n5. \"Ventilator\" is a mechanical unit for moving air from inside of a building to the outside.\n6. \"Room air conditioner\" is a unit that is permanently connected to only the inside unit of the split system ductless\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning package unit and that cools only the interior of the room of the single-family dwelling.\n7. \"Drum heating system\" is defined as either heating equipment or an HVAC system for both heating and cooling, provided it does not serve other mechanical systems.\n8. \"Heating and/or cooling system\" means any mechanical system which circulates air conditioned, heated, or humidified air.\n9. \"Heating or cooling system\" means a system that delivers warm or chilled air to or from the conditioned space through ducts or pipes.\n10. \"Central air conditioning system\" is defined as having both heating and cooling equipment.\n11. \"Distribution system\" means the piping or ductwork that distributes or conveys conditioned air from the outdoor unit to remote units in a system.\n12. \"Heat recovery ventilator\" is defined as equipment which provides ventilation for the space where it is located along with simultaneous recovery of thermal energy from one airstream for use in the other.\n13. \"Fan coil unit\" is defined as equipment that includes (a) a blower, (b) a heating or cooling coil, (c) a heating element, or (d) a ventilation fan, but not (i) any other components (electric or electronic), or (ii) any heating systems, cooling systems, humidification systems, dehumidification systems, air cleaning systems, or ventilation systems, unless such other components or such systems are listed for use with that equipment.\n14. \"Heating-ventilating-air conditioning equipment (HVAC)\" is defined as equipment which includes (a) at least one separate heating or cooling unit, (b) at least one separate ventilation", "Newspapers can increase their circulations by creating \u201cnews communities\u201d (small groups of subscribers for whom a newspaper becomes the \u201ccommunity newspaper\u201d) and helping the news community to manage its resources.\nNecessary for the formation of a new news media\nI suggest that \u201ca new news media\u201d can only be formed by \u201cthe users of the publicly available news media\u201d.\nOne reason for this is the need for diversity. Any single \u201cnews community\u201d will be influenced by the resources held by the organisations within it. A newspaper which does not contain news from all sources of a country may have one point of view, which is biased towards certain commercial interests. Such a newspaper, when read by people of the same sort of \u201cnews community\u201d, will have a greater influence over them, than is desirable, from a range of sources.\nA newspaper, if it has a large subscription, is likely to carry news from a limited range of sources, which suit the interests of the owners of the newspaper. This can result in very biased reports on news stories. But such biased reports do not mean, that the whole news community from which the newspaper has subscriptions will believe the stories, because the news community contains more diverse groups. Even if many more subscribers of one newspaper are in a particular community, others will see that subscribers are very different in their make-up from other such groups. Also, it is possible that, the subscription is purchased for a particular news community \u2013 for example, a large public company may purchase a large subscription of one newspaper, which then reports the news in a manner favourable to that company.\nA \u201cnew news media\u201d which does not have this influence can be established by the users of the current news media, but it has become clear that very few of the people who read the current news media (apart from people who are already convinced of a particular viewpoint) believe the reports of newspapers on very many news stories, that do not conform to their own thinking.\nCriticism which says that many news stories are not believed, is made by people who wish to make sure of the sources of news stories. In the case of very many news stories, the original source is clear, and people can decide for themselves if they wish to believe the reports. In that case, there are two sources of reports, one being the newspaper, which reports the news story, and the reader who reads the report. This works as well, as people check whether the news report agrees with their own knowledge of the situation, and, if there are problems with the report, people can ask for an explanation. If the newspaper reports on a situation about which it is not known, for example a conflict between nations, then the newspaper reports could be checked for their validity.\nWhat people do with such news stories is to check on any other reported sources, and the reader may, for whatever reason, decide, at that time, to believe the story, or not to believe the details of the story. One reason for not checking, might be that it is too distressing, to have a negative report on their viewpoint. So they continue with life the best that they can, either agreeing with the report, or not worrying about it. To a certain extent, such people avoid any serious problems, such as the ones which might be incurred from having a war, but the avoidance, also reduces the ability of a society to find solutions to the problems which it is facing.\nIn the news community, where the users have an alternative news media, they are more likely to understand reports, because the users have a means of assessing the information. There is a much greater, and more frequent, interaction with the news community, by the users, which leads to a greater general understanding of what is occurring within the community. The community can be much more influential on those who are trying to act on their behalf, such as politicians.\nNecessary for the formation of a single news media\nThe fact that there are different news sources, is not necessarily a good thing. For a \u201cnew news media\u201d to form, it is necessary for all members of the community to have access to the news from all available sources. Different members of the community may prefer one or two news sources, but this does not mean that all members, have access to all sources, and they have no single source, which they will accept as a single viewpoint for everyone. There needs to be a single source, with which they all accept, as a community, to be the single source, from which they derive their reports on the news. In this way, there is a more trusted news source, than those on which different members of the community have different points of view on.\nA \u201cnew news media\u201d, which is used by all members of the community should not depend on any one source, because, in this", "We, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council (NRC), have examined how well the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are meeting the needs of stakeholders and the general public. We have reviewed the history of the DRIs and found that stakeholders from diverse sectors have been engaged in their development. The DRIs provide comprehensive information for decision making about nutrition and health, and the FNB, in particular, has served as an unbiased review group for all DRIs. These efforts have improved dietary guidance. The DRIs have been used successfully to communicate scientific information to the general public and stakeholders. As evidence of the value of the DRIs, we found that various sectors, including the food industry, are using the information to improve the healthfulness of foods. In addition, we find that the DRIs have been used by regulatory agencies to develop national recommendations, state regulations, and voluntary private sector initiatives. The DRIs have also proved to be useful as a source of scientific information. The DRIs have significantly improved dietary guidelines and helped reduce the dietary confusion of the general public on food and nutrition. They provide the basic information that the stakeholder groups can build upon, and they serve as a reference point for a better and more accurate understanding of nutrition science. The DRIs have also demonstrated themselves to be an accurate way of determining nutrient needs. However, we have identified many obstacles to the use of the DRIs that need resolution. The first major obstacle involves the amount of time required for review and to conduct research to update and maintain the DRIs. This difficulty is compounded by a lack of funding for the NRC, as the publicly supported organization relies heavily on private funding to support its scientific advisory committees, a process that can take up to two years. We also believe that the DRIs lack the visibility and public impact that they could have. The DRIs are not known or used to their full potential by the general public. We believe the NRC should be adequately funded and that the DRIs require greater promotion and outreach. To promote the DRIs, the NRC should also be assigned the task of monitoring their usage in order to better evaluate the impact of the DRIs on scientific developments.\nPrepared by the FNB, Panel on Nutrient Requirements of Age, Gender, and Lifestage Physical Activity and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nThe review of the DRIs was conducted in conjunction with the FNB committee on \"Nutrient Metabolism and Cognitive Function Across the Lifecourse: A Workshop.\" This joint effort is an example of NRC's recent shift in emphasis to an \"activity systems\" approach to studying important issues, such as obesity and nutrition. The NRC was originally established to provide independent, science-based advice with the goal of \"promoting the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and security; and to secure the national defense.\" In carrying out this charge, the NRC organizes scientific activities within four divisions: physical sciences, mathematics and physical sciences, life sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. Each division has five programs.\nDRIS IN THE GENEAL GENERAL, HISTORY, AND COMMON CONCEPT OF THE DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES\nFood and Nutrition Board Panel on Nutrient Requirements of Age, Gender, and Lifestage Physical Activity and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DRIs)\n1994 -- The FDA advises that dietary supplements meet standards similar to those of the pharmaceutical industry.\n1997 -- The FDA promotes the use of DRI data for labeling foods.

(\"VCI\") and its wholly  owned subsidiary, VisiCom  Corporation,  have  unanimously  determined to recommend to VCI stockholders that such approval be given at a meeting to be called to consider the merger with VCI.  In connection with the foregoing and in order to enable VCI to consummate its proposed merger with VCM, the Board expects to take certain actions, some of which are described below.  All such actions are  conditioned upon and are intended to be conducted or completed immediately prior to or at the same time as the  merger.\nThe following descriptions  of the actions the Board\nproposes  to   take  are   summary  in  nature.  Reference is made to the following documents for a more complete description of and the considerations the Board took into account before  approving the merger and the actions described below and any of its  alternatives.  For  further  information  regarding the merger, please see the joint proxy  statement/prospectus regarding the merger dated September 12, 1995 (the \"Joint Proxy Statement\"), registration number 234-113255 (which is an appendix to this letter) and  a press release dated July 10, 1995 titled \"VISIcom And VCM To Merge\" (the \"VCM Press Release\"), a copy of which is attached as Appendix A herein.\nVCI has recently sold  its business of designing,\nmanufacturing and distribution of digital electronic equipment, 1994 having net revenues of approximately $178,000.  VCI has no operating,  product or marketing  capabilities.  VCM is currently in the process of selling its business, comprised solely of its technology, of providing information on financial products to consumers and investors,  consisting of a portfolio of 19 companies with investments of approximately $4.5 billion invested via a proprietary and patent-protected business process referred to as \"the Mosaic Process\".  Consistent with VCM's current business focus to grow primarily through the acquisition of portfolios of investments in public or private companies, no single acquisition has had a significant  impact on revenue or earnings in 1995. VCM's financial products included in its Mosaic process consist of investment capital committed through equity and debt\ninvestments and through  convertible equity preferred shares  into\npublicly  traded  companies  in  such  sectors  as biotechnology,  technology & communications,  media, education/training and services.   VCM's portfolios included in this merger  consists of 28 companies with which VCM has investments (and which are  disclosed in the Joint Proxy Statement) and a number of investment projects in these and other areas that have not yet reached the development stage where full information may be given regarding them in this letter.  Except for  information  relating to  the  publicly  traded  companies  in this merger,  VCM will not be providing other investment related information to VCI at this time as that would not be in the best interests of its public shareholders.

The ruling serves to make it more difficult for an organization to exonerate itself from liability for discriminatory acts performed by non-employees.\n CURRENT SITUATION: Discrimination claims may be addressed in several ways which generally involve employment discrimination (the employer-employees and their supervisors are liable for supervisory discrimination and harassment); contractual claims (the non-employee (e.g., vendor, vendor supervisor) is the only party at liable). If the non-employee is found to have engaged in discrimination the employer is only responsible for discriminatory acts that take place on the grounds of the organization/business of the organization, the employer vicariously and jointly liable for discrimination or harassment directed at the employee by a non-employee.\n CURRENT SITUATION: The D.C. Circuit had ruled only the employer\u2019s vicarious liability for the acts of employees. Under the new law, if a supervisor (or someone holding the position of a supervisor) engages in discrimination while acting as an employer and his/her company does not have a written anti-bias policy, the organization would be responsible for discrimination of that supervisory agent.\n The DC Circuit has held that a supervisor must \u201ceffectively direct another to take action discriminating against or harassing the victim.\n The effectiveness of the supervisory duty must be determined objectively, as long as an objective person would conclude that the duty was fulfilled.\n COMMENT: The ruling is based on the premise that a supervisor should know that any action he/she directs towards a person can, and will, effect other individuals. It also applies to claims made by employees based on co-worker harassment. If a supervisor knows that his/her behavior is, or will be, a cause of discrimination among any of the persons he/she supervises, he/she must be held responsible for their behavior. Under this new law no business may allow an agent (supervisor) of the business to engage in conduct that can be perceived as discrimination because an employee\u2019s right to work without discrimination protects both employers and employees.", "The  EIB  is   publishing   for  public   comment   in\nthis Notice, and in the form and  manner described in section 3 of\nthis Notice, the proposed guidelines of the EIB for managing the\nEIB's activities  in  the  area   of   social  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  guidelines  describe  how the EIB proposes to\naddress development goals and targets.\nThe EIB Guidelines, which the EIB has established for the purpose\nof managing its activities towards  developing  countries, seek\nto  clarify  the  EIB's expectations   of  its  clients  with regard\nto achieving economic and social progress, especially towards the\npopulation living in  the  poorest  countries.  The  EIB's  guidelines\nare a practical application of  the development mandate  that  the\nEIB  enjoys  from  the   European  Community.  The  guidelines  are\nparticularly  designed  for  use in cooperation  with  other\ninternational institutions, and also with bilateral donor \norganisations.  They address particular  development  or  social\nobjectives, and are expected to result in a clear, mutually  agreed\nprogramme  of  activities   through  which  the  EIB  will  be  in\nconditions of  being able, within  the limit of its  resources, to\nreach  the  objectives   it   seeks,  or  contribute   to  reaching\nthem.   They  will  also  provide  guidance  for  the   appropriate\ninvolvement of the private  sector,   local  and  regional,  in\nachieving  their  objectives.    The   guidelines   themselves   do\nnot set out precise objectives, but lay upon  the  implementing\nprojects the responsibility to adapt  to  local  conditions.  The\nobjectives set out in the guidelines are expressed as policy goals\nand targets. These are: elimination of extreme poverty, full and\nproductive labour for all, elimination of discrimination,  and an\nenvironment, which is respectful of the needs of current generations\nand  allows   for   the   progress  of  future  generations.\nThe EIB is publishing for public comment the Draft of\nthe EIB Guidelines on Development.   The  guidelines  are being\npublished in  the  context  of  the  preparation by the EIB  of a\nDocument  on its policy, and its guidelines for managing investment\nand  support   in  the  development  of   products,   processes  and\nservices.

Although\nthe EIB Guidelines for managing the  EIB's  activities  related  to\ndevelopment can have an effect at all stages of the process, they\nhave  been  organised  so that they  have  a particular effect  at\nfour stages: Project design; preparation and assessment of projects\nand studies;  financial  appraisal  and  final decision to invest;\nand project implementation. The  EIB  Guidelines  provide the EIB\nwith a set of guidelines to apply in managing  its  development \nactivities. Each of the guidelines includes a series of specific\nobjectives of EIB investments and other  support .  The  list  of\nspecific development objectives, and the means of achieving them,\nhas   been   divided  into   five   sections.   The   first   section\nconcerns the  elimination  of extreme poverty:  'Elimination of\nextreme poverty through broad, sustainable economic growth '.  The\nsecond section deals with ensuring productive  and  decent  labour\nfor  all.    The   third   section  is   on    ensuring  an  equitable\nenvironment, respectful of the needs of current generations  and  of\nthe  future.

Oswald used it more than anyone; he had to, if he\nintended to try to get an audience.  \"Effectiveness\" was one of his\nfavorite slogans.  For example, \"The Party [i.e., the Communist\nParty] is a progressive class movement.  The Communist Party is\neffective!\"  In this excerpt from a June, 1957, talk in Los\nAngeles, he has a \"Communism\" theme; but he also gives some\nfavorable references to \"Effectiveness\" and \"The Party is a\nprogressive class movement. The Communist Party is effective!\"\nSo it looks like he had \"Effectiveness\" at least partly through\nhis own agency, and if it came from anyone, it probably came from\nmy boss, Mrs. Ruth Groves [nee Tate], a native Minnesotan.\nOswald in LA, June, 1957\n[Extracted from Minneapolis speech, 6/18/57. \"Communist\" is in\nsmall script.  See also Oswald Tape 5.]\nIn this section, I want to talk about the problems of\nrepresenting the working people. In the United States, we have\na tremendous task to do to organize the great majority of\nAmericans. This is because the whole world lives through the\nAmerican market.  The United States are the world's\nentrepreneurs.  [I think he's trying, without much success, to\nuse \"entrepreneur\" in English as a more colloquial-sounding\nalternative to \"capitalist.\"]  At any moment the American\ncapitalists will go to war to make profits.  Therefore, this\nis the major reason for revolution in the United States.  This\nis our major duty.  We must work to organize the people's\nmovement against the American system.\nBut when one talks about the American Communist movement as\na political party and as a mass movement, this does not give\nimmediate answers to the task of organizing the working\npeople.  It goes much deeper.  You can look over American\nhistory, all 200 years of it, and you see there have been\nwars and revolutions. You look to what is happening at this\nmoment.  You realize that the people's movement cannot be a\none-sided movement or simply one part of the people's\nmovement.  The labor movement cannot be considered one-sided\non the question of revolution.  To talk about the class\nstruggle in politics is to be a bad politician.  We are\nsocialists.  We are partisan.  That is the fundamental basis\nof our politics.\nThe question of revolution must not be put aside.  The\npeople's movement must be part of the revolutionary\nmovement.  The people's movement is the force which the capitalist\nruling people have to watch, and which they fear most.  The\npeople's movement is the greatest enemy and the greatest cause\nof revolution in any country of the world.  That is the\ndifference between America and Russia.  That is the reason the\ncapitalists in Russia are so worried about Trotsky and his\nfaction and the Worker People's Party is a reactionary force in\ntheir movement, because it is their reactionary force which\nthey must fight.  At present, in Russia and in the United States\ntoday, the Communist movement is the people's movement, the\nrevolutionary movement is the progressive class movement.  The\nPeople's Party is effective.  The American Communists are\neffective!  We cannot forget this.  The Communist movement\nmust take over because it fights for the people.\nBut the Communist movement must not forget about its great\nobligation and its greatest duty, which goes much further than\nthe mere people's movement.  The Communist movement must have\nthis one-sidedness, but at the same time it must have a broader\noutlook than that of revolution alone.  The Communist Party is\neffective in its fight for the people's movement.  We must\nlook at the big picture, we must look at the world.  If we\nlook at the world in a narrow sense, a one-sided\nsense--one-", "The Department of Natural Resources will be holding public scoping meetings concerning the draft amendment to the Coastal Management Program regarding the recreational wind energy siting policies for the waters off Washington.

Peter Blase, then Fairfax\u2019s digital advertising director, saw the transformation coming and made some changes in the editorial room to ensure the Fairfax news app could grow and innovate over the next five years.\nNow Fairfax Media\u2019s digital content director, Blase\u2019s charge is to ensure the business can grow the apps and the digital footprint. After an 18-month trial running two mastheads \u2013 The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age \u2013 as a news app, and with a new model and team in place, he has started to think about future innovations and what that might mean for a mobile-first news platform.\n\u201cThe first step was really convincing the organisation of the absolute value of doing a news app, and then that was followed by reorganising our desktop newsrooms into their new mobile home,\u201d Blase said in London last week at Digital Publishing Europe\u2019s Future Digital Publishing conference. \u201cBut our challenge was around staffing and hiring and creating the right team of people who were more like software product managers and engineers than journalists.\n\u201cIt was getting the right team in place. The team was one of the biggest challenges and we realised quickly it had to be distributed across editorial leadership, product management, and engineering, but also journalists who should have expertise in technology.\u201d\nDespite a staffing challenge, the app made a significant impact in audience growth, and in the short term, monetisation growth, too.\nOver the past 18 months, Fairfax Media had already put its focus on digital subscriptions while it had been building its new model. While this was the core of the subscription business model, it was also clear that there were more products and more opportunities in the digital space for Fairfax\u2019s future monetisation.\n\u201cThe audience growth has been significant because of that innovation, to our mobile products, but also within a subscription focus,\u201d Blase said.\nWhen asked by journalists attending the conference if there was any way for legacy publishers to catch up, Blase said: \u201cWhat you have to do is really understand what innovation is, which is about understanding, testing, and experimenting.\n\u201cThere are no silver bullets and no magic beans. We\u2019ve tried that and it doesn\u2019t work. What I\u2019ve tried to do is really build a team of people who understand technology, who understand a digital product, and then who also have a strong understanding of what their core audience is and actually innovate within that.\n\u201cWe also had to make sure we were testing constantly, and we\u2019re continuing to do that, and innovating, and then just being transparent about what we\u2019re doing and sharing that with the organisation.\n\u201cThis means we\u2019ve looked at everything from content and design, to audience insights, monetisation and of course, how can we improve and test the technology. If you get your head into that space, then you come up with all sorts of ideas and solutions and experiments.\u201d\nOver the next three parts of this article, Peter Blase will cover topics such as his staffing challenges while building the team, his audience growth, and what his next challenges and steps for the business will be.\nPREV AI is a business\u2019s new competitive edge NEXT The 7 biggest challenges in building a global publisher\u2019s first mobile news app", "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (\"Commission\") today announces the availability of a final rule to prohibit the distribution of children's products that do not comply with the lead content ban in section 101(b)(4) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).\nThe CPSIA, enacted by section 101 of Public Law 110-314 on August 14, 2008 (\"Act\"), included an initial lead standard in section 101(a) to prohibit children's products from containing lead in excess of 0.009 percent of lead for accessories or surfaces.\nIn addition, section 101(b)(1) required the Commission, on or before February 12, 2009, to issue regulations to prohibit all goods, and to establish a timeline for the elimination of all lead-containing paint on such goods, for items intended for use by children, including toys and games but excluding paint for bricks, sculptures or handcrafted goods.\nSection 101(b)(4) further prohibited the distribution in commerce of any children's product that would contain lead in excess of 600 parts per million (ppm). In response to section 101(b)(4), the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register on June 12, 2009, (74 FR 30159) proposing prohibition orders prohibiting the distribution in commerce of children's products that contain lead levels over 600 ppm. After considering the public comments, the Commission decided to lower the lead content standard to 100 ppm. The Commission issued a final rule on March 16, 2010, (75 FR 12360) that adopted the 100 ppm lead standard.\nAt the same time, the Commission promulgated a final rule that created and established a timeline for phasing in the lead content standard for children's products at 100 ppm lead by manufacturer, importer, or private labeler of children's product, or both, as applicable, based on the quantity of lead bearing products produced or imported in each category, respectively. That rule required manufacturers, importers, or private labelers to meet the 100 ppm lead content standard for each children's product that the manufacturer or private labeler manufactures or imports, or both, after June 22, 2009, or after June 22, 2012, for \"small businesses\" as defined below. Small businesses had to meet the 100 ppm lead content standard prior to June 22, 2018 (or June 22, 2019, as applicable).\nSection 104 of the CPSA amended the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFLA, 15 U.S.C. 1191-1196), and added section 20B to that Act, to establish a national flammability standard applicable to clothing for children 12 and under. Section 20(b) of the FFLA requires any garment made after January 1, 2007 from material that meets the requirements of sections 1192 and 1193, and of appendix C, to be presumed to comply with the national flammability standard in section 20(b) of the FFLA and in section 1616 of the CPSIA. In its implementation of the CPSIA, the Commission found, and the Commission and the Office both agree, that section 104 of the CPSIA is substantially similar to section 20B of the FFLA and, therefore, adopts the analysis in section V.A. of this preamble.\nSection 3(a) of CPSIA, and the regulation issued thereunder, provide:\n(a) PROHIBITED DISTRIBUTION STATEMENTS.-- A manufacturer, importer, private labeler, or distributor of a children's product shall not provide a distribution statement regarding such product that indicates that the product complies with the lead content ban established by this section or the lead content limit established by this section.\n(b) DEFINITION OF DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT.-- For purposes of this section, the term 'distribution statement' means a representation that appears on a label, sign, tag, or other manner of written, visual, or verbal", "A weekly review of the news for executives of newspapers of record in the United States by Tad Smith.

However, the concept of native advertising is inherently tied to the authenticity of news as an editorial format and disguising a paid advertisement as editorial content represents a threat to editorial integrity.\nIn a nutshell, advertising should look like advertising. It\u2019s not clear how this compromised editorial integrity would be monitored, or how brands can be assured they won\u2019t be associated with fake stories appearing in their name.\nSo-called \u201cfaux ads\u201d are just the beginning. What about social media disguised as editorial comments, or Twitter sponsored tweets, or sponsored blogs for bloggers? Where do we draw the line?\nThe fact that native advertising is gaining significant traction in newsrooms around the world should ring a warning bell that this is happening in the marketplace and we need to be vigilant about how it looks, feels and sounds to the news audience.\nSocial Media Editor at The Huffington Post, @jgold12\nNative AdvertisingNative AdvertisingContentDisplay Advertising", "The Greatest Day in History\nHow a Cul-de-Sac Changed the Course of Time\nWas Jesus a Historical Figure?\nHow Jesus Influenced History\nFollowing Jesus\nWhere Did Jesus Work?\nJesus' Controversial Ministries\nJesus and Women\nA Different Jesus?\nJesus and the Apostles\nJesus and Paul\nPaul and the Gentiles\nCracking the Mystery of the Crucifixion\nMoving on from the Cross\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise From the Dead?\nDid Jesus Rise from the Dead?\nJesus' Rejection by Israel\nJesus' Rejection: The Gospels\nLearning About \"Jesus the Jew\"\nDid the Disciples See Jesus Risen?\nJudas the Apostate\nJesus' Death, Tomb, and Resurrection\nDid Jesus See His Resurrected Body?\nWhat about the Empty Tomb?\nWhat to Make of the Empty Tomb\nDid Jesus' Risen Body Look Like a Ghost?\nJesus' Resurrected Body\nJesus was God: The Trinity\nJesus Was Not Crucified\nBut Was Jesus Really Resurrected?\nJesus' Physicalness and Resurrection\nChristians and the Resurrection\nThe Real Jesus and the Bible\nAvoiding Fanaticism\nThe Fear of Rejecting Jesus\nFake News and Misinformation: Avoiding Deception\nJesus Is the Way\nA History of Israel\nRecommended Reading\nINTRODUCTION:  \nSUMMARY\nIn case you were wondering, this book is about Jesus of Nazareth. There are lots of books about other topics, but this one is about Jesus. So, let's get to it, shall we?\nI don't want to waste your time. I know you're busy, and if I'm going to have the privilege of your time, I want the most valuable nuggets of information I have to give. After all, there are many others I could choose to take up your time. And since you already love Jesus, I'd rather get to the point right away. So, let's review, in the most direct way I know how, Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. I'll be honest with you \u2014 no one gets perfect in this book, because there was only one perfect person in the entire history of humankind.\nIf it's not your first look at Jesus and the Bible, feel free to skim ahead and start reading what interests or piques your interest. But if you have never read a comprehensive history of Jesus, the Bible, and its impact on history, let's get to it.\nFor those of you who are open to being challenged by a different perspective, I want to recommend my book _How Jesus Became God_ , published by HarperOne and released early in 2012. This book is an attempt to reconcile the biblical Jesus with orthodox Christian faith. In fact, it is quite possible that without the later accretions and redefinitions of Jesus, the early Christians may not have even considered him a \"God.\" The book explores the social pressures that shaped the church's developing understanding of Jesus as God or not God, of the true humanity of Jesus and of how the church came to understand \"God\" as a single being. It explores the church's developing understanding of what exactly God is, and why it was so important to understand Jesus in those terms.\nThis book is much easier to read than _How Jesus Became God_. However, I suggest you read _How Jesus Became God_ first, since the book that follows explores many of the same points and builds on them.\nIn this, the first of five parts of this book, we will explore the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.\nPart I: The Greatest Day in History\nCHAPTER 1: THE GREATEST DAY IN HISTORY\nIn the year 96, a controversy broke out among a group of people called the Jews. This was not a new controversy; it had been going on for a long time. What made it controversial to the Jews was their long tradition that made their God to be a jealous God: \"I will be your God and you shall be my", "HIPAA continues to be a workplace concern, not only because of its impact on the employer and patient protection but also because of potential employer legal responsibilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued its Decision in Texas Employers Ins. Assn. v. Holder. The court held HIPAA pre-emption does not apply to the State of Texas health privacy law, Texas Insurance Code \u00a711202.85. The Texas law, which prohibits an employer from inquiring into its employee's, prospective employee, or individual applicant's health information, does not conflict with existing Federal law, specifically HIPAA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued its Decision in Rowe v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment. The court held that the HIPAA privacy rule and the Department of Health and Human Services' regulatory definition of spouse (including same-sex spouses) in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7160.103 is pre-empted by Federal marital law. A spouse under Federal law is a husband or wife according to the law of the state where a marriage was solemnized.\nC.F.R. \u00a7160. 103 defines spouse as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca husband or a wife. This definition does not include individuals in legal same-sex marriages.\nC.F.R. \u00a7 160.103(i) further provides that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[a] legal marriage is a marriage between a man and a woman.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Seal v. Salazar upholds Federal HIPAA privacy rule with no modification to Federal pre-emption in HIPAA. The appeals court ruled that the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington did not abuse its discretion in finding that Federal HIPAA did not pre-empt a Washington statute prohibiting disclosures of the records of a government employee or of a patient's health information. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have considered all of the parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099 arguments and have found no error that would require modification.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A U.S. District Court jury in New York has found that a hospital breached the HIPAA privacy rules, which resulted in $11 million in damages against the hospital.\nThe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied a motion for summary judgment filed by the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) on the issue of enforcement of a hospital's Business Associate Agreement (BAA). It held HHS established that it had not violated the HIPAA privacy and security rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaintiff's attempt to read section 220 of HITECH so broadly or in tandem with section 13 of the Privacy Rule is misguided.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard arguments before the three-judge panel in Seal v. Salazar.\nAn appeal by the Federal government of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruling in Texas Employers Ins. Assn. v. Holder was dismissed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the lower court and upheld the validity of the Texas law, Texas Insurance Code \u00a711202.85. The law prohibits insurance companies from requiring information from applicants for health insurance about their physical condition, medical history, health care received, genetic test results, pregnancy, or birth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaintiff's attempt to read section 220 of HITECH so broadly or in tandem with section 13 of the Privacy Rule is misguided.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA U.S. District Judge in the Northern District of Illinois dismissed seven consolidated cases that claimed violation of HIPAA privacy rights by the BJC Medical Center (BJC) in Belleville, Illinois for failing to de-identify patient health information. The plaintiffs' alleged damages were the value of the de-identified health information that would be used by third parties for purposes of marketing and for purposes of determining price for services and products. Three of the cases alleged the de-identified information was released to physicians for referrals to services offered by BJC. The district court dismissed allegations that BJC breached HIPAA privacy and", "A new model of advertising is beginning to take a grip in\nthe market, with the potential to make newspapers a central focus in\nmedia campaigns.  It is a model used in recent elections by several\nCanadian parties, and one that has begun to take hold in the U.S.,\nalthough only in a limited fashion. The concept is \"issue ads\".\nIssue-oriented ads in the U.S. are sponsored by interest groups who\nsupport a candidate for political office. These groups pay\nadvertising agencies to produce ads that attack a particular issue,\nbut do not mention or explicitly link to any one candidate.\nSome examples of issue-oriented ads from this past\ncampaign:  \"AIDS should not have a death penalty\", \"The Clinton-Lewinsky\nscandal is a distraction from important national issues\".\nThese ads target specific issues, such as the Republican\nplatform position on gay rights (one such ad attacked gay couples\nliving together before marriage) to the Democrats position on welfare\nspending (a Democratic issue ad linked Republicans with the Welfare\nQueen).  There are ads against the death penalty, for abortion,\nagainst gay marriage, against the PATRIOT Act, ad infinitum -- there\nare as many issues as there are advertisers, and as the election cycle\ngrows longer, that number only grows.\nSuch issue ads typically avoid the legal restrictions (i.e.:\ncampaign laws that limit the amount of campaign money a candidate can\nspend in an election and require that some of it be spent only with\ntheir designated candidates/parties) placed on the candidates themselves.\nThis allows the groups to fund their issue-ad campaigns more\nfreely than a traditional political media ad buy.\nMost of the issues that are in the issue-ad arena now are\nnational issues that are important to the overall election campaign;\nissues of import to Canadians are not so far on the radar screens of\nthose running the ads, but they may come into focus during this\ncampaign in the years up to the next federal election (which, by the\nway, will be in either 2007 or 2009, a change made by Paul Martin in\nhis first budget).\nThis issue-oriented advertising was the focus of a recent\ndiscussion by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.  Some of\nthe editors were disgusted by the approach -- one described having\nto tell to her publisher that in order to save his newspaper's\ncredibility, he couldn't run the ads that advertisers were paying for.\nIndeed, to some in the audience, it looked as if the newspapers were\nhelping them to buy campaigning.  Others in the audience, particularly\nmembers of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, found the\nidea of placing issue-oriented advertising in the newspapers quite\nThe ANAA's take on the issue was that this was a chance to\nreform the system to put more importance back on newspapers as\ncredible sources and less importance on the \"institutionalized\" ads\nfrom candidates, where they would not take the risk of running issue\nads as there would be less accountability due to the lack of direct\nname association with the ad.  These ads could carry more impact and\ninfluence the vote in a more lasting way, given that Americans will\nusually vote against an incumbent in Congress in the mid-term elections.\nThe ANAA believes that a better campaign by candidates\ncould get more voters out to the polls.  They also point to the ads\npaid for by the non-profits or activist groups to support candidates\n-- the kind of \"get out the vote\" ads the ANAA believes have been\npart of every campaign that has not been a \"wave\" for at least since\n1946 (and possibly since 1920).  According to the ANAA, these\nadvertisements have taken a much more traditional approach to media\nadvertisements.  A report done by their marketing committee (released\non August 28, with the title \"Candidates in 2002: The Advertising\nLandscape\") reports that there are two types of advertising in\ncampaigns:  paid issue ads (or \"issue ads\", to use the ANAA's\nterms) and \"paid message control.\"  Paid Issue Ads include \"issues\nads", "Growing a business revenue through content marketing is a lot like making a good stew pot of sauerkraut and frankfurters.\nContent marketing isn't just about creating great content. It's about a culture change at media companies, and that can't happen through a series of presentations, discussions or workshops. It demands a more fundamental commitment from leaders and stakeholders throughout an organisation, and requires an unwavering focus from decision-makers.\nTo paraphrase an old saying that applies to many of the successful businesses I've encountered over the years, content marketing is like making good sauerkraut -- no one really wants to eat it, but everyone secretly likes it. Once they've tasted it, they like it too much to stop.\nIf you don't make good sauerkraut, no one really wants to eat it.\nThat has become clearer to me in the week prior to ICC 2018 as we've continued to explore what's required to put a successful content marketing strategy in place at Fairfax New Zealand.\nTo help explain our thinking on this, I've been reading the book, Content Inc.: How Entrepreneurs Use Content to Build Massive Audiences--and Create Radical New Businesses (Portfolio, 2014), by Joe Pulizzi, the founder of the Content Marketing Institute, and Robert Raiola, whose 25 year marketing career has spanned IBM, Ford, and Oracle.\nThe authors are a bit heavy-handed with their advice, but they make a number of excellent observations on the importance of investing in the right type of journalists and story tellers.\nWhen Pulizzi and Raiola looked at the evolution of content marketing at The Huffington Post, they highlighted the critical role played by two of its founders, Eric Meyer and Ryan McCarthy. After an extended period of experimentation that began in 2010, the pair settled upon a successful content marketing strategy driven by a team of journalists, editors, and content managers who were also trained as story tellers.\nTheir ability to attract and maintain a readership was critical for the survival of the Huffington Post, and the business strategy that Pulizzi and Raiola describe is largely responsible for the brand continuing to evolve and prosper across various business lines.\nI've discussed the need to build a different kind of journalist elsewhere, so allow me to expand on that topic here. In the digital world, content is the product and the journalist is the sales person. The journalist is the storyteller.\nAs with the recipes of good sauerkraut and frankfurters described above, we need the right ingredients to make something great, and journalists have always been trained to tell the story.\nMany of us still rely on content marketing as a strategy to connect with our readers, but if we want to reach an increasingly distracted and disengaged audience we need to shift focus away from the content itself and onto what lies between our publishers and their customers -- the audience.\nThis is what Pulizzi and Raiola refer to as the gap between your content and your customers. In most cases, this means telling the right story that connects to and resonates with the needs and priorities of your audience.\nAs Pulizzi and Raiola describe what happened at The Huffington Post in their efforts to move towards content marketing: \"We became obsessed with understanding [our] customer and using that insight as a springboard to develop targeted and personalised content strategies (our storytelling).\" ICC 2018\nAt its heart, this means we need to invest further in understanding our customer better through research. We've identified the need for this through our work on The Listener site, the New Zealand Herald and TVNZ.co.nz websites. These efforts have required the involvement of both our research teams and dedicated news editors to work with audiences.\nThis combination of skills and experience is something we don't have a lot of and is something we are having to rebuild, but it is worth it if the aim is to find ways to connect with a modern readership and build relevancy with our target market.\nAs I see more and more examples, particularly on TVNZ.co.nz and our New Zealand Herald offering, success in the world of digital content marketing increasingly hinges on a deep customer empathy and a genuine desire to engage and entertain audiences. This is far beyond the content we typically create -- think of those old media \"advertorials\" -- or those", "Birdy has the body of a normal 17-year-old but the\nmind of a 19-year-old.

While I feel the book\ndidn't really get started until after the backstory was revealed, this\ninitial section was a good setup for what is to happen (particularly, the initial\nescape of Birdie's friends) and really gives the reader the overall feel of\nthe book. It took me a little while longer than I anticipated to get\ninto the book, but I was definitely hooked by the end of chapter three.\nAlthough the pace of the book picks up after the backstory is revealed,\nthe middle of the book is more than a \"twist\" with its own sub-plot and a\nseparate story arc with its own twist and conclusioI~ _Birdy_ is an interesting\nexploration of depression, isolation, obsession and the mental health of\na young person, and it's a good study on how a \"normal\" teenager can see things\ncompletely differently than an \"older\" teenager or adult. I've seen this sort of\nthinking by younger people before, but it's not as common as I believe it to be\nin reality. Of course, I'm no doctor, but Birdy's narrative sounds very\nbelievable. The story that unfolds is the story of a young man searching for\nhimself against his best friends' efforts to \"save him.\" There is plenty of\naction, with occasional flashbacks to Birdy's story of his early life.\nAnd the ending of _Birdy_ was brilliant and completely unexpected. I really\nenjoyed _Birdy_ and was left with a number of questions (which I won't list here\nas they are spoilers to the story). _Birdy_ ends with just\nenough questions about the character's future that one wants to read the\nsequel (which I haven't read yet). _Birdy_ could definitely use another edit\nand I would personally like to see a little more information about the story's\nvillain, but it's still a great listen.\nAudio Notes: _Birdy_ is narrated by Christopher\nEvan Welch, who previously played the main role in\nMacDonald's _Tales from the Crypt_ podcast. He did a\nsuperb job narrating _Birdy_, using the slight inflections\nto separate characters so the listener knows exactly who's\nspeaking.

We could take all the iPads or the iPhones that get returned at the end of the exhibits and send them out again the next day in the hands of somebody else, all for free.\nMy idea is to give an iDevice to everybody in the audience for the entire conference, just as free gifts to facilitate communication and learning and innovation. It's a way for you to have some fun while introducing new media tools to the journalism industry.\nI think it would be really neat to give everybody who attends the first day of the conference a free iPhone or iPad to use for the duration of the conference, just to help them get used to the new technology to encourage learning and innovation. We could take all the iPads or the iPhones that get returned at the end of the exhibits and send them out again the next day in the hands of somebody else, all for free.\nWe have more than 2,000 people attending each year, and I would think that a high percentage of them are going to go home and continue to use technology. Maybe we should have a whole day of presentations specifically to help people use these new tools? They can learn while they're at the conference.\nI have heard that at least one of the mobile social networking applications allows users to post photos instantly to Twitter and Facebook accounts. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a booth where all the attendees could upload their mobile photos (taken with their iPhone), and then we send them back out to their Twitter and Facebook accounts or Flickr?\nIf the booth could also be loaded with a Twitter and Facebook \"app,\" it would be cool for all the people to use to post and share updates in real time. We could take all the iPads we get back at the end of the conference's first day and send them out for use the next morning with new attendees.\nIf we wanted to really have some fun, there could be a day when we give out some really outrageous and wild devices (like a Palm Pilot). It's more of an incentive to attend our sessions, which would be kind of like a teaser. A contest like that would bring people in who may not have even thought about coming.\nI think, instead, we should provide conference registrants with a free device that they can use for the entire conference and that is of decent quality. They could take it home and use it for an entire year until the next convention comes around. It would introduce them to new technology and give them something good to show for investing the time and money in the convention. The technology community has to make sure there are no limitations or other obstacles that might prevent or limit our new audience from entering the fray and using the tool in the way they want to.\nGiving away an iDevice the first day of the conference and then sending it out again the next day with people who may not have wanted to buy a device would be a great way to expand our network and attract new members. It would help people, especially the older generation, who may not be as comfortable with technology to learn about social networking, photo blogging, and even texting.\nThe conference would give away some of the more expensive devices for people to try and introduce them to new technology, and then send them out again for new people to keep using, for a year or until the next convention. It would be kind of like the free iPods they give out at the Apple Store in New York City on Fifth Avenue. We could call it \"iCUE,\" and it would expand our network and attract new members.

ANNOTATION: House passage of the measure, which passed the House on a 210-30 vote, would send a message to Castro that the USA is continuing its fight against communist dictators.\nCOPYRIGHT 2014 CQ Transcriptions, LLC. All rights reserved.\nROBINSON: The bill would give those oppressed by the communist dictators -- by Castro, by other regimes out there -- the ability to send money out of the country to their families in their troubled countries around the world. That's money into their economy, money into these families, not only to sustain families here in the United States, but also provide them with economic incentive to stay home and fight for democracy. It's the right thing to do. It's got my vote.\nIt would be an unprecedented act for the Congress to act in this manner. By this unprecedented act, they are giving into the communist, totalitarian, murderous Castro regime even more power over the Cuban people. And we in Congress should not be acting in support of the Castro regime. And, therefore, I'm opposed to this unprecedented and outrageous action by the Congress.\nThe fact that we're going to allow even more money to go over into the hands of the Cuban dictator, even more money will flow from our families and our citizens here into the hands of Fidel Castro and the Cuban dictatorship, is something that I cannot support. Thank you.\nBut the real problem with this bill -- and I think we've got to address it -- is that even the people who support this bill are not aware of the reality that this bill does provide money to Castro on a very selective basis to help his own interests, not those of the oppressed Cubans to give to the dissidents within a program that is totally controlled by the Cuban dictator.\nMy position all along has been, don't help him. Don't provide money. Instead, we put our sanctions into effect, which hurt him. He knows that we will continue to do that. So, why should we give him more money when what we're supposed to be doing is to give more money to his opposition, not to his regime?\nAnd so, it seems to me, this bill fails to achieve just what the authors thought they would achieve -- the opposition to Castro. What will actually happen when we pass this bill is that we will increase the regime's income, and that is certainly not something that we should be doing. It will not help the freedom of the Cuban people. It will not help them overthrow Castro one day. It will ensure that they stay oppressed by that regime for a long time into the future.\nI think that we in this country should not provide more money to the Castro regime. We should put the economic sanctions back in effect. And we should make certain that we do not allow any more of our dollars to go into the hands of oppressive dictators like Castro.\nCARSON: On this issue, I want to support what the speaker is saying. I do not believe that it is in the interests of the American people in this case to give money to the Cuban regime. It has never worked in our interest. The people of Cuba have very little benefit from these dollars. And also, on the contrary, we see exactly what Dr. Carson is saying. They increase the number of troops and they increase the number of guns and missiles that are being sent to Cuba. We know that there is always a quid pro quo.\nOn this issue, we can do much better by giving money to the Cuban dissidents themselves, those who are really trying to effect a change. I think that the United States is well-positioned to do this. It can give to these people money. When we try to give to the central government of Cuba, we give money to the people that are holding the people down.\nThe fact of the matter is that we ought to be supporting, we ought to support the voices that are being raised by the Cuban dissidents themselves. This is a very difficult circumstance because the dictatorship that is in charge in Cuba has made it impossible for the voice of the Cuban people to be heard. We cannot see this as a problem simply from the vantage point of the American people. We have to take into account and acknowledge what the facts are in the situation in Cuba itself -- the difficulty of even getting information in and out of Cuba.\nAnd then, also we have to address the fact of the central government in this situation, that there", "The Department of the Treasury's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishes a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed information collection.

These information collection requirements have received OMB approval under control number 1557-0016, which expires November 30, 2003. OTS proposes to discontinue its approval of the following information collection: 1557-0003, Application for Temporary Liquidation; and 1557-0004, Thrift Liquidation Annual Report.\n1. Report Title: Thrift Liquidation Reporting Requirements.\nAffected Public: Thrifts that have liquidated.\nEstimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 425 hours.\nAbstract: Thrifts are required to file this information in connection with the filing of their application for permission to engage in liquidation proceedings. The information requested is used to evaluate each liquidation application for its compliance with existing OTS regulations. This information also may be requested to evaluate any questions that may have been raised regarding the liquidation of a particular institution.\nAffected Public: The Board of Regents of State Colleges and Universities and the boards of trustees of each separate community college district that have liquidated.\nAbstract: On October 30 and November 15, 1977, OTS issued interim final rules concerning its authority to liquidate institutions. The first interim rule specified the information that the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and OTS must request and collect in addition to FRB information collections in order to use FRB resources to liquidate institutions. The second interim rule set forth procedures that the FRB would follow in using its resources to liquidate these institutions. OTS issued these interim rules in order to provide for a prompt and orderly resolution of the financial institutions problems that it was responsible for addressing. While OTS issued these interim final rules for liquidation, the OTS did not formally implement this process. OTS did not have the statutory authority to engage in liquidation. Therefore, the Board of Regents of State Colleges and Universities and some separate community colleges did not liquidate. OTS also issued interim final rules concerning the authority of OTS to sell any assets that the Agency acquired from an institution upon its liquidation. OTS issued interim rules on these matters in order to have a mechanism to use FRB resources to resolve and liquidate these institutions. As it developed, the process that the agencies developed for addressing the financial institutions problems did not provide the agencies with the authority to liquidate institutions. During the late 1970s, the Federal Government authorized the agencies to develop a process to quickly wind down the nonviable financial services institutions. Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA, Title IV, Subtitle B, 12 U.S.C. 1463(f)(2); and amends) to make available limited authority for the liquidation of certain institutions that OTS and OCC are responsible for. FIRREA also provided funds in the event the Government engaged in liquidations to wind down problem financial institutions and created the Financing Account fund to administer the recovery funds to liquidate Federal insured institutions. When Congress passed FIRREA on October 15, 1989, it also provided the agencies with emergency authority to resolve the financial institutions problems that they were", "What we know about\nHow to use the Internet in journalism\nHow to use the Internet for audience\nHow to use the Internet to generate\nHow to use the Internet for local\nFor many people the Internet is an uncharted jungle. For some\nstill it is, but it's also an indispensable weapon for journalists to\nuse to further their work. In this report I will try to explain what\nit can do for you, and how you can use it best to further your\nwork as journalists.\nThe first thing to clarify is if you're an unconventional journalist.\nIt is for sure a weapon to be used against you, but on the other hand\nit is one of the most powerful tools to use. Most newsrooms of\nnewspapers are quite comfortable in their old methods and don't find\nnecessary to follow the latest technological developments. I suggest\nthe reader to read the chapter \"the web and you\" in John Perry's\nbook \"The new new journalism\". It is a great source to get your head\nof the latest developments in this field. What Mr Perry says in his\nbook is very useful for both the journalist and the reader:\n- \"You are responsible\nfor what you know and what you don't know.\" (J. Perry, 2002,\nI found this to be a great idea to take when you're searching\nsomething online.\n- \"No more is the Internet\na substitute for good judgment and good information. It's a\nsupplement.\" (J. Perry, 2002, see above)\nAnother point raised by Peter Kellner in his book \"Netocracy\" is\nthat, although there are a lot of opinions on the Internet, it is very\neasy to discern facts from propaganda.\n\"Propaganda is not\nvery effective on the Internet because it is so easy to disprove\n\"The Internet is just the\nlast and the longest stage of what has long been a global\nnetwork of free-market capitalism - the network that is also\nknown, less romantically, as 'free movement of goods and\ncash'\" (Peter Kellner, 1998)\nSo one can make the point that the Internet can be used by anyone\nin the world to promote his opinions and views. But on the other side\nof the coin, it is a wonderful way to research for data, and even more\npowerfully it can be used to gather data through polls, interviews and\nquestionnaires that are used for research.\nOne of the most\nimportant tools in this area is the ability to collect data using the\nInternet. It is a great way to conduct research and gather data and\ninformation that will be of great use. But we have to be very careful\nand have to ensure that the data we gather is accurate and\nsubstantiated. At the same time, if we don't care about finding\ndata using the Internet we will lose ground.\n\"It is more than a tool. It is\nan indispensable weapon in the information wars that are being\nfought at the world's boundaries, as well as in the newsrooms and\npress-centres of our own cities\" (John Perry, 2002)\n- \"You will find yourselves\nslapped down if you do not know the best sites to go to,\nreliable sources to talk to, latest developments, etc.\n\"If you are an\nolder journalist, it is a way of keeping up to date in a\nprofession that used to be a closed shop\" (John Perry, 2002)\nThis is one of the most important reasons for embracing the Internet\nas a way to improve your profession.\nInternet: an easy target?\nAnother aspect of the use of the Internet that I have already\ndescribed in this article is that it is a fast and easy way to reach\nand gather a specific amount of data, a fact that makes the Internet\nan easy and fast target for those who are looking to spread\n\"A lot of very stupid\nthings have managed to find easy access through the Internet,\nsometimes without any great effort.\" (Peter Kellner, 1994)\nThis quote shows the importance of the Internet as a fast and efficient\nway to spread an idea or data. This is why some of the most\nunconventional and radical ideas have had an easy access through the\nInternet, being the main factor this way easy to spread data\nthroughout the world. This has caused some problems for most\nintelligent and sophisticated people, as they have had the problem,\nthe responsibility of finding these ideas unimportant", "As one in the 16 million who live in the\nUnited States under a permanent resident alien visa, I have a\nstrong personal interest in seeing the United States maintain its\nmoral, cultural and economic well-being. But I have only recently\ndiscovered that a large cadre of so called \"libertarians\", and\nmany conservatives, also have a strong interest in America's\nwell-being and economic survival.\nA surprising number of these individuals oppose the free\ntrade agreements with Mexico, Central America and Canada promoted\nby the U.S. corporate-politicos and the media.  (Incidentally,\nmost of these same individuals tend to oppose the U.S. invasion of\nIraq and the current U.S. military occupation of Afghanistan for\nthe same reasons.)  In fact a surprisingly large number of them\nalso know there have been many false flag attacks against the\ncitizens of the United States, and they are outraged at what they\nknow about secret government programs, such as covert black\noperations, the drug trade, assassinations, false flag, government\nsponsored terrorism, and various other government abuse of power\nThis was shown clearly in the recent controversy over the\nrelease of the 1991 FBI memo written by one of its agents,\nindicating that certain explosive materials had been found in the\nTwin Towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.\nFunding for a study team that had been investigating the\npossibility of a governmental cover-up of this information had\nallegedly been canceled because the study was likely to reveal an\n\"inadequate investigation\", according to the memo, of the actual\ncauses for the destruction of the Twin Towers on that fateful day.\nThe memo was released on April 25, 2002 after Senator Bob Graham\nfinally obtained it from the FBI.  The FBI had refused to release\nthe memo for months, claiming it would \"expose government to\ndisaster\" and infringe on national security.  It apparently\nnever occurred to the FBI that the government's refusal to\nappreciate the 9/11 information, let alone release it, might\njust be one more indicator that the government was involved in a\ncover-up, as the memo clearly indicated.\nThe mainstream media were quick to respond to the release\nof the memo, and they immediately began blasting Senator\nGraham and criticizing his insistence on being provided with the\nreport written by the University of Southern Florida's Center\nFor Implementing National Security Act Guidelines (CINSAG)\nthat would have produced the final result. This was despite the\nfact that the media and most of the U.S. congress were fully aware\nthat 80% of the report had already been declassified and the rest\nwere mostly the results of the ongoing 11-year investigation by\nAtlanta journalist Dale E. Bailey and his CINSAG group. Bailey's\nwork had been on the Congressional Record for years.  It was also\nwell-known by 93% of the U.S. congressional representatives, but\nthey also chose to remain silent, apparently hoping the memo would\ngo away, without further publicity. Even the 9/11 Commission\nreport acknowledged  that there was evidence of \"a cover-up\".  Yet\nnot one of the news organizations chose to inform the public about\nthis. Even Senator Graham was criticized for having \"the tenacity\nof an arson investigator\"  that had led him to the release of the\nmemo.  In spite of the fact that Senator Graham was a member of the\nSenate Select Committee that had been appointed to conduct a\ncomprehensive and bipartisan investigation of the 9/11 attacks,\nmany of his colleagues in the congress were not so eager to\nshare this information, and neither were the corporately controlled\nmainstream media.\nThe release of the memo and the subsequent public outcry led\nto some embarrassing moments for the press, especially the\nFox network, which was the first to get the story from Senator\nGraham and immediately broadcast it to America's TV viewers.\nBarton Hinkle, one of their news anchors and a columnist for\nSouthwest Virginia's Roanoke Times reported on an open letter he\nhad received from Fox commentator Bill O'Re", "Members of the Committee were provided with a report from the \n      Director, Children's Services regarding an assessment undertaken by \n      Bromford on behalf of the Strategic Children's Board.          Members \n      also considered issues associated with a range of other areas such \n      as:        a)    Youth Crime  b)    Safer Stronger Communities Grants \n      Programme   c)    Adoption   d)   Fostering  e)    Child Care Strategy \n      f)    Home to School Transport  g)    School Transport Consignments \n      h)    School Transport Arrivals  i)    School Activity Excursions \n      j)    GATE Excursions  k)    School Travel Support  l)    Bilingual \n      Education Service  m)    Youth Education Scheme   n)    Home Tutoring \n      o)    Home School Link  p)    Home Tuition Quotas  q)    Early Years \n      Partnership  r)    Schools' Pupils with Significant Delay in Reading \n      Development       s)    Disadvantaged Learner Fund  t)    School Climate \n      Measures        u)    Attendance Initiatives  v)    School Sites' \n      Renewal, Reorganisation and Expansion   w)    School Meals  x)     Early \n      Years Excursions Y)    Childrens Services Capital Programme Z)   Housing \n      for Youth 2008         AA) Child Protection.          The Director, \n      Children's Services indicated that a new format of the Children's \n      Plan would be in place by November 2007 and that the Children's Plan \n      would consist of 24 outcomes which would be divided into short and \n      medium term objectives.      In response to a question, the Director, \n      Children's Services indicated that in relation to a number of objectives \n      under Outcome 2, some of the outcomes might be addressed outside of Local \n      Education Authorities (LEAs). He further indicated that the LEA would \n      have an input in the planning of such activities and that this would be \n      addressed at a National level.      The Chairperson stated that one \n      matter which the Committee would be focusing on at the next meeting \n      would be the Children's Plan.     He further indicated that he felt \n      another area which needed particular attention was that of  early \n      years learning. He highlighted that this would be addressed through \n      the work of the Early Years Partnership.  A number of items of urgent \n      business relating to Child Protection were considered. The Chairperson \n      reported that he had recently attended the launch of 'Safe from Harm', \n      a new guide for professionals which had been written by Children's \n      Services staff. He stated that the guide would be useful in ensuring \n      that appropriate assessments were carried out. The Chairperson added \n      that this would be available from November 2007.       The Chairperson \n      reported that on the 16th November, the launch of the Regional \n      Action Plan for Children would take place at the North Wales Conference \n      Centre.  The Action Plan would identify priority areas for child \n      protection and safeguarding work. The Plan was a joint undertaking \n      involving all the key partners. A number of items for the Committee's \n      Forthcoming Proceedings were considered, including the new Code of \n      Practice for Schools' Pupil Accommodation.     It was stated that an \n      open consultation had just opened on a draft Code of Practice, developed \n      by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to assist \n      LEAs and governing bodies in making decisions regarding new sites and \n      refurbishment projects.   The consultation would close on 12 000thof \n      2007. It was further stated that the consultation draft was not the \n      same as the original Code of Practice but now included a number of \n      alterations resulting from the initial consultation phase.     The \n      Director, Children's Services invited any Members who wished to make \n      further comments to respond by 30th November in order that they \n      could be considered by the Committee prior to making a further", "A newspaper's business and editorial missions need not conflict.\nToday's media culture encourages a competitive, adversarial and\ndisparaging view of the news-making process and journalists who participate\nin it, including newspapers and the businesses they serve\nIn this article, I offer a contrarian point of view--\nThat the news-making journalists can and should become\na key part of the commercial enterprise whose\nbusiness and editorial missions need not\nconflict. That, if done correctly,\nthe news business can\nand must be a major source of\nrevenue for newspapers because a company that\nneeds to create a substantial amount of wealth for\nits owners and shareholders, it can do so by creating a\npublic good-- quality journalism as a professional discipline--\nand profits from providing this service to its customers, including\nIt argues that news journalists need to think long and hard about\nwhether they are working to fulfill their editorial purposes, doing\ntheir best work and serving their readers. If the answer is no, they\nmust take action or move on. If the answer is yes, they should recognize\nand embrace that being a professional journalist also\ncan be a profitable business.\nI've written other pieces dealing with this topic in\nthese last few years, from the business and editorial perspectives, so I'm\ngoing to offer a different approach, from the perspective of a longtime\nnewspaper executive.\nI don't mean to suggest that everyone's approach is wrong. It\nis well-known that newspapers and newsrooms that serve a community the\nbest also are the very ones that have an awful lot of problems.\nI believe that the most critical element in succeeding at this\nis the newspaper and its newsroom doing as best it can in the\ncommunity it serves-- for its own employees, customers and the public\nIt all comes back to this one simple principle:\nIf the staff at a newspaper serves its customers with excellence,\nthat newspaper can have good business results; if its staff serves with\nless than excellence, the newspaper will not be rewarded with the\nresults it deserves.\nThe idea is not new, however. I was reminded about the importance\nof this concept recently by a discussion with a colleague who was\ncommenting on the current financial mess that many of our newspapers\nfind themselves in.\nOur discussion brought in the subject of how a newspaper and its\nnewspaper management need to fulfill their business and editorial\nobjectives. Our discussion prompted me to write about these issues,\nbecause I don't think we're doing enough to understand the\nimportance of connecting the need to create journalism as a public\ngood with the need to be successful as a business, both for our owners\nand employees. We need to do better because it is important to us,\nto our communities, our stakeholders and our stockholders.\nHow did I come to this opinion? It is the result of nearly 40 years\nof working closely with newspapers and their newsrooms. It is also from\nhaving had an opportunity to learn firsthand what works in today's\nnewspaper business from many who have been among the most successful\nnewspaper companies.\nIt is also the result of having personally participated in the effort\nto create successful, profitable newspapers (and newspaper\ncompanies) at four major newspaper chains: Gannett Co., Inc., The\nMorris Communications Co., Lee Enterprises Inc. and most recently,\nDemocrat & Chronicle Inc., publisher of the Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat\n& Chronicle and USA Today.\nOf course, no one has all the answers, but we\nknow something is off track when we witness newspapers-- and their\nnewsrooms-- that no longer make a positive difference. When we see\nnewspapers that don't appear to have the courage to do the right thing\nfor their companies, their employees or the public.\nThat is where we believe, in our opinion, the industry is today as it\nstruggles to survive, particularly as it faces the most serious financial\ncrisis it has faced in nearly 80 years. But it doesn't have to go on\nlike this-- we know that we can still do the right thing.\nThose who manage, work in and are the customers of our\nnewspaper companies often ask me for my opinion on this vital\ntopic because I believe strongly in both the journalism that newspapers\nproduce and the business that supports it.\nMy answer is that newspapers have always\nbeen in the business of creating and", "In a study from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, 7 billion (yes, billion) data points from 31 million individuals on energy, travel, diet, and social behavior help to \"visualize\" personal mobility habits and patterns in big data. The project was inspired by the massive datasets collected by tax authorities, and the resulting visualizations may be a big boon to businesses, researchers, and marketers.\nThe project was inspired by big data, and the resulting visualizations give marketers a different perspective on individuals' energy and travel habits. According to the European Commission's official statement, \"the visualization allows anyone to have a comprehensive and objective picture of how they travel and how their neighbours travel, as well as enabling policy makers to study social and travel habits over longer timescales, based on these visualizations. \"\nIn the world of big data, visualizations have become crucial forms of analysis for companies and marketers seeking to create rich, visual representations of demographic and location-based information. The data visualization techniques have become so popular, in fact, that it led to the first World Data Visualization Day (hosted by QlikView) on October 9.\nThe project that inspired this visualization approach involved massive datasets collected by tax authorities and similar institutions in member states of the European Union. The researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) used the datasets to identify key trends in mobility habits, as well as regional variations in patterns.\nAs the release states, \"the interactive visualizations show data from 31 million individuals on their everyday mobility habits throughout the EU. The website allows all users to explore the collected data from different angles, for instance by visualizing the number of trips per week, region and length per person. All visualizations are updated in real-time to provide the most accurate and up-to-date picture of mobility in Europe.\"\nSuch advances in data visualization are extremely beneficial to marketers and researchers.

To that extent, it examines options for the scope of the collective management of rights covered, and whether Member States should be able to opt out of the proposed mechanism. The Draft Proposal also contains a number of other provisions relating to the application of the Directive, such as the powers of the Commission to ensure transparency and the principle of non-discrimination.\n\uf0b7 The Draft Proposal's main provisions are:\n\uf0b7 The Commission would introduce specific legislative provisions for the collective management of authors' (and related rights). Those provisions would not affect existing schemes for the collective management of rights on matters not covered by such schemes, which are already in place, either in Member States or at the EU level. Conversely, such existing schemes would not be affected by any framework put in place by the proposal.\n\uf0b7 Collective management would involve the negotiation and granting of multi-territorial licences for the use of copyright material. The Directive would require that the licence be transparent (i.e. that all licence terms are specified in order to ensure fair and open licensing). It would also place conditions on how the licence is enforced, and on the transparency and accountability of the management entity in relation to the use of the licence income and the handling of disputes.\n\uf0b7 The Collective Management of Copyright in the Digital Single Market will allow users to know where they should go for licences (e.g. to use content in their business), thereby ensuring a level playing field for the use of copyright material in all sectors.\n\uf0b7 This approach would provide a predictable multi-territorial licensing framework for European authors and rightholders. Such a framework would assist market players in Europe in the management of their copyrights and create economies of scale, thus lowering licensing costs. The Directive should in particular help the EU audiovisual and online publishing sectors, where a small number of European rights are needed to broadcast or publish content. It should also help the cultural sector, where small scale activities generate a relatively small amount of earnings.\n\uf0b7 Adequate and proportionate governance provisions will ensure that the licensing framework ensures fair and transparent working conditions for authors and users. They would be backed up by an anti-trust review by the European Commission into whether a given system of collective management produces negative effects that outweigh its efficiencies.\n\uf0b7 The Directive's anti-abuse rules would prevent abuse of collective licensing, such as using collective management schemes to avoid licensing individual rights. Abusive practices are already prohibited under EU antitrust rules (e.g. anticompetitive price-fixing agreements). The Commission would propose similar anti-abuse provisions in the Directive and ensure their coherence with those of antitrust. In addition, the Directive would provide that if collective management of rights does not ensure effective protection of rightholder interests, such rights could be managed directly by authors or rightholders.\n\uf0b7 Certain specific rights would be excluded from the scope, on a compulsory basis, for example geographical broadcasting rights, database rights, and performers' rights. Collective management options would be given for other specific rights, while other rights would be excluded on an optional basis. Member States would be able to opt-out of any collective management provisions in the following cases:\n- In the case of rights which are normally managed directly by authors or rightholders (including, for example, rights of communication to the public by wire or wireless means).\n- In the case of rights exclusively administered by collective management organisations (including, for example, rights that have historically been managed by collective management organisations).\n- In the case of rights of public interest, such as scientific, literary, artistic and education related rights, with the exception of rights included in a specific Directive and rights managed for direct public benefit.\n\uf0b7 The Directive would foresee a mechanism to ensure that the cost of managing rights is fair and proportionate. However, this would concern the costs relating to the management of specific rights, which Member States would have to set out in their transparency regimes, which are already in place.\n\uf0b7 The Directive would aim to ensure that multi-territorial licensing is not considered less transparent as compared with the management of individual rights.\n\uf0b7 The Directive", "How do major news websites across the globe measure up to a major search engine?\n\"Average\" is the word you want to focus on. With so many variables, most are averaged out. When compared directly between the websites, it becomes a \"winner takes all\" scenario, so there is not a need for a comparison as that only causes confusion.\nLooking at the \"average\" rankings of major news websites in search results is a better method for analysis and comparison.\nWe created a method for a news publisher to find out how their website compared to the top 10 sites and which ones had the biggest gap between their rankings.\nFocusing on the UK search market in particular because rankings are displayed in the same order in all 3 of the major browsers, it showed that an average difference of 33 positions between websites was a substantial difference.\nAn analysis comparing the average rankings of the top 10 sites in search would reveal that the search engine held almost two-thirds of the market-share.\nBased on this information, the UK was ranked No. 1 for the top spot for \"news,\" but the second-placed site, the homepage for the Telegraph, appeared at No. 19 in search results \u2013 almost 50 positions lower.\nFor the Guardian, Google\u2019s site was almost 33 positions lower at No. 40, while the Telegraph was 9 places behind at No. 48.\nLooking at a similar example with other countries, such as US or Germany, the US website held 73% of the market share while the German site held 70%.\nSimilarly, a global average with the top 10 news sites shows that Google holds 38% share of market-share, despite the fact that this is far higher than the other sites' market share.\nThis was found to be on account of the number of search queries, a number of articles and an average of 15% traffic to the top 5 news websites.\nThe average rankings of each page in Google\u2019s index were counted by our research engine which was then filtered to only be of the Top 500 news publishers.\nA similar analysis for the UK search results showed that there was an average difference of 4.1, which in real terms was the difference of an estimated 21.8 million people's awareness for the Top 10 News websites.\nThis meant that when compared to each other, there was a small gap between them.\nIt also shows that Google held only 19% more clicks on news in comparison to the Telegraph\u2019s website, meaning that 81% were clicking on Google\u2019s news in comparison to the Telegraph\u2019s.\nIt was also discovered that it was the Guardian who had the largest difference, holding almost 2.2 million more clicks than the Telegraph\u2019s website.\nSimilarly, looking at the global market in the top ten countries, it became apparent that the countries with the highest average were the US, the UK, Germany, France and Spain.\nIn the US, it was discovered the Google had the largest difference of almost 307 million more clicks between themselves in comparison to Telegraph\u2019s website, meaning that the Telegraph only had 7% of the market.\nFor the UK, the average was 10,361,000 clicks for Google and only 2,237,400 clicks for Telegraph\u2019s website.\nThe news publishers are likely to attract 10-15x more traffic from search engine organic results and that this makes their rankings in Google a very powerful metric.\nOne of the key findings after performing the analysis was that there was almost no significant difference in difference of how those sites compared to the others.\nThough there was a small difference in the average ranking between the Guardian\u2019s website (82nd) and The Telegraph\u2019s (133rd), it was not enough to show a significant change.\nLooking purely at the difference of the top 10, no clear trends were found between the countries and only the UK news site having an advantage. It was found that with a difference of 4.1 positions, the Guardian had an advantage by approximately 100 million people's interest.\nThe main take home message from this analysis was the fact that all three countries\u2019 had a significant number of news websites, which was most likely to generate more clicks throughout the search engines.\nAnother was that the UK news industry had a much higher amount of clicks to all three websites compared to most countries.\nGoogle was then further measured by its share of news websites in search, which was found to be 7% for the US, 7", "A successful marketing strategy will attract customers and then retain them with new offers. Customer loyalty efforts require a two-way approach of marketing and customer feedback. The bottom line is that satisfied users should be rewarded with new offers.\nCustomer loyalty is at the heart of any successful marketing strategy, with the reward of satisfied users often becoming new offers via loyalty programs. In order to effectively implement a two-way loyalty program that encourages customers to stick around, the efforts must be both strategic and collaborative. That means marketers must take advantage of the various touch points that they have throughout the customer relationship, whether in-store, online or mobile-based. If they are to successfully create brand advocacy and loyalty, this is a necessity.\nThere is a reason why it is called the \"golden\" year of the customer. When consumers decide to move from one company to the next year-over-year, this is known as the golden opportunity for marketers to make the move to the new brand a \"golden moment\" for the consumer. This might come in the form of an immediate discount or an exclusive membership offer. Either way, once the consumer has transitioned to another brand, the loyalty programs can have a substantial economic effect on the business moving forward. This is why investing in loyalty programs is a must for companies in both high-engagement industries and industries that need to focus on their brand reputation.\nIn fact, studies show that customer loyalty programs work wonders for brand reputation. One report, co-authored by Harvard Business School and Accenture, concluded that 78% of consumers are driven by brand loyalty to stay with a company. In a separate study completed by Bain & Company, the results showed that the typical consumer interacts with a brand 10 to 20 times before making a purchase. Based on this data, companies in high-engagement industries can increase loyalty from less than 5% to more than 80%.\nIn order for a company to create this level of brand loyalty, it is critical to take advantage of this opportunity to make the most of its data. By understanding its customers and understanding their individual needs, a company can effectively communicate with its customers through a variety of touch points to create two-way loyalty that will drive results. According to McKinsey & Company, there are five key focus points to keep in mind when creating an effective loyalty program:\nMake it easy to sign up: This is one of the most important steps in the overall customer loyalty strategy. The process should be seamless, with a few simple steps getting the brand access to the customer's information.\nMake it easy to use: The loyalty program should provide simple and seamless experiences to ensure ease of use. If consumers find the program challenging to access or use, it will make them less engaged and less enthusiastic about being a part of the program.\nReward relevant loyalty: This is the key to creating brand advocacy. Marketers must reward loyalty in a way that resonates with the particular audience segment and with the customer's specific needs. The rewards must be relevant and valued by customers if the loyalty program is to be successful.\nMake it easy to join other programs, too; and reward the effort: This should not just be the responsibility of the company. Customers are looking for a loyalty program that allows them to take advantage of offers from a variety of different brands. It should also be extremely easy for the customer to take advantage of the rewards from other brands. All companies in the same vertical market have to compete in the consumer's eye.\nFind the right metric to measure success: The true measure of loyalty program success is not just the number of customers in the program, but also the number of people who are satisfied. It is only when customers are able to take advantage of all the offers that the program is effectively driving value for the marketer and customer alike.\nAs loyalty programs continue to evolve, marketers need to take full advantage of every touch point they have with consumers. This means more than simply offering rewards. Rewards alone will not keep customers loyal. There must be a two-way dialogue to make it work well. Marketers must be able to track the impact, behavior, and loyalty that have been driven by their investments in these customer outreach initiatives. Companies that succeed in this manner are likely to see the greatest return on investment.\nFor additional information on Loyalty Strategies: Brands, Loyalty Trends 2017: What You Need to Know and Global Mobile Wallets: Payment, Top-up and Loyalty, download the free white papers.\nPREV GDPR and Google:", "900 million people are reading news on mobile phones\n28 Oct 2013, Rovaniemi, Finland\nMobile devices are not only personal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mass media phenomenon,\u201d says\nMobile World Congress CEO\nGuy Kornblum, in an interview with\n. \u201cA lot of it is mass-scale mobile.\u201d\nSometimes Mobile World Campuss\nThe Mobile World Campus\nis an event, a conference, an\nidea, just the name, a slogan\nfor what you like to call\nmobile phones, tablets,\nphones, whatever, the way\nyou look at it,\n.

A consumer survey, said the article, found that purchases were more impulsive around the same time as the offer.\nWhat seems a little less well-understood is if and when these consumers will respond positively to such SMS offers. The article in question didn't discuss it.\nIn this first-of-its-kind study published by the Journal of Interactive Advertising, we learned that, in the case of offers coming via SMS, it's best to send the offer and make the sale very quickly, lest the consumer forget the offer. The same applies if the offer includes free shipping or a low initial price point.\nThe results, which are based on an in-depth study of consumer data over the course of two years, show that making the offer quickly is all you need to do. This does not indicate a need to send SMS offers in real time, however.\nThe findings come from looking at 15,000 mobile advertisements in the form of SMS coupons and offers sent by five of the largest U.S. online marketers, and 50,000 coupon codes sent in similar fashion by the marketing firm Foursquare.\nThe data set includes over 1 billion ad impressions and more than 160 million unique consumers, and the researchers analyzed the data to determine who used SMS coupons during a given shopping session, when they used them, and when they made purchases.\nThe study found that the median time between an SMS deal coming through and consumers making a purchase is two hours or less. For SMS coupons with a discount but no shipping or initial price point incentive, the median purchasing time is also two hours or less. If the SMS offer gives consumers more time (a week or more) to do the purchase, however, the average buying time is 11 days.\nFor offers that include free shipping or low initial price points, buyers make purchases at even faster speeds. Such offers typically come with a three-day expiration date. For offers that are for limited supplies of popular products, the SMS coupon's average buying time goes down even further. The offers are used and purchased within three days at the median, according to the study.\nOne thing we learned: The right time is very close to the offer but not necessarily right as you see it. What this tells us is that if you're offering a free-shipping deal, the offer should come right after the consumer makes the purchase, and if you're offering a small discount price point on a product, it should come in two hours or less. The offers need to be very close to the consumers' purchases.\nIf an ad includes free shipping and the order needs to be placed within the next two days, the ad has a high success rate. This is because consumers are more likely to make small purchases and do so under time pressure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially on their cell phones.", "In 2011, The New York Times (NYT) launched a new\nseries aimed at the highly-engaged, but spasmodically-devoted\nreaders to attract and engage them more deeply.

The engagement survey findings were a good indication\nthat there needed to be an increase in the frequency and nature\nof the type of content the NYT was producing to meet the needs of\nthe more actively news-consuming demographic of readers.\nThe NYT newsroom, therefore, began to look at its content as it\nwas produced and edited on the day and the prior days for\npotential engagement opportunities for its active readers.\nThe newsroom editorial conference meetings, which take place in\nthe evening every day, began to look beyond the most-read\nheadlines and most-read listicles (and other types of stories)\nin order to consider other stories that were engaging the more\nactive readers, and that had a high likelihood of generating a\nsizable comment stream.\nNewsroom editors began to search for stories that would provide\na way in to more deeply engage them, either with stories that\ncould be followed in more depth, or others that opened up new\nways in which the NYT could engage them through its content.\nThe newsroom meeting editorial agenda was to look at stories that\ntook the reader to places they'd never been; to places and ideas\nthey were likely to have never encountered before or even\nthought about before.  An engagement editor had been hired with\nthe mandate of supporting the newsroom in increasing the amount of\nsuch work produced, and in finding ways to make it more readily\naccessible and engaging.\nIn order to provide more engagement opportunities after the\nevening daily news meeting, the new engagement editor introduced\n'Engagemeta' to the weekly edit meeting.  It is a system of\nmetrics devised to track the engagement of different kinds of\nstories:  headlines, listicles and other posts, stories that are more\nop-ed-type in style, stories with polls, stories with infographics\nand data visuals, etc.  These, in turn, become categories\nthrough which stories are monitored and analysed, with the idea\nof producing more content of this type, and to learn how different\nkinds of stories were performing and from which platforms they\nwere most read.\nThis system has been used as a way to track the development of\nthe Engagement team's work from this initial 'pushing/pushing'\napproach.  Headlines in particular have been tracked through to\ntheir 'end-state' on the blog.  Many of the best-performed headlines, for\ninstance, were more infographics/data-based, or 'cute/human interest'\nnews or stories.\nThe NYT has a relatively small number of readers it actively\nengages.

In those days, vampires could mix in London society without fear of a witch-hunter staking them for heresy.  It was not that London was more tolerant than most cities, simply that in the case of vampires it was the best disguise available.\nThe vampire society was like a human society.  There were upper classes composed of more powerful vampires with more powerful minds; there were middle classes of those who had acquired some modest skill that made them capable and valuable; there were lower classes of those who had very little \u2013 or none at all.  London provided an excellent cover for the vampires in society.  So did almost every other large metropolitan area in Europe.\nThe vampire who introduced Brian to a different sort of society \u2013 a different breed of girls \u2013 was named Risa.  She claimed to be half-Russian.  Her eyes were gold and her skin was pale.  Her hair was jet black.  She was a stunner of a gal, and Brian, for his part, made no attempt to deny it.\nBrian had met her in Piccadilly.  He had been wandering, looking for something to do.  There was always so much to do; he rarely had a dull moment these days.  Some girls had approached Brian and he had listened to their stories of starvation and poverty \u2013 all of which was nonsense, but it was what vampire girls liked to tell.  It was about four in the afternoon.  There was no reason to get up early and the nights were long in the winter.  Besides, vampire girls preferred to see someone at night.  It made the experience more magical.  Brian was on his way to a club when he happened to see Risa waiting on the corner.  Her clothing was not as fine as his \u2013 she was in a thick wool coat with fur lined on the sleeves \u2013 but she seemed very attractive.  Risa had beautiful white skin and large gray eyes.  She had her hair up under a black hat that was a simple copy of his dark brown fedora.  On her feet was a pair of black riding boots.  Brian would always remember one moment during their first date.\nIt was night.  The snow was coming down but it was not heavy.  It was a light snow.  They went into a small bistro.  Risa wanted tea and Brian wanted coffee.  They were sitting at the table, sipping tea and coffee when Risa leaned toward Brian, put her hand on his arm and asked, looking somewhat coy, \"Would you like some cake?\"\nBrian took a bite out of a biscous bun.  \"I'm full,\" he said.\nShe put the tea cup aside.  \"Let me.\"  Risa stood and turned around slowly so that Brian got a good view of her body.  Brian began to drink his coffee with some interest.  It had been some time since Brian had a date this long and he began to feel restless.  Brian watched the woman walk behind the bar and lift a teakettle.  She waited at the wall until the water had come up to a dull boil, and then she went over to the bistro and poured the dark water into a tureen.  She then lifted a wooden bowl and scooped it with her right hand.  After setting the bowl back down, she lifted up a small plate and placed a piece of a cake on top of it.  The cake was very warm.  Risa placed the tureen and the bowl back down on the counter and began to walk back to her seat.  Brian, too, began to walk towards her.  Brian placed his coffee on the table and leaned back in the chair.  Risa walked around the table and sat down right behind Brian.  She leaned back in her chair, so Brian was facing her and could look at the side of her leg \u2013 a very appealing leg and quite lovely feet \u2013 in front of her, just like in the pictures she had", "As a result of several key acquisitions and key investments in a range of mobile applications for both new and existing publications, News Corporation is aggressively focusing on mobile technology to give its audience, advertisers and shareholders the latest, cutting-edge interactive mobile capabilities.\nThe News Corporation Group (NYSE: NWS), one of the world\u2019s largest multimedia organizations, is aggressively focusing on mobile technology to give its audience, advertisers and shareholders the latest, cutting-edge interactive mobile capabilities.

We\nhope to provide details in this year's SBPCC handbook.\nResolution 2001-2:  Urges the AEA Executive Board to\npublish regular updates on the status of the International\nConference on Communication and Environment\nCommentary:  The AEA Executive Board asked that these\nissues be considered by the SBPCC as part of a larger,\ninterdisciplinary look at global issues impacting\ninformation and library issues.  This project was\ninstituted by the Secretary/Treasurer as a \"standing\nresolution\" at the January 2000 meeting, and the first\nreport is available by clicking the link at the top of\nthe AEA Home Page.  The second report is tentatively\nscheduled to be available late in July.\nResolution 2001-3:  Urges the AEA Executive Board to\ndevelop a position statement on fair and equitable\ncompensation for library and information professionals.\nCommentary:  The Executive Board asked the AEA to follow\nthe lead of our colleagues and work with the SBPCC on\nthis matter.  One possible action would be the creation\nof a special committee to evaluate trends, research,\nanalysis and other data as it pertains to the\nprofessional salaries of AEA members.\nResolution 2001-4:  Urges the AEA Executive Board to\nsupport the revision of the ALA Statement on Intellectual\nFreedom to include a section on freedom of access to\ninformation technology.\nCommentary:  As you can read in the January 2000\nreport (above), the AEA Board is very much interested in\nthis matter.  The Executive Board asked the AEA to follow\nthe lead of its sister organizations and work with the\nSBPCC on this.  One possible action would be the creation\nResolution 2001-5:  Urges the AEA Executive Board to\nwork with the library section organizations and\nconstituencies within the ALA to ensure the accuracy of\nthe national occupational classifications to ensure\nacceptance of the library sciences field as a distinct\noccupational group.\nCommentary:  The AEA Board recognizes the work done by\nthe ALA on this matter and will use the same method as\nused by our sister organizations.  We plan to work\nwith the American Library Association Committee on\nPersonnel Statistical Standards.  Library science will\nbe part of the discussion by this committee (along with\nlibrarian, archivist, etc.).  The Executive Board\nacknowledges that this will be a long-term project.\nResolution 2001-6:  Urges the AEA Executive Board to\nmake an official position statement to the state boards\nof education, legislators, university faculty and\nteachers colleges in opposition to the proposed\nelimination of the professional librarian licensure title\nCommentary:  This resolution was passed 79 to 7.  The\nAEA", "The Commission will hold a meeting at the FCC, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC Conference Room TW-C305, on Thursday, February 21, 2008, starting at 9:00 a.m.\n2: The Commission will consider a Report and Order and a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, DA 07-3136, adopted on November 23, 2007. This item pertains to media ownership; the Order will reduce the public interest obligations of commercial dual network radio licensees in small markets and establish a rebuttable presumption for market areas that have six or more commercial and noncommercial fullpower broadcast stations. The Further Notice seeks comment on a number of issues relating to the proposed presumption.\n3: The Commission's Media Bureau will discuss rules pertaining to a number of issues arising under the commercial broadcast television license renewal procedure. The event will be streamed live over the Internet.", "One small town newspaper  has discovered a new way\nto engage the  online audience.  Its solution:  keep the focus\non local and personal information.\n\"The focus of the paper is local news, with information about\npeople and businesses that helps to create a sense of local\ncommunity,\" said  Jeff Smith,  executive vice-president of\nHillcrest Media  a company  that owns 15 weeklies, one\ndaily and a 24-hour cable station in  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,\nKansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\nSmith explained  that it makes no sense to create a website\nand have nothing on it in order to have  a website that gets\n1000 visits per day  (the average for their newspapers).  One\nway that  makes sense  is to create a news blog.\nThat is what  the Kahoka,  Missouri  news  blog  has become.\nSmith  said  that  in order to increase readership on the\nnewspaper's web  site, it  created a second online home for its\nlocal  news.  In its online news  section, the  paper can add\nnew material to its website every  day  in the form of a news\nstory or blog entry.  And it can do it almost instantly.\"\nOne of the keys to the  blog's  success  has been the\npartnership with local schools that provide  the paper class\nmaterials to encourage the use of its  site..  90% of the\nresponses on the  site can be seen as the site's main page\nwhere the reader scrolls down to view past stories.  In an\ninterview with the  webmaster of the site,  it has  been found\nthat 25% of the traffic comes from Google searches.  Another 5\nto 15% come from social media sites  like Facebook.\"  An\nimpressive  amount,  if  you  consider that  these are local\npeople from the town making these searches.\nThe  results have been good and they are in part due to\npeople in the community supporting the effort and using the\nlocal blog as their first stop for local news.  An impressive\nnumber  of  the  blog's  local site visitors have  been\nactively using the  local blog's comments section to  speak out\non local events.\nAs a  testament to how successful the blog has become, it\nhas  been  featured  in  a number of national publications,  as\nwell as a number of blogs.   Smith said  that even when the\npaper was  featured in national publications, it did not get\nthe impact  of local.  Local writers, local issues and a local\nvoice all go  together to create an online newspaper  that is\na destination website  that people want to visit.\nBecause the  local blog is the first place  in which the town\nsees its news, this helps create a sense  of community and local\nsolidarity among those who have access to the online blog.\"\nWith the blog succeeding at creating the buzz among the\npeople of the small town, readers visit the site in an effort\nto connect to this  online community.  They respond to the\narticles  and  in order to create a conversation  and feel  a\npart of a \"neighborhood blog\", the blog moderates comments to\na certain extent.  However,  this keeps the  comments\nrepresentative  of the town.  Also, the use of  the comments\nis still relatively low.\nSmith said  that  for a town to be successful  with this\ntype of news, it must be an extension of the paper.  However,\neach  local site should have  its own blogger to make it most\ninformative for the community.  The biggest challenge is  \"to\nkeep them  updating on a regular basis.\" Because of the low\ninvolvement of the community, creating a strong online presence\nis the first challenge, especially in a small town.\nFor this small town  to do this, the first step was to make\na change  in the paper's outlook.  The decision was  made to be\nthe news source for the community,  where people will go  to\nfind local news and to speak  their mind in the comments\nsection.  The  local blogs must speak to the town the way that\nthe town wants to speak  about those things  it wants more of\nand those that it does not.\"\nAfter  seeing  this town's blog and its success, there is", "In 2011, The Times of India\u2019s Mumbai edition developed a proprietary \u201creal-time\u201d pricing strategy for its print and digital editions, setting 50 percent of its cover price for each unit, then charging 40 percent less than that based on the time since cover\u2019s issuance. This pricing strategy has increased The Times of India\u2019s subscriptions and revenues by more than $500,000.\nThe Times of India sells more than 3 million copies every day. One of India\u2019s largest media companies, the publication has more than a dozen editions in India\u2019s cities, reaching every one of India\u2019s 1.23 billion people who read a print newspaper every month.\n\u201cPrint editions and digital editions were not always separate revenue lines,\u201d said Nitin Mantri, chief revenue officer at Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd., which publishes The Times of India in 12 major cities. The company had developed a proprietary pricing strategy that it applied to its digital editions, a Times of India Mobile app, and a digital version of a Times of India newspaper, according to the Times of India, called The Times of India iPad Edition.\nDespite some industry attention to \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d and the value of \u201cthe power of one\u201d pricing, The Times of India developed and employed its own strategy, that of \u201creal-time pricing.\u201d\nIt has seen 1,277.33 percent revenue growth from its digital subscriptions this year, from the day it launched its iPad app in October 2010 to June 2011. From its inception, digital subscriptions have been only about 1 percent of total revenue.\nBut in the two years since The Times of India iPad edition was launched, digital subscriptions have risen rapidly.\nIn 2011, that percentage increased to 4.07 percent, and according to Mantri, who spoke at a SIIA event held by the Online Publishers Association, the number will grow. Mantri told the audience at the OPA event that it expects digital subscriptions to be as much as 20 percent of revenue by the end of 2014.\nThe Times of India is also seeing revenue growth via its Times of India Mobile app, a free mobile application that provides mobile users access to news content from the newspaper. The app is available on both the Apple and Android platforms, and has already garnered 3.4 million downloads.\nIn its mobile app, The Times of India employs an exclusive pricing strategy that aims to build a user base as a digital product, much the way that it aims to grow its subscriber base in print.\nWhile this strategy was employed to build a mobile subscriber base, it was also applied to The Times of India iPad edition.\nPricing strategy: Setting prices that increase print subscription sales\nIt has set 50 percent of the print edition\u2019s cover price as its price for a digital copy of that edition.\nBut then, it allows users to get a further price discount.\nThe Times of India\u2019s pricing strategy has a variable rate discount program, the \u201creal-time\u201d pricing strategy.\nThe strategy: Setting half of the cover price for each unit, then 40 percent less for each unit, based on the time since cover\u2019s issuance.\nThe strategy dictates that 50 percent of the publication\u2019s cover price is its published price for each unit.\nThen, users get 40 percent less than that because the unit price gets discounted at 40 percent based on the time since cover\u2019s issuance.\nTherefore, with the use of this dynamic pricing strategy, there is a constant change in prices, from the day of cover\u2019s issuance.\n\u201cThis is a first in India. We have never seen any publication go through a such pricing strategy ever before,\u201d Mantri said.\nThe \u201creal-time\u201d pricing strategy is a \u201cdynamic pricing strategy,\u201d not the same kind of algorithmic \u201creal-time\u201d pricing strategy used by Amazon and most major e-commerce retailers to adjust sales prices.\nMantri said that The Times of India has employed the strategy and has seen its print business revenues grow by 10,000-15,000 percent when it employs the dynamic pricing strategy.\nAccording to Mantri, with its 50 percent pricing and \u201creal-time\u201d pricing, The Times of India will see a revenue growth of over 500 percent.\nIts \u201creal-time\u201d pricing strategy applies to all of", "This is the first study to show that the ability to pay is not driving usage and revenue. The data shows people want a range of experiences with their products and brands, and that they are willing to pay to have them. This has massive implications for publishers that are trying to monetise both experiences and products.\nMobile and Connected Video: How People's Feelings Drive Engagement\nMobile Marketer | 22 Nov 2017\nBoth video and mobile usage are at all-time highs, and will continue to grow.\nThat means marketers face important questions around the types of experiences they want people to share in order to keep people engaged.\nHow do you make sure that the ads you show people fit in with the experience you are offering them?\nIn this research project we went into detail on the types of products people want to participate in, and how this influences their consumption behaviors. We looked at people in 15 different markets, and how they use connected TV, smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers to consume video.\nWe worked with researchers from the Really Useful Group to give us high-quality insight through research in the UK and across Europe.\nPeople's motivations around their consumption behavior are shaped by a range of cultural and behavioral factors, and these things can change over time.\nOur research found that two of the most common motivations for engaging with connected TV are relaxation and stress-relief, with 71 per cent of young adults citing this. This is followed by distraction (46 per cent) and escapism (36 per cent).\nWe also looked at people's motivations around their consumption behavior to determine trends across all geographies we researched, rather than on the motivations of individual markets.\nThree key motivations across markets and devices emerged as follows:\n\u2022 55 per cent of people cited relaxation as a motivation for TV content\n\u2022 33 per cent cited distraction\n\u2022 23 per cent cited escapism\nWhile these motivations are consistent across all 15 markets we investigated, the motivations people cite when consuming mobile devices and tablets or the internet varied from market to market.\nAcross the six consumer markets, distraction was the most common motivation for mobile content.\nIn contrast, the top two digital motivations for all digital markets were entertainment and education.\nOur findings show that some of the behaviors we see online at home move to the smartphone.\nThis is the first study to show that the ability to pay is not driving usage and revenue. The data shows people want a range of experiences with their products and brands, and they are willing to pay for some of them.

One of the aircraft had been unable to take off, so Pilot Officer Liddle Bader was to fly with F/S Charles Brown, who had recently arrived from 6SFTS, West Freugh. They took off, as planned, although the wind was against them. It was an arduous trip to drop their load of High-Explosive, Incendiary and Lead Bombs.\nAfter reaching altitude, the wind had dropped and it was decided to turn for base. The decision was most unwise, for the aircraft was caught in a severe downdraft, causing the nose to fall well below a safe angle. The pilot turned so the wind was over the tail, hoping it would then drop, but this was not to be; the aircraft flew into and through clouds, at a relatively slow speed. The crew found themselves very vulnerable - 10,000 feet - being blinded, and the aircraft falling. Bader attempted to gain height but to no avail. The cloud broke and they found they were just one mile from the ground.\nB Flight had already turned back because they had realised that their leader, Bader was no longer with them. To have continued on at any higher altitude could have been potentially fatal for all aboard the aircraft. They were in their own personal hell on Earth, as the aircraft, now going more slowly, fell out of control like an eagle in distress. Brown's experience and calmness helped the pilot control the aircraft, hoping that, by lowering the nose, enough speed would be regained to level up, but it was not to be. At 400 feet, F/S Robert Wiley, the Navigator, was to make his last communication: A red light above their head went on, indicating that their oxygen equipment required renewing. 'We are in trouble.' Bader radioed. Then, a final message: 'Let us know how long we have'. The crew knew they were in trouble, now at 300 feet, still falling, and their time had come. It is uncertain whether the aircraft came into the ground or was shot down, but the crew certainly hit it hard. The rear-gunner, Sergeant E. M. Elias, was hit in the stomach; Pilot Officer George 'Sailor' Gorman, nose-gunner, had landed at the side of one of the airfields of a neighbouring station, but had been hit. Sergeant S. Henshall survived, only to be held prisoner of war until 1945. The bodies of Navigator Wiley and Bomb-aimer Brown were never found; both had been killed.\nAn investigation followed, with Lieutenant Arthur Thomas, flying an aircraft of another Squadron, and Pilot Officer J. A. 'Jack' Hunt, in Sergeant Gorman's aircraft, and also Sergeant Gorman, reporting the aircraft to his Squadron as having spun in, and making a successful landing. It was also later reported that the crew believed the pilot did his job very well. It was thought unlikely that Sergeant Hunt would also be telling tales, but this possibility was also investigated. At one stage he had allegedly flown a formation of aircraft back to East Kirkby, and although, on the surface, evidence of a midair collision was obtained, it lacked sufficient clarity. No one was willing to believe that 46 Squadron had been guilty of flying a defective aircraft, and the findings agreed this was not the case. The truth, however, lay in the fact that Sergeant Hunt had told the crew as they landed, that they had come down too low to return to the base; the truth was the same for Sergeant Gorman, who said he had crash-landed a few hundred yards away from the base after being hit, the aircraft coming down in the area which was known as 'Tall Trees', and the crew then, according to the Sergeant, having reported the loss.\nWing Commander Bromwich, Flight Commander of the Squadron, knew that, from the evidence that he and the other Pilots had heard, it would be highly unlikely that any of the aircraft would stay aloft long enough to have reached the position where the two aircraft were reported to have disappeared from 1944. He also suspected that, if an aircraft had landed, it may not have been in a position where anyone would hear the crash or would dare to go out to the 'danger area'. These suspicions proved to", "A local paper in Ohio's Mahoning Valley offers a behind- the scenes look at local broadcast meteorologists as they prepare for Hurricane Sandy.

The regulation requires entry information with respect to the covered foods, unless otherwise exempt under the regulation. Entry information includes (1) declaration of the food for entry, (2) declaration of value of the good, and (3) documentation (e.g., certification by a qualified individual). The declarations of value apply to all goods imported by individuals. When entry information is not exempted from coverage under the regulation, the declaration of value would serve as the customs entry. The declaration of value would be reported to Customs at the time of entry, and would be based on the market value and/or replacement value of the covered food. The declaration by a qualified individual would be based on the value of the product as declared by the person making the declaration. The value declaration would not serve as the only basis for establishing whether entry information was properly submitted. The declaration by a qualified individual would serve as the only basis for establishing whether entry information was properly submitted. As an alternative to declarations by others, importers may submit entry information directly to Customs, and in those situations, the declarant will be the importer. The covered foods that trigger an entry requirement under the regulation are limited to foods where the individual is personally involved in importing the food and the imported goods are used for personal consumption or are used for trade. The regulation also establishes a waiver from coverage under the regulation for imports that are not for personal consumption and are imported for wholesale, retail, or other bulk sale.\nCertain classes of foods would not be covered by the regulation, pursuant to the regulation's exemption provisions. In lieu of declaration of value, exempted entry information includes declarations of information that is readily observable, i.e., information that can be observed by sight or measured by physical means by any person. The exemption covers declarations of information that will be readily observable based on the nature of the imported good, such as information on the net weight of baked goods, meat or poultry, or pesticide residues. The regulation's exemption provisions provide a framework for determining whether the requirements for covered food shall apply. Foods that would be exempt from coverage under the regulation include foods where the individual either makes a reasonable effort to declare entry information about the value, market value, or the replacement value or has not made a reasonable effort to declare entry information about the value, market value, or the replacement value.\nThe regulation establishes a framework of penalties for failing to comply with the entry requirements. The regulation sets forth maximum civil penalties for a person who import covered food in violation of applicable law. The regulation provides that the penalties will be collected as customs duties and will generally be assessed against the violator. USDA would be directed to use the moneys received as civil penalties to further the purposes of the regulation or pay certain obligations incurred by the United States Government.\nDATES: The regulated community is required to comply with the regulation's requirements by October 31, 2004.\nADDRESSES: Comments and related material, if any, should be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 6010 Executive Boulevard, Room 100, Rockville, MD 20854. To assure consideration, comments and related material must be received by October 31, 2004.\nThe Division of Policy Development at AHRQ is interested in clarifying the definition of qualified individual under 441.702. The definition of qualified individual is intended to include individuals who are knowledgeable about agricultural products and/or processed foods and/or the value of such imported goods. The regulations are designed with regard to those persons who handle the imported goods. For that reason, the regulation is limited to those knowledgeable about the subject and not those who merely import the goods. Comments on such interpretation as well as comments on other aspects of the regulation should be submitted to the Division of Policy Development at AHRQ by October 31, 2004.\nComments or suggestions by individuals and organizations not affiliated with AHRQ are most helpful if they include specific suggestions about", "The United States will no longer accept a two-state solution for the state of\nPalestine and will instead work towards an enduring\nsolution in which the borders revert to their pre-\nIsrael-Palestine borders, where all the Israelis and\nPalestinians are moved into the Gaza Strip and\nWest Bank.\nThe United States officially recognized the Gaza Strip,\nthe West Bank, and east Jerusalem in 1979, during the time of Gerald Ford.\nWhile Israelis and Palestinians were living in relative peace in a small part\nof the city, war broke out in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which is why the\nUnited States split the state by today's borders. Now as a peace settlement the\nUnited States will help Israel and Palestine create an enduring solution to their\npeace talks, the United States recognizes the two-state solution but will\ninstead work towards an enduring solution.\nThe State Department made a statement in the Middle East\nPress Briefing Room from the United States Department of State that stated:\n\"The two-state solution and dividing the Gaza Strip into two parts, the\nWest Bank and east Jerusalem into two parts. This is no longer working for\nour country of Palestine and Israel. We will be working towards an enduring\nsolution where the borders will revert back towards their pre-1948 boundaries.\"\nAlan B. Hamlet, Undersecretary of State for International Affairs, went on to\nfurther explain, \"the United States will move Israeli's that are living in the\nGaza Strip and the West Bank to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank so the two state\nsolution is more permanent and more stable at least until we're done. For the\nPalestinians and Israeli's that were living east of Gaza they will be moved to the\nGaza Strip, and they already control a very large portion of the Gaza Strip.

But that is not necessarily the case with every type of CPG market, and other data suggest a shift to online advertising.\nAd Age\u2019s \u201cHow 15 Big Brands Are Spending Ad Dollars\u201d study released in June reported that the majority of the 15 top CPG categories ranked at that time had ad dollars going to newspapers and magazines. Of the 11 brands that said they planned to shift at least part of their advertising from newspapers to online channels, they identified three as making moves into online video, one as shifting into streaming radio and seven as buying more social.\nBut what about smaller brands \u2014 the ones that are not large enough to be trackinged in Ad Age\u2019s study? Do these brands even have advertising budgets \u2014 or rather, do they even need advertising budgets, since they simply market to a smaller regional market to begin with? And if these smaller brands do have advertising budgets, how are they shifting those dollars from the more traditional media outlets they have traditionally relied on to online ones?\nWhen you look under the hood of these smaller brands you realize there is not one single answer to these questions. Instead, your approach and goals can influence which marketing channel you choose, based on data collected by the likes of Digital News and Ipsos.\nA recent study from Digital News Group titled \u201c2014 Digital Revenue Study: CPG Brand Managers\u2019 Advertising Plans for 2014\u201d sheds light on what CPG brand managers think about different media options as well as how different market situations and categories influence their choices. In terms of media planning, of the four CPG categories surveyed (household and personal care cleansers, laundry and dishwashing liquids, and health/fitness bars) \u2014 the majority of respondents from CPG brands who ranked themselves between the middle size bracket and enterprise in this category plan to use more print and online video advertising, and spend less on radio. In terms of size of ad budget, the majority in the middle category plan to spend over $51.0 million in 2014.\nThe majority of \u201cbrand managers\u201d in the middle size bracket feel that they have done well on Facebook, but not on other social channels. In fact, Facebook is the only social channel in which 25% or more of brand managers say they have seen \u201csignificant improvements\u201d in ROI in 2013 vs. 2012. Google Adwords was rated as the most consistent channel in terms of ROI improvement in 2013 vs. 2012. A consistent performer, on the other side of the spectrum is direct mail with 77% of brand managers rating the channel as a \u201cgood investment.\u201d\nEven though the majority of brands responding are in personal care, household cleaners, or health/fitness segments, brands within those categories plan to shift more advertising dollars toward online video and streaming radio, and away from print publications.\nSource: DigitalNews\u2019 2014 Digital Revenue Study.\nIt is important to note that among those brands who identify themselves as \u201csmall start-ups,\u201d their decision to go digital over traditional is driven by a business plan based on a specific target market. The respondents\u2019 goals and marketplace needs in terms of customer acquisition appear to be better suited to online marketing than offline, and the majority of these smaller brands do not plan to advertise in print.\nIn fact, according to Ipsos\u2019 \u201cAdvertising Outlook: 2014-2024\u201d report, 82% of brands plan to shift marketing dollars toward digital channels. This also aligns with the study by Digital News Group about which media channels brands are using to market. In 2013, online video\u2019s share of overall video advertising budgets increased from 10% to 20% \u2014 and it may reach 25% by 2015. Also noteworthy, online video has the largest share of the market in smaller media buys than in larger media buys. This indicates that companies are willing to experiment more in online video formats as their overall ad budgets grow.\nAs the market matures, and smaller brands move toward more sophisticated marketing techniques, we are likely to see more direct-to-consumer brands opting to shift ad dollars from print to online video.\nBENEFITS OF INTEGRATING OFFLINE & ONLINE,", "The Commission is granting a request for temporary waiver of the Commission's political file recordkeeping requirements in connection with a political communications coordinated by an organization known as the Independent Women's Voice. The Commission finds that the waiver, which was granted to two broadcast licensees in 2008, should be extended to the present broadcasters, subject to certain changes and additional conditions. The Commission also grants a request to be treated under the Rate Regulation Telecommunications Act of 1995.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kymberly A. Haley, Associate Bureau Chief, Investigations Group, 202-418-2470, Kymberly.Haley@fcc.gov.\nOn March 25, 2013, the Commission issued a Report and Order (R&O) in this proceeding (Majority and Minority Memos, March 25, 2013, MB Docket Nos. 12-83 and 12-84, released March 25, 2013). In the R&O, the Commission found that four broadcast licensees, Cumulus Media Holdings Inc., Citadel Communications Holdings LLC or its affiliates, Clear Channel Communications Inc., or its affiliate ABC Television Network, Inc., and Tribune Co. or its affiliate Tribune Broadcasting Inc., jointly incurred expenses in connection with radio public service announcements that promoted the candidates and policies of the Republican Party (R&O, at 2-3). However, the four broadcasters maintained, and still maintain, that they did not participate or provide any substantial assistance in any manner in these communications.\nIn the R&O, the Commission noted that the Commission's rules are not designed to, or otherwise intended to, discourage communications regarding political issues or candidates' positions that meet certain standards set forth in the Commission's regulations.1 Further, the Commission found that the substantial assistance criteria are too restrictive for political communications (R&O, at 3). In light of these finding, the Commission granted the four broadcasters certain waivers of recordkeeping requirements under its regulations pertaining to political communications from political or issue ads in all stations owned or operated by the broadcasters, but made clear those waivers had a definite end date (i.e., the November 2012 election) and did not in any way seek to waive the overall electioneering communication ban for the remaining duration of the broadcast license renewal term (R&O, at 3-4).2\nIn the R&O, the Commission also found that the broadcasters had violated the Commission's recordkeeping requirements associated with political files, and thus imposed certain civil penalties on the broadcasters (R&O, at 4-5).\nThe Commission received an application (app.) from two of the broadcasters seeking, on a temporary basis, to waive the Commission's political file recordkeeping requirements (March 25, 2013 Waiver Letter, Citadel, Cumulus, KFGX, at p.1; and Waiver Letters, 2008 Order, Cumulus, Citadel, Clear Channel, KFGX, at pp. 6, 14). Subsequent to the Commission's issuance of the Waiver Letters from the Commission, the other broadcaster (Citadel) obtained approval from the Office of the General Counsel to file the two broadcasters' joint application, as well as to file a separate application for itself. In this application, Citadel seeks the same waivers for itself as it seeks on behalf of Cumulus Media Holdings Inc., Citadel Broadcasting Corporation d/b/a ABC 7 Chicago, Clear Channel Media and Entertainment and KFGX 980 Radio Network, Incorporated (MB Docket Nos. 13-129 and 13-130; joint app. of ABC 7 Chicago, Citadel Communications Inc., Clear Channel Holdings Inc., and KFGX).\nThe two broadcasters originally filed their app. in the KFGX proceeding, which is the only docket in which the Commission's ruling could be rendered in the wake of its March 25,\n1See 47 U.S.C. 315; 47 C.F.R. 4.1", "Pending before the Court is Defendant-Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.

(Cox Tampa Bay), licensee of\ntelevision broadcast stations in the Tampa Bay area of Florida,  by Broadcasting of Tampa,\nInc.  (Broadcasting of Tampa), licensee of a broadcast  television station that also broadcasts\nprogramming  in the Tampa Bay area, is not likely to  cause one or more of the remaining\naffiliated radio stations  of Broadcasting of Tampa to  be market dominant.  The  Commission\naffirms  an Administrative  Law Judge\u2019s conclusion  that the acquisition of radio  broadcasting\nstations of  Sunbelt, Inc. (Sunbelt), licensee  of a number of  radio broadcasting  stations in\nthe Tampa Bay,  Clearwater, and  St. Petersburg  areas of Florida, by Cox Broadcasting  License\nCorporation (Cox Broadcasting), licensee  of radio broadcasting  stations in other  geographic\nareas, is not likely to  cause the  remaining Sunbelt radio  broadcasting stations to  be\nmarket  dominant.  The  Commission  denies  Sunbelt\u2019s   request  that  it  be  permitted  to\nparticipate in the licensing  of television broadcasting  stations,  which are co-owned  with\nits radio broadcasting  stations, because of the  Commission\u2019s earlier  decision  that a\nprior  applicant\u2019s  licensing  applications  must  be  considered  in light  of  the  Commission\npolicy expressed  in a 1961 Memorandum Opinion and     Order (Order)  denying  such\napplications.

The cat was rescued by the Alberta SPCA from a house where there were 25 cats and, during transport to the local shelter, experienced convulsions and fell to the ground in seizures after being handled. The cat had a history of respiratory distress when incarcerated or exposed to stressors prior to rescue. On admission there was an obvious, large, protruding occiput with a moderate degree of deformity secondary to a depressed skull. Intravenous fluids were administered for 2 days, until the cat could take solid food after which the cat was allowed to recover from its ordeal under the watchful eye of the owners, who provided a quiet and controlled environment. After being released, the cat remained healthy with no sequelae.\nINTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury is a clinical problem not uncommon in domestic animals (Hall et al 1985, Riley et al 2000, Brennan et al 2005), and seizures are a common neurological manifestation of this condition in dogs (Behrendt et al 2007, Brennan et al 2007). One third of all trauma fatalities among humans are due to head injury (Klaassen et al 2001, Brennan et al 2005). The incidence of epilepsy in the large domestic animal species has been estimated at 4% in dogs, and the rate of seizures per animal is as high as 5, but averages 1 or 2 per 10,000 per year (Reijerkerk et al 1991, Brennan et al 2007). The reported natural history of epilepsy in cats suggests that 95% of the feline cases have benign epilepsy syndrome (Brennan et al 2007). In contrast to dogs, cats with focal epilepsy (a type of seizure originating in a localized area of brain tissue) have an unfavourable outcome, with 87% of cats with intractable seizures being euthanized within 24 months of diagnosis, and 91% being euthanized within 5 years (Brennan et al 2005). In humans, epilepsy is estimated to affect 1% to 5% of the population worldwide (Nesby 2003) with the prevalence being 2% to 5% in developed countries and 3 to 5% in underdeveloped areas (Klaassen et al 2001, Gouriecola-Zarate et al 2001, Brennan et al 2005).\nMETHODS: 6-month-old female intact Norwegian Forest cat (domestic white cat) was presented for a 12+ hour-long episode of generalized seizures. Secondary to traumatic head injury, there was a depressed occiput (an obvious, large, protruding occiput with a moderate degree of deformity secondary to a depressed skull) and a small laceration to a peripheral vein on the occiput. The cat presented for care after being rescued by the Alberta SPCA from a house where there were 25 cats in 2008. Prior to rescue, the cat spent long periods of time in her mother's uterus. The household was a hoarding situation. The majority of the cats were feral. During transport to the shelter, the cat experienced convulsions and fell to the ground in seizures after being handled. The local family who had cared for the cat claimed that the cat never had any health problems prior to her capture and there was no mention of a seizure disorder. Although there had been some minor history of respiratory distress, the caregiver did not mention seizures occurring in the cat. As stated by the local family, this cat was \"very skittish\" and nervous around other cats, or people handling the cat and was frightened easily. At the local shelter, the cat was housed in a cage in the veterinary room, where she had access to food and water, but the animal was not handled.", "This is a summary of a news release issued by NASA on July 1,\n1997.

Her funeral ceremony passed uneventfully, but two days later the woman was observed emerging from her grave and entering the local church. She appeared in perfect health, except that her dress was torn and dirty. Several days later, she was discovered collapsed by the side of the road, having apparently fainted.\nFollowing this incident, the dead woman was admitted to the local hospital. At first she refused to stay long enough to be treated, but eventually she complied. During this time, she remained silent, her face expressionless and unrevealing. At the end of the week's stay, it was proposed that she would be released as soon as she was able to resume her normal daily routine.\nAs a favor to a friend of a friend, a young student-medical intern was summoned to the emergency room and assigned to assist in her care. This was his first visit to the hospital, and he was curious. He would have no difficulty following her instructions, but he was puzzled by the woman's silence and failure to even nod when asked if there was anything she wanted.

At a conference held Sept 16 & 17, the focus was on the evolution of news publishing business models and how publishers are tackling the threat of disruption. With insights from the biggest publishers across Europe, the event offered attendees an opportunity to better benchmark their organisations against leading industry players and gain insight into innovative best practices around optimising revenues and attracting talent.\nIAB Europe\u2019s Publisher Labs, a programme dedicated to helping European publishers to grow by empowering them to experiment with new services, formats and strategies, hosted its first European Publisher Forum: Transforming business models and driving audience engagement, on Sept 16 & 17 in Brussels.\nThe event, which brought together a range of senior publisher executives from across Europe, aimed to highlight best practices and enable publishers to benchmark their organisations against leading European industry players to help drive growth in an age of disruption.\nThe conference opened with Sara Holmberg, IAB Europe\u2019s Vice President Corporate Partnerships and Senior Consultant Publisher Labs, who discussed the evolution of news publishing business models, the need to evolve and how European publishers need to respond to the threats they face from the tech giants and social media.\nIncreasing audience engagement: News publishers are well-placed to evolve their businesses to be more consumer-centric. But, with new players coming into advertising, like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, publishers must continue to experiment and strive to build on the trust they have with their audience.\nStrategising for growth: In response to questions from the audience, Holmberg shared insights from IAB Europe\u2019s \u201cEuropean Media & Technology Outlook: 2017-2020\u201dreport, which highlighted the importance of optimising for mobile and video to achieve continued growth.\nKeynote: Eye-widening: In a keynote speech based on her latest book, \u201cThunder & Lightning: The Challenges Facing the News Media in the Age of Disruption,\u201d veteran publishing executive and leading industry consultant Monica Kaltenbronn explained how and why news publishers should focus on their unique point of difference and the importance of creating a great customer experience.\nKaltenbronn advised publishers to invest in their people so that organisations can attract and retain top talent and to consider ways of creating a sense of social belonging. She also highlighted three business-model archetypes that can help publishers to understand what they need to do to succeed. In a panel discussion to conclude the conference, Kaltenbronn shared insights into how publishers can drive audience engagement and improve loyalty.\nPublisher insights: At the event attended by the leading independent and media organisations across Europe and North America, the event featured eight case study presentations from publishers that showcased how they are experimenting with news formats and innovation and driving new revenue streams from audience engagement.\nAttendees represented a broad spectrum of Europe\u2019s most iconic publishers, including Axel Springer, Corriere della Sera, Hearst-Argosy, Le Figaro, The Guardian, and The Telegraph.\nKarel-Jan Maes, Managing Director, Axel Springer International, which was involved in a joint case study presentation with Samsung about its AI News app, explained the motivation behind the collaboration with Samsung: \u201cThere is a clear correlation between digital technology, digital marketing and the future of news. The smartphone has become our go-to device for all matters. We have to acknowledge that not every one of our users cares to read and to get their news online.\u201d\nKimberly Lin, Director of Innovation, Hearst-Argosy, showcased how Hearst-Argosy has built Hearst Newspapers' first original branded multi-media content initiative with SpareFoot, called The New American Dream. Describing the project as \u201ca great example\u201d of how The New York Times can help other organisations to achieve their mission, Lin observed the key challenge to be that the industry is struggling to generate enough high-level sponsorships for video projects: \u201cWhile we know that advertisers are eager to enter the news video space, there is still a shortage of video inventory to fill the need.\u201d\nCindy Muller, Senior VP Global Digital, Meredith Corporation which was involved in a joint case study presentation with Samsung discussing how the company is focusing on digital and mobile"]
