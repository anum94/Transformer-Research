["The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) faces challenges in managing radioactive waste cleanup at its sites, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report found that, due to technical and economic limitations, many sites are unable to be restored to acceptable levels for unrestricted use. The DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for cleanup efforts for legacy waste resulting from nuclear weapons development and research, and the DOE's Office of Legacy Management (LM) manages post-cleanup sites. The GAO report recommends that LM work with EM and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop agreements and procedures for addressing new cleanup work that exceeds the scope of LM's capabilities and resources. The report also suggests that LM develop plans to assess the effects of climate change on its sites and incorporate principles from GAO's Disaster Resilience Framework to ensure the long-term protectiveness of cleanup remedies.", "The Department of State has failed to meet the reporting requirements of Section 653(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which mandates the President to notify Congress within 30 days of any law appropriating funds for foreign assistance. In fiscal years 2015 through 2018, the State Department consistently submitted reports late, with an average delay of 139 days. Although the annual appropriations acts have become more detailed since 1971, the State Department has not adjusted its process to meet the reporting deadline. One reason for the delay is the complex process of reviewing congressional instructions and aligning them with the administration's priorities and country-specific foreign assistance needs. The State Department's system for collecting feedback and incorporating it into the report is also inefficient and prone to errors, which further contributes to the delays. Additionally, staffing gaps within the department have affected the timeliness of the report. The report concludes that the State Department needs to review its process and identify areas that can be streamlined or eliminated, improve its data collection systems, and develop a plan to address staffing vacancies. The Department of State agreed with the recommendations in the report.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) may enter into Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSAs) with authorized countries and international organizations for the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, and services. DOD has signed 125 ACSAs as of February 2020, many of which were established during wartime, training exercises, and contingency operations. The agreements provide flexibility, enhanced readiness, and increased military effectiveness by allowing partners and allies to access U.S. logistics capabilities. However, there are several weaknesses in the management and implementation of ACSAs. \n\nFirst, DOD failed to provide complete information to Congress about its intent to designate non-NATO countries for ACSAs. Out of the 104 agreements signed with non-NATO countries, DOD did not have documentation of congressional notifications for 26 agreements. \n\nSecond, State did not provide timely notifications to Congress about ACSAs entering into force. Out of the 118 ACSAs that had entered into force, 48 notifications were late, exceeding the 60-day deadline required by law. This was largely due to DOD not providing State with information about new agreements. \n\nThird, DOD lacks quality data to track the status of ACSA orders and has not received full reimbursement for a significant number of orders. In a sample of ACSA orders authorized from October 2013 through March 2018, DOD inaccurately recorded the reimbursement status for 7.3% of orders, and was unable to determine the reimbursement status for 12.2% of orders. \n\nAdditionally, DOD did not process invoices for some ACSA orders, leading to unreimbursed support worth millions of dollars. DOD also lacks a process to monitor and collect unpaid debts related to ACSA orders.\n\nTo address these weaknesses, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) made several recommendations to DOD. These include improving recordkeeping procedures for congressional notifications, updating guidance for providing information to State about new ACSAs, verifying the accuracy of ACSA order statuses recorded in DOD's system of record, reconciling financial data with ACSA records, developing mechanisms to track reimbursement time frames, improving invoicing processes, and implementing a process to monitor and resolve overdue reimbursement orders.\n\nDOD concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and provided information on actions taken to address them. GAO concluded that by implementing these recommendations, DOD can provide more complete information to Congress and improve its oversight and management of ACSAs.", "National internet regimes around the world are becoming increasingly divergent, posing challenges for international trade and the growth of digital economies. This trend has significant implications for the US and its digital trade interests. While the US generally advocates for a free and open internet, countries like China and the EU have their own unique internet governance and data policies, creating trade barriers for US firms. Efforts are underway to establish global rules and standards for digital trade through negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international forums. However, these negotiations face challenges given the divergent positions of countries. Congress has a role to play in shaping US internet policy and positions in trade negotiations, and in ensuring that the US digital economy thrives in the face of evolving national internet regimes.", "This report provides an overview of major trade issues for U.S. agriculture that may be of interest in the second session of the 116th Congress. It covers a range of topics including U.S. agricultural trade with other countries, trade policies pursued by the Trump Administration, ongoing trade policy concerns for U.S. agriculture, and updates on World Trade Organization (WTO) agricultural issues. The report highlights the importance of U.S. agricultural exports, the impact of retaliatory tariffs on agricultural imports, the renegotiation of trade agreements such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the signing of trade agreements with Japan and China, and the potential for trade negotiations with the European Union, India, Kenya, and the United Kingdom. The report also mentions the U.S. trade dispute with China, ongoing trade tensions with the European Union and India, and the implementation of trade assistance programs for farmers affected by foreign trade retaliation. Finally, the report discusses domestic support for U.S. agriculture, particularly in relation to WTO commitments, and explores issues related to sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) in the agricultural sector.", "The federal income tax serves as a key mechanism for reducing poverty in the United States. The tax code includes provisions such as the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the additional child tax credit (ACTC), which increase the disposable income of low-income taxpayers who have children and work. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made changes to the income tax system, which were found to benefit higher-income individuals and families. However, the overall impact of the TCJA on poverty was relatively small compared to the previous income tax system. Recent tax legislation, such as the Economic Mobility Act of 2019, aims to target additional tax benefits to lower-income families. This report analyzes the impact of the income tax on poverty, both pre- and post-TCJA, to inform future policy debates and legislative proposals. It finds that the income tax system reduces poverty rates, particularly among families with children, but has limitations in its ability to lift the poorest families out of poverty.", "The Medicare and Medicaid programs have certain distinctions in their coverage and financing policies. The main differences lie in the fact that Medicare is a national program with coverage policies established at the national level, while Medicaid is a federal-state program that allows states to design their own coverage policies. The programs estimate improper payment amounts and rates through medical reviews conducted by contractors. In fiscal year 2017, insufficient documentation comprised the majority of estimated improper payments in both Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare has seen an increase in insufficient documentation since 2009 due to changes in review criteria, while Medicaid has had stable rates since 2011. Differences in coverage policies and documentation requirements between Medicare and Medicaid likely contribute to the substantial variation in their insufficient documentation rates. Additionally, Medicaid medical reviews do not provide robust information at the state level for developing corrective actions, and there is a risk that medical reviews could interfere with ongoing fraud investigations. It is recommended that CMS institute a process to evaluate and ensure the effectiveness of documentation requirements, improve the robustness of Medicaid medical reviews, and address disincentives for state Medicaid agencies to report providers under fraud investigation.", "CBP has increased its recruitment efforts by establishing a central recruitment office, increasing its participation in recruitment events, and allocating more funds to recruitment. The number of recruitment events and recruitment incentives for CBP officers has also increased significantly. These efforts have resulted in an increase in the number of applications received for law enforcement officer positions. CBP has also made improvements to its hiring process by reducing the time-to-hire and increasing the percentage of applicants that are hired. CBP has implemented various changes to streamline the hiring process, including revising certain steps and using new recruitment strategies. CBP has also hired a contractor to help with recruitment and hiring efforts. CBP faces challenges in retaining law enforcement officers, particularly in hard-to-fill locations. The agency has implemented programs and incentives to address retention challenges, but the use of financial incentives and other payments has been limited. CBP does not have a systematic process for collecting and analyzing data on departing law enforcement officers, which hinders its ability to understand and address retention challenges. However, CBP has developed an exit survey and plans to analyze the results to inform retention efforts.", "A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said the National Biodefense Strategy needs further implementation, as agencies faced problems when trying to establish the core components. Although they face challenges, agencies have deployed several efforts to counter bio-threats, including training exercises and cooperation through information-sharing. The country still faces problems with regard to systems and decision-making, as many systems have not yet been fine-tuned to integrate detection technologies and other surveillance.\n", "The Constitution gives Congress the power to control government spending, and this is done through budget authority. Budget authority is the legal authority given to federal agencies to spend money, and it includes both newly enacted budget authority and unspent balances from previous years. There are two types of spending: discretionary spending and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is subject to annual appropriations and makes up about 30% of federal spending, while mandatory spending is determined by multiyear laws and makes up the other 70%.\n\nSequestration is a budgetary mechanism that requires automatic cuts to programs and activities in order to reduce spending. It was created in 1985 and has been used to enforce various fiscal policy goals. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established discretionary spending caps for the years 2012 to 2021 and also created a Joint Committee to negotiate additional budget savings. If the Joint Committee failed to achieve savings of at least $1.2 trillion by January 15, 2012, automatic spending reductions would be triggered. These reductions were split between discretionary and mandatory spending.\n\nThe calculation of the automatic reductions is complex, but it is done to achieve the required savings. For example, in the defense category, the reductions are apportioned between discretionary and mandatory spending based on the ratio of each type of spending to the total in that category. The same process is followed for the nondefense category. The reductions in discretionary spending are achieved by lowering the spending caps, while the reductions in mandatory spending are achieved through across-the-board cuts.\n\nSequestration has been extended multiple times, and it is now required for each fiscal year through 2029. The amount of savings required for each year depends on the total reduction required over the period from 2013 to 2021. Certain programs and activities are exempt from the sequester, and others have special rules that limit the amount of cuts that can be made. Medicare, for example, is subject to a 2% reduction, while student loans have their origination fees increased.\n\nOverall, sequestration is a mechanism that helps control government spending by automatically reducing budgetary resources. It applies to both discretionary and mandatory spending, but there are exemptions and special rules that limit its impact on certain programs and activities.", "According to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), component agencies reviewed and notified awardees within the required time for 84% of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. However, there were instances where agencies failed to meet the notification requirement for 16% of the awards. Some component agencies consistently met the requirement for all or most of their awards, while others did not. The delays were attributed to factors such as the availability of reviewers, the number of proposals, and agency-specific factors. Additionally, the report found that agencies issued 76% of awards within the recommended time period, while 24% were issued after the recommended time. Delays in award issuance were caused by factors such as the type of contract, the availability of grants and contracting officers, coordination among agency officials, the responsiveness of awardees, and the availability of funding. The GAO recommended that agencies take steps to ensure timely notifications and awards. The Department of Education stated that it has already taken steps to improve its notification process. The SBIR and STTR policy directive specifies that the notification time requirements apply to both phase I and phase II awards, and subsequent phase II awards were not included in the analysis for this report. The report concludes by providing agency-specific data on award timeliness for the fiscal years reviewed.", "Three major hurricanes hit the United States in 2017 and historic wildfires struck California. These disasters collectively affected nearly 15 percent of the country's population. The Stafford Act establishes a process for requesting federal assistance in response to disasters, and FEMA is responsible for coordinating federal disaster response efforts. FEMA issues mission assignments to other federal agencies to support disaster response and recovery efforts. FEMA's contracting workforce plays a key role in post-disaster contracts, but the agency has struggled with workforce shortages. Several challenges were identified in the contracting process, including difficulties in identifying and awarding contracts to local vendors, determining whether vendors reside or primarily do business in the disaster area, justifying the use of non-local vendors, and developing specific requirements for contracts. In addition, there were coordination challenges between federal, state, and local entities during the mission assignment process. The report recommends actions to improve the contracting process, enhance coordination, and address workforce shortages within FEMA.", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is one of the largest civilian employers in the country, employing around 634,000 people in fiscal year 2018. USPS is known for being a leading employer of minorities, women, veterans, and disabled veterans, with roughly one-sixth of its workforce consisting of military members and veterans. The majority of USPS employees are represented by four unions and are divided into \"career\" and \"non-career\" employees.\n\nCareer employees are considered permanent and receive benefits such as health and retirement plans, while non-career employees are temporary and have fewer benefits and lower pay. USPS has implemented several changes in recent years to decrease employee compensation costs. This includes lowering pay for new career employees, increasing the use of non-career employees, and reducing USPS contributions to employee health insurance premiums. These changes have saved USPS billions of dollars in employee compensation costs.\n\nHowever, USPS may have overestimated the cost savings from these changes because they did not consider factors such as work hours and employee tenure in their estimates. Additionally, these changes have raised concerns about recruitment and retention of non-career employees, as well as employee morale.\n\nUSPS could potentially achieve further cost savings by implementing changes to employee work hours, benefits, and pay. For example, reducing delivery frequency from six days a week to five days a week could result in significant cost savings. Additionally, reducing retirement contributions and health insurance premiums could also lead to savings. However, these changes would require legislative action and may have implications for employee morale and the overall viability of USPS.\n\nOverall, USPS has made efforts to manage employee compensation costs, but further changes and legislative reform may be needed for the organization to achieve financial sustainability.", "U.S.-Iran relations have been adversarial since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The U.S. has sought to constrain Iran's nuclear program and limit its purchase of conventional weaponry and development of ballistic missiles. The Trump Administration implemented a \"maximum pressure\" campaign, imposing sanctions to compel Iran to renegotiate the 2015 nuclear agreement (JCPOA). The U.S. withdrawal from the agreement and the reimposition of sanctions led to increased tensions and escalations. Iran has responded by causing unrest and raising concerns about nuclear activities. Key incidents include attacks on Saudi oil facilities, tanker attacks in the Gulf, and the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The U.S. has considered military options against Iran, including operations against Iran's allies or proxies, retaliatory strikes on key targets, a naval blockade, and even invasion. Congress has expressed concern about military action against Iran and has taken steps to prevent unauthorized use of force.\n", "The Food and Nutrition Service at USDA oversees the school meals programs at the federal level, while designated state agencies administer the programs at the state level. Students can be certified for free or reduced-price meals through household applications or direct certification. In addition, schools can apply for community eligibility or use special provisions to provide free meals to all students. USDA and state agencies conduct oversight of the school meals programs, including management evaluations and administrative reviews. USDA estimates improper payments in the programs through its APEC study, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for the programs. USDA has reported various actions to reduce improper payments, though a change in how meal claiming errors are defined resulted in lower reported error rates for fiscal year 2018. GAO recommends that USDA establish a process to plan and conduct regular fraud risk assessments for the school meals programs. USDA generally agreed with the recommendation.\n", "The private health insurance market in the United States is vast and diverse. It consists of various segments, including individual and group health insurance markets. While most private health plans must comply with state and federal health insurance requirements, there are certain coverage arrangements that are exempt from or do not comply with these requirements. These arrangements are divided into two categories: exempted health coverage arrangements and noncompliant health coverage arrangements. \n\nExempted health coverage arrangements include fully insured plans covering fewer than two employees, excepted benefits plans, short-term limited-duration insurance (STLDI) plans, student health insurance coverage, and self-insured nonfederal governmental plans. These arrangements are exempt from compliance with some or all federal health insurance requirements. For example, fully insured plans covering fewer than two employees and excepted benefits plans do not have to comply with any federal health insurance requirements. State regulation of these arrangements varies, with some states imposing additional requirements and others exempting them from state insurance laws.\n\nNoncompliant health coverage arrangements include health care sharing ministries (HCSMs) and health benefits coverage offered by state Farm Bureaus. These arrangements are not explicitly exempted from federal health insurance requirements and may not comply with them. HCSMs are faith-based organizations that facilitate the sharing of medical expenses among members. While they are not considered insurance, the federal government has not provided a clear definition or regulation for HCSMs. State regulation of HCSMs varies, with some states exempting them from insurance laws and others treating them as unauthorized insurers. State Farm Bureaus in certain states can offer health benefits coverage that is not defined as insurance and is exempt from state insurance laws. These arrangements do not necessarily comply with federal health insurance requirements.\n\nIn summary, the private health insurance market in the United States is complex, with various coverage arrangements that may or may not comply with state and federal health insurance requirements.", "Sanctions are tools used by Congress and the President to influence the behavior of foreign governments, individuals, or entities. They can be used in response to a variety of issues, such as human rights abuses or weapons proliferation. Sanctions can take many forms, including trade restrictions, asset blocking, limiting access to the financial system, and denying foreign assistance.\n\nThere are two main types of sanctions: comprehensive and targeted. Comprehensive sanctions involve broad-based trade restrictions against an entire country, such as U.S. sanctions against Iran and Cuba. Targeted sanctions, on the other hand, focus on specific individuals or entities. There are also sectoral sanctions, which target specific sectors of a target's economy, and secondary sanctions, which target third-party actors doing business with the targeted regimes.\n\nThe implementation of sanctions is carried out by agencies such as the Treasury, State, and Commerce. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for implementing sanctions and maintains a list of sanctioned individuals and entities. State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for implementing economic sanctions and coordinating with other agencies. Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is responsible for implementing export controls related to sanctions.\n\nThe effectiveness of sanctions is difficult to assess, but studies have shown that sanctions are more effective when implemented through an international organization or when the target has existing dependency or a relationship with the United States. The economic impact of sanctions is also influenced by factors such as the comprehensiveness or severity of the sanctions.\n\nOverall, sanctions are a complex and widely used tool in U.S. foreign policy, with varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the circumstances.", "Congress provides budget authority to agencies through appropriations acts each fiscal year. When an appropriation expires and a new one is not enacted, a funding gap occurs and the affected agency may lack sufficient budget authority to continue operations. This is known as a government shutdown. During a shutdown, agencies must determine which employees can continue working based on exemptions outlined in the Antideficiency Act (ADA). Employees who perform activities funded with budget authority that remains available despite the lapse in appropriations are considered exempt. Employees who perform activities pursuant to a statutory authority that allows an agency to enter into an obligation in advance of an appropriation or to address emergencies are considered excepted. Funding gaps can occur at the beginning of a fiscal year or any time during the year. The government has experienced six shutdowns in the past 29 years, ranging from 2 days to 35 days. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for providing guidance to agencies on managing a shutdown. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans for use during a shutdown. A review of selected agencies' contingency plans found that some key information elements were either missing or incomplete. The agencies also did not always document potential changes to operations in the event of a prolonged shutdown. In addition, agencies did not consistently include sufficient details about their procedures for resuming program activities. The agencies in our review generally communicated shutdown-related information to employees sufficiently, although some documentation and attention to improving communication methods could be beneficial. Internal controls to track and limit employee physical and virtual workspace access during a shutdown were not always in place. We recommended that the agencies take steps to address these issues.\n", "The United States tracks and records deaths through a multi-step registration process. When an individual dies, a death certificate is filed with the state, which includes demographic information and cause of death. The information is then verified by the local registrar of vital statistics and transferred to the state registrar. The state vital registration office creates an electronic record and submits the death certificate information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n\nIn 2003, the CDC revised the standard death certificate to include a checkbox indicating pregnancy status. However, not all states adopted this revised death certificate until 2019. Due to concerns about the reliability of the pregnancy checkbox, the CDC has not published statistics on maternal mortality in their annual reports since 2007. \n\nThe CDC collects maternal mortality data using two national surveillance systems: the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS). NVSS is the official source of mortality statistics in the US and uses death certificate information to compile data. PMSS is exclusively focused on pregnancy-related deaths and collects additional information, including linking death certificates to birth certificates to confirm pregnancy status. \n\nCurrently, PMSS data is only available at the national and regional level and is subject to confidentiality protections. However, the CDC is taking steps to gain direct access to state vital records, which would improve the timeliness of PMSS data. \n\nThe CDC has also implemented the Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs), which systematically review pregnancy-related deaths and identify opportunities for prevention. These committees collect and review data from various sources to determine preventability and factors contributing to the deaths. The CDC funds MMRCs through cooperative agreements with state agencies and organizations. \n\nAdditionally, the CDC provides funding for other efforts aimed at reducing maternal mortality, such as the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) Initiative and the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant Program. These efforts focus on improving maternal health outcomes and addressing disparities. \n\nOverall, various funding efforts and initiatives are in place at the federal and state levels to track and address maternal mortality in the United States. However, there are ongoing challenges with data quality and reporting, and improvements are being made to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of maternal mortality data.", "The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has been working on a national maritime strategy to address challenges facing the U.S.-flag fleet, including the need for U.S.-flag vessels to remain competitive and the shortage of U.S. citizen mariners. DOT plans to issue the strategy by February 2020. Stakeholders have identified maintaining the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels and the shortage of U.S. citizen mariners as the primary challenges. Options to address these challenges include reducing the costs of operating U.S.-flag vessels and increasing government cargo carried on these vessels. However, DOT and the Maritime Administration have not yet evaluated the feasibility or formally proposed these options. The lack of a national maritime strategy hinders decision-makers' ability to address these challenges effectively.", "Federal agencies have made progress in their efforts to consolidate data centers, but more needs to be done to meet goals. Agencies reported closing a total of 102 data centers in fiscal year 2019 and have plans to close an additional 184 by the end of the year. However, 11 agencies have stated that they will not meet their closure goals for 2019. In addition, 20 agencies have not met cost-savings targets for 2019. Furthermore, agencies have made limited progress in meeting the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) data center optimization targets. Four out of five OMB metrics have not been fully met, and agencies are struggling to implement automated monitoring tools to measure server utilization.\n", "Federal agencies are advised to consider several key factors as their employees reenter the workplace amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous communication with employees and their representatives is crucial, as is the identification of employee concerns and the provision of human capital guidance. It is important for agencies to assess the risk of exposure for employees who must work onsite and to update determinations and monitor risks as conditions evolve. Local conditions should be considered for workforce reentry decisions, and agencies should collaborate with other agencies in the same area. Protection measures should be put in place based on exposure risk level, including changes to the work environment and the provision of personal protective equipment. Social distancing strategies should be implemented, and telework should be maximized where possible. Clear policies, guidance, and communication protocols should be established for telework. Technology infrastructure should be sufficient to support increased telework, and performance management and program evaluation should be conducted. Agencies should learn from lessons learned during the H1N1 pandemic and apply those lessons to address the challenges of the current pandemic and future emergencies.", "This report discusses the disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The report examines the Public Assistance program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides funding to assist state and local governments in responding to and recovering from major disasters. The report highlights the use of alternative procedures in Puerto Rico for large permanent work projects, the challenges faced in the recovery process, and the development of a recovery plan. It also discusses the funding obligations and expenditures for Puerto Rico and the oversight of federal funds. Finally, the report provides comments from the Department of Homeland Security and the government of Puerto Rico.", "Around 2 million out of the 6 million veterans who received services from the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) in FY 2018 were diagnosed with at least one mental health condition. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) were the three most prevalent mental health conditions. Treatment options for veterans with mental health conditions included non-pharmacologic therapy (45%), combination therapy with both non-pharmacologic therapy and psychotropic medication (27%), and psychotropic medication only (10%). There is a lack of clear guidance from the VHA regarding the expectation of mental health providers to document treatment plans in an easily identifiable way, and there is no monitoring system in place to ensure that different evidence-based treatment options are being considered in treatment plans. The VHA has taken steps through the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI) to improve the safe and effective prescribing of certain psychotropic medications used to treat veterans with mental health conditions, and there have been notable improvements in some performance metrics. However, there is still a lack of coherent oversight related to treatment planning, which poses risks to the continuity and quality of care for veterans with mental health conditions.", "The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program is one of several contracting programs Congress has approved to provide greater opportunities for small businesses to win federal contracts. The program aims to promote the interests of small businesses and increase market competition by ensuring that small businesses receive a fair proportion of federal contracts and subcontracts. The program allows federal contracting officers to set aside acquisitions for bidding by WOSBs and economically disadvantaged WOSBs (EDWOSBs) exclusively in industries where they are underrepresented or substantially underrepresented. However, the program has faced challenges in implementation and oversight, and the federal government has struggled to meet the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs. Congress has shown increased interest in the program and has taken steps to address these challenges. There have been calls to improve the certification process, provide additional guidance to federal contracting officers, and expand the program to include sole source contracts. The program is likely to remain a priority for congressional oversight, and efforts will be made to ensure that federal agencies are effectively utilizing the program to meet the procurement goal for WOSBs.", "The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has predicted that coal production in the U.S. will continue to decline through 2050, leading to economic distress in coal-dependent communities. In response, the Obama Administration launched the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Plus Plan, which provided funding for economic stabilization, social welfare efforts, and environmental initiatives. The POWER Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative, provided economic development funding and technical assistance to address economic distress in coal communities. Currently, the POWER Initiative is operated by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in its 420-county service area. The ARC's POWER Initiative program is the largest of these efforts and continues to receive annual appropriations from Congress. The decline of the coal industry and the need to address economic dislocations from energy transition are likely to increase congressional interest in programs like the POWER Initiative. However, certain elements of the POWER+ Plan have not been enacted and face potential elimination under the Trump Administration. Congressional options for addressing energy transition in affected communities include expanding the geographic scope and funding of the POWER Initiative, considering other energy industries or regions in decline, and creating programs to promote renewable energy and carbon capture technologies. Additionally, further evaluation of the effectiveness of the POWER Initiative may be necessary to determine its impact on economic distress and development.", "The rules and practices of the House of Representatives regarding quorums and voting on the floor are derived from the Constitution. A majority of the House constitutes a quorum, but a smaller number can adjourn or compel absent members to attend. The yeas and nays of Members can be entered on the Journal if one-fifth of those present desire it. The House conducts much of its business in the Committee of the Whole, which has its own quorum requirement of 100 Members. A quorum is always presumed to be present and only challenged when a Member objects during a vote. A quorum is not required during general debate in Committee of the Whole, but is required for amendment and final passage votes. Votes are taken by voice or division, and a Member may request a recorded vote. Electronic voting is used for most votes and a quorum is established by the presence of Members during this vote. A quorum can be established during a call of the House or Committee of the Whole, and absent members may be compelled to attend. In the event of a catastrophic event, the House has established provisions to determine a provisional quorum and conduct business. The Speaker can decide not to vote unless a vote would be decisive or the House is voting by ballot. Members cannot delegate their vote to someone else, and ghost voting is prohibited. Most questions are decided by a simple majority vote, but a two-thirds vote is required for certain matters, such as expelling a Member or overriding a presidential veto.", "The military justice system in the United States consists of three types of military courts: summary, special, and general courts-martial. These courts are intended to deal with progressively more serious offenses. In addition, an accused servicemember can receive nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, which allows a commander to punish a servicemember without going through the court-martial process. \n\nThe military justice process begins with an offense being alleged and an initial report being made. This report is usually made to law enforcement, an investigative entity, or the suspect's chain of command. An inquiry or investigation is then conducted into the accusation, and evidence is gathered. After the investigation, charges are preferred against the accused. These charges are then forwarded to a convening authority, who can refer the case to a court-martial. The accused may be tried by a military judge alone or by a military judge with a military jury. Convictions at the general and special court-martial level can be appealed to higher courts. \n\nThe military services do not collect consistent information regarding race and ethnicity in their investigations, military justice, and personnel databases. The number of options for race and ethnicity within the databases varies across the services. For example, the Army's database has 6 options for race and 23 options for ethnicity, while the Coast Guard's database has 7 options for race and 3 options for ethnicity. The inconsistencies in data collection limit the services' ability to assess racial or ethnic disparities in the military justice system. \n\nIn May 2019, recommendations were made to each of the military departments and the Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard to collect and maintain race and ethnicity information in their investigations and personnel databases. DOD and DHS concurred with these recommendations, and implementation was expected by December 2020. \n\nThe military services currently do not externally report data that provides visibility into racial or ethnic disparities in the military justice system. However, in December 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 included a provision directing the Secretary of Defense to include data on race, ethnicity, and gender in the annual military justice reports. This change will allow for greater visibility into potential disparities. \n\nDOD has not issued guidance to specify when data indicating possible racial or ethnic disparities in the military justice system should be further reviewed. Other federal agencies have established criteria in the equal employment opportunity context, which could serve as a model for DOD to follow. Recommendations were made to the Secretary of Defense to issue guidance that establishes criteria for such reviews. DOD partially concurred with this recommendation, and implementation was estimated for March 2021. However, in December 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 included a provision directing the Secretary of Defense to issue guidance consistent with the recommendation. \n\nRacial disparities exist in investigations, disciplinary actions, and punishment of servicemembers in the military justice system. Black and Hispanic servicemembers are more likely than White servicemembers to be the subjects of recorded investigations and to be tried in general and special courts-martial in multiple services. However, there are fewer statistically significant racial disparities in case outcomes, such as convictions and punishments. \n\nDOD and the military services have not comprehensively studied the causes of these disparities. Recommendations were made to conduct an evaluation to identify the causes of any disparities in the military justice system and take steps to address them. DOD partially concurred with this recommendation, and implementation was estimated for March 2021. However, in December 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 included a provision directing the Secretary of Defense to conduct the evaluation.", "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound found in cannabis that is claimed to treat a range of conditions, but there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not allow CBD to be added to food or marketed as a dietary supplement, but it has approved a drug called Epidiolex, which contains CBD and is used to treat epilepsy. CBD can be derived from either hemp or marijuana, but only hemp-derived CBD is legal according to the 2018 farm bill. CBD is also being marketed in cosmetics and tobacco products, such as electronic cigarettes. Sales of CBD products in the U.S. reached $534 million in 2018 and are expected to continue growing in the coming years.", "In the United States, there are numerous memorials to individuals, groups, and events, and decisions about which ones to create are made by various entities. The location and funding of memorials are important considerations, with some memorials receiving high or medium federal involvement, while others receive little or no federal involvement. Memorials can be established on federal land and managed by federal agencies, or they can be located on nonfederal land but receive funding or assistance from federal agencies. Congress has the power to establish or recognize national memorials, and executive-branch officials can also designate commemorative works on federal land. Additionally, memorials can be established by nonfederal entities and receive no federal funding or support. There are different models for federal-nonfederal partnerships in the establishment and maintenance of memorials, and Congress has also designated existing nonfederal memorials as national memorials without any further federal affiliation. If Congress wanted to take a more systematic approach to establishing and funding national memorials outside of Washington, DC, they could consider creating a statutory definition of a national memorial or establishing criteria for memorial designations. Congress could also limit the number of memorial designations, similar to the limits on commemorative coins. Another option is to increase the number of nationally recognized memorials by establishing a program to identify nonfederal memorials deserving of a national designation or providing grants to nonfederal entities for constructing and maintaining memorials. Alternatively, Congress could continue to evaluate requests for national memorials outside of Washington, DC on a case-by-case basis.", "The U.S. government has made promoting the rule of law abroad a priority for decades, with funding for rule of law assistance increasing from $496 million in fiscal year 2014 to $551 million in fiscal year 2018. Assistance has been primarily focused on activities in Latin America, the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Afghanistan. The Department of State is the lead agency for rule of law assistance, while other agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) also provide assistance. State and USAID allocate funds for rule of law assistance through an annual foreign assistance budget process, with allocations determined by operating units. DOJ does not directly fund rule of law assistance but provides implementation support through interagency agreements. Rule of law activities include strengthening judicial systems, constitutional and legal reform efforts, access to justice, and legal education and associations. Rule of law assistance in selected countries such as Colombia, Kosovo, Liberia, and the Philippines focuses on issues such as violence against human rights defenders, land disputes, trial congestion, and the war on drugs. Coordination among agencies for rule of law assistance varies, with some countries having rule of law-specific working groups and others relying on broader law enforcement or counterterrorism working groups. The sufficiency of coordination efforts among agencies is unknown. The report concludes with a recommendation for Chiefs of Mission to assess the sufficiency of coordination methods for rule of law assistance.", "The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program is the largest source of federal financial assistance for postsecondary education. It offers several types of federal student loans to individuals, including undergraduate and graduate students, and parents of undergraduate students. In FY2020, the program is estimated to make 15.9 million new loans, averaging $6,299 each, totaling $100.2 billion. As of the end of the second quarter of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in principal and interest on Direct Loan program loans remained outstanding. \n\nThis report provides an overview of the program, including its history and different loan types. It describes the terms and conditions of loans made through the Direct Loan program, focusing on borrower eligibility, amounts that can be borrowed, interest rates and fees, repayment procedures and relief, loan discharge and forgiveness benefits, and consequences of defaulting. The report also explains how borrowers are informed about loan terms and conditions. \n\nThe program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) through its Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA). Loans are made by the government using federal funds, and outstanding loans are considered assets of the federal government. The program was established in 1994 and was intended to gradually replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. However, the FFEL program operated alongside the Direct Loan program until 2010 when the authority to make new loans through FFEL was terminated. \n\nBorrowers have options to repay their loans through different repayment plans, including standard, extended, graduated, income-driven, and alternative plans. Income-driven repayment plans cap monthly payment amounts based on the borrower's income and family size. Interest rates on loans made through the Direct Loan program can be fixed or variable, depending on when the loan was made. Interest subsidies are provided in certain circumstances, such as during in-school periods, deferment, or repayment according to income-driven plans. Borrowers may also defer repayment during periods of economic hardship, deferment, or forbearance. Interest may be capitalized, meaning added to the loan balance, in certain situations. Loan origination fees are charged to borrowers, with the amount depending on the loan type and when it was disbursed. \n\nThe report includes a directory of resources and a glossary of terms in the appendix. It is intended to support Members of Congress, congressional committees, and staff in their roles related to federal student loan policy.", "The U.S. Census Bureau has not yet developed mitigation and contingency plans for all the risks it has identified for the 2020 Census, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). The agency also lacks clear time frames for developing and obtaining management approval of such plans and the status of some plans is unclear, the report said. GAO examined the 2020 Census plans as well as Bureau's fraud risk strategy and found it did not align with the agency's Fraud Risk Framework. In its comments, the Commerce Department agreed with GAO's findings and said it would develop an action plan to address the recommendations.", "The United States has a significant backlog of employment-based immigrant visas, primarily dominated by Indian nationals. This backlog exists because the annual number of foreign workers hired by U.S. employers and sponsored for visas exceeds the annual allocation of green cards. The Immigration and Nationality Act imposes a 7% per-country cap on green cards, but this limit is regularly breached for countries like India and China. As a result, Indian nationals can expect to wait many years, even decades, to receive a green card. This backlog creates hardships for those affected, including the inability to switch jobs, travel overseas, or bring family members to the U.S. Some U.S. employers also face a competitive disadvantage for attracting highly skilled workers due to the backlog. Various legislative proposals have been put forth to address the backlog, including the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, which would eliminate the per-country cap. Supporters argue that this would lead to a more equitable system, while opponents believe it would disadvantage immigrants from other countries. Ultimately, the backlog highlights the need for reform to the employment-based immigration system.", "The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) established reporting, recordkeeping, and other anti-money laundering (AML) requirements for financial institutions, and as the delegated administrator of the BSA, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued implementing regulations. In complying with BSA/AML requirements, U.S. financial institutions assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. Oversight and enforcement of compliance with the BSA involve several federal agencies, including FinCEN and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Each of the federal banking regulators has independent authority to initiate enforcement actions against supervised institutions for violations of law and to seek civil money penalties for BSA violations. In addition, FinCEN has delegated examination authority for BSA/AML compliance for certain entities, including money transmitters, to the IRS. The federal banking regulators have also issued BSA/AML regulations that require banks to establish and maintain a BSA/AML compliance program. Money transmitters and banks are subject to requirements under the BSA such as the establishment of a written AML compliance program and the reporting of certain transactions. However, some banks have been terminating or limiting money transmitters' access to banking services, a practice known as derisking, due to concerns about regulatory scrutiny and the cost of BSA/AML compliance. Regulators have responded to these concerns by issuing guidance to clarify expectations for providing services to money transmitters and other MSBs. However, some examiners are unclear about the due diligence requirements for money transmitter accounts, and banks have expressed uncertainty about how much due diligence is reasonable to expect. Some banks have terminated accounts due to concerns about compliance costs, inability to manage BSA/AML risk, and reputational risk. Money transmitters have reported that derisking has resulted in the cessation of operations, the loss of revenue, higher costs for services, and the failure of the business. The interagency working group established by the regulators may help address these concerns indirectly by reducing the burden associated with BSA/AML compliance. However, regulators should continue to work towards addressing the full range of factors influencing banks to derisk.", "The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted several areas of concern for the country\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Specifically, the GAO has labelled the VA\u2019s management of IT acquisitions and operations; strategic human capital management; managing federal real property; and ensuring cybersecurity as high-risk areas. The GAO report, released on Wednesday, also noted concern about the management of disability claims workloads and outdated eligibility criteria for veterans' disability benefits. The VA is responsible for delivering benefits to veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, and financial assistance.\n", "Campus climate surveys on sexual violence are used to collect information about incidents of sexual violence, student attitudes and behaviors, and related topics on college campuses. The surveys can be conducted using either a census approach, in which all members of a group are surveyed, or a sample approach, in which a portion of the group is selected for the survey. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The surveys can vary in the topics they cover and the questions they ask. Some states have passed laws requiring colleges to administer campus climate surveys, but there is no federal requirement to do so. Federal agencies such as the Department of Education and the Department of Justice provide resources to help colleges develop and implement campus climate surveys. Stakeholders generally view the surveys as a useful tool for understanding and addressing campus sexual violence, but they also note challenges with conducting the surveys, such as limited resources and low response rates.", "The US Navy uses the Multiple Award Contract, Multi Order (MAC-MO) strategy for non-nuclear surface ship repair and maintenance. The strategy involves contracting with multiple ship repair companies to competitively bid and carry out repairs and maintenance work on Navy ships. This approach aims to increase competition, control costs, and improve quality. The Navy plans and defines requirements for upcoming repairs and maintenance, awards fixed-price contracts for on-time completion, and uses a third-party planner to create contract specifications. The strategy has had some successes, including increased competition and fixed-price contracts, but there have also been challenges with meeting cost and schedule goals. The Navy is taking steps to address these challenges and improve performance. Contractors have shown mixed views on the strategy, with large companies expressing uncertainty about future workloads and small businesses seeing opportunities for growth. The Navy is continuing to evaluate and refine the MAC-MO strategy to achieve better outcomes in the future.", "The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program provides grants to students who are completing or plan to complete coursework required for a career in teaching. Recipients must teach in a high-need field at a qualifying school within eight years of completing their program, or the grant is converted to a loan. Two-thirds of recipients are expected to see their grants converted to loans, raising questions about the program's efficacy. Challenges with administering the program include loan conversions due to late certification paperwork and the absence of an appeals process. Congressional attention may focus on program design, grant benefits, finding qualifying teaching placements, program quality at institutions, and the definition of a highly qualified teacher. Administrative challenges may also be addressed, such as certification of teaching service and the absence of an appeals process. Several legislative proposals are being considered to amend or replace the TEACH Grant program.", "The House of Representatives has certain rules for how bills and resolutions are considered on the floor. However, in order to expedite legislation, these rules can be temporarily set aside for non-privileged measures. This can be done through a special order of business resolution or by suspending the rules and passing the measure. The suspension procedure is often used for broadly supported legislation that does not require floor amendments or extensive debate. Most bills and resolutions in the House are considered under suspension of the rules. The decision to schedule a bill for consideration under suspension is based on how widely supported the measure is and how long Members wish to debate it. Suspension measures cover a wide range of policy areas, but often address government operations. In the 115th Congress, 64% of measures that received floor action were considered under suspension. Most suspension measures are bills, sponsored by members of the majority party. Committees may recommend amendments to suspension measures during markup meetings or through informal negotiations. Suspension measures are limited to 40 minutes of debate and require a two-thirds majority vote for passage. In the 115th Congress, the average length of consideration for a suspension measure was 12 minutes and 21 seconds. Most suspension motions are agreed to by voice vote, but record votes can be demanded. After passing the House, suspension measures are sent to the Senate, where they may face further consideration and amendments. However, in the 115th Congress, the Senate agreed to a majority of suspension measures passed by the House. Ultimately, the President signed all suspension measures presented to him, resulting in their enactment into law.", "The United States is experiencing a shift in its electricity generation sources due to economic factors, new technologies, environmental concerns, and regulations. One significant change is the increased generation from wind and solar sources, which have grown from 1% of total electricity generation in 2008 to 9% in 2018. However, these sources have weather-dependent availability, meaning that changing weather patterns can affect the electricity supply. Power system operators have adjusted reliability standards and planning practices to accommodate weather-dependent sources, but adjustments are still being discussed as wind and solar generation continues to grow. So far, wind and solar generation have not caused reliability issues at the national level, and reliability performance is stable in regions with high shares of wind and solar generation. Congress has mandated the setting and enforcement of electric reliability standards, which are developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These standards apply to the bulk power system but not to distributed energy resources or local distribution systems. While wind and solar generation have not posed reliability problems, there are still questions about how higher levels of generation from these sources could impact reliability in the future. The electric power sector consists of the generation, transmission, and distribution systems. In some regions, there are competitive markets for wholesale electricity, managed by regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs). In non-RTO regions, vertically integrated utilities are responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution. Different sources and technologies are used to balance wind and solar generation in the power system. These include reciprocating internal combustion engines, steam turbines, transmission between regions, energy storage, and demand response. The existing regulatory framework can accommodate some changes to maintain reliability, but there may be a need for new approaches if wind and solar generation increases beyond current projections. Congress could consider providing guidance for regulatory activities, assessing the siting and approval of transmission projects, expanding federal activities affecting distribution system reliability, and continuing or expanding federal financial support for technologies that improve reliability.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals (aliens) who are arrested for immigration violations that make them removable from the United States. Detention serves two purposes: ensuring the presence of aliens at their removal hearings and detaining those who pose a threat to community safety. The detention rules depend on factors such as the alien's status, criminal history, and stage of removal proceedings. In many cases, detention is discretionary, and aliens may be released on bond or supervision. However, mandatory detention applies to certain aliens, such as those convicted of specified crimes. The Supreme Court has recognized the broad power of the federal government over immigration but also acknowledged that due process protections apply to aliens within the United States. Constitutional limitations on detention differ depending on whether the alien is seeking initial entry into the United States or has already entered. The detention framework under the INA has been the subject of legal challenges, with lower courts addressing issues such as the length of detention and conditions of confinement. The Flores Settlement and subsequent regulations set standards for the detention and release of minors. However, there is ongoing debate and litigation concerning the scope of the government's detention authority and the conditions of confinement.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) nuclear enterprise consists of both strategic and nonstrategic nuclear forces, as well as the infrastructure and personnel needed to support these forces. Strategic nuclear forces include intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), nuclear-capable bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) carried by submarines. Nonstrategic nuclear forces include fighters capable of delivering nuclear or conventional munitions. NC3 capabilities are a critical component of the defense nuclear enterprise, providing support for planning, communications, and synchronization between the President and nuclear forces.\n\nThe DOD has limited the number of deployed systems for each leg of the strategic nuclear triad in accordance with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlights the importance of the triad, which provides deterrence capabilities and the capacity to target a range of adversary targets in a crisis or conflict.\n\nIn addition to the strategic nuclear triad, the DOD nuclear enterprise includes nonstrategic nuclear forces such as dual-capable fighter aircraft, associated nuclear weapons, and infrastructure and personnel necessary for maintenance and control. NC3 capabilities are fielded through a complex system of components used to ensure connectivity between the President and nuclear forces.\n\nResponsibilities for managing NC3 capabilities are distributed among several DOD components, including military departments, combatant commands, defense agencies, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe DOD established the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group (NDERG) in 2014 to address issues identified in nuclear enterprise reviews. The NDERG is the primary civilian-military governance body for the DOD nuclear enterprise and is responsible for ensuring the long-term health of the enterprise.\n\nThe DOD has made progress in implementing recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report. However, current tracking tools do not provide complete and up-to-date information on the status of these recommendations.\n\nThe DOD and military services have taken steps to address sustainment and maintenance challenges for nuclear weapon systems. For example, initiatives have been implemented to increase parts availability, improve depot-level maintenance, and address workforce issues. However, challenges related to aging, parts availability, fleet size, and workforce remain.\n\nThe DOD must ensure that the tools used to track progress on implementing recommendations remain current and complete. Additionally, the DOD should continue to use these tools to monitor progress and inform additional efforts to maintain the health of the nuclear enterprise.", "The US Department of Transportation (DOT) should provide more transparency on the effects of antitrust immunity between airlines and their international partners, says a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. Although DOT performs analysis of immunity applications and monitors the market effects of such grants, it does not publicly report its findings. The GAO suggested that DOT publish a report on DOT monitoring and immunity based on DOT's \"anticipated benefits\" assessment, but the DOT partially concurred with the suggestion, stating such transparency could have a chilling effect on competition and airline cooperation.\n", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has stated that it will only accept mailed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will only accept requests submitted electronically. This raises questions about how agencies will respond to FOIA requests in the future. FOIA does not require a specific format for requests, but agencies must respond within a certain time frame. COVID-19 may impact FOIA requests in two ways: certain information related to the pandemic may be expedited, and processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely. The decentralized nature of the FOIA process may present challenges in processing requests during this time. Some agencies have altered how requests should be submitted and have established additional allowances for expediting requests. Overall, the impact of COVID-19 on FOIA request processing varies among agencies.", "Congress is considering federal funding for infrastructure to revive the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. This report discusses the economic impact of transportation infrastructure funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). ARRA was enacted in response to the Great Recession and included approximately $100 billion to $150 billion for infrastructure. The funding was provided through direct spending, grants to nonfederal entities, tax preferences, and credit assistance. Most of the funding was spent in FY2010 and FY2011. The slow recovery of highway construction jobs suggests that more funding could have been absorbed after ARRA. State and local governments faced challenges in complying with the maintenance-of-effort requirements and there was a substitution of federal funds for state funds. The employment effects of the funding were relatively modest in many infrastructure sectors. ARRA also included the Build America Bond program to address problems in the municipal credit markets. The program allowed state and local governments to issue tax credit bonds, which attracted more investors and reduced borrowing costs. The BAB program helped finance various infrastructure projects. Overall, ARRA had a significant impact on transportation spending, but state and local spending on infrastructure continued to decline after the recession. The report concludes that further infrastructure investment could have been beneficial after ARRA funding had been largely expended.", "A new report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) are making progress in increasing board diversity. The GAO described the steps taken by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the FHLBanks to promote diversity in their boardrooms and the progress they have made to date. While the number of women on the boards of the 11 FHLBanks has increased, there is still room for improvement. The percentage of women on the boards has risen to 23% in October 2018, up from 18% in 2015. However, racial and ethnic minorities still remain underrepresented.\n", "Various management practices over the past century, including fire suppression, timber harvesting, and grazing, have led to changes in the frequency of wildfires and reduced the resilience of forest and grassland ecosystems to fire. These practices have resulted in a buildup of burnable material and an overstocking of forests with fuel. Reduced wildfire frequency has also led to increased amounts of vegetative debris, which can increase fuel quantities. The arrangement of vegetation can also affect fires, and an increase in small tree density can create ladder fuels that allow fires to spread into the trees' crowns. Moreover, reducing fire frequency in fire-adapted ecosystems can lead to changes in plant species, favoring non-native invasive species. Approximately 70,000 communities nationwide are at risk from wildfires due to factors like flammable vegetation, flammable building materials, and the location of structures in relation to vegetation. Fuel reduction projects can help lower the risk of wildfire damage to communities, structures, and valuable assets, such as power lines and natural resources. The Forest Service, BLM, FWS, and NPS manage over 670 million acres of federal land, with an estimated 100 million acres at high risk from wildfire. Each agency has a unique mission that shapes its management decisions. Funding for fuel reduction projects is allocated among the agencies based on factors such as wildfire hazard potential, the location of communities and infrastructure, and ecosystem health. Fuel reduction methods include mechanical treatments, prescribed burns, and herbicides or targeted grazing. Each method has advantages and disadvantages depending on different conditions. The purpose of these projects is to reduce the intensity of future wildfires to protect communities and ecosystems. The agencies face challenges in implementing fuel reduction projects, including the scale of the problem, operating under continuing resolutions, balancing treatments in new areas with maintaining past treatments, the availability of staff, the higher cost of treating WUI areas, limited economic value of biomass, and community acceptance of projects. Despite challenges, the agencies are working to improve their methods and prioritize areas for treatment. Moving forward, it's important to continue supporting fuel reduction efforts to mitigate the risks of wildfires to communities and ecosystems.", "The United States and Russia signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in 2010, which replaced the 1991 START treaty. The treaty limits the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and the number of deployed and non-deployed strategic delivery vehicles to 800. The treaty also includes provisions for monitoring and verification. The treaty entered into force in 2011 and is set to expire in 2021, unless extended. The Trump Administration has expressed concerns about the treaty and has not yet made a decision on whether to extend it. Some experts argue that the treaty should be extended, while others believe it should be renegotiated to include China's nuclear forces and address emerging threats.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of the public comment process for federal rulemaking and found inconsistencies in the treatment of identity information submitted by commenters. While agencies are not required to collect or verify identity information, they have the discretion to do so. The GAO found that agencies collect some identity information through required and optional fields on comment forms, but there are no mechanisms to check the validity of this information. Additionally, agencies collect information about users' interactions with their websites, such as IP addresses and browser type, but this information cannot be reliably connected to specific comments. \nThe GAO found that seven out of ten selected agencies have some internal guidance regarding the identity of commenters during the public comment process, but the focus and substance of this guidance vary. The agencies differ in how they treat identity information during the comment intake phase, particularly in terms of how they post duplicate comments. Some agencies maintain all comments within the comment system, while others keep duplicate comment records outside of the system. The treatment of identity information during the comment analysis phase and in the response to comments also varies among agencies. \nThe GAO also found that the agencies reviewed do not effectively communicate the limitations and inconsistencies in how they post identity information associated with public comments. Public users of comment websites lack information about data availability and limitations, which affects their ability to use and make informed decisions about the comment data and participate effectively in the rulemaking process. The GAO made recommendations for agencies to establish policies for posting comments and to communicate those policies more clearly to the public.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the largest integrated healthcare system in the country, operating 172 VA medical centers. The VA's intramural research program aims to improve the health of veterans by funding research and developing effective treatments. The VA's medical and prosthetic research appropriation of $722 million funds the program, with additional funding from other sources. The VA translates research into clinical practice in several ways, such as implementing new diagnostic tools and changing treatment protocols. The VA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) manages the intramural research program and sets research priorities based on input from internal and external stakeholders, as well as other factors. Funding is provided through the Merit Review Program, Cooperative Studies Program, Career Development Program, and funding for research centers. ORD coordinates with the VA's program offices to ensure that research findings are incorporated into clinical practice. The ORD also supports research translation through the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), the health services research service, and the Diffusion of Excellence Initiative. Coordination between the research program and program offices helps prioritize research and facilitates translation into practice. Ongoing efforts to improve coordination include strategic planning sessions, the use of consortiums of researchers focused on priority areas, and QUERI's Partnered Evaluation Initiatives. The coordination between the research program and program offices plays a crucial role in ensuring that VA research has a direct impact on clinical care for veterans.", "The current congressional budget process allows Congress to engage in budgeting without prescribing specific budgetary legislation or outcomes. However, there has been criticism of the current process and its outcomes, leading to calls for a more long-term budget focus. There is no consensus on what is meant by long-term or what is required for long-term budgeting. Concerns have been raised over projected levels of deficits and debt, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stating that deficits and debt are projected to increase sharply over the next 30 years. Some argue that the current budget process does not encourage or require consideration of long-term budget outcomes, which discourages long-term planning and may lead to short-term policy outcomes at the expense of the long-term budget situation. Addressing long-term deficit and debt challenges may require policy changes, and there are challenges associated with long-term budgeting, such as uncertainty in projections and the difficulty of budgeting for unforeseen events. However, information and data are available to assist Congress in understanding the projected long-term budget situation. Congress has developed budget-related rules and legislation, as well as committees, to carry out its budgeting responsibilities. Congressional committees specialize in policy areas and may study the long-term implications of specific programs within their jurisdiction. The House and Senate each have a Budget Committee that plays a significant role in the budget process, developing budget plans and overseeing the budget resolution. The budget resolution is an annual agreement between the House and Senate on spending and revenue levels and can be enforced through points of order and the budget reconciliation process. There are several budget enforcement mechanisms, such as discretionary spending limits and pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules. The budget process has undergone reform efforts in the past, and there have been proposals for further reform.", "Foreign students wanting to study in the United States must first be admitted to an SEVP-certified school or university. They must then apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate overseas. A visa holder must present themselves for inspection at a U.S. port of entry to determine admission. Nonimmigrants, including foreign students, are allowed to enter the U.S. for a specified period of time. Schools seeking to enroll foreign students must pay an application fee and petition for SEVP certification by submitting a petition and supporting documents to ICE through SEVIS. SEVIS assists ICE in tracking foreign students and their accompanying dependents while they are approved to study in the U.S. and provides oversight of foreign students at U.S. educational institutions. During the certification process, schools must provide evidence of their legitimacy, proof of accreditation, and a statement of compliance with program rules and regulations. Schools must also provide proof of licensure or approval by an appropriate agency, as well as proof of eligibility for certification. DSOs, or Designated School Officials, act as liaisons between foreign students, the employing school, and federal government agencies. They support school compliance and provide recommendations to foreign students regarding their immigration status. DSOs are also responsible for submitting their school's certification petition, updating information in SEVIS, and providing statements certifying their familiarity with program rules and regulations. Once a complete petition has been submitted, a site visit is conducted by SEVP's Field Representative Unit. After the visit, the Certification Unit analyzes the documentation and determines the school's eligibility for SEVP certification. DHS is required to conduct a review every two years to determine a school's continued eligibility for certification and compliance with program requirements. To be eligible for recertification, a school must demonstrate its ongoing eligibility and compliance with record-keeping and reporting requirements. ICE's Compliance Unit conducts ongoing monitoring of SEVP-certified schools for compliance and eligibility. SEVP also uses a Risk Assessment Model and the Risk Assessment Tool to identify potential fraud and noncompliance issues among certified schools. ICE has taken steps to strengthen its fraud risk-management efforts in SEVP, but there are areas that still need improvement. Specifically, ICE has not fully developed and implemented a fraud risk profile that identifies and assesses the agency's fraud risks and determines its tolerance for those risks. ICE also has not fully employed the use of data analytics, such as network analysis, to identify potential fraud indicators in schools. There are also delays in the recertification process, which creates additional fraud risks. ICE has weaknesses in the controls related to DSOs, including the verification of their information and the implementation of background checks. Mandatory training for DSOs is also lacking. Overall, there is room for improvement in ICE's management of fraud risks in SEVP.", "The United States relies on drugs manufactured in foreign countries, with about 70 percent of establishments manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and more than 50 percent of establishments manufacturing finished drugs for the U.S. market being located overseas. The FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of all drugs marketed in the United States, regardless of where they are manufactured. The FDA conducts three main types of drug manufacturing establishment inspections: preapproval inspections, surveillance inspections, and for-cause inspections. The FDA uses various databases to select foreign and domestic establishments for inspections, but inaccurate information in these databases has made it difficult to accurately identify establishments subject to inspection. The FDA has taken steps to improve the accuracy and completeness of this information, but challenges remain. The FDA faces challenges when conducting foreign inspections, including preannouncing inspections, language barriers, lack of flexibility in scheduling, and a post-inspection classification process. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led the FDA to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing establishments, further highlighting the complexities of overseeing foreign drug establishments.", "The IRS Form 990 is an important document for organizations exempt from income tax under the Internal Revenue Code. It asks for information about the organization\u2019s employees, governance, finances, and other specific details. The form is used by the Tax Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE) division of the IRS to promote compliance and enforce tax laws for tax-exempt organizations. The Form 990 has undergone changes over the years, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2008. The form is also available in different versions to accommodate small organizations, private foundations, and organizations not required to file the standard Form 990. TE/GE uses data-driven approaches to select organizations for examination. This involves the use of models and queries to identify potential noncompliance. However, there are deficiencies in the internal controls and processes related to the use of data for examination selection. These deficiencies include inconsistent assignment of point values to queries, errors in query documentation, lack of testing for new queries, inadequate retention of model scores and query performance data, and lack of regular evaluation of selection decisions. TE/GE also has not identified specific risks associated with using data for examination selection. Improving these internal controls and processes is essential to ensure that data used for examination selection are reliable and that selection decisions are valid and effective. Additionally, TE/GE should document measurable objectives for using data in examination selection and consider risks associated with using data in this process. By addressing these recommendations, TE/GE can enhance its efforts to select and examine tax-exempt organizations and increase the integrity of the charitable sector.", "Congress establishes advisory commissions for various purposes, such as informing Congress, providing expert advice, and generating policy recommendations. These commissions are authorized to conduct hearings, research, analyze data, and make field visits. Most commissions deliver their findings and recommendations to Congress in the form of a written report. Commissions may also be established to commemorate individuals, groups, or events. Funding for commissions varies, and factors such as staff hiring, consultant contracting, and administrative support contribute to overall costs. Commissions typically reimburse travel expenses and may compensate their members. Funding methods include appropriations, federal agency funding, and private donations. Congressional commissions can be categorized as commemorative or noncommemorative, with noncommemorative commissions being more common. The funding mechanisms authorized in commission statutes range from specific appropriations to the use of existing agency funds. Some commissions are authorized to receive private donations. The amounts provided to commissions in appropriations acts can vary widely, and data on commission expenditures are limited but indicate that staff and consultant pay and travel expenses are significant components. Overall, commissions play important roles in informing Congress and generating policy recommendations, and the funding and expenditure patterns of commissions vary depending on their specific purposes.", "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and tribes to help them finance a wide range of benefits and services that address economic disadvantage among children. While TANF is primarily used to provide public assistance benefits to needy families with children, states have the flexibility to use the funds in any manner that is reasonably calculated to achieve TANF's statutory goals. TANF was created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and has been funded through a series of extensions since then. The major issues facing TANF in the 116th Congress relate to whether the current policy framework allows states to de-emphasize the original concerns that led to the creation of TANF. This report provides an overview of TANF, its funding, current uses of funds, accountability measures, decline in caseload, and implications for child poverty. It also describes legislation introduced in the 115th and 116th Congress related to TANF funding, uses of funds, and work participation requirements.", "Four relief laws have been enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as of June 2020, with a total appropriation of $2.6 trillion. Six areas, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and unemployment insurance, account for 86% of the appropriations. As of May 31, 2020, obligations for these areas totaled $1.3 trillion and expenditures totaled $643 billion. However, comprehensive obligation and expenditure information published by federal agencies about the programs funded through these relief laws is not readily available to the public until July 2020. Challenges in the federal response to the crisis include incomplete and inconsistent data on viral testing, distribution of supplies, confusion and questions about the PPP, difficulties in delivering economic impact payments, and issues with unemployment insurance. Lessons learned from the initial response include the need for clear goals, communication, data collection and analysis, transparency, and accountability mechanisms. Congress is considering additional actions to address the pandemic and develop plans for oversight of the response and recovery efforts.", "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) used bridge contracts extensively to operate Job Corps centers in 2016 due to various challenges including acquisition planning, staffing levels, and protests from Job Corps offerors. ETA implemented strategies to decrease the number of noncompetitive bridge contracts in subsequent years, including prioritizing staff efforts on competitive awards, utilizing oral presentations to evaluate contractors, and awarding indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. ETA has also transitioned from using cost-reimbursement contracts to fixed-price contracts for Job Corps center operations. However, ETA faces ongoing acquisition planning and workforce challenges that could pose risks to its ability to manage and award future Job Corps contracts without having to rely on bridge contracts. In addition, program and contracting officials at ETA have limited insight into how incentive fees are calculated for contractors and may lack key information regarding contractor performance. Therefore, GAO recommends that ETA (1) develop a comprehensive strategy for planning, awarding, and monitoring Job Corps center contracts and (2) develop a coordinated and documented process for sharing relevant information on incentive fees paid to contractors. The Department of Labor concurred with both recommendations.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) completed its first agency-wide financial audit in FY2018 and recently completed its FY2019 audit. In both audits, the DOD Inspector General (IG) issued a disclaimer of opinion, meaning auditors could not express an opinion on the financial statements because the financial information was not sufficiently reliable. This is particularly significant because DOD accounts for about half of federal discretionary expenditures and 15% of total federal expenditures. The auditors identified 20 material weaknesses in DOD's internal controls, ranging from issues with financial management systems to inventory management. DOD spent $413 million to conduct the FY2018 audit and an additional $406 million on audit remediation and $153 million on financial system fixes. The auditors also identified three critical areas of improvement: financial management systems and information technology, financial reporting and fund balance with Treasury, and property. The DOD faces challenges in accurately recording and valuing its real property, inventory, and government property in the possession of contractors. The auditors issued 2,377 notices of findings and recommendations, resulting in 20 agency-wide material weaknesses and 129 component-level material weaknesses. DOD expects it could take a decade to receive an unmodified (clean) audit opinion. However, the annual audit process helps DOD reform its business practices and supports the National Defense Strategy. Continued congressional oversight of DOD's plan to achieve a clean audit opinion could help DOD achieve its goals and improve its business processes.", "Clinical trials are a common pathway for patients seeking access to investigational drugs. These trials are typically led by a physician and involve the testing of a drug's safety and effectiveness in human participants. Clinical trials have eligibility criteria that determine which patients can participate, including both inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria specify the characteristics required for participation, while exclusion criteria identify characteristics that disqualify patients. Certain patient populations, such as children and pregnant women, may be excluded from clinical trials for ethical reasons. The three phases of clinical trials are Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, each of which involves testing the drug on a larger number of patients to gather more information about its safety and effectiveness. After completing these phases, drug manufacturers submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval. If patients are unable to participate in clinical trials, they may seek access to investigational drugs through the FDA's expanded access program or the federal Right to Try Act. FDA, in collaboration with drug manufacturers, has made efforts to broaden eligibility criteria for clinical trials, including the release of guidance documents in March and June 2019. These documents recommended that certain patient populations, such as adolescents and patients with compromised organ function, be included in clinical trials. However, drug manufacturers face challenges in broadening eligibility criteria while maintaining evidence from a well-defined population. FDA has also taken steps to simplify the expanded access program and increase communication about the program and the federal Right to Try Act. This includes updating webpages, clarifying guidance on adverse events, and launching a pilot program to help oncologists access investigational drugs for their patients. Many drug manufacturers have also communicated on their websites whether they consider individual requests for access, and have outlined the criteria and process for reviewing and granting access.", "The United States has implemented various projects in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to support the objectives of the U.S. Strategy for Central America, including prosperity, governance, and security. These projects have sought to address challenges such as high rates of poverty, weak governance, and high levels of violence and insecurity. The projects have focused on areas such as economic growth, agricultural development, good government service, justice reform, community-based violence prevention, and professionalizing the military. Overall, the projects have achieved mixed results, with successes and challenges reported in each sector. However, there are limitations in monitoring and evaluation efforts, and there is a need for a comprehensive approach to assess progress and results across all agencies and sectors. The U.S. should collaborate with the Departments of Defense and Agriculture to develop a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan that aligns with the objectives of the Strategy.", "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of fluorinated compounds that have been used in numerous commercial, industrial, and U.S. military applications. PFAS are persistent in the environment and studies suggest that exposures above certain levels may lead to adverse health effects. PFAS have been detected in soil, surface water, groundwater, and public water supplies in numerous locations. Federal actions to address potential health and environmental risks of exposure to PFAS have been taken primarily under the authorities of several federal statutes including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has used the authorities of these statutes to address the potential risks of PFAS. Detections of PFAS contamination in drinking water and the environment have increased in recent years, prompting calls for increased federal action. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address PFAS, and the EPA has proposed regulations and guidelines on PFAS.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress and faced challenges in managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. Some of the areas of progress include identifying non-compliant facilities, improving data sharing among agencies, and implementing an updated risk assessment approach. DHS has also taken steps to improve the accuracy of data used to identify high-risk facilities and to review and approve security plans. Additionally, DHS has made efforts to engage with stakeholders and first responders, although improvements can still be made in information sharing with first responders. Overall, while progress has been made, there are ongoing challenges that DHS needs to address to effectively manage the CFATS program.", "A report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has stated that specialist retirement plans are being used as tax avoidance tools by US executives. Companies offering \u2018executive retirement plans\u2019 typically do so to supplement benefits offered under qualified pension plans, or to provide retirement benefits as a way of circumventing those offered through a qualified retirement plan. These plans have no statutory limits on benefits, contributions or compensation, meaning executives can set their own retirement funds and avoid some taxes. GAO estimates that in 2017, companies provided executive retirement plans to approx. 2,300 senior executives, representing around $13bn in accumulated plan benefits.", "Insurance is an essential tool for managing risk, and technology is playing an increasingly important role in the insurance industry. Insurtech companies are using technology to offer innovative insurance products and streamlined customer experiences. Key technologies being utilized in the industry include mobile apps, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, drones, and telematics. These technologies are providing various benefits, such as increased underwriting accuracy, more individualized pricing, improved risk monitoring, reduced costs, increased convenience for customers, and increased consumer choice. However, there are also challenges associated with the use of technology in insurance, including validating consumer data and models, protecting consumer data and privacy, concerns about the nonadmitted market, and ensuring that regulations keep up with technological advancements. Regulatory bodies such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) are working to address these challenges and provide guidance for insurers and consumers in the rapidly evolving insurtech landscape.", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), continue development of a crew vehicle, and prepare infrastructure at Kennedy Space Center for the launch system. NASA established the SLS program in 2011 and aligned the requirements for the Orion program with those of the SLS and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) programs in 2012. When a major project or program exceeds its development cost baseline by more than 30 percent, it must be reauthorized by Congress and rebaselined by NASA in order to continue work. In April 2017, NASA changed the launch readiness date for the first SLS mission, known as Artemis-1, to December 2019. However, in June 2019, it was determined that the revised launch date was unachievable and the launch may be delayed until June 2021. The delays are attributed to ongoing technical challenges with the SLS and Orion programs. The SLS program has also underreported its development cost growth. The SLS program is currently working towards completing the core stage and conducting green run testing. The Orion program is also behind schedule and has faced delays with the European Service Module and avionics systems. The EGS program, which is responsible for infrastructure and software, is now targeting an August 2020 launch date for Artemis-1. The EGS program has faced challenges with ground support equipment and software development. The report recommends enhancing contract management and oversight, minimizing risky programmatic decisions, and improving transparency into costs for long-term plans.", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications in the United States. Its functions include issuing licenses for broadcast television and radio, overseeing the licensing and regulation of cellular phones, regulating the use of radio spectrum, investigating complaints related to communications laws, addressing public safety issues, educating consumers about communications goods, and reviewing mergers of companies holding FCC-issued licenses. The FCC relies on computer systems and information security controls to support its mission. In May 2017, the FCC experienced a service disruption that prevented the electronic filing system from accepting comments for a period of time. The disruption was caused by an increase in comment traffic and system design deficiencies. The FCC took several actions to reduce the risk of future disruptions, including conducting internal assessments, deploying additional virtual hardware, optimizing system software, and updating incident response policies and procedures. However, a recent audit by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the FCC had not consistently implemented security controls to effectively protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems. The report identified deficiencies in all five core security functions of the NIST cybersecurity framework, including identifying risk, protecting against threats, detecting events, responding to incidents, and recovering from disruptions. The GAO made numerous recommendations to address these deficiencies, and the FCC has made progress in implementing them. However, the GAO found that additional actions are needed to fully resolve the deficiencies and protect the FCC's systems and information from cyber threats.", "The previous work conducted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) on board diversity in corporate and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) boards is summarized as follows:\n\n1. Corporate Boards: Corporate boards of directors are responsible for managing the business and affairs of a corporation. They oversee management performance, select the CEO, and establish committees for specific tasks. The average board size is about 11 directors.\n\n2. FHLBank Boards: FHLBank boards are made up of directors from member institutions and independent directors. Each FHLBank has between 14 and 24 directors, totaling 194 directors across all banks. Boards are subject to requirements set forth by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, including skills, term length, and the percentage of member and independent directors.\n\n3. Benefits of Board Diversity: Research has shown that diverse boards lead to better decision-making and can better reflect a company's employee and customer base. Some studies suggest that diverse boards may have a positive impact on financial performance.\n\n4. Representation of Women and Minorities: The representation of women and minorities on corporate and FHLBank boards has increased over time but still lags behind men and whites, respectively. In 2014, women comprised about 16% of corporate board directors, and it could take decades for women to achieve parity with men. In 2018, women comprised less than 25% of FHLBank board directors.\n\n5. Challenges to Board Diversity: The main challenges to increasing board diversity are not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts, limitations of the traditional board candidate pipeline, and low turnover of board seats. Recruitment efforts often rely on personal networks and traditional CEO pipelines, which limit the pool of diverse candidates.\n\n6. Strategies to Increase Board Diversity: Strategies to increase board diversity include setting voluntary targets for the number or proportion of women or minorities on boards, requiring diverse slates of candidates, filling interim board seats with women or minority candidates, engaging in outreach and mentorship programs, improving disclosure requirements on board diversity, expanding board searches beyond CEOs, and evaluating board performance.\n\n7. Suggestions for Improvement: Stakeholders have suggested improving federal disclosure requirements on board diversity, increasing transparency, and enforcing voluntary targets. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has been recommended to review FHLBank data collection processes to improve transparency on board diversity.", "Legislators and regulators are concerned about the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs used for off-label purposes. Two recent incidents have highlighted these concerns. One involves the use of ketamine, an injectable anesthetic, for off-label treatment of depression and migraines. Safety experts have raised concerns about the lack of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of this use. The second incident involves Astra Zeneca's promotion of Seroquel for use in children, despite the drug being approved only for adult use by the FDA. Congress is concerned about off-label prescriptions and is exploring options to address the issue. Off-label use of prescription drugs is common, with studies estimating that 12% to 38% of all prescriptions are written for off-label uses. While some off-label use is supported by scientific evidence, there are risks associated with off-label prescriptions, including unknown safety and effectiveness for the specified use. Congress has given the FDA the authority to regulate the approval and labeling of drugs to protect patients and encourage research. However, off-label use can provide benefits to patients, especially in the treatment of rare diseases where clinical trials are not feasible. There are concerns about the dissemination of information about off-label uses, as well as the lack of data collection and transparency regarding off-label prescriptions. Congress could take actions such as requiring disclosure to patients about off-label use, improving data collection and availability, allowing manufacturers to disseminate information about off-label uses, and conducting oversight of off-label prescribing. Off-label use also raises questions about drug pricing, reimbursement, research, and clinical guidance. Any actions taken to address off-label use must carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks to patients, manufacturers, and researchers.", "The Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have implemented numerous projects under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, which aims to support security and rule of law in Mexico. State/INL funded 388 projects, while USAID funded 57. State/INL projects focused on training and assistance for Mexican officials in justice, security, military, and law enforcement sectors. USAID projects aimed to address corruption, promote trust in government, and prevent crime and violence. State/INL allocated $542 million, and USAID allocated $182 million for assistance to Mexico from 2014-2018. State/INL and USAID generally followed key practices for assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff and planning a monitoring approach, but State/INL lacked procedures to consistently follow all key practices for monitoring project implementation. USAID consistently tracked project performance data against established measures, but State/INL did not consistently track data for all projects. State/INL and USAID use data from the Government of Mexico to monitor the implementation of the M\u00e9rida Initiative. It is recommended that State/INL and USAID establish procedures to improve monitoring practices and track performance data more consistently.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) historically separated a number of children from adults at the U.S. border and transferred them to HHS custody, but this only happened in certain circumstances. Separation occurred if the parental relationship could not be confirmed, if there were concerns of human trafficking or safety threats to the child, or if the child crossed the border with other family members without proof of legal guardianship. Under the \"zero tolerance\" policy implemented in April 2018, DHS began referring more individuals, including parents with children, for criminal prosecution. In these cases, referred parents were placed into U.S. Marshals Service custody and separated from their children, who were treated as unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and transferred to the custody of HHS. The executive order issued on June 20, 2018, aimed to keep alien families together during criminal proceedings, and a federal judge ruled on June 26, 2018, that certain separated parents must be reunited with their minor children. DHS and HHS identified 2,654 children of potential class members in the court case as of September 10, 2018. DHS and HHS made changes to their data systems after April 2018 to help identify family separations, but these changes do not fully address coordination issues between the two departments.", "The United States and Liberia have maintained diplomatic relations for over 150 years. The two countries have had close ties, particularly during the Cold War when the United States invested in Liberia's rubber sector and provided political and defense cooperation. However, relations strained during Liberia's civil wars in the late 20th century. The United States provided humanitarian assistance and helped mediate the end of the wars. Relations improved under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and have remained close under current President George Weah. Congress has shown ongoing interest in Liberia and has provided substantial aid to support stabilization, development, and recovery efforts. Recent efforts have focused on promoting good governance, strengthening the rule of law, reforming the security sector, improving service delivery, and spurring economic development. Many Members of Congress have also sought to adjust the immigration status of over 80,000 Liberian nationals living in the United States. Liberia declared independence from the American Colonization Society in 1847, and a small elite dominated by \"Americo-Liberians\" held power until a military coup in 1980. The country then experienced two civil wars from 1989 to 1997 and from 1999 to 2003. Liberia's wars led to social service disruptions, economic devastation, and regional destabilization. Charles Taylor, a former civil servant who launched a rebellion from neighboring Cote d'Ivoire, played a major role in the conflicts. After the wars, the United Nations established a peacekeeping mission in Liberia to stabilize the country. The wars also had an impact on neighboring Sierra Leone, as Taylor provided support to rebels there. Taylor was later convicted of war crimes by a UN-mandated court. Former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who served from 2006 to 2018, oversaw a period of political stability and economic growth in Liberia. She received extensive support from the United States and other donors in rebuilding the country's infrastructure and promoting development. However, her administration faced criticisms for not implementing key recommendations of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and for corruption scandals. In the 2017 general elections, former soccer star George Weah was elected president. His administration has faced challenges, including corruption scandals, economic difficulties, protests, and human rights concerns. Liberia's economy relies on agriculture, mining, and rubber and palm oil production. However, the country faces high levels of poverty, food insecurity, and inadequate infrastructure. Foreign direct investment has declined due to low global commodity prices and a poor business climate. The United States has been a major donor to Liberia, providing significant aid to support development efforts. The country also benefits from the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, which focuses on improving access to electricity and road infrastructure. While U.S.-Liberia relations remain close, challenges such as corruption, political tensions, and weak governance pose ongoing obstacles to Liberia's development and democratic progress. The United States is likely to continue supporting Liberia, but may reduce aid allocations in the future. Congress will continue to monitor Liberia's governance and development progress and may consider various tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, and potential punitive measures, to advance U.S. interests in Liberia.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has not fully implemented the open source software (OSS) pilot program mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum. The pilot program requires DOD to release at least 20 percent of newly custom-developed code as OSS and develop a metric to gauge the program's performance. As of July 2019, DOD had released less than 10 percent of its custom-developed code. The department also lacked a consistent measure to assess the program's progress. DOD had partially implemented the other four supporting requirements, which include issuing an OSS policy, conducting OSS analyses, securing data rights and inventorying custom code, and facilitating the OSS community. DOD had not issued an OSS policy, but it planned to do so by the end of 2019. The department had not established milestones for securing data rights and conducting an inventory or facilitating the OSS community. DOD officials provided mixed views on the use of OSS. Some officials cited potential financial benefits and increased efficiency, while others expressed concerns about security risks. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) made four recommendations to DOD, including the implementation of the pilot program, the establishment of milestones, and the identification of a measure for assessing progress. DOD concurred with three of the recommendations but did not concur with the recommendation to implement the pilot program.", "The US government provides democracy assistance in various forms, with different agencies focusing on different program areas. The State and USAID are the main agencies responsible for democracy assistance, with State using bureaus like the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to provide this assistance. INL focuses on combating crime and narcotics trafficking, while DRL funds programs to promote human rights, democracy, and governance. USAID, on the other hand, sees democracy assistance as central to its core mission and provides oversight through its regional bureaus. From fiscal years 2015 to 2018, State and USAID allocated more than $8.8 billion for democracy assistance, with State allocating $2.9 billion and USAID allocating $5.9 billion. They directed democracy assistance to a combined total of 100 countries, with some overlap in the countries they supported. However, the entities focused on different program areas, with DRL funding projects supporting human rights, civil society, and independent media, INL directing funds towards the rule of law, and USAID prioritizing good governance. State and USAID use various mechanisms to coordinate democracy assistance at both the headquarters and country levels, but embassy officials often lack complete information about projects, leading to potential duplication and inhibiting coordination efforts. The report concludes with a recommendation to develop mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of information about democracy assistance projects between the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and relevant embassy staff.", "Intercity passenger rail in America dates back to the 19th century, and federal regulation has played a significant role in its development. The High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 and subsequent legislation have provided federal support for passenger rail services. Amtrak, created in 1971, operates intercity passenger trains on a national network. The federal government continues to support passenger rail through grants, loans, and tax preferences. There have been ongoing debates over the justification of federal subsidies for passenger rail, with the Trump Administration calling for a shift of decision-making and cost responsibility to states. Some states have received federal funding for projects to improve existing passenger rail services, such as higher speeds, increased frequencies, and reduced trip times. However, the establishment of true high-speed rail systems in the United States has been challenging due to the high costs and limited funding. The California High-Speed Rail project, which aims to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has faced funding and timeline challenges. Other private companies, such as All Aboard Florida and Texas Central, are planning high-speed rail lines between major cities. The federal government has also supported state-supported routes, studies of new rail corridors, and improvements to existing infrastructure and equipment. The long-distance routes operated by Amtrak have required significant operating subsidies, and there have been calls to reform these services. Efforts to foster competition in the passenger rail industry have not been successful. Overall, the federal government's approach to passenger rail funding in the United States has lacked predictability and a dedicated revenue source, which has made long-term planning and implementation challenging.", "The National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans aim to bring together all elements of federal biodefense capabilities to address various sources of catastrophic risk. The strategy includes goals and objectives, a process for collecting and analyzing information across the enterprise, and a structure for assessing capabilities and needs. However, challenges with planning, guidance, and decision-making processes could limit the success of the strategy's implementation. The first year of implementation revealed challenges with data collection, lack of planning and guidance, and uncertainty about decision-making processes. Additionally, there is a lack of clear procedures and planning for analyzing the data and a lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities for joint decision-making. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the effective implementation of the strategy and the improvement of the nation's biodefense capabilities. Recommendations include establishing a plan for change management practices, documenting guidance and methods for data analysis, and clearly defining roles and responsibilities for decision-making.", "Mozambique is facing political, economic, and security challenges. The country has been dominated by the FRELIMO political party since gaining independence in 1975. Political tensions between FRELIMO and the main opposition party, RENAMO, have resurfaced, resulting in violence. Economically, Mozambique has suffered a downturn due to a debt scandal in which the government failed to report over $2 billion in debt. The country also faces security challenges, including an insurgency by armed Islamist extremists. Despite these challenges, Mozambique has potential for economic growth due to large offshore natural gas reserves and rising coal exports. However, poverty rates remain high, and corruption is a major issue. The United States has cordial relations with Mozambique and provides significant aid to the country.", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the primary source of flood insurance for residential properties in the US. It collects $4.6 billion in annual revenue and provides over $1.3 trillion in coverage. The NFIP is planning to introduce Risk Rating 2.0, the biggest change to the program since its inception. Under Risk Rating 2.0, premiums will be based on an individual property's flood risk rather than the current system of flood zones. The new rating system will incorporate a wider range of flood frequencies and sources. It will also consider additional variables such as distance to water and property value. Risk Rating 2.0 is expected to reduce cross-subsidies between policyholders and eventually eliminate premium subsidies. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for premium increases and the affordability of flood insurance. FEMA, which administers the NFIP, does not have the authority to implement an affordability program, but affordability provisions are included in proposed legislation for the long-term reauthorization of the NFIP. ", "The Department of Defense (DOD) lacks comprehensive data on its space acquisition workforce, including the size, mix, and location of personnel working on space acquisitions, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report states that DOD does not have a defined space acquisition workforce and its systems are not configured to identify space acquisition personnel. As a result, the report recommends that DOD identify space acquisition programs and personnel and report this information to Congress. The lack of comprehensive data hampers DOD's ability to assess gaps in its space acquisition workforce and make decisions regarding its new organizations, the United States Space Command and the Space Development Agency.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides monthly disability compensation to veterans with service-connected disabilities based on the severity of their condition. The claims process begins when a veteran submits a claim to the VA, which then reviews the claim and helps gather relevant evidence. This evidence includes military service records, medical exams, and treatment records from VHA medical facilities and private providers. If necessary, the VA will provide a medical exam for the veteran through a VHA medical facility or a contractor. The contractor assigns an examiner to conduct the exam and submit a report to the VA for evaluation. The VA established an exam program office in 2016 to manage contractors and monitor their performance. However, the VA has encountered difficulties in collecting accurate information on contractor performance, which has hindered their ability to oversee the program effectively. There have been delays in completing quality reviews of contract exam reports and a lack of accurate information on timeliness. The VA has made some efforts to address these issues, including hiring additional staff and implementing a new exam management system. However, they have not fully resolved the problems, and there is still a need for improved oversight and verification of contractor training. Without proper oversight, there is a risk of delayed or inadequate exams for veterans.", "Congress has a history of creating advisory commissions to assist in public policy development, especially in crisis situations. These commissions can provide expertise, examine complex issues, and lend bipartisan credibility. As Congress considers its response to the pandemic, creating advisory commissions could be an option. This report compares five proposed commissions related to COVID-19 and analyzes their membership structure, appointment process, rules of procedure, duties, powers, staffing, and funding. The overall structures of the proposed commissions are similar, but each has unique elements. Factors such as size, qualifications, compensation, and partisan balance vary among the proposals. The commissions would be temporary, serve in an advisory capacity, and produce reports detailing their findings and recommendations. Some proposals exempt the commissions from the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and specify deadlines for appointments and report submission. The commissions would have the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, and receive administrative support from the General Services Administration (GSA). They could also hire staff, consultants, and experts, and federal agencies would cooperate in providing security clearances. Four of the proposals provide funding mechanisms, while one does not. The estimated cost of a commission depends on factors such as staff size, duration, and scope. Ultimately, the decision to create an advisory commission rests with policymakers and their preferences for utilizing existing oversight structures or establishing new entities.", "This report provides an analysis of the annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020. It compares the enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the appropriations measures developed in response. The report identifies additional resources on DHS appropriations and explains budgetary concepts. It also analyzes the legislative process for FY2020 appropriations, including the House and Senate committee recommendations, continuing resolutions, and the final enacted levels. The report then breaks down the funding for each component of DHS, including law enforcement, incident response and recovery, support, and headquarters components. It provides tables that show the budgetary resources for each component and analyzes selected administrative provisions. The report also explains the concepts of budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and offsetting collections. Finally, the report discusses the 302(a) and 302(b) allocations, the Budget Control Act and discretionary spending caps, and adjustments to the caps for disaster relief, overseas contingency operations, and emergency spending.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in meeting criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, but there are still areas that need improvement. DHS has met three out of five criteria, including leadership commitment, action planning, and monitoring progress. The department has partially met the remaining two criteria, capacity and demonstrated sustained progress. DHS leaders have demonstrated commitment and support for addressing management challenges and have taken actions to institutionalize this commitment. They have also implemented an initiative to strengthen integration of business operations. DHS has an action plan and has produced multiple versions of its strategy for high-risk management, which includes performance measures to monitor key initiatives. However, DHS needs to make more progress in identifying and allocating resources in areas of acquisition, IT, and financial management to fully demonstrate its capacity. The department has made progress in meeting specific outcomes in the areas of human capital and IT management, but there is still work to be done. DHS continues to face challenges in acquisition management, particularly in funding its portfolio and meeting cost and schedule goals. The department has taken steps to strengthen requirements development and improve oversight of IT investments. However, there are ongoing challenges in information security and cybersecurity workforce assessment requirements. DHS has received a clean audit opinion on its financial statements for six consecutive years, but there are material weaknesses in financial reporting and information technology controls. The department's financial management systems and processes need to be modernized. DHS has made efforts to strengthen employee engagement and has improved its score on the employee engagement index, but there is still room for improvement. The department has implemented an Integrated Priorities initiative to address crosscutting management challenges. Continued progress in addressing the remaining outcomes depends on implementing corrective actions and achieving sustainable progress. DHS needs to maintain leadership support, identify necessary resources, implement its plan, track progress, and make necessary adjustments. The Government Accountability Office will continue to monitor DHS's efforts to determine if outcomes are achieved and sustained over the long term.", "The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and eight regional fishery management councils are responsible for managing approximately 460 fish stocks in federal waters. NMFS collects data on fish stocks and generates scientific information for the conservation and management of marine resources. The stock assessments conducted by NMFS provide information on the past and current status of managed fish stocks, including predictions of future trends. NMFS provides the results of its stock assessments to the regional councils to inform their management decisions. The councils, which are composed of members from federal and state agencies, commercial and recreational fishing sectors, and other stakeholders, are responsible for developing fishery management plans and determining the allocation of fish stocks between sectors. NMFS reviews and approves these plans, ensuring they are consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws. The councils also establish committees and advisory panels to assist in developing research priorities and management options, and to gather input from stakeholders. Once the councils complete proposed fishery management plans or amendments, they are submitted to NMFS for review and final regulation. NMFS and the councils use various sources of information, such as catch and landings data, stock assessments, economic analyses, social indicators, and ecosystem models, to inform their allocation decisions. However, there are challenges in accessing and using some of these sources, particularly economic and social data, as they may be limited or uncertain. The councils face difficulty in making allocation decisions due to the complexity and potential controversy of these decisions, as well as the economic and social implications for stakeholders in each sector. The South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico councils have developed policies outlining criteria for initiating allocation reviews, but neither has established a process for conducting these reviews or specified how they will be documented. GAO recommends that the NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries work with the councils to develop documented processes for allocating fish stocks and specify how these reviews will be documented.\n", "The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) has a responsibility to ensure that schools funded by the federal government meet the educational needs of Indian children with disabilities. However, a recent report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that BIE schools are not consistently providing these students with the special education services required by their individualized education programs (IEPs). The report identified several issues with the provision of special education services at BIE schools, including the failure to make up missed services and the challenges of obtaining qualified special education staff. In addition, the report highlighted limitations in BIE's oversight and support for special education programs at its schools, such as inconsistent monitoring and a lack of expertise among staff in BIE's Education Resource Centers. The GAO made several recommendations to address these issues, including establishing consistent requirements for making up missed services, creating a community of practice to share promising practices for recruiting and retaining special education staff, and developing training requirements for Education Resource Center staff. Overall, the report concludes that BIE needs to take steps to improve its management and oversight of special education programs at its schools in order to ensure that Indian children with disabilities are receiving the education they are entitled to.", "In fiscal year 2019, states are required to spend at least 8 percent of CCDF funding for \u201cquality activities\u201d\u2014activities that are designed to improve the quality of child care services the state provides. These activities may include supporting the professional development of the child care workforce and improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers. States must also spend at least 70 percent of discretionary funds that remain on subsidies for eligible families. States reported using fiscal year 2017 CCDF funds to entirely or mostly fund child care activities such as child care resource and referral systems, consumer education, and health and safety standards establishment and training. These activities were found to affect nonsubsidized children receiving child care as well. States plan to spend new CCDF funds on licensing, consumer education, and professional development, which will also indirectly benefit nonsubsidized children. However, many states are still uncertain about their spending plans due to ongoing legislative processes and uncertainty about the ongoing availability of funds.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) uses contracts to procure various supplies and services. The federal acquisition process consists of three phases: pre-award, award, and contract performance. Contracting officials complete activities in accordance with federal statutes and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) during these phases. Before awarding a contract, FAR requires contracting officials to review information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), which can include descriptions of a contractor's past safety and health violations. Additionally, for competitively awarded acquisitions using negotiated procedures, agencies must evaluate prospective contractors' past performance, including safety incidents. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets and enforces safety and health standards for private sector employers, including federal contractors. OSHA conducts inspections to enforce these standards, both programmed and unprogrammed. However, data limitations prevent comprehensive matching of federal contracting data with OSHA inspection data, making it difficult to determine the incidence of safety and health violations among all DOD contractors. The Department of Labor (DOL) could explore the feasibility of requiring a corporate identification number in OSHA's inspection database and enabling its website to be searched by that number. Furthermore, DOD can provide information to contracting officials about the OSHA website and explore the feasibility of requiring a safety performance rating for contracts in high-risk industries.", "Offshore aquaculture, the rearing of marine organisms in ocean waters beyond significant coastal influence, has the potential to increase U.S. seafood production and provide economic opportunities for coastal communities. However, there are concerns about the environmental impact and negative effects on other coastal activities. Developing offshore aquaculture will require a regulatory framework, environmental protection measures, and capacity building. Regulatory uncertainty is currently a major barrier to developing offshore aquaculture in federal waters. Congressional action may be necessary to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework. Controversy arises from different perspectives of aquaculturalists, environmentalists, fishermen, and others. Global aquaculture production has been increasing and now makes up 47% of global fish production, but U.S. aquaculture production has stagnated and accounts for a relatively small portion of total U.S. seafood production. The development of offshore aquaculture in federal waters could help increase U.S. seafood production and reduce the reliance on seafood imports. However, there are challenges related to the regulatory framework, environmental concerns, and economic viability of offshore aquaculture. The future growth of the U.S. aquaculture industry will depend on factors such as technical advances, economic feasibility, government support, and addressing environmental impacts.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a plan, known as the 921 plan, which outlines eight initiatives aimed at reforming various aspects of its operations. The plan addresses most of the requirements outlined in section 921, including providing a schedule and cost estimate for conducting the reforms. The initiatives identified in the plan include improving civilian hiring, reforming human resources regulations, establishing a common human resources service delivery model, implementing strategic sourcing practices, improving maintenance work packages and bills of material, enhancing munitions readiness, expanding the use of service requirements review boards, and implementing category management practices. While these initiatives address some of the findings and recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), there are areas where the initiatives fall short. For example, the human resources service delivery initiative only applies to certain defense agencies and does not address all human resources service providers identified in a prior GAO report. The maintenance work packages and bills of material initiative focuses on improving the accuracy of bills of material, but does not address other planning factors. Similarly, the service requirements review boards initiative expands the use of these boards but does not indicate whether guidance has been provided on their timing. Overall, it is difficult to assess the feasibility of DOD's reform effort because many of the initiatives involve collecting information that will lay the groundwork for future reforms. While DOD claims to have made progress in implementing the initiatives, insufficient documentation was provided to independently assess this progress. The plan also lacks clear outcome-oriented goals and performance measures, and progress on some initiatives appears to be slower than anticipated. DOD has reported significant cost savings from its reform efforts, but these savings have not been independently validated. The plan identifies costs of at least $116.3 million to $116.8 million to implement the initiatives through fiscal year 2021, although funding needs for some initiatives have not been fully determined or met. DOD has made changes to the composition of the reform teams and the framework for managing the reform efforts, but the effectiveness of these changes remains unclear.", "The Mexico City Policy, also known as the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy, is a U.S. government policy that restricts funding for foreign NGOs that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. The policy has been rescinded or reinstated by different administrations since it was first announced in 1984. In 2017, the Trump Administration reinstated and expanded the policy, which now applies to all global health assistance provided by U.S. departments and agencies. The policy applies to billions of dollars in annual assistance, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and malaria programs. Foreign NGOs that receive U.S. assistance are required to agree not to perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive funding. The policy does not apply to global health contracts, food and water assistance, direct assistance by U.S.-based organizations, or assistance provided directly to national governments or multilateral organizations. As of September 2018, U.S. agencies reported applying the policy to 1,309 awards, with an estimated total value of almost $29 billion. Over $12 billion in funding remained to be obligated as of that date. USAID and CDC had the most awards subject to the policy, and HIV/AIDS programs in Africa were the largest recipient of funding subject to the policy. The policy has resulted in some NGOs declining U.S. funding due to their inability to comply with the policy's requirements. Two major NGOs, Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, declined the largest prime awards due to their inability to meet the policy's conditions.", "Under traditional Medicare, hospitals are paid for inpatient and outpatient services under two distinct payment systems. Inpatient services are paid under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which provides a flat fee per beneficiary stay. Outpatient services are paid under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System, which provides a flat fee per service. Congress has established payment adjustments for certain hospitals under the IPPS, including the Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) designation, which enhances payments to hospitals that meet certain criteria. MDHs must demonstrate that at least 60 percent of their inpatient days or discharges are attributable to Medicare beneficiaries, have 100 or fewer beds, and are located in a rural area. MDHs receive additional payments based on their historic reported inpatient operating costs compared to the IPPS rate. The MDH program is temporary and must be periodically extended by Congress. MDHs represent a small proportion of rural hospitals, with the majority being Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs). The MDH designation offers a relatively small financial benefit compared to other rural hospital designations, and the benefit only applies to inpatient services. The number of MDHs and the number receiving additional payments has declined in recent years. MDHs have varied on operational and financial metrics, including the share of Medicare revenue from inpatient care, measures of Medicare dependence, and profit margins. Regression analysis found that rural hospitals with fewer beds were associated with higher Medicare shares of inpatient days and discharges, indicating that the MDH program effectively targets Medicare-dependent hospitals. However, these hospitals generally received a smaller share of total care revenue from Medicare compared to other hospitals. MDHs experienced a decline in Medicare revenue from inpatient services and declining profit margins. Medicare profit margins and total facility profit margins for MDHs declined from fiscal year 2011 to 2017. MDHs were not profitable in 2017, indicating that their revenue was less than the costs of providing services.", "NASA's plans for human spaceflight have changed multiple times over the past 15 years, with a focus on lunar landings and missions to asteroids. However, NASA has faced challenges in developing systems to transport humans to space, resulting in canceled programs and cost and schedule delays. The agency has struggled with creating a sound business case for these programs and has not followed best practices for establishing cost and schedule baselines. NASA's current human spaceflight programs, including Orion, SLS, and Exploration Ground Systems, have experienced cost overruns and schedule delays. The agency has implemented some recommendations to address these issues but more action is needed. NASA's Artemis III mission, which aims to return humans to the Moon by 2024, is facing coordination challenges, limited cost information, and a lack of alternatives analysis. The agency needs to ensure synchronization reviews are conducted, conduct a joint cost and schedule confidence level, schedule key milestone reviews, develop an overall cost estimate for the mission, finalize a document outlining the rationale for the lunar architecture, and establish a process for analyzing alternatives. NASA has agreed with these recommendations and has provided estimated completion dates for each.", "The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution establishes that federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws. This principle, known as federal preemption, is a fundamental aspect of the modern regulatory state. Federal preemption occurs when federal law supersedes state laws, and it has a significant impact on various industries, such as drugs and medical devices, banking, air transportation, securities, automobile safety, and tobacco. There are several debates surrounding federal preemption, including the benefits of uniform national regulations and the concentration of expertise in federal agencies versus the importance of policy experimentation, democratic accountability, and state common law. The Supreme Court has identified different types of federal preemption, including express preemption, implied preemption (field and conflict preemption), as well as different types of conflict preemption such as impossibility preemption and obstacle preemption. The Court has also considered the primacy of congressional intent and the presumption against preemption in its preemption jurisprudence. The Court's interpretation of preemption clauses in federal statutes is an essential part of determining the scope of federal preemption. Additionally, the Court has recognized the role of savings clauses in preserving certain categories of state law from federal preemption. Understanding federal preemption is crucial for Congress when crafting laws that involve overlapping federal and state interests.", "Air ambulance providers use helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft depending on the distance and location of the patients they transport. Helicopters are often used for shorter-distance transports or transports from the scene of an accident to a hospital, while fixed-wing aircraft are used for longer-distance transports between hospitals. Air ambulance providers respond to emergencies without knowing patients' health insurance coverage, which means that privately-insured patients cannot always choose to be transported by an air ambulance provider in their insurer's network and may receive a balance bill for the difference between the provider's charges and the amount paid by the insurer. This is in addition to copayments and deductibles. Air ambulance providers are prohibited from sending balance bills to Medicare and Medicaid patients, while uninsured patients might be held responsible for the entire price charged. Both providers and insurers have little incentive to negotiate contracts with agreed-upon payment rates for air ambulance transports due to their emergency nature and high price. Approaches to limit balance billing may target either providers, insurers, or both, but targeting one over the other can have undesired outcomes. Some states have attempted to limit balance billing for air ambulance services through regulation, education, and public pressure. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 requires the FAA to assess the availability of information to the public regarding the location of heliports and helipads used by air ambulance services. Increases in the prices charged for air ambulance transports have made balance billing more of financial risk for those with private insurance, and the proportion of out-of-network air ambulance transports is higher than other types of emergency services. Limited data is available on the extent of balance billing and the amount patients actually pay. Some air ambulance providers offer discounts and payment options to reduce balance bills, but even with these discounts, patients may still pay thousands of dollars. Some states have enacted laws to limit balance billing by regulating insurers, but challenges related to federal preemption have arisen. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 requires the formation of an advisory committee on air ambulance patient billing to make recommendations related to disclosure of charges, options to prevent balance billing, and steps states can take to protect consumers. Some states have also attempted to limit balance billing through education and public pressure.", "The National Mediation Board (NMB) is a federal agency responsible for ensuring the independence of air and rail carriers and employees in matters of self-organization and collective bargaining. It has a three-member board appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In 2018, the NMB reorganized its agency components and created new offices to improve management and oversight. It hired a Chief Financial Officer and a Chief Information Officer to oversee budget, accounting, and information technology functions. The NMB has three program areas: representation, mediation and alternative dispute resolution, and arbitration. The agency is overseen by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management, and it has an agreement with the National Labor Relations Board's Office of Inspector General for independent audit and investigative oversight. The NMB is subject to government-wide requirements for cloud service authorizations through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made several recommendations to the NMB, including developing policies for employee requests for outside employment, addressing the backlog of arbitration cases, and improving organizational climate assessment and survey results. The NMB has implemented some recommendations but has more work to do. The GAO also found that the NMB lacks effective internal controls for managing its appropriations and addressing audit findings. The GAO has made several recommendations to the NMB to address these issues. The NMB has agreed to take action on the recommendations but has not provided specific timelines for implementation.", "The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the United States' dependence on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production in China. Congress is particularly concerned about U.S. shortages of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceuticals, as the United States ramps up efforts to contain COVID-19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient industrial capacity. Reduced exports from China have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the United States, and China's government has directed production and distribution of medical supplies for domestic use, exacerbating the shortage. As China's manufacturing sector recovers, the Chinese government may release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, but these decisions are likely to be driven in part by political calculations. The outbreak has also had a direct economic impact on U.S. firms operating in China and has led to disruptions in global supply chains. The Chinese government's efforts to restart business activities have been slow and uneven, leading to bottlenecks and delays in imports and exports. The economic slowdown in China is expected to have a significant impact on U.S. industries that rely on exports and imports from China. Congress is now facing choices that will influence the longer-term U.S. trade trajectory with China, including decisions on tariffs, supply chain diversification, and efforts to increase domestic production of medical supplies."]
