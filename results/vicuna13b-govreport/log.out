["1. Innovation involves translating ideas into new products or services through the process of innovation, which is inherently risky.\n2. The path from innovation to commercialization comprises three stages: inventing, transitioning to making, and selling.\n3. FDA and USDA are responsible for overseeing the safety of the food supply. FDA is responsible for virtually all domestic and imported food products except for those regulated by USDA, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, processed egg products, and catfish.\n4. FDA and USDA cooperate with states, tribes, and local food safety and public health agencies to carry out their federal responsibilities, which include inspections of facilities where food is produced. FDA conducts risk-based inspections of high-risk and non-high-risk food facilities, while USDA conducts inspections at least once per operating shift or maintains a constant presence.\n5. FDA and USDA also oversee food labeling of the products under their respective jurisdictions. USDA requires pre-approval of all labels before manufacturers can market their products, while FDA ensures that foods are properly labeled to avoid misbranding, which is prohibited by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n6. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempts GRAS substances from the general requirement that companies obtain FDA approval before marketing food containing a new additive. GRAS substances include hundreds of spices, artificial flavors, emulsifiers, binders, vitamins, minerals, and preservatives that manufacturers add to enhance a food\u2019s taste, texture, nutritional content, or shelf life.\n7. To claim a substance is GRAS, a company must conclude that there is common knowledge about the safety of the substance among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety.\n\nSOURCE: \"Food Labeling; GRAS Notice Procedures,\" Federal Register, Volume 79, Number 191,", "The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) is a federal law that establishes requirements and guidance for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) when appointing members to advisory committees. EPA must follow uniform procedures to establish and operate advisory committees, balance the membership in terms of views and functions, and comply with federal ethics regulations to identify and prevent conflicts of interest. The EPA Federal Advisory Committee Management Division developed the Federal Advisory Committee Handbook to clarify roles and responsibilities for FACA compliance. The Ethics Office at EPA is responsible for following federal ethics requirements, ensuring that financial disclosure forms are reviewed, and providing guidance. EPA can establish either non-discretionary or discretionary advisory committees, and may appoint different types of members, including federal employees. If a federal employee is expected to serve for less than 130 days, they should be designated as a special government employee.\n\nAccording to the Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, one of the primary reasons for passing FACA was to ensure public access to the records and documents of advisory committees, fostering greater transparency and accountability. The designated agency ethics official and deputy ethics officials oversee EPA's ethics program and review financial disclosure reports for prospective committee members. The Designated Agency Ethics Official delegates authority to more than 100 deputy ethics officials to carry out EPA's ethics program.\n\nEPA can establish a variety of advisory committees, including the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee, the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, and the National Drinking Water Advisory Council. The agency must approve the establishment of any subcommittees formed to assist committees with their work. EPA appoints different types of members to its advisory committees, depending on the needs of the committee and other considerations.", "Climate change poses severe threats to physical and ecological systems and is expected to cause more frequent and intense extreme weather events. The National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, and National Academy of Engineering have identified the need for decision-makers to have a basic set of information to understand and adapt to the effects of climate change. The federal government collects and manages climate information, including temperature and precipitation data, projections, and tools to make this information more useful to decision-makers. The Fourth National Climate Assessment and the U.S. Global Change Research Program reference various sources of climate information. Multiple future scenarios allow planners and engineers to consider different possible conditions for a project's design or service life. DOD requires all military installations to develop master plans based on a strategic assessment of the operational mission and expected use of the installation, covering at least a 10-year period and updated every 5 years.", "The article describes how nursing homes are required to keep residents safe from harm, and when abuse is alleged, a combination of federal, state and local agencies, as well as the nursing homes themselves, play a role in investigating. Federal laws establish minimum requirements nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including standards for the quality of care. The changes were implemented in three phases, starting November 28, 2016.
