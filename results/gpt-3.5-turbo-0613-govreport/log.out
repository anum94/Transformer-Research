["Cell-cultured meat production involves several phases, including biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing. During the biopsy phase, tissue samples are taken from animals, and during the cell banking phase, desirable traits are selected and cells are stored for later use. In the growth phase, cells are placed in a bioreactor and begin to divide and differentiate. After the cells have grown sufficiently, they are harvested and prepared into a product. The specific methods and composition of the final product are still unknown, as cell-cultured meat firms are in the middle stage of prototyping and testing. The lack of specific information poses challenges for regulators and industry stakeholders. There are open questions regarding tissue collection, genetic engineering, antibiotic use, and the growth medium. Stakeholders are concerned about the regulatory approval process for genetically engineered products and the potential presence of antibiotics in the final product.", "A variety of federal laws, regulations, and policies establish requirements and guidance for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) when appointing members to serve on advisory committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) ensures uniform procedures govern the establishment and operation of advisory committees, and requires committees to have balanced membership in terms of points of view and functions. Federal ethics regulations are also in place to prevent conflicts of interest among committee members. EPA's Federal Advisory Committee Management Division is responsible for committee management and compliance with FACA, and the EPA's Ethics Office oversees the agency's ethics program. EPA can establish both non-discretionary and discretionary committees, and can appoint members as federal employees or non-employee representatives. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains a government-wide database of advisory committees, including those for which EPA officials are responsible. EPA has an established process for appointing committee members, which involves soliciting nominations, evaluating candidates, and obtaining approvals from relevant EPA offices before final appointment decisions are made. However, in fiscal year 2018, EPA did not follow a key step in its process when appointing members to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC). Overall, EPA generally followed its established process for most advisory committees.", "Climate change poses serious risks to physical and ecological systems, and the effects and costs of extreme weather events will increase. Decision makers need information on climate conditions and projections to make informed choices. Climate information must be tailored to meet the needs of each decision maker. The Department of Defense (DOD) collects and manages climate information from various sources. Climate projections are a range of possible scenarios for future conditions. DOD requires installations to develop master plans based on operational missions and expected use. Individual DOD projects must adhere to facilities design standards that consider climate impacts. Extreme weather and climate change can damage infrastructure, resulting in budgetary risks for DOD. Some installations have integrated climate considerations into their plans, while others have not. Examples of installations incorporating climate considerations include Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. Instances of installations experiencing damage from extreme weather include Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.", "Nursing homes are required to keep residents safe from harm, and federal, state, and local agencies are responsible for investigating abuse allegations. Federal laws establish minimum requirements for nursing homes, and these standards cover resident rights, quality of care, and quality of life. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the federal standards, and CMS regional offices oversee state activities. State survey agencies assess nursing homes to ensure they meet the standards through standard surveys and investigations. If a violation is found, the nursing home may face penalties such as fines or termination from Medicare and Medicaid programs. Abuse deficiencies in nursing homes have increased over the years, with higher percentages of severe cases. Investigations into abuse deficiencies are often initiated through complaints or facility-reported incidents. Enforcement actions for abuse deficiencies are imposed and implemented infrequently, with fines being the most common penalty. The number of nursing homes with abuse deficiencies has also doubled over the years. Some nursing homes have had multiple abuse deficiencies cited in consecutive years, indicating potential patterns of abuse. Characteristics such as ownership type and bed size differ between nursing homes with multiple abuse deficiencies and those without any deficiencies.", "The legal framework governing mixed high-level waste (HLW) at INL is defined by various federal laws, cleanup agreements, and regulations. DOE primarily regulates radioactive components of HLW under the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Calcine waste and saltstone waste are considered HLW under these laws. Hazardous components of mixed HLW are regulated by EPA or authorized states under RCRA, and Idaho and New Mexico have authorized state programs for managing their respective HLW. The IWTU reengineering project at INL is currently in phase two, which involves implementing fixes and modifications to the facility. The project has experienced cost overruns and schedule delays. EM divides its cleanup work into capital asset projects and operations activities, each governed by different project management policies. EM's capital asset projects include construction and cleanup projects, while operations activities include ongoing facility operations and waste management. The IWTU project was managed as a capital asset project during construction and is now being managed as an operations activity. The IWTU project has not fully followed best practices for cost and schedule estimates, and the EVM system used to measure project performance is producing unreliable data. Additionally, EM has partially followed best practices for monitoring projects with start-up risks. The cost estimate for the IWTU project is not comprehensive and does not account for all possible costs. The schedule estimate has some sequencing issues, an inaccurate critical path, and unreasonable values of total float. EM should establish requirements for classifying work as an operations activity and revise its cleanup policy to follow project management leading practices. DOE has implemented an oversight requirement called the operational release milestone for selected projects, which includes developing an operational release plan and providing progress updates to the PMRC. EM has not fully followed best practices for cost and schedule estimates for the IWTU project, which may impact its ability to plan resources effectively.", "The selected agencies use required and optional fields on comment forms to collect identity information from commenters, such as name, address, and email address. However, anonymous comments are accepted in practice, and commenters can submit under fictitious names or provide fabricated information. There are no mechanisms in place to check the validity of identity information submitted through comment forms. The agencies also collect information about users' interactions with their websites, such as IP addresses and browser details. Internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters varies among agencies, with most guidance focused on the comment intake or response to comment phases. The agencies' treatment of identity information during the public comment process varies, particularly in terms of how duplicate comments are posted. There is a lack of communication regarding the limitations and inconsistencies in how identity information is posted, which limits public users' ability to use the data effectively. Regulations.gov provides some disclosure statements regarding the disclosure of identity information but does not provide specific information about what information users should expect to find in the comment data. Participating agencies direct public users to Regulations.gov for information, but do not provide details on posting practices and limitations. The lack of communication about posting processes may inhibit meaningful participation in the rulemaking process. Recommendations have been made for agencies to establish policies and communicate them more clearly, and some progress has been made by the SEC in implementing these recommendations. Other agencies are in the process of developing policies and statements for their websites, but specific details about posting duplicate comments are not always included. Overall, the lack of transparency in posting identity information associated with public comments hinders public users' ability to participate effectively in the rulemaking process.", "In order to be eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit, individuals must have Medicare Part A and must be certified as having a terminal illness with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. When enrolling in Medicare hospice care, beneficiaries can receive various types of services in different settings. The Medicare hospice benefit covers services and supplies for the management of the terminal illness, including physician and nursing services, medical equipment, and counseling. The hospice provider works with the beneficiary and family to develop a plan of care. Hospice care can continue beyond 6 months if the eligibility requirements are still met. CMS pays hospices based on the level of care provided. For-profit and non-profit hospices serve about the same percentage of Medicare hospice beneficiaries, but for-profit providers receive a higher proportion of Medicare payments. This is because for-profit providers have a larger percentage of beneficiaries with non-cancer diagnoses, which typically result in longer stays and thus higher payments. For-profit and non-profit hospices have similar scores on quality measures, but there are variations in performance on other care indicators.", "Federal agencies rely on computerized information systems and electronic data to carry out operations and process essential information. Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting these systems and data to maintain public confidence. The IRS is responsible for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive financial and taxpayer information on its systems. However, taxpayer information held by third-party providers is generally not subject to the same requirements. This leaves it vulnerable to theft and misuse by fraudsters, who often target third parties like paid preparers and tax software providers. The number of electronically filed tax returns has been increasing, making more data vulnerable to security incidents. Multiple IRS offices have oversight responsibilities for third-party providers, such as educating preparers about information security risks and investigating security incident reports. The IRS has taken steps to address identity theft refund fraud, including forming the Security Summit and launching the Identity Theft Tax Refund Fraud - Information Sharing and Analysis Center. The IRS has also implemented requirements for third-party providers through its Authorized e-file Provider program but has not fully incorporated the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions to implement comprehensive information security programs. IRS publications provide some information on the FTC Safeguards Rule but do not detail all the required elements. Modifying the Authorized e-file Provider program requirements to explicitly incorporate these elements would help ensure all providers are aware and comply with the rule. Additionally, the program does not outline minimum information security standards for paid preparers. Many paid preparers are unaware of how to protect taxpayer information on their systems, leading to confusion and increased risk.", "The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act is a federal law that governs state child-care programs for low-income working families. It was reauthorized in 2014 to focus on improving the quality of child-care services and development for participating children. The Office of Child Care (OCC), a program office within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), works with states to administer the CCDF program. States must develop a State Plan that identifies how CCDF funds will be spent and designates a lead agency responsible for administering child-care programs. OCC reviews and approves State Plans and provides oversight of states' compliance with program requirements. \n\nOCC has implemented a Monitoring System to review states annually, focusing on program integrity and accountability among other topics. The CCDF program is considered a high-risk program for improper payments, and OCC oversees states' estimation and reporting of improper payments. OCC also reviews and approves states' program-integrity activities, although most approved State Plans did not provide the results of these activities. OCC lacks established policies for staff to follow when reviewing and approving State Plans, which limits consistency and knowledge retention. OCC officials stated that they provided training materials and draft documents to guide the review process, but these documents were not finalized as written policies. OCC officials pointed to staffing changes and regional differences as reasons for needing flexibility in their policies. However, it is possible for OCC to establish written policies that provide consistency while still accommodating variations. Documentation of the internal control system should be a continuous and integral part of operations.", "The purpose of the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act (PMIAA) is to enhance program and project management in federal agencies. The act includes requirements for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and 24 agencies listed in the CFO Act. It mandates OMB to establish government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management, engage with the private sector for best practices, conduct portfolio reviews of agency programs, and create a 5-year strategic plan for program and project management. The act also establishes the Program Management Policy Council (PMPC) to improve agency practices related to program management. OPM is responsible for identifying key skills and competencies needed for program and project managers and establishing new job series and career paths for them. OMB has developed a strategic plan for PMIAA implementation, which includes three key strategies: coordinated governance, regular reviews, and strengthening program management capacity. OMB has also published a set of program and project management standards for agencies to apply to internal management processes. However, OMB's standards are less detailed than widely accepted standards from the Project Management Institute (PMI). OMB's governance structure for developing and maintaining the standards is incomplete in terms of delineating roles and responsibilities, obtaining stakeholder input, and developing and approving standards. Further development and maintenance of the standards is not clearly outlined in OMB's plan.", "A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted the increasing trend of abuse deficiencies in nursing homes between 2013 and 2017. While abuse deficiencies accounted for less than 1% of total deficiencies in each of those years, the number of abuse deficiencies more than doubled during that period. In addition, the severity of abuse deficiencies increased in 2017 compared to 2013, with more cases causing actual harm to residents. The GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) lacked key information on the type of abuse and the perpetrator involved, hampering its ability to address the issue effectively. The GAO recommended that CMS require state survey agencies to report abuse and perpetrator type and that it develop guidance on the information nursing homes should include in facility-reported incidents. The report also identified gaps in CMS's referral process for abuse incidents, suggesting that referrals to law enforcement were often delayed, resulting in missed opportunities for investigation and prosecution. The GAO recommended that CMS address these gaps by immediately referring reasonable suspicions of a crime against a resident to law enforcement.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with disabilities caused or worsened by their military service. The amount of compensation is determined by the severity of the disability and is based on a rating scale. Veterans can receive compensation for multiple conditions, and VA calculates a combined disability rating to determine the monthly compensation. The number of veterans receiving disability compensation has increased in recent years, resulting in a rise in obligations for the VA. The VA's Compensation Service is responsible for determining eligibility and processing claims for disability compensation. The VA uses an electronic system called the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to review and make rating decisions for claims. The VA also has a reevaluation process to ensure that veterans' conditions are being rated correctly. Veterans can receive healthcare through VA medical facilities, non-VA providers paid for by the VA, or their own health insurance. The VA has a priority system in place to determine eligibility and prioritize healthcare services. Veterans can also receive community care if the VA is unable to provide the necessary care. The number of veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system has increased over the years, resulting in a budget increase for VHA and an increase in the use of community care programs. The VA tracks its performance in providing timely and accurate disability compensation decisions, and accuracy ratings have been high in recent years. Veterans receiving disability compensation often use VA healthcare for their service-connected conditions, with an average of four conditions per veteran. The use of community care for service-connected conditions is not well-documented. The health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions who receive VA healthcare services have not been extensively studied, except for veterans with PTSD. Limited research has been conducted due to challenges in linking data between the VA's benefits and healthcare systems. VA officials have acknowledged the need for better data collection and agreements to facilitate research on health outcomes for veterans with service-connected conditions. The VA's strategic plan includes goals for data-driven decision making and improving outcomes for veterans.", "Foreign students interested in studying in the United States must first be admitted to an SEVP-certified school or university before applying for a nonimmigrant visa. A visa holder must present themselves for inspection at a U.S. port of entry to determine admissibility. Schools seeking to enroll foreign students must pay an application fee and petition for SEVP certification. SEVIS is used to track and provide oversight of foreign students. Schools must provide evidence of legitimacy, accreditation, and eligibility during the certification process. DSOs act as liaisons between foreign students, the school, and government agencies. ICE conducts site visits and analyzes documentation to determine a school's eligibility for certification. Recertification is required every two years. ICE has developed a risk assessment model and tools to manage fraud risks in the program. Fraud risks fall into four categories: schools, students, DSOs, and third-party brokers. ICE has taken steps to strengthen fraud risk management and improve collaboration with criminal investigations. ICE has also made changes to SEVIS to help identify fraud. However, ICE has not fully developed and implemented a fraud risk profile.", "Zika is a virus primarily spread through mosquito bites but can also be transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during pregnancy. It can cause symptoms such as fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and joint and muscle pain. In pregnant women, Zika can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and severe birth defects. The virus has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect of the brain, and other neurological disorders. Zika was first identified in Uganda in 1947 and spread to other parts of the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean. As of 2017, transmission of the virus was occurring in 79 countries. Several vaccines are in development, but none have been approved yet. The US government, through the agencies USAID and State, has allocated funding to respond to the Zika outbreak overseas. USAID has obligated and disbursed about $385 million of the $390 million available for the Zika response, while State has obligated and disbursed about three-quarters of its funding. However, USAID did not track the uses of the funding on a country basis, making it difficult to assess the impact of the response activities in each country. The response activities included mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, capacity building, and research.", "A 2020 report by the United Nations reveals that nearly 10% of Thai workers in the seafood industry are working under forced labor conditions. These workers are subjected to involuntary work and coercion, which constitute forced labor. If this sample is representative of the entire Thai seafood industry, it suggests that tens of thousands of workers are working in forced labor conditions. The fishing industry is particularly vulnerable to illicit practices such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which can lead to forced labor. IUU fishing has social, economic, and environmental impacts and can involve activities such as fishing without a license, failing to report catches, conducting unauthorized transshipments, and more. It is a threat to food security and socioeconomic stability around the world and is often associated with organized crime and human trafficking. Forced labor can occur at various points in the seafood supply chain, making it difficult to detect. It can happen on fishing vessels, during seafood processing, or even when fish caught with forced labor is mixed with legally caught seafood. Some seafood may also be used as feed for farm-raised seafood, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the supply chain. The import of goods made with forced labor is prohibited by federal law, particularly the Tariff Act of 1930, which bans goods produced with convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor. The Forced Labor Division of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces this law and carries out a four-phase process to detect and detain goods suspected of being produced with forced labor. This process includes assessing leads, investigating cases, reviewing evidence, and implementing withhold release orders (WROs), which allow the detention of shipments. CBP can also issue civil penalties for forced labor violations. However, CBP has limited resources to gather firsthand information on labor practices overseas and relies on information from external sources, such as NGOs, industry parties, and other federal agencies. Since 2016, CBP has issued 13 WROs, including one for seafood imports caught by the fishing vessel Tunago No. 61.", "SOCOM, or U.S. Special Operations Command, has a unique structure and responsibilities that include both combatant command duties and military service-like functions. The commander of SOCOM is responsible for training and ensuring the readiness of special operations forces (SOF) and monitoring their preparedness for assigned missions. SOCOM is also responsible for developing special operations strategy, tactics, and doctrine, as well as acquiring specialized equipment and submitting requirements for intelligence support. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD-SO/LIC) has oversight and policy responsibilities for special operations activities. Congress has made efforts to strengthen the role of the ASD-SO/LIC through legislation, resulting in the development of recommendations and actions to increase the ASD-SO/LIC's involvement in the management of SOF and special operations. These actions include enhancing the ASD-SO/LIC's role in budget, personnel, program, and acquisition functions. Many of the actions taken so far formalize pre-existing, informal relationships between the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. However, there are still several actions that need to be implemented, with some lacking clear time frames for completion.", "Two State entities, State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and State's U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem (ConGen), play important roles in providing education assistance in the West Bank and Gaza. State/PRM funds and oversees education assistance provided by UNRWA, and State/ConGen funds and oversees U.S. educational assistance. UNRWA provides education, health care, social services, microfinance, and emergency assistance to Palestine refugees. UNRWA administers over 700 schools across its five fields of operation, and uses the curricula and textbooks of host governments. The Palestinian Authority provides all textbooks used in UNRWA and Palestinian Authority schools in the West Bank and Gaza except for English language textbooks. The U.S. government provided an estimated $243 million for education assistance in the West Bank and Gaza from fiscal years 2015 to 2017. State provided about $193 million, of which $187 million went to UNRWA, while USAID provided about $50 million. State did not fund textbooks, except for English language textbooks used in UNRWA schools. UNRWA reported expending about $877 million for education in the West Bank and Gaza during this time period. UNRWA's largest education expenditure was personnel-related. UNRWA spent about $2 million on educational materials, including $1 million on English language textbooks, which were partially funded by U.S. contributions. Educational materials made up less than one percent of UNRWA's education expenditures.", "This text discusses the establishment of business centers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the need for evaluating their effectiveness and impact. The USDA has established business centers in all eight of its mission areas, which are responsible for delivering administrative services. These services include financial management, human resources, information technology, procurement, and property management. The business centers vary in their approach to providing these services, with some mission areas grouping all administrative services together and others dividing financial management responsibilities between the business center and other offices. The USDA has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the business centers on its ability to deliver administrative services. Stakeholders have expressed concerns about staffing vacancies and employee confusion resulting from the reforms. The GAO recommends that the USDA develop outcome-oriented performance goals and measures to assess the effectiveness and impact of the business centers. USDA generally agreed with the findings and recommendations in the report.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for implementing and overseeing the security of the nation's civil aviation system. They perform screening operations at about 440 TSA-regulated airports nationwide. Passengers must pass through security checkpoints where their person, identification documents, and accessible property are screened. TSA conducts covert tests to assess the effectiveness of their screening procedures. These tests involve testers attempting to smuggle threat objects through the checkpoint or checked baggage screening process. TSA uses a risk-informed approach to select locations and scenarios for these tests, taking into account threat likelihood, vulnerability, and consequence. TSA has made efforts to improve their covert testing process and ensure the quality of test results.", "Out of the eight coal mine operator bankruptcies identified, three resulted in a transfer of estimated benefit liability from the coal operator to the Trust Fund, while the remaining five did not, according to the Department of Labor (DOL). Self-insured operators assume the financial responsibility for providing black lung benefits to their employees, while operators that do not self-insure obtain coverage from commercial insurance companies or other authorized entities. From 2014 to 2016, three self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies resulted in a transfer of $865 million in benefit liabilities to the Trust Fund, which was an increase from the previous estimate of between $313 million to $325 million. The amount of collateral required from self-insured operators did not fully cover their estimated benefit liabilities, resulting in the transfer of excess liabilities to the Trust Fund. However, self-insured operator bankruptcies such as Arch Coal, Peabody Energy, and Walter Energy did not affect the Trust Fund as their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a reorganized company or purchaser. Other self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies since 2016, including Cambrian Coal, Cloud Peak Energy, Murray Energy, and Westmoreland Coal, may have an impact on the Trust Fund, but the exact effect is uncertain. The DOL did not estimate future benefit liability when setting collateral or regularly review operators to monitor their changing financial conditions in the past. However, a new process for coal mine operator self-insurance has been implemented, which requires operators to periodically submit financial and claims information for the assessment of insolvency risk. Collateral amounts required will be based on a percentage of the operator's estimated benefit liability. The DOL could revoke an operator's ability to self-insure, fine operators for operating without insurance, or place liens on operator assets to protect the Trust Fund, but these actions were not always taken in the past. The DOL plans to implement procedures to clarify the duration of self-insurance authority, submission timelines for renewal applications, and conditions for non-renewal. Procedures for self-insured coal mine operator appeals and monitoring of commercially insured operators also need to be developed and implemented.", "State and local governments rely on various revenue sources, including federal grants, user charges, and taxes. When spending exceeds revenue, fiscal pressures arise, and governments must seek solutions such as reducing spending or increasing revenue. Changes in spending and revenue can be influenced by economic, demographic, and policy changes. From 1998 to 2018, state and local government expenditures increased, with health expenditures experiencing the largest increase. Revenues also increased during this period, with taxes and federal grants being the largest sources. Expenditure growth generally exceeded revenue growth, resulting in fiscal pressures for state and local governments. Specific expenditure categories, such as public welfare and education services, grew faster than state GDP in many states. Federal grants were the fastest growing revenue source, followed by user charges and taxes. Property taxes experienced the highest growth among the tax categories.", "The number of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans eligible for both VA and IHS services is unknown. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that in 2017, approximately 141,000 AI/AN individuals identified themselves as veterans. However, there are discrepancies between the counts reported by IHS and VA. According to IHS, in fiscal year 2017, 48,169 active IHS users self-identified as veterans, while VA reported that 80,507 VA-enrolled veterans self-identified as AI/AN. VA is responsible for providing healthcare services to eligible veterans and served 6.8 million veterans in fiscal year 2017. VA's healthcare system includes 170 medical centers, as well as community-based outpatient clinics and other facilities. When services are not available at VA facilities, VA may purchase care from non-VA providers through its community care programs. Eligibility for VA healthcare is based on various factors, including period of active service, discharge status, and income. IHS, on the other hand, provides health services to members of AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS operates a network of hospitals, health centers, and health stations. When needed services are not available at IHS facilities, IHS may pay for external providers through its Purchased/Referred Care program. To be eligible for IHS healthcare services, an individual must generally be a member or descendant of a federally recognized Indian tribe. In instances where an AI/AN veteran is eligible for care from both VA and IHS, VA is the primary payer. In 2010, VA and IHS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to coordinate and share resources. The MOU set five goals to improve access to and quality of healthcare for AI/AN veterans. These goals include increasing access to care, promoting patient-centered collaboration, establishing effective partnerships, ensuring resources are available, and improving health promotion and disease prevention services. The MOU includes areas of collaboration, such as reimbursement, sharing staff, staff training, and information technology interoperability. VA is responsible for administering the MOU and has established the IHS/THP Reimbursement Agreements Program to develop payment and reimbursement policies. Under these policies, VA reimburses IHS and Tribal Health Programs (THP) facilities for services provided to dually eligible AI/AN veterans. VA and IHS officials have established a joint leadership team to oversee MOU implementation, and workgroups have been tasked with implementing strategies to meet the goals of the MOU. However, facility officials have reported limited improvements in national-level collaboration and coordination between VA and IHS. VA and IHS are currently revising the MOU to be broader and more flexible, addressing areas that have not been fully implemented. While VA and IHS have improved their efforts to measure progress towards meeting the goals, the performance measures in the MOU still lack quantitative and measurable targets.", "The Kingpin Act authorizes the US Treasury Department to identify and sanction foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations in order to protect the national security and economy of the United States. The act aims to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations and prevent designated individuals and entities from accessing the US financial system. The designation process involves several steps, including identifying potential targets, gathering evidence, assembling an evidentiary package, conducting legal reviews, consulting with partner agencies, and finally designating the targets. OFAC is the primary office for implementing and enforcing sanctions, while other agencies such as the Department of Justice, State, DHS, DOD, CIA, FBI, and DEA participate in the designation process. Sanctions imposed under the Kingpin Act include blocking assets, prohibiting transactions, denying visas, and imposing penalties on individuals and entities that engage with designated individuals and entities. The majority of Kingpin Act designations are individuals and entities from countries in the Western Hemisphere. The Treasury Department is required to report to Congress on the status of sanctions imposed under the act and to provide information on designated individuals and entities to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Coordination with partner agencies and foreign governments is crucial in the designation process to ensure that ongoing investigations are not jeopardized and to maximize the disruption to drug trafficking organizations.", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is responsible for providing prompt, reliable, and efficient universal postal service to the entire population of the United States. USPS has various stakeholders, including private companies like UPS and FedEx, who both compete and partner with USPS in the mail and delivery industries. In 1970, the Postal Reorganization Act was enacted to transform USPS into an independent establishment with a self-sustaining business model. However, by the early 2000s, USPS faced financial challenges due to declining mail volumes and increasing costs. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act was passed in 2006 to provide USPS with greater pricing flexibility and accountability. USPS's current business model is not financially sustainable due to a decline in mail volume, increased labor costs, and unfunded liabilities. USPS has implemented cost-cutting measures, such as closing retail facilities and increasing the use of non-career employees. However, stakeholder opposition and statutory requirements have limited USPS's ability to address these challenges. USPS is also constrained by federal laws that define the level of postal services it must provide and limit its pricing flexibility. USPS's compensation and benefits costs have been increasing despite efforts to control them, and its unfunded liabilities and debt have become a significant burden. USPS has not made required payments for retiree health and pension benefits, citing its financial condition. Federal laws define the requirements for USPS's retiree health and pension benefits, and USPS is required to prefund its share of retiree health benefits but no longer makes payments for these premiums. USPS is required to finance its pension benefits under specific provisions. Overall, USPS faces financial and operational challenges that require significant changes to its business model and statutory requirements to ensure its long-term sustainability.", "The MESA Complex at Sandia is a facility that produces microelectronics for nuclear weapons. It includes multiple production facilities and buildings, with the SiFab Facility being the primary production facility. The SiFab Facility produces application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) used in nuclear weapons. The complex also includes the Micro Fabrication Facility, which produces strategic radiation-hardened devices. The facilities have clean rooms to maintain a low level of dust. The SiFab Facility produces ASICs at the 350 nm node, while state-of-the-art microelectronics are produced at the 32 nm or below node. Sandia conducts research and development, designs microelectronics, and produces them for weapon programs years in advance. Sandia also produces microelectronics for DOD's weapon delivery platforms. The MESA Complex's budget for 2020 is $283 million, with funding coming from NNSA, DOE's Strategic Partnership Programs, DOE's Laboratory Directed Research and Development work, and DOD's Strategic Partnership Programs. NNSA has undertaken actions to sustain the microelectronics facilities at Sandia until 2025 and is assessing options for producing microelectronics beyond 2025.", "Generally, Congress provides budget authority to agencies through the passage of appropriations acts each fiscal year. When an appropriation expires, and a new one is not enacted, a lapse in appropriations, also called a funding gap, results and the affected agency or program may lack sufficient budget authority to continue operations. Funding gaps can occur at the beginning of a fiscal year when new appropriations, or a continuing resolution, have not yet been enacted. Funding gaps also can occur any time during the year when a continuing resolution expires and may affect a few agencies or all agencies across the federal government. During a lapse in appropriations, employees may continue working if they are exempt from the lapse in appropriations or if an exception to the ADA applies. Exempt employees are those who perform activities funded with budget authority that remains available despite the lapse in appropriations, such as multiple-year or no-year carryover balances. Excepted employees are those who perform activities pursuant to a statutory authority that expressly authorizes an agency to enter into an obligation in advance of an appropriation, or to address emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, as described under the ADA. Over the past 29 years, there have been six lapses in appropriations that led to government shutdowns, ranging in duration from 2 days to 35 days. In the event of a government shutdown, OMB is responsible for ensuring that agencies have addressed the essential actions needed to effectively manage the government shutdown. OMB does so by providing policy guidance and shutdown-related instructions. Agencies are to prepare contingency plans in anticipation of a lapse in appropriations. These plans are key documents that help ensure an orderly shutdown following a lapse in appropriations, as well as continuity of appropriate agency operations. However, the selected agency contingency plans reviewed did not fully align with OMB's guidance. Some key information elements were missing from the plans, including summaries of activities that would and would not continue, the legal basis for retaining employees, and changes to operations in the event of a prolonged shutdown. It is important for agencies to consider and document the effects of a potential prolonged shutdown in their contingency plans. Additionally, agencies' contingency plans did not include complete information about flexibilities available to supervisors if furloughed employees were unable to return to work as specified by the agency, and procedures for resuming program activities and disbursing funds upon the end of a shutdown. USTR, in particular, did not have a separate contingency plan and operated under EOP's plan, which did not fully address key information elements. While three of the four selected agencies had internal discussions on changes to operations in the event of a prolonged shutdown, these discussions were not documented in the contingency plans. Planning for potential prolonged shutdowns and including this information in contingency plans can assist agencies with effectively managing changes in operations and provide transparency.", "Entities involved in the prescription drug supply chain include manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacies, Part D plan sponsors, and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). Manufacturers develop and sell drugs to wholesalers, who then sell them to pharmacies. Part D plan sponsors receive payments from CMS to provide drug coverage and negotiate reimbursement rates with PBMs for drugs provided to beneficiaries. When a beneficiary purchases a drug, the pharmacy is paid by the plan sponsor or PBM, and the beneficiary pays any cost-sharing. PBMs earn revenue through various sources, including fees from plan sponsors, retention of rebates negotiated with manufacturers, spread pricing, and payments from manufacturers. PBMs and plan sponsors provide a range of services, including formulary development, pharmacy network development, utilization management, negotiation of rebates, and other pricing concessions. Part D plan sponsors are required to provide access to drugs in certain therapeutic classes. CMS makes monthly payments to Part D plan sponsors based on their estimated costs and rebates. At the end of the program year, actual costs are reconciled with estimated costs, and CMS either recovers funds or makes additional payments. Rebates and other price concessions reduce costs for beneficiaries and the government. PBMs provided the majority of drug benefit management services under Part D plan sponsor contracts, with CVS Caremark, OptumRx, Express Scripts, Medimpact, and Argus being the most frequently used PBMs. The primary revenue source for PBMs from Part D plans is a fee paid by plan sponsors based on the number of paid claims the PBM processes. PBMs pass the majority of rebates negotiated with manufacturers through to plan sponsors. PBMs can earn additional non-rebate revenue from manufacturers for services like rebate program administration and prescriber education programs. PBMs earn little revenue from spread pricing in Part D, and they generally earn more from spread pricing and rebate retention in commercial plans. The growth in rebates and other price concessions obtained by plan sponsors and PBMs has outpaced the growth in gross and net Part D expenditures for all brand-name and generic drugs from 2014 to 2016. Rebates accounted for the majority of rebates and price concessions obtained for Part D drugs during this time.", "The threat of biological warfare and bioterrorism is a significant challenge to national security, population health, and the environment. Countries like China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Syria continue to engage in activities related to biological weapons. The biotechnology revolution presents opportunities for advancements in public health, but also the potential for misuse in creating biological weapons. Additionally, non-state actors such as terrorist organizations have the interest and limited capacity to develop biological weapons. Human behavior, including habitat loss, vaccine hesitancy, and mass migration, also contributes to the biological threat landscape. Changes in the environment, such as climate change and the spread of vector-borne diseases, pose risks to human health and the agriculture industry. Finally, the storage of pathogens in laboratories without proper safety measures creates a risk of accidental release or intentional diversion. The National Biodefense Strategy was developed to address these challenges and promote a more efficient and coordinated biodefense enterprise. It includes high-level goals, objectives, and over 240 activities to guide agencies in protecting against biological threats. The strategy also establishes a governance structure and implementation process, which includes a Biodefense Steering Committee and a Biodefense Coordination Team. The implementation process involves assessing biodefense capabilities, identifying gaps, and developing joint policy guidance and metrics for resource allocation.", "The Navy has been experiencing significant delays in completing ship and submarine maintenance, resulting in reduced training and operational time and additional costs. From 2014 to 2019, the Navy was unable to complete scheduled maintenance on time about 75% of the time, resulting in approximately 33,700 days of maintenance delays. These delays have also been growing longer and more frequent. When maintenance is delayed, it affects readiness and incurs additional costs. For example, in 2018, the Navy spent $1.5 billion on idle attack submarines waiting for maintenance. Some factors contributing to these delays include difficulties in adhering to the maintenance planning process, shortages of skilled personnel at shipyards, poor condition of facilities and equipment, and a lack of dry dock capacity. The Navy has implemented a Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan to address these issues, but it will require significant time and resources to complete. The Navy estimates that it will take 20 years to replace facilities and 30 years to bring equipment up to industry standards, with a cost estimate of $21 billion over 20 years. However, this estimate may be understated and additional funding will be needed.", "The text explains the concept of drawback refunds, which are remittances of duties, taxes, or fees previously paid by importers. The refunds are issued by the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on goods that were previously imported and subsequently exported or destroyed. The rationale for the drawback program is to encourage American commerce and manufacturing by allowing manufacturers to compete in foreign markets without including the duty paid on imported merchandise in their costs or sales prices. There are three main categories of drawback refunds: manufacturing drawback, unused merchandise drawback, and rejected merchandise drawback. Within each category, there are variations in eligibility, such as the ability to substitute imported merchandise. The total amount of drawback refunds claimed has ranged from $631.6 million to $1.4 billion from 2009 to 2019. The drawback program was originally enacted in 1789 and has been expanded over the years to allow for more flexibility in claiming refunds. The text also discusses the transition to electronic filing of drawback claims, the role of CBP offices in managing the program, and the impact of changes in trade policy on the drawback program. The text further explains the changes made by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) and the challenges faced by CBP in managing the increased workload resulting from these changes. One significant change under TFTEA is the shift to a more objective substitution standard for qualifying for drawback refunds, which has increased the eligibility of certain merchandise. Industry representatives have reported an increase in new claimants and expanded eligibility for existing clients as a result of the changes. The new substitution standard may also have implications for \"drawback trading,\" where importers and exporters match excess import and export activity to maximize drawback refund recovery. CBP officials do not believe the new standard should affect the potential for drawback trading.", "Trauma or adverse childhood experiences can have a significant impact on a child's well-being. These experiences, such as abuse, neglect, or exposure to violence, can overwhelm a child's ability to cope and cause stress reactions. Chronic exposure to trauma can disrupt a child's neurodevelopment and impair their cognitive functioning and ability to cope with negative emotions. Traumatic experiences have also been linked to a wide range of health-related conditions and can increase the risk of chronic illnesses and early death.\n\nChildren in the child welfare system are particularly vulnerable to trauma, as many of them have experienced abuse or neglect. However, child welfare systems that use trauma-informed approaches are better equipped to address the needs of these children. A trauma-informed approach involves incorporating knowledge of trauma and its effects into policies, procedures, and practices.\n\nSchools also play a crucial role in recognizing and responding to trauma in children. A trauma-informed school is characterized by teachers and staff who are aware of how trauma affects students and are committed to creating a safe and supportive learning environment. Trauma-informed schools address and treat traumatic stress, develop partnerships with students and families, evaluate and revise discipline policies, and create trauma-informed learning environments.\n\nThere are evidence-based trauma treatments available for clinicians and therapists working with children and their families. These treatments can help mitigate the effects of trauma and improve child well-being. Studies have shown that trauma-informed approaches in child welfare and school settings can lead to positive outcomes, including improved child well-being, stability in foster care placements, and reduced post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.\n\nFederal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), provide discretionary grants and funding to support efforts aimed at addressing childhood trauma. States also use a combination of federal and state funding, as well as nonprofit funding, to support their initiatives.\n\nHHS and Education provide information, training, and technical assistance to help state and local agencies support children affected by trauma. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) is an important resource that offers training, curriculum, and other resources on trauma. HHS and SAMHSA have also issued guidance and frameworks to encourage trauma-informed approaches in child-serving settings.\n\nState and local agencies use various approaches to train staff, educators, and foster parents about trauma and its effects. These approaches include learning communities, online learning modules, and university coursework. The effectiveness of these initiatives is not evaluated in this report, but many of them incorporate key trauma principles recommended by SAMHSA.\n\nOverall, addressing childhood trauma requires a comprehensive and coordinated effort from various stakeholders, including child welfare systems, schools, and community organizations. By implementing trauma-informed approaches and providing necessary support and resources, we can help mitigate the effects of trauma on children and promote their overall well-being.", "The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal agency that investigates and prosecutes prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for whistleblowing, in the federal government. OSC reviews disclosures of wrongdoing from federal employees, former employees, and applicants for federal employment. Whistleblowers can make disclosures of alleged wrongdoing related to violations of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, dangers to public health or safety, or censorship. If a whistleblower believes they have experienced retaliation for their protected disclosure, they can file a complaint with OSC. Although probationary employees do not have the same protections against adverse personnel actions as permanent employees, they can still file complaints with OSC if they believe a personnel action was retaliatory. However, probationary employees have higher termination rates compared to permanent employees. From fiscal years 2014 to 2018, an average of 0.15 percent of federal employees filed complaints each year, but it is unclear whether probationary employees file at lower or comparable rates to their prevalence in the overall employee population. Estimated termination rates for probationary employees who filed whistleblower disclosures or retaliation complaints were higher than termination rates among all federal employees. Further examination is needed to fully understand the relationship between filing and terminations. The OSC uses a complaint form to collect information from federal employees, but the designation of probationary status is not a mandatory field. Limited data on probationary status makes it difficult for OSC to identify trends and challenges related to probationary employees who file whistleblower claims. Currently, OSC does not have plans to conduct data studies or analyses on probationary employees who file complaints due to limited resources.", "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) manages a large healthcare system in the United States and relies on its electronic health record (EHR) system, VistA, to document patient care. However, VistA is outdated, costly to maintain, and does not fully support the exchange of health records with other organizations. To address these challenges, the VHA planned to implement the same EHR system as the Department of Defense (DOD), called Cerner, to improve interoperability and care coordination. The implementation was initially scheduled for spring 2020 but has been delayed. The VHA formed EHR councils to make configuration decisions for the new system and held national and local workshops to discuss these decisions. The process of making configuration decisions is ongoing, and the VHA plans to implement the new EHR system in phases over the next decade.", "Dual-eligible beneficiaries qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid and can receive benefits from both programs. Medicare is the primary payer for acute and post-acute care, while Medicaid covers long-term services and supports. Dual-eligible beneficiaries can choose to receive their Medicare services from traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Medicaid beneficiaries, including dual-eligible beneficiaries, may receive their benefits through Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). States can use various approaches to encourage aligned enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries in MA plans with aligned Medicaid MCOs. These approaches include managing which MA plans operate in the state, limiting MA plan enrollment to full-benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and encouraging MA plan marketing to support informed decision-making. Some states also allow the automatic assignment of certain beneficiaries to plans with aligned enrollment and engage counselors to assist beneficiaries with enrollment decisions. The level of aligned enrollment varies among states, from 20% to 100% of dual-eligible beneficiaries in the selected states. States face challenges in using D-SNP and Medicare data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment policies.", "The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers the Disability Insurance (DI) program, which provides benefits to individuals who are unable to work due to qualifying impairments. In 2018, SSA paid DI benefits to over 10 million beneficiaries, totaling about $144 billion. DI claimants must meet work and medical requirements to be eligible for benefits. They may also apply for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The processing of DI claims involves staff at SSA field offices and state government Disability Determination Services (DDS) offices. Claimants have the right to appeal if their claim is denied. SSA periodically reviews beneficiaries' cases to ensure continued eligibility. Musculoskeletal conditions make up the largest proportion of impairments for DI benefits and treatments for pain-related symptoms can include prescription opioids. Trends in opioid prescriptions and DI claims have followed a similar pattern, peaking between 2010 and 2014 and then declining. However, the relationship between these trends is not well understood. Analysis of county-level data showed a positive correlation between rates of opioid prescriptions and DI claims. Rates of opioid prescriptions were also correlated with poverty rates, population size, and access to health insurance, while rates of DI claims were correlated with poverty rates, unemployment, age, and race. SSA's policies require staff to deny DI benefits to claimants if substance use disorders are \"material\" to the impairments that prevent work. Substance use disorders are seldom the key factor in DI eligibility decisions, as they may not be severe enough or well-documented in medical records.", "EXIM offers four types of financing products to support U.S. exports: direct loans, loan guarantees, export-credit insurance, and working capital guarantees. These products have different maturity periods: short-term (less than 1 year), medium-term (1-7 years), and long-term (more than 7 years). To combat fraud, EXIM conducts preauthorization and postauthorization antifraud activities. Fraud risk exists when individuals have the opportunity, incentive, or ability to commit fraud. Agency managers are responsible for managing fraud risks and implementing practices to combat them. The Fraud Risk Framework provides leading practices for assessing and mitigating fraud risks. EXIM identifies itself as subject to this framework and follows it. EXIM uses antifraud controls to detect and mitigate fraud risks, but its controls could be further adapted based on a comprehensive fraud risk assessment. EXIM has procedures to detect delinquent federal debt owed by applicants and participants, but it is missing opportunities to use readily available data to identify ineligible applicants or participants with delinquent federal debt. EXIM should consider using SAM data to assess repayment fraud risk.", "The Small Business Administration's (SBA) management process for STEP grants does not ensure that grant recipients meet two of the three requirements outlined in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA). The requirements include a proportional distribution of funds to states with fewer eligible small businesses and a total match requirement by states. The SBA's process does not document whether states meet these requirements before grant closeout. Additionally, the process does not provide reasonable assurance that states have complied with the cash match requirement. OIT does not track or analyze states' expended cash matching funds. Furthermore, the SBA's grants management process does not ensure full utilization of grant funds. Nearly 20 percent of grant funds go unused each year. OIT has made some changes to improve states' ability to use all their grant funds, but challenges remain including timing of the application and award processes and administrative burdens. OIT has not assessed and addressed the risk posed by low utilization of funds by states. The SBA should establish a process to ensure documentation of states' compliance with the total match requirement and develop a process to determine compliance with the cash match requirement. Additionally, the SBA should assess the risk posed by low grant fund utilization and enhance the collection and sharing of best practices among states that receive STEP grant funds.", "NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 for the development of crew transportation systems and initial service missions to the International Space Station (ISS). The contracts include design, development, test, and evaluation work to support NASA's certification of the contractors' spacecraft and launch vehicle systems. The contractors must submit evidence for review and approval by the Commercial Crew Program in order to proceed with uncrewed test flights, crewed test flights, and certification milestones. Both Boeing and SpaceX have experienced schedule delays, creating uncertainty about when they will be certified for operational missions to the ISS. Boeing faced an anomaly in its launch abort engine testing in 2018, resulting in a 12-month schedule delay. SpaceX conducted a successful uncrewed test flight in March 2019, but subsequently experienced an anomaly during a testing exercise. Both contractors have delayed their certification milestones multiple times, with Boeing now planning for certification in January 2020 and SpaceX in September 2019. The contractors are working to address technical risks identified by the program, such as parachute system certification and propellant loading procedures. The program is also reviewing safety reviews and verification closure notices to ensure compliance with requirements, but completion of this process has been delayed. Continued schedule delays and uncertainties surrounding certification create further delays in operational missions to the ISS.", "The Navy has several organizations overseeing the repair and maintenance of non-nuclear surface ships. These organizations include the Chief of Naval Operations, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms for ship repairs, which can range from a few weeks to years depending on the work required. The Naval Sea Systems Command oversees the implementation of the MAC-MO strategy for ship repairs, which involves establishing fixed contractual prices and completion time frames, using a third-party planning contractor, and awarding indefinite delivery contracts to multiple contractors. The Navy has achieved some goals with the MAC-MO strategy, such as increased competition and control of costs, but has also faced challenges with cost and schedule growth due to unplanned work. The Navy has implemented measures to mitigate these challenges and improve schedule outcomes.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is facing management and oversight challenges that have hindered its ability to fulfill its mission effectively and efficiently. Some of these challenges involve shortcomings in human capital management, such as veterans' access to timely healthcare and the appeals process for disability benefits. VA has agreed with most of the recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to address these challenges and is taking steps to implement them.\n\nHowever, there are still areas where VA has fallen short. For example, VA's written workforce plans have not been consistent with sound workforce planning practices. The GAO has recommended that the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) develop a timely and detailed workforce plan for recruiting, hiring, and training new staff. VA has made progress in addressing this recommendation but still needs to develop risk mitigation strategies to manage appeals workloads and improve timeliness.\n\nVA has also faced workforce challenges in areas like sterile processing services and leadership development. The GAO has recommended that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) examine the workforce needs of these services and take appropriate action. Additionally, VA's Office of Inspector General has identified poor leadership and workforce investment as major management challenges within the organization.\n\nThe GAO assessed VA's succession planning efforts and found that they partially met some leading practices but fell short in others. VA lacks a current, department-wide succession plan and has not fully aligned its succession planning process with strategic goals. The agency has also not conducted a comprehensive analysis of current and future workforce gaps or developed strategies for closing those gaps. Monitoring, evaluating, and updating succession plans and strategies is also an area where VA has fallen short.\n\nThe VHA has developed a succession plan that partially meets leading practices for both leadership and mission-critical occupations. However, there are still areas where improvement is needed, such as ensuring complete and accurate workforce data, monitoring and evaluating succession planning efforts, and establishing a process for evaluating strategies. VHA has made progress in identifying strategies for closing workforce gaps but can further enhance its efforts.\n\nIn summary, VA's management and oversight challenges have affected its ability to fulfill its mission effectively. While some progress has been made in addressing these challenges, there are still areas where improvement is needed, particularly in the area of succession planning. Ensuring active leadership support, aligning plans with strategic goals, analyzing workforce gaps, developing strategies, and monitoring and evaluating succession plans are crucial for improving VA's workforce management.", "The United States has two missions in Afghanistan: a counterterrorism mission and a training mission through NATO. These missions are part of Operation Freedom's Sentinel, and the training is carried out by Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A). CSTC-A identifies capability gaps in the Afghan security forces and develops training programs to address those gaps. These training needs are then incorporated into the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) budget request. However, there are challenges in accurately estimating costs and adjusting to changing conditions in Afghanistan. The training programs are executed through a process modeled on the U.S. government's foreign military sales process, with contracts being awarded to providers. Previously, training for the Afghan National Army was executed under a single contract, but DOD began transitioning to multiple contracts in April 2019.", "The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program provides funding to SBDCs to offer business advising and assistance to small businesses. The program is managed by SBDC lead centers, which receive grants from the Small Business Administration (SBA). SBDCs must provide matching funds from nonfederal sources to cover program costs. Funding for SBDCs is determined through the annual appropriations process, with the President submitting a budget request to Congress. SBDCs submit initial funding applications based on a funding estimate provided by SBA, and after appropriations are enacted, final funding amounts are determined. In recent years, SBA has used the President's budget request as the funding estimate, which has led to significant discrepancies between the initial estimates and final appropriations. SBA cites federal financial management practices and adherence to the Antideficiency Act as the reasons for this change. However, OMB staff and SBA's Office of General Counsel state that using other estimates in the funding opportunity announcement would not violate the Antideficiency Act. SBDCs have reported that this funding practice has created burdens and challenges for their budgeting and operations.", "The United States has maintained close ties with Central America and has provided assistance to the governments of the region, particularly the Northern Triangle countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). This assistance focuses on addressing violence, criminal activity, and drug trafficking. Multiple U.S. agencies have implemented projects in the Northern Triangle to support law enforcement, criminal justice, human rights, youth violence prevention, customs and border control, and economic and social development.\n\nThe U.S. government's latest initiative in the region is the Strategy for Central America and Southern Mexico, introduced in 2014 and updated in 2017. The Strategy aims to take a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Central American countries, including poverty, corruption, weak governance, high crime rates, and lack of employment opportunities.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2013 to 2018, the United States allocated approximately $2.4 billion in assistance to the Northern Triangle countries. The primary agencies involved in implementing these projects were the State Department, USAID, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). State and USAID manage foreign assistance and play key roles in monitoring and evaluation. State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs oversees coordination among agencies.\n\nThe agencies implemented at least 370 technical assistance projects in the Northern Triangle, with USAID implementing the largest number of projects. The projects supported the three objectives of the Strategy - prosperity, governance, and security. USAID focused on assisting populations, businesses, and farmers, while State and USAID worked on strengthening governance and justice institutions, combating corruption, and promoting human rights. DOD primarily supported military training and development.\n\nThe agencies reported mixed results for the projects in the six selected sectors we reviewed - economic growth, agricultural development, good government service, justice reform, community-based violence prevention, and professionalize the military and develop defense capabilities. While some projects achieved their targets, others did not. Evaluations generally reported positive project results.\n\nOverall, the United States has provided significant assistance to the Northern Triangle countries to address their challenges in the areas of prosperity, governance, and security. However, there is a need for continued monitoring and evaluation to ensure the effectiveness and impact of these projects.", "School-age children have various ways to access the internet, including in-home fixed internet, mobile wireless service, and publicly available Wi-Fi. However, lower-income households are less likely to have access to these internet options compared to higher-income households. This digital divide can make it more difficult for students in lower-income households to do homework and for parents to support their children academically. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plays a role in expanding internet access through initiatives such as assigning licenses for Educational Broadband Service (EBS) spectrum and supporting internet investments at schools through the E-rate program. Some school districts have implemented projects to address the homework gap, including providing students with wireless hot-spot devices, building or using private networks, and equipping school buses with Wi-Fi. The Department of Education also provides grants that schools and districts can use to support internet investments. Additionally, the department is finalizing a survey that collects data on teachers' use of computers and the internet, as well as students' access to these resources outside the classroom.", "When a disaster occurs and state and local agencies are unable to provide sufficient services on their own, the federal government steps in to support disaster response and recovery efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the primary agency responsible for disaster response, while the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) focuses specifically on public transportation in emergency situations.\n\nCongress has allocated significant funds to transit services in the aftermath of major disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. FEMA's Public Assistance Program provides funding to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations for recovery efforts, while FTA's Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program focuses on reimbursing emergency response and recovery costs for public transportation systems.\n\nFollowing the 2017 hurricanes, Congress appropriated funds to FTA for the 2017 hurricanes. FTA allocated approximately $233 million to 52 transit agencies for response, recovery, and rebuilding projects, with a majority of the funds going to Puerto Rico. Transit agencies had to submit grant applications to FTA detailing eligible project activities and expenses.\n\nDuring this process, there were instances of duplication in funding between FTA and FEMA. Both agencies awarded funds for the same expenses, leading to the need for coordination and communication between the two agencies to avoid duplicate funding. FTA and FEMA established a memorandum of agreement (MOA) and a communications protocol to address these issues.\n\nHowever, challenges remained in identifying transit expenses within larger applications submitted to FEMA. FTA may be unaware of whether transit entities are part of these applications, and FEMA staff face difficulties in searching for transit expenses within hundreds of pages of documents. This increases the risk of duplicate funding being awarded.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, FTA and FEMA agreed to jointly monitor, evaluate, and report on the effectiveness of their collaboration in future events. They also implemented measures to limit the potential for duplicate funding, such as updating internal guidance and coordinating responses to grant applications.\n\nOverall, coordination and communication between FTA and FEMA are crucial in providing effective and efficient funding to transit agencies in the wake of disasters. Further measures should be taken to detect and prevent duplicate funding in order to ensure the appropriate use of resources.", "The majority of Americans receive health coverage through private health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing it directly. Private health coverage is obtained in one of three market segments: individual, small group, or large group. Prior to the implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), health plans often provided more restrictive or lower levels of coverage for mental health and substance use disorders compared to medical/surgical benefits. MHPAEA was enacted in 2008 to address this discrepancy and requires that coverage for mental health and substance use services be no more restrictive than coverage for medical/surgical services. MHPAEA applies to large employer-sponsored group plans, individual insurance plans, and some small group health plans. It establishes requirements for financial requirements (deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket maximums) as well as quantitative and non-quantitative treatment limitations. The oversight of compliance with MHPAEA is split between states, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Treasury, depending on the type of coverage and whether the plan is self-funded or fully insured. States have primary responsibility for regulating insurance and oversee fully insured health plans, while HHS, DOL, and Treasury have oversight authority for self-funded plans and ensure compliance with MHPAEA requirements. Compliance reviews for MHPAEA vary across states and can include reviews prior to products being approved for sale, targeted reviews based on consumer complaints or other information, random audits, and market conduct examinations. Overall, states conduct various types of reviews to assess compliance with MHPAEA requirements, both before and after consumers enroll in plans.", "The National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, now known as CMP, was established in 1903 by the War Department to promote marksmanship and military preparedness. In 1996, CMP became a nonprofit corporation and the Army transferred firearms and funds to them. CMP's responsibilities include instructing citizens in marksmanship, promoting firearm safety and conducting competitions. They can loan firearms and supplies to affiliated youth organizations and sell surplus firearms to gun clubs and members of affiliated organizations. The Army provides support to CMP by identifying and reserving surplus firearms and assisting with transfers. CMP must follow federal, state, and local laws when selling firearms, and they have established procedures to verify the eligibility of buyers. The Army and CMP have agreements outlining their responsibilities for transferring surplus firearms, and they have established procedures for inventory control and tracking. CMP uses sales procedures and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to ensure compliance with federal requirements. Surplus rifles can be shipped directly to customers, while surplus handguns must be sold through an FFL. CMP restricts sales to a certain number per customer per year and requires applicants to provide proof of citizenship, age, membership in a CMP-affiliated organization, and participation in marksmanship activities.", "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has reported that complete restoration to levels acceptable for unrestricted use cannot be achieved at many of its cleanup sites. The report states that various hazards, such as long-lived radionuclides and residual contaminants, would remain after cleanup due to technical and economic limitations. The Office of Environmental Management (EM) was responsible for cleanup until DOE established the Office of Legacy Management (LM) in 2003. LM now manages 100 sites across the U.S., including sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Cleanup activities were conducted by EM, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and private licensees. The sites were cleaned up under various authorities, including CERCLA, RCRA, and UMTRCA. LM categorizes its sites based on the level of surveillance and maintenance required, with category 3 sites requiring the most intensive management. LM's environmental liability estimate for fiscal year 2019 was $7.35 billion, with long-term surveillance and maintenance accounting for about $3 billion of that liability. LM's overall environmental liability has remained stable in recent years, but fluctuations have occurred at individual sites. Examples of factors driving changes in environmental liability include improvements in groundwater treatment strategies and repairs to aging infrastructure.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for security in all modes of transportation, working with public and private entities to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate security risks. The Surface Programs account, which supports TSA's programs for surface transportation, received an average of $113 million annually from 2009 to 2018. TSA allocates these funds to its Security Operations, Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service, and Policy, Plans, and Engagement offices. TSA also conducts the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act through its I-STEP program, which offers exercise management services, training support services, and security planning tools and services to transportation operators. The roles and responsibilities for coordinating surface transportation exercises are not clearly defined in TSA's internal operating procedure for I-STEP, which could result in missed input and information from relevant offices. To address this, GAO recommends that TSA clarify roles and responsibilities as part of a planned revision of the operating procedure. DHS concurred with the recommendation and outlined actions planned to address it.", "The U.S. electric grid is made up of three main functions: generation and storage, transmission, and distribution. Power plants generate electricity, which is then transmitted through substations and distributed to consumers. There are three major electric grids in the U.S.: the Eastern Interconnection, Western Interconnection, and Electric Reliability Council of Texas Interconnection. These grids operate independently and produce electricity to meet demand within their respective areas. The grid is considered resilient, with the ability to quickly respond to and restore service after incidents. However, a cyberattack on the grid could be more challenging to respond to and recover from. Industrial control systems, which monitor and control grid operations, are becoming more vulnerable to cyberattacks as they become more connected and use traditional IT systems. The protection of critical infrastructure, including the grid, is the responsibility of federal and state authorities. Various policy directives and plans outline roles and responsibilities for protecting the grid, promoting cybersecurity, and improving resilience. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees the reliability of the bulk power system and enforces cybersecurity standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Grid owners and operators are required to report cybersecurity incidents to the Department of Energy (DOE) and NERC. State regulators oversee the reliability of the distribution system and may have varying cybersecurity regulations. The U.S. electric grid faces significant cybersecurity risks from various threat actors, including nations and criminal groups. Grid owners and operators face challenges in addressing these risks, including a lack of cybersecurity workforce and limited information sharing.", "A series of laws and policies dating back to 1904 require the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to rely on U.S.-flag commercial ships for its sealift needs. These laws and policies align with the principles of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which state that a fleet of commercial ships owned and operated by U.S. citizens is necessary for national defense. U.S.-flag commercial ships are staffed by U.S. citizen mariners, who are also needed to crew the government-owned reserve cargo ships. The U.S. government financially supports the U.S.-flag maritime industry through the Maritime Security Program (MSP) stipends and cargo preference requirements. The MSP provides annual stipends to U.S.-flag ships that agree to operate under the U.S. flag and be available for national defense needs. Cargo preference requirements mandate that federal agencies transport a portion of their cargo on U.S.-flag ships. The U.S. government also has the Jones Act, which requires that maritime transport of cargo between U.S. points be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships. The U.S.-flag maritime industry faces challenges in terms of fleet size, shipyard capacity, and availability of qualified mariners. Declines in the size of the U.S.-flag fleet could lead to shortfalls in capacity, and there are concerns about a mismatch between the types of ships needed for defense and those needed for commerce. Shipyard capacity has also declined, leading to repair delays for both government-owned and commercial ships. Additionally, there may be a shortage of qualified mariners, which could impact sustained military sealift operations. To address these challenges and ensure the viability of the U.S. maritime industry, the Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to develop a national maritime strategy in consultation with the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOT is also responsible for providing funding to maritime academies and shipyards, maintaining a fleet of government-owned cargo ships, and overseeing the U.S. maritime industry.", "The NDAA requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and implement 43 border security metrics in four domains: between points of entry, at points of entry, the maritime border, and air and marine security in the land environment. CBP and the Coast Guard are responsible for border security within these domains. The metrics are a combination of counts, rates, estimates, and a combination of counts or rates with an estimate. DHS contracted with the Institute for Defense Analyses to develop a statistical model for estimating undetected unlawful entries. In its fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, DHS provided information on 35 of the 43 metrics, with some differences in scope or calculation. Eight metrics were not included because they were still in development or data collection was ongoing. DHS has processes in place to ensure data reliability, but there were limitations that were not always disclosed or transparently communicated in the report.", "Medicare beneficiaries have several options to choose from when it comes to their coverage, including original Medicare, Medicare Advantage (MA), prescription drug coverage, and supplemental coverage. The Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) website is a resource that helps beneficiaries compare costs and coverage options. However, stakeholders and research studies have found that MPF is difficult for beneficiaries to navigate and understand. The website navigation is complex, requiring users to answer multiple questions and click through several pages before finding detailed information on coverage options. The lack of prominent instructions and the inability to filter and sort plan information early in the search process further complicates navigation. Additionally, beneficiaries struggle to understand terminology and cost estimates, and the cost estimates provided by MPF are incomplete because they do not include the effect of Medigap coverage. This incomplete information makes it difficult for beneficiaries to compare original Medicare with Medigap plans to specific MA plans. Furthermore, MPF lacks information on MA plan provider networks, requiring users to go to individual plan websites for this information. Overall, improvements are needed to make MPF more user-friendly and provide complete and understandable information to beneficiaries.", "The government has a variety of contract types to choose from when acquiring supplies and services. The primary contract types fall into two categories: cost-type and fixed-price-type. The specific contract types range from cost-plus-fixed-fee to firm-fixed-price, with incentive contracts in between. The choice of contract type depends on the degree of responsibility assumed by the contractor for costs and the profit incentive offered. The government usually assumes greater risk for more complex requirements. However, DOD and Congress have encouraged the use of fixed-price-type contracts where appropriate. The choice of contract type is a matter of negotiation and requires the exercise of sound judgment. DOD acquires major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) through the Defense Acquisition System, which includes four phases: technology maturation and risk reduction, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment. Milestone decision authority, program managers, contracting officers, and other agencies are involved in the choice and monitoring of MDAP contracts. The choice of contract type for MDAPs is based on risk assessments and considerations of program requirements and constraints. The use of cost-type contracts for MDAPs has been relatively low, with the majority of contracts being fixed-price-type. Contracting officers consider factors such as historical contract information, technology, cost stability, and requirements definition when choosing contract types. Cost-type contracts exceeding certain dollar thresholds have additional reporting requirements to help monitor cost and schedule performance. The use of earned value management (EVM) systems is required for cost-type and incentive contracts valued at $20 million or more. DCMA and SUPSHIP review and approve contractor EVM systems and provide regular reports to program offices on cost and schedule performance. Regular interactions between DOD and contractors are important to proactively identify cost or schedule overruns. However, there is no clear relationship between contract type and cost and schedule outcomes for MDAPs.", "Since 1990, the Department of Defense (DOD) has consistently struggled with cost, schedule, and performance issues in its acquisition of weapon system programs. In 2009, Congress passed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act and DOD implemented its \"Better Buying Power\" initiatives to address these problems. These reforms aimed to improve the organization, procedures, and certifications for DOD's acquisition programs. In 2016, DOD made progress in controlling costs, but Congress and DOD remained concerned about the bureaucracy and slow delivery of capability. Additional provisions were enacted in subsequent years to address these issues, including the establishment of the Section 809 Panel to identify ways to streamline and improve the defense acquisition system. DOD's acquisition process includes three major milestones, known as Milestones A, B, and C, which represent transition points in programs. DOD has made efforts to tailor the acquisition process and documentation requirements, but there is still room for improvement. Several entities at the enterprise and military department level are involved in the oversight and budgeting of DOD's weapon system acquisition programs. Our review focused on five selected reforms from the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017. These reforms have led to changes in decision-making authority, improved consideration of program cost and performance goals, and restructuring of acquisition oversight functions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Overall, DOD has made progress in implementing these reforms, but there are still questions about their full implementation and effectiveness. Milestone decision authority for most major defense acquisition programs now resides with the military departments, and new processes are in place to improve DOD's consideration of program goals and technical risks. However, no programs have yet held a milestone A or established goals under the new process. DOD has issued policies and taken steps to implement these reforms, but further actions are needed to fully complete the restructuring and ensure effective oversight within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "The DATA Act, signed into law in 2014, aims to increase transparency in federal spending by requiring agencies to disclose a variety of data related to federal spending and link spending information to federal program activities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Treasury are responsible for establishing data standards for federal funds, with OMB focusing on policies and definitions and Treasury handling technical standards. However, there have been significant challenges with data quality and completeness. In Q4 FY2018, 96 out of 107 agencies submitted data, but not all files were complete or accurate. Some agencies did not include certain financial assistance programs in their submissions, and others had difficulties reporting data elements. Agencies also submitted blank files, and some CFO Act agencies did not report spending for certain financial assistance programs. OMB and Treasury have made some efforts to address these issues, but further progress is needed to establish clear policies and processes for data standards.", "The military services have highly trained Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel to eliminate explosive hazards in various missions, including combat operations, assisting the Secret Service, and supporting homeland defense. However, the military services' current processes for determining the appropriate number of EOD forces do not fully account for the increase in domestic support missions, such as VIP support. As a result, military preparedness for combat-related missions may be negatively affected. The military services prioritize combat missions when determining EOD requirements and do not routinely increase EOD manpower to provide support to other federal agencies. This lack of consideration limits their ability to efficiently and effectively manage risks. Additionally, current guidance does not require the military services to notify senior leaders when military preparedness is negatively affected by VIP support missions. This lack of communication further hinders the evaluation of the effects of VIP support missions on military preparedness. Overall, updating guidance to consider the total EOD force required to support combat-related and domestic support missions would allow decision-makers to accurately assess the sufficiency of EOD forces and manage risks effectively.", "The MyVA initiative was launched by the VA in response to the 2014 access crisis and aimed to improve access to healthcare for veterans. As part of this initiative, the VA introduced nine \"access declarations\" to improve and ensure access to care, including same-day services for primary and mental health care. Prior to the same-day services initiative, the VA had policies in place for same-day access in primary and mental health care clinics. The VA also required timely access to mental health care services. VA medical centers were responsible for implementing local policies to ensure the effective operation of their primary and mental health care clinics.\n\nThe VA used a five-pronged approach to design the same-day services initiative, which included defining same-day services, developing guidance, updating mental health policies, offering training, and assessing medical center readiness. The VA provided solutions and guidance to help medical centers implement same-day services, but they were not mandatory. The VA also updated mental health policies to facilitate same-day services and provided training on the initiative. Medical centers were assessed on their readiness to provide same-day services.\n\nBy January 2018, the VA announced that all medical centers were providing same-day services in primary and mental health care. Medical centers used a variety of approaches to provide same-day services, and many were providing same-day services prior to the initiative. However, veterans' expectations may have shifted with the initiative, causing challenges in implementation. The VA officials stated that their main concern was that veterans' needs were met, and they found medical centers' implementation of same-day services acceptable.\n\nThe VA plans to provide clearer education and training on same-day services to both staff and patients. However, the impact of same-day services has not been fully assessed due to the absence of documented objectives and performance goals.", "The U.S. government has an export control system in place to manage the risks associated with exporting sensitive items and ensure that legitimate trade can still occur. The system is governed by a complex set of laws, regulations, and processes that are administered by multiple federal agencies, including the State and Commerce Departments. State controls the export of military items, while Commerce controls the export of less sensitive items with military and commercial applications. Both agencies require a license or authorization for the export of controlled items and conduct various compliance activities. State controls items listed on the U.S. Munitions List (USML), such as tanks and fighter aircraft, while Commerce controls items listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL), such as computers and telecommunications equipment. The government is currently proposing to transfer certain firearms, artillery, and ammunition from State's jurisdiction to Commerce's jurisdiction as part of an effort to reform the export control lists. State and Commerce published proposed rules in May 2018 and have been reviewing public comments. The transfer of firearms, artillery, and ammunition is the last step in the export control reform process that began in 2010. State reviewed over 68,000 export license applications for firearms, artillery, and ammunition between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, and the number of applications remained relatively constant during that time. About 57% of the applications involved non-automatic or semi-automatic firearms, which would transfer to Commerce control if the proposed rules are finalized. The top countries for these exports were in Europe and Eurasia, followed by the Western Hemisphere and East Asia. State and Commerce have different requirements for registration, licensing, end-use monitoring, congressional notification, public reporting, and enforcement. There are also differences in how they screen export license applications and conduct end-use monitoring. The manufacturing companies, exporters, and brokers of items on the USML are required to register with the State Department, while there is no registration requirement for items on the CCL. Both departments review export license applications, with other agencies participating in the review process as well. State and Commerce maintain their own internal watch lists to screen all parties identified on license applications. The watch lists are used to target transactions for possible end-use checks and can result in a denial of the license.", "Federal agencies have various procurement opportunities set aside for small businesses, including programs specifically for women-owned small businesses (WOSBs). To participate in the WOSB program, businesses must be at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more women who are U.S. citizens. Initially, WOSBs could self-certify their eligibility or seek certification from an approved third-party certifier. However, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has not yet implemented changes to the program as required by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2015, which include eliminating self-certification and establishing a new certification process. The SBA has also not fully addressed deficiencies related to oversight of third-party certifiers and eligibility examinations. Consequently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the SBA implement comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess third-party certifiers and improve its oversight activities. The timing of the final rule implementing the changes to the program is uncertain, and the GAO believes its previous recommendations should be fully addressed. Additionally, the SBA lacks formalized guidance for its eligibility examination processes, which has resulted in high rates of potentially ineligible businesses being identified. The GAO recommends that the SBA establish formalized procedures for eligibility examinations.", "The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) defines lobbyists as individuals who are hired by clients and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20% of their time spent on behalf of the client. Lobbying firms are entities that employ lobbyists to lobby on behalf of clients. The LDA requires lobbyists to register and file quarterly reports with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House. Lobbyists are also required to file semiannual reports disclosing political contributions. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House are responsible for ensuring LDA compliance and can refer noncompliant lobbyists to the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO). Penalties for noncompliance can include fines and even imprisonment. Our review found that most lobbyists comply with reporting requirements, but there are some issues with rounding income and expenses, disclosing previously held covered positions, and accurately reporting political contributions. Overall, the U.S. Attorney's Office has sufficient resources to enforce compliance with the LDA.", "VA administers one of the largest health care systems in the United States, providing care to over 7 million veterans. The system includes 172 medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics, and other facilities. When needed services are not available at VA medical facilities, VA may purchase care from non-VA providers through community care programs. The VA Organ Transplant Program, overseen by the National Surgery Office, includes 12 VA Transplant Centers (VATCs) that offer solid organ transplant surgery and post-operative care. The program provides pre-transplant evaluation and testing, transplant surgery, follow-up care, and travel and lodging for the veteran and caregiver. Organ allocation is managed by the United Network for Organ Sharing, and veterans are placed on the national organ donation waitlist. VA allocates funding for transplant care through the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system and by specifically allocating funds for transplant patients. Veterans go through a five-step process to receive an organ transplant, including referral, evaluation, listing on the waitlist, transplant surgery, and follow-up care. Follow-up care is typically provided by the referring VHA medical center, with some aspects of care done through telehealth. Between fiscal years 2014 and 2018, VATCs provided approximately 1,700 organ transplants.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress and addressed challenges in managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. This includes improving the process for identifying high-risk chemical facilities, assessing risk, and approving security plans. DHS has also identified facilities that failed to report information and has taken steps to ensure compliance. The department has strengthened the accuracy of data used to identify high-risk facilities and has enhanced its risk assessment approach. DHS has reduced the backlog of security plans awaiting review and implemented an Expedited Approval Program (EAP) to streamline the process for certain facilities. Compliance inspections have been conducted and efforts are being made to manage noncompliant facilities. DHS is working to evaluate the program's impact on reducing vulnerability and has improved outreach efforts to facility owners and operators. However, there are still challenges in sharing CFATS information with first responders and emergency planners. Overall, DHS has taken steps to improve the CFATS program, but there are areas that require further attention.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) provides contract financing to defense contractors to help manage expenses during the production of capital intensive items like weapon systems. This financing can include progress payments, performance-based payments, and payments for undefinitized contract actions (UCAs). Progress payments are determined as a percentage of the costs incurred by the contractor as work progresses, and currently DOD pays 80% of costs for large businesses and 90% for small businesses. Performance-based payments are made for achieving certain contractual milestones, and can be up to 90% of the contract price or the price of a deliverable item. UCAs are used when a definitive contract cannot be finalized in time, and progress payments during this period are limited to 80% of work accomplished. Several offices and agencies within DOD are responsible for managing contract financing, including the Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) office, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and the Cost and Pricing Center within DCMA. Contract financing can impact the price of negotiated contracts and the profitability of defense contractors. DOD requires contracting officers to consider contract financing when determining profit objectives for contracts. Contractors who receive financing from the government can also achieve higher rates of return on their investments. Studies have shown that defense contractors generate high returns on investment, partly due to government-provided contract financing. The impact of contract financing policies has been studied by various organizations, including a comprehensive study by the DFAIR commission in 1985. Since then, Congress and DOD have made changes to reduce administrative burden and encourage performance-based payments. However, the use of performance-based payments decreased after certain DOD actions, but started increasing again in 2016. The relative use of progress and performance-based payments is uncertain, but data from the DCMA indicates that the majority of contract financing payments are made to medium and large defense contractors.", "Schools and districts are responsible for reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion to the Education Department's Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The CRDC collects data every two years on a wide range of topics, including discipline and restraint and seclusion. However, there are issues with the data quality and reporting process. \n\nOne issue is that Education's business rules for detecting errors in reporting zeros for restraint and seclusion only apply to large districts with over 100,000 students, leaving a majority of districts unchecked. Additionally, Education has not identified the reasons why districts may be reporting inaccurate data.\n\nThere are also concerns about underreporting and outliers in the data. Analysis of the 2015-16 CRDC data revealed patterns that suggest potential underreporting in several large districts, with incidents of restraint and seclusion concentrated in a small number of schools. There were also outliers with very low and very high rates of restraint and seclusion.\n\nThese issues raise concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the CRDC data on restraint and seclusion. Without effective quality control processes and analysis of outliers, the data may not provide an accurate picture of the extent and impact of restraint and seclusion in schools. Education may need to implement improvements in its data collection and quality control procedures to address these issues.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of foreign assistance programs in response to legislation passed in 2016. The guidelines provide direction to federal departments and agencies on monitoring the use of resources, evaluating outcomes, and applying findings to program design. However, the guidelines do not incorporate all of the leading practices for monitoring and evaluation identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Notably, they do not include practices on developing monitoring plans based on risks, ensuring staff qualifications for monitoring, establishing close-out procedures for programs, developing staff skills for evaluation, and following up on evaluation recommendations. The guidelines also do not define best practices for monitoring and evaluation, but agencies are free to add additional requirements to their own policies. The GAO found that most agencies incorporated the OMB guidelines into their policies, but some did not include specific requirements such as establishing roles and responsibilities for funding transfers and conducting impact evaluations on pilot programs. The GAO recommends that agencies incorporate these best practices to ensure accountability and effectiveness in foreign assistance programs.", "The 22 tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs reviewed vary widely in terms of total donations and number of scholarships awarded. Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania operate the largest programs in terms of both dollars donated and number of scholarships awarded. Each state has the discretion to develop and operate TCS programs, and there is no federal role in establishing these programs. The financial impact to states primarily occurs through forgone revenue resulting from associated tax credits. State agencies, scholarship granting organizations (SGOs), and participating private schools all play a role in administering state TCS programs, with responsibilities varying by program. SGOs are responsible for managing the donation process and awarding scholarships, while participating private schools educate students receiving scholarships. Requirements for SGOs include limitations on non-scholarship expenses and financial audits, along with adherence to conflict of interest policies. SGOs must also be recognized as tax-exempt organizations by the Internal Revenue Service and may be subject to state laws for tax-exempt organizations. Key requirements for SGOs include registration or state approval, leadership qualifications, rules for marketing and fundraising, and reporting on scholarships awarded and student characteristics. SGOs are generally prohibited from awarding scholarships to only one school or from allowing donors to recommend specific students. Requirements for participating private schools include academic qualifications, such as registration or approval by the state and accreditation, minimum instructional time, curriculum content, academic testing, background checks for teachers, and site visits. Financial requirements for participating private schools are less common and include reporting or repaying scholarships for student withdrawals, financial audits or reviews, and surety bonds or evidence of financial viability. In the three states with the largest TCS programs (Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania), SGOs are generally responsible for recruiting donors while state agencies administer tax credits. SGOs recruit potential donors, help them apply for tax credits, and sometimes involve schools or families in soliciting donations. State agencies administer tax credits based on program rules, including maximum total dollar limits and tax compliance reviews.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 15 components that work towards countering terrorism, securing borders, protecting critical infrastructure, and more. DHS relies on contracts to support its missions and has 10 contracting activities within the department. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to conduct market research, perform acquisition planning, and follow specific policies and procedures for contracting activities. DHS has its own regulations and manuals to supplement the FAR. The DHS also has its own policies and guidance for managing service acquisition programs. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) has issued a policy letter clarifying when governmental outsourcing of services is appropriate and highlights the risk of losing control of inherently governmental functions or mission operations when contracting for certain functions. DHS has a job aid called the Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis to ensure that proposed service requirements do not include inherently governmental functions and to identify closely associated functions. DHS previously used the Balanced Workforce Assessment Tool (BWAT) to assess the mix of federal and contractor personnel but replaced it with the job aid. DHS uses planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process to allocate resources, including service contracts, across the department. Service contracts are reflected in budget documents using object classes prescribed by OMB. The GAO has conducted previous work on the use of service contracts and has made recommendations to improve oversight and reporting of service contract requirements.", "The FDA approves reference listed drugs and generic drugs that meet safety and efficacy standards. Generic drugs must be the same as the reference listed drug in terms of active ingredients, dosage form, etc. They must also be bioequivalent, meaning they deliver the same amount of active ingredients in the same amount of time. The FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for certain drugs, which includes additional measures to ensure safe use. This can include providing patients with medication guides or developing communication plans for healthcare providers. The FDA may also require \"elements to assure safe use\" (ETASU) for drugs associated with a specific serious risk. This can include prescriber training or patient monitoring. Certain practices, such as limiting access to samples of reference standard drugs or delaying negotiations on required shared systems, can hinder competition and delay the development of generic drugs. As of March 18, 2019, there were 74 approved REMS that apply to 523 drugs, with Medicare and Medicaid paying billions of dollars for these drugs. Over half of the REMS with ETASU measures include limits on drug distribution. The FDA and FTC have taken actions to address limited access to samples and delays in negotiations for shared systems. Generic drug companies have reported difficulties in accessing samples of reference standard drugs with limited distribution measures.", "The F-35 program, a key part of the Department of Defense's modernization efforts, is facing several concerns that may impact its cost and performance in the future. These concerns include risks in its modernization efforts, reliability targets not being met, and challenges in sustainment and supply chain. The program plans to award Block 4 development contracts before key business case documents are ready, which may increase the risk of delays and additional deficiencies. The program is not meeting all of its reliability and maintainability targets, and sustainment costs are rising due to supply chain challenges. The F-35 program is transitioning to early development and testing activities for Block 4, but important documents such as the Independent Technology Readiness Assessment, Test and Evaluation Master Plan, and Independent Cost Estimate will not be ready before development contracts are awarded. Without these documents, program officials cannot have confidence in the requirements and risks of the Block 4 project. In addition, the F-35's reliability and maintainability metrics are not meeting targets, and the program has not taken adequate steps to ensure they will be met. The program's R&M Improvement Program does not define specific, measurable objectives, and funding for improvement projects is not prioritized. As a result, the program may not fully meet its R&M targets, which could lead to less reliable aircraft and increased costs in operation and sustainment. Recommendations have been made to assess the feasibility of R&M targets, revise the R&M Improvement Program, identify specific objectives and projects, and prioritize funding. The Department of Defense has concurred with these recommendations and plans to take action.", "A skilled acquisition workforce is crucial for the Department of Defense (DOD) to maintain military readiness, increase buying power, and achieve long-term savings. However, DOD has faced challenges in growing and sustaining its acquisition workforce, including hiring, recruiting, and retaining personnel. DOD reduced the size of its acquisition workforce in the 1990s due to budget constraints but has since increased it. Although DOD has used various hiring flexibilities, such as direct hire authorities and Veterans' Recruitment Appointment, it has not established specific size targets for the workforce. DOD has also increased the use of recruitment and retention flexibilities, such as recruitment and relocation bonuses, to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. However, there have been delays in implementing some of these flexibilities, which have hindered DOD's ability to hire personnel in a timely manner. DOD leadership, along with the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) and military departments' civilian personnel centers, have taken actions to simplify and increase the usage of hiring flexibilities. Despite these efforts, there is still room for improvement in effectively utilizing hiring flexibilities to build a strong acquisition workforce.", "Depots are government-owned industrial installations that maintain and repair military weapons systems and equipment for the DOD. The Air Force and Navy each have their own aviation depots where they perform depot-level maintenance on aircraft. Over the past decade, audits have been conducted on the services' working capital funds activities related to depot maintenance timeliness. The Air Force has generally completed depot maintenance on time or early, while the Navy has struggled to meet timeliness goals. Various factors, such as unexpected repairs and aircraft operating beyond their designed service life, have contributed to maintenance delays. The Air Force has implemented initiatives to improve planning and has largely accurately planned for maintenance requirements. The Navy, on the other hand, has not accurately planned for maintenance and has identified planning challenges that have not been fully addressed. The Navy has implemented an initiative to improve planning, but it is still in the early stages of implementation.", "Tribal lands in the United States have significant untapped energy resources, including uranium, coal, oil, gas, and renewable energy potential. However, a majority of these resources remain undeveloped. The Department of Energy (DOE) has identified tribal lands as having the potential for over 6,000 gigawatts of utility-scale solar photovoltaic capacity, which could help to alleviate economic hardships among tribal populations. However, there are several factors that limit federal government energy purchases from tribes, including requirements to purchase from monopoly utilities, difficulty entering the market at prevailing rates, lack of access to transmission infrastructure, limited access to capital, and lack of technical capacity. Although federal agencies are authorized to give preference to majority tribally owned energy suppliers when purchasing energy, this preference has not been widely used due to uncertainty and lack of guidance. The General Services Administration (GSA) has primary authority for energy contracts, and while they acknowledged the need for implementing guidance, they believe that government-wide rulemaking is required from the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to clarify the use of the preference.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays monthly disability compensation to veterans with service-connected disabilities based on the severity of their disability. The VA's disability compensation claims process begins when a veteran submits a claim, and a claims processor assists the veteran in gathering the necessary evidence to evaluate the claim, including military service records and medical exams. If needed, the VA will provide a medical exam through a VHA medical facility or a VBA contractor. In 2016, the VA established an exam program office to manage and oversee contractors, but it has faced challenges in collecting accurate information on contractor quality and timeliness. The VA has taken steps to address these issues, such as hiring additional staff for quality reviews and implementing a new exam management system. However, the VA has not fully resolved the problems and has not yet implemented a plan to verify that contracted examiners have completed required training. Proper oversight of contractors is crucial to ensure that veterans receive timely and high-quality exams, and without sustained oversight, the VA risks causing harm to veterans through delayed or inadequate exams.", "The aviation industry has specific workforce needs that vary depending on the type of work performed. This includes FAA-certificated mechanics and repairmen, as well as non-certificated workers. FAA-certificated mechanics inspect, service, and repair aircraft bodies and engines and can approve an aircraft for return to service. It can take up to 3 years to obtain the necessary education or training for certification. FAA-certificated repairmen service aircraft components and must be recommended by their employer for specific tasks. It takes over a year to obtain the required experience or training for certification. Non-certificated aviation maintenance workers are supervised by certificated mechanics or repairmen. Federal data shows that as of December 2018, there were about 295,000 FAA-certificated mechanics and 35,000 repairmen. The median age of these workers is 54, and only 3% are women. The supply of certificated workers is projected to grow, with an average of 8,600 new certifications issued each year. However, there are limitations to this data, as it does not collect information on race or ethnicity, and it is unclear how many certificate holders are retired or working in other industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects an average of 11,800 job openings annually for aircraft mechanics and service technicians from 2018-2028. There are challenges in determining employment characteristics such as pay, as the classification system used does not distinguish between certificated and non-certificated workers. Some employers in the industry are experiencing difficulty finding enough workers, while others are not. There are federal grants and programs available to support individuals pursuing aviation maintenance careers, such as DOD's COOL program and DOL's Registered Apprenticeship Program. FAA has established an Aviation Workforce Steering Committee to address workforce related provisions and support workforce development. However, FAA does not routinely analyze or collect data related to workforce development, and there are areas where improved data analysis, collection, or coordination could assist in measuring progress and targeting resources. The current curriculum requirements for AMT schools and mechanic testing standards are considered outdated, and efforts are being made to update them. FAA has proposed rulemaking to update the curriculum requirements, and the testing standards are also being updated. However, delays in finalizing these updates could result in the continued use of outdated or irrelevant questions on the mechanic tests.", "Historically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has separated children from adults at the border only in certain circumstances, such as when the parental relationship couldn't be confirmed or if the adult posed a threat to the child's safety. Children in these situations were treated as unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). However, in April 2018, the Attorney General issued a memo directing DHS to refer all improper entry offenses for criminal prosecution, resulting in more parents being separated from their children and placed into U.S. Marshals Service custody. These separated children were also treated as UAC and transferred to ORR. A federal judge ruled in June 2018 that certain separated parents must be reunited with their children, and as of September 2018, the government had identified 2,654 children affected by this ruling. The responsibility for the care and custody of UAC is delegated to DHS and ORR, respectively. ORR has cooperative agreements with residential care providers to house and care for UAC, and staff at these facilities are responsible for identifying potential sponsors for the children. Prior to the April 2018 memo, DHS and HHS did not plan for family separations or an increase in the number of children referred to ORR. Changes were made to the data systems of CBP and ORR to better indicate when children are separated from their parents, but it is unclear if these changes will consistently help identify and reunify separated families.", "Different aviation industry employers have specific workforce needs and require workers with specific skillsets. The aviation maintenance workforce includes FAA-certificated mechanics and repairmen, as well as non-certificated workers. FAA-certificated mechanics inspect, service, and repair aircraft bodies and engines, and only they can approve an aircraft for return to service. FAA-certificated repairmen service aircraft components and must be recommended by their employer to perform specific tasks. Non-certificated aviation maintenance workers are supervised by certificated mechanics or repairmen. The FAA collects data on certificated mechanics and repairmen, but there is no data on the total number of non-certificated workers. There are three pathways to become eligible to take the FAA mechanic tests\u2014military training and experience, AMT School, and practical work experience. The median age of FAA-certificated mechanics and repairmen is 54 years old, and women make up 3 percent of certificate holders. The demand for certificated aviation maintenance workers is difficult to determine due to data limitations. BLS data project an annual average of 11,800 job openings for aircraft mechanics and service technicians from 2018-2028. However, the availability and willingness of workers to work in the aviation industry is also a factor. The pay for certificated workers is difficult to determine due to classification systems and data limitations. BLS data show that annual wages for aircraft mechanics and service technicians range from about $37,000 to about $98,000. The demand for certificated workers is influenced by factors such as the number of people qualified for the work, their availability, willingness to work at a certain wage, and working conditions.", "CMS and states work together to administer the Medicaid program and share in the financing of Medicaid payments. States can deliver healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries through fee-for-service payments or Medicaid managed care plans. States finance their share of Medicaid spending through various sources, including state funds, taxes on healthcare providers, and funding from local government providers. Medicaid payments to hospitals are made through base payments and supplemental payments. Base payments are set by state Medicaid programs and can vary across states. Supplemental payments are lump sum payments that can offset uncompensated care costs for hospitals serving Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured low-income patients. There are two types of supplemental payments: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, which are required by law, and non-DSH payments, which are allowed but not required. States also make four types of non-DSH payments: Medicaid upper payment limit (UPL) payments, uncompensated care pool payments, delivery system reform incentive payment (DSRIP) programs, and graduate medical education payments. PPACA allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility, and as a result, the number of uninsured individuals decreased. However, Congress has delayed the reduction in DSH allotments to states multiple times. Supplemental payments have become more popular in recent years as states have reduced or frozen base payments to hospitals. States and hospitals prefer supplemental payments because they provide more predictability in payments. Supplemental payments are often financed through sources other than state general funds, such as taxes levied on healthcare providers. Supplemental payments give states flexibility in targeting payments to specific hospitals or types of hospitals. However, there have been concerns that DSH payments are not always targeted to hospitals with the highest uncompensated care costs. The amount of DSH payments to hospitals varies widely, with some hospitals receiving as little as 1 cent and others receiving hundreds of millions of dollars.", "FAA air traffic controllers are responsible for guiding aircraft in terminal areas at U.S. airports. Incidents can occur in both movement and non-movement areas, including runway incursions, runway excursions, wrong-surface incidents, and ramp area incidents. The FAA oversees terminal area safety through various offices, including the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), the Office of Airports, the Office of Aviation Safety, and the Office of Aviation Safety, Accident Investigation and Prevention. The FAA has implemented safety initiatives and uses a data-driven approach to analyze runway incursions and excursions. However, the agency's data on excursions may contain duplicates, and it does not use data to analyze most ramp area incidents. Ramp areas have their own safety risks and complexities, and analyzing ramp incidents could help mitigate these risks. The FAA, airports, and airlines have implemented efforts to improve safety in terminal areas, but the FAA's focus is primarily on runway and taxiway safety.", "The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) is responsible for managing the Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process to resolve workplace violations in the legislative branch. They have implemented three of the four requirements mandated by the Reform Act, which became effective in June 2019. The requirements include managing changes to the ADR process, appointing a confidential advisor, and creating a secure electronic system to file claims. However, OCWR has not yet completed the requirement to establish a program to permanently retain records. They have taken interim steps to establish a records retention program but have not developed the necessary policies and procedures. OCWR has also incorporated some key management practices, such as defining requirements and establishing project schedules for certain tasks. However, they did not consistently incorporate these practices for all requirements and missed opportunities to communicate with stakeholders and manage expectations. OCWR also lacks meaningful performance goals and measures to assess progress towards their strategic goals. They have identified performance measures but have not set target levels of performance or used the data to improve their programs. Overall, there are opportunities for improvement in the implementation and administration of Reform Act requirements by OCWR.", "Several bureaus within the Department of the Interior are responsible for leasing, permitting, and inspecting mineral extraction activities on federal lands and waters. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for onshore activities and manages approximately 700 million acres of subsurface mineral rights throughout the country. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management handles offshore leasing and resource planning, while the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement is responsible for permitting, inspecting, and verifying production volumes on offshore leases. Companies must obtain leases and permits from these bureaus before conducting drilling activities. Once drilling begins, oil and gas is transported to market and sold, with companies deducting certain costs associated with transportation and natural gas processing from the royalties due. BLM and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement have inspection and enforcement programs to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including those related to measuring oil and gas volumes. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) is responsible for collecting, disbursing, and verifying federal royalties on oil and gas production. Companies with federal leases are required to submit monthly reports to ONRR, reporting production volumes and calculating the royalty payment owed. ONRR reconciles these reports with the actual payments made by companies and disburses royalties to appropriate accounts. ONRR also conducts audits, compliance reviews, and data mining activities to ensure accurate reporting and payment of royalties. The Department of the Interior has established strategic goals to improve the management of oil and gas revenue collection. In the past, there have been issues with royalty collection, including late payments and underpayments. The Department and Congress have taken steps to address these issues, including passing the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act. Several recommendations have been made to improve compliance processes and systems within ONRR, and efforts to restructure and improve the agency's operations are underway.", "Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are small countries in the Pacific region. The United States has a relationship with these countries dating back to World War II when the US liberated them from Japanese control. In the years following the war, the US entered into trusteeships with the United Nations and became the administering authority over Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The US provides economic assistance to these countries through compact agreements. The economic assistance provided to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands totals $3.6 billion, while Palau has received $229 million. The US also has defense and security responsibilities in these countries, and subsidiary agreements allow for US military use of certain facilities. Compact migrants from these countries have certain visa and labor certification exemptions and are eligible for certain US federal benefit programs. The number of compact migrants living in the US has increased over the years, raising concerns about the accuracy of population estimates. Compact migrants move to the US for economic opportunities, educational opportunities, access to healthcare, to join family members, and for personal freedom.", "The summary provides an overview of the United States' control and administration of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The text explains that the CNMI became a self-governing commonwealth in political union with the United States after a covenant was established in 1976. Certain federal laws, such as minimum wage provisions and immigration laws, were exempted for the CNMI. However, the CNRA in 2008 amended the covenant to generally apply federal immigration law to the CNMI. The CNMI-Only Transitional Worker program was established in 2011 by DHS to facilitate the transition from the CNMI immigration system to the U.S. federal immigration system. The text also discusses H.R. 560, a proposed bill that would provide CNMI resident status to eligible individuals. The summary highlights the statistics on CW-1 permits and H-2B beneficiaries for foreign workers in the CNMI and mentions concerns about the removal of the Philippines from the list of countries eligible for the H-2B program. USCIS data is used to analyze the number of CW-1 permit holders and the reduction in petitions for construction workers under the CNRA. The summary also mentions the establishment of E-2C status for foreign long-term investors and the termination of parole for certain individuals in the CNMI. Lastly, the summary acknowledges that individuals who qualify under certain criteria may be eligible to apply for CNMI resident status under H.R. 560.", "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an agency established in 1974 that is responsible for regulating nuclear material and activities in the United States. It is headed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The NRC is responsible for revising budget estimates and determining how funds are distributed for major programs. NRC staff in various offices implement the agency's programs, including regulations, licensing, inspection, enforcement, and emergency response. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer oversees the agency's budget and regulatory user fee policies, including assessing fees to licensees and sending invoices. NRC's authority to charge fees comes from two laws, and it aims to recover approximately 90 percent of its annual budget through fees. The licensees regulated by NRC include a wide range of commercial users of nuclear material. NRC sets its fees through a rulemaking process, including a proposed fee rule, a comment period, and a final fee rule. In recent years, there have been initiatives and recommendations to improve NRC's fee-setting process. NRC's billing process involves identifying billable work, reviewing and validating charges, and sending invoices to licensees. Disputes may arise, and NRC provides additional information to licensees through cost estimates and biweekly reports. Various findings and recommendations have been made to improve NRC's billing process. NRC submits an annual budget justification to Congress and allocates appropriated funds to its offices to carry out its mission. The agency collects approximately 90 percent of its budget through fees. NRC's budget structure includes major programs and business lines, with corporate support costs allocated across all business lines. Several findings and recommendations have been made to improve NRC's budgeting process. In recent years, NRC has made changes to its fee-setting process to improve clarity and consistency in fee rules, as well as performance goals for transparency and timeliness. NRC has provided definitions of key terms, posted fee-related spreadsheets, and made other changes to enhance transparency. However, some licensees still find it difficult to determine what is covered by fees. NRC has modified its budgeting system to provide more detailed information on which budgeted activities are recovered through service fees and annual fees for the operating fee class. However, similar modifications have not been made for other fee classes.", "CBP, OFO, Border Patrol, and ICE are responsible for securing U.S. borders, inspecting travelers, and processing individuals who are apprehended. USCIS and EOIR are responsible for screening and adjudicating credible and reasonable fear claims, and immigration judges make determinations in removal proceedings. USCIS asylum officers have a high rate of positive determinations, while immigration judges uphold negative determinations most of the time. USCIS has procedures in place for conducting interviews and security checks during the screening process. FDNS assists with security checks, but their involvement is limited in credible and reasonable fear cases.", "New technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, are transforming societies and changing the workforce. While automation has historically disrupted manufacturing and physical work, recent progress in AI and robotics is enabling machines to perform cognitive tasks currently performed by humans. Examples of AI applications include expert systems that perform predefined tasks, like preparing tax filings, and machine learning systems that \"learn\" how to perform tasks, like reading information from a form. Studies have estimated that a significant number of jobs are at risk of automation, but the effects on employment are complex and difficult to predict. Advanced technologies may lead to job displacement but could also create new jobs that require different skills. The adoption of advanced technologies may be influenced by a variety of factors, and the impact on industries and occupations can vary. While there are indications that advanced technologies are changing the workforce, comprehensive data on technology adoption and workforce effects are lacking. Workers with lower levels of education, certain racial or ethnic backgrounds, and particular geographic areas may be more vulnerable to job displacement. These workers tend to earn lower wages compared to workers in occupations less susceptible to automation. Overall, the relationship between advanced technologies and employment trends is complex and still evolving.", "The percentage of female active-duty servicemembers in the United States military has slightly increased from 2004 to 2018. However, female enlisted servicemembers and commissioned officers have higher attrition rates than their male counterparts, and the percentage of female active-duty servicemembers decreases as years of service increase. Factors such as access to quality childcare and family planning influence female servicemembers' decisions to separate from the military. The Air Force has the highest percentage of female servicemembers, while the Marine Corps has the lowest. Female servicemembers are more likely to separate from the military than males, and this likelihood is higher for married servicemembers with dependents compared to unmarried servicemembers without dependents.", "The Office of Federal Student Aid administers federal student aid programs, including the TEPSLF and PSLF programs. Only Direct Loans are eligible for these programs. Education currently contracts with nine loan servicers to handle services for the Direct Loan program. However, for TEPSLF and PSLF, Education contracts with a single loan servicer. To qualify for loan forgiveness under these programs, borrowers must be employed in a public service job for 10 years, make 120 on-time monthly loan payments, and not be in default on their loans. TEPSLF allows borrowers to qualify for forgiveness through additional repayment plans that do not qualify for PSLF. The TEPSLF program is currently funded with $700 million and will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Education has implemented a confusing application process for TEPSLF, requiring borrowers to first submit a PSLF application before they can be considered for TEPSLF. This has led to numerous denials and confusion among borrowers. Education should integrate the TEPSLF request into the PSLF application to simplify the process for borrowers. Additionally, Education does not provide complete information to borrowers about options to contest a denied TEPSLF request. There are options for borrowers to address their concerns, but Education does not include this information in denial letters or on its website. Finally, Education does not ensure that the loan servicer responsible for TEPSLF is receiving accurate loan payment history information, increasing the risk of inappropriate denials.", "U.S. and foreign air carriers cooperate through various methods to expand their international reach and services. These methods include interlining and codesharing, as well as the formation of global alliances. These alliances, such as Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance, allow airlines to link their route networks and coordinate marketing, sales, and other activities. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) reviews and approves these cooperative agreements and may grant antitrust immunity to allow carriers to cooperate more extensively. The DOT's review process involves analyzing the competitive and public benefit effects of the agreements and considering factors such as the geographic scope of the alliance, the number of competitors in affected markets, and the likelihood of market entry by new competitors. The DOT may also stipulate certain conditions or remedies to mitigate potential competitive harms. Overall, the DOT aims to determine whether the proposed agreement will have a positive or negative impact on competition and consumer benefits before making a decision to approve or deny it.", "Natural gas is stored in underground geologic formations such as salt caverns, depleted aquifers, and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Depleted natural gas or oil reservoirs are the most common type of storage sites in the United States, accounting for 80% of the approximately 400 sites. Salt caverns and depleted aquifers each make up about 10% of the sites. The largest natural gas storage sites are located in California, Louisiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The wells used to inject and withdraw natural gas from these storage sites are constructed with multiple layers of steel casing to prevent leaks. However, wells that lack multiple control points can be prone to single-point failures, leading to large gas releases. The Aliso Canyon incident in California in 2015 was caused by damage to a well casing and a lack of redundant safety valves. The leak lasted for four months and resulted in the temporary relocation of nearby residents due to health issues. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for overseeing the safety of natural gas storage sites and issued an interim final rule in December 2016 that established minimum safety standards. PHMSA is expected to issue a final rule in October 2019. The regulation of natural gas storage sites was changed by the PIPES Act of 2016, which required PHMSA to set safety standards and partner with states for oversight. PHMSA also collects user fees from operators of storage sites, which can only be used for safety-related activities. The health effects of exposure to hazardous chemicals in the air, water, or soil can be significant. Several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have roles in assessing the public health and environmental effects of exposure to chemicals. EPA uses scientific research to identify linkages between exposure to environmental contaminants and diseases or health outcomes. OSHA and other agencies also have responsibilities related to the human health effects of chemicals. In 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed PHMSA's natural gas storage program and found that the agency had not fully established performance goals or assessed resource needs. PHMSA has since established a performance goal to inspect all natural gas storage sites within 5 years but has not fully assessed resource needs or established a performance goal that measures progress toward improving safety. Inspections conducted by PHMSA focus on determining whether storage sites meet minimum safety standards and include visual inspections of wells and reviews of safety procedures.", "Technological advancements have enabled single-aisle aircraft to fly longer distances, resulting in the majority of U.S. carriers using single-aisle aircraft for domestic flights. However, these aircraft do not typically have lavatories that are accessible to passengers with disabilities. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has taken steps to address this issue, including creating an advisory committee and exploring the feasibility of requiring accessible lavatories on new single-aisle aircraft. Both Airbus and Boeing offer lavatory designs that can accommodate passengers with reduced mobility, but carriers often choose not to acquire them due to cost and space considerations. Passengers with reduced mobility may face challenges when flying, and precautionary measures are often taken to avoid using the lavatory. There is limited information available to passengers about which flights have accessible lavatories, and aircraft can be switched at the last minute without notice. While complaints about lavatory accessibility are not common, stakeholders argue that the lack of accessible lavatories makes flying difficult for passengers with disabilities.", "The primary mortgage market consists of lenders originating mortgage loans for borrowers to purchase homes. Lenders evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers based on credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and loan-to-value ratios. Borrowers with strong credit histories receive prime mortgages with competitive interest rates. Mortgage lending carries various risks, including credit risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. After origination, mortgages are serviced until they are paid in full or closed due to nonpayment. Lenders can hold mortgage loans in their portfolios or sell them to institutions in the secondary market. The federal government participates in both the primary and secondary mortgage markets, operating mortgage guarantee and insurance programs, and regulating the housing finance system through various agencies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, purchase conforming mortgages and hold them in their portfolios or pool them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are sold to investors. The housing market has shown signs of recovery since the financial crisis, with rising house prices and declining mortgage delinquency rates. The federal government has continued to support the housing market with mortgage guarantees and involvement in the secondary market.", "The U.S. retirement system consists of Social Security, employer-sponsored pensions and retirement savings plans, and individual savings. Social Security is the foundation of the system but is facing financial difficulties. Employer-sponsored pensions have shifted from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, which place more financial risks on employees. Individual savings include home equity and other non-retirement assets. The number of older Americans is increasing, and disparities in income and wealth among older households have grown. Social Security plays a significant role in retirement security, particularly for lower-wealth households. There are disparities in income and wealth based on education, race, and marital status.", "Federal research centers known as FFRDCs were established during World War II through partnerships between the federal government and academic researchers. They were later restructured to retain scientists and became known as FFRDCs in the 1960s. FFRDCs perform tasks such as technical studies, research and development, and systems engineering for federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD). FFRDCs can be operated by universities, nonprofit organizations, or private industry firms. The DOD sponsors 10 FFRDCs, which fall into three categories: S&A Centers, Research and Development Laboratories, and Systems Engineering and Integration Centers. These centers provide independent analysis and advice, conduct research and development, and ensure complex systems meet operational requirements, respectively. Sponsoring agreements between the primary sponsor (the DOD organization overseeing the FFRDC) and the parent organization of the FFRDC define the purpose, mission, and operation of the FFRDC. The FAR and DOD instruction provide guidelines for these agreements, including the prevention of conflicts of interest and limitations on commercial work. The primary sponsor awards noncompetitive contracts to FFRDCs to support research requirements. The FAR requires a comprehensive review of the FFRDC at least every five years to determine the need for continued sponsorship. Work sponsors, either the primary sponsor or another entity, initiate projects at FFRDCs and approve research proposals based on the FFRDC's core competencies. DOD manages the overall level of FFRDC work using a metric called staff years of technical effort (STE) and sets an annual limitation on Defense STE funded for non-intelligence programs. From fiscal years 2013 to 2018, DOD obligations to the 10 sponsored FFRDCs increased annually from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. S&A Centers accounted for about 18% of obligations, Research and Development Laboratories accounted for 27%, and Systems Engineering and Integration Centers accounted for 55%. Sponsoring agreements and comprehensive reviews highlight the importance of strategic relationships between the sponsors and FFRDCs in maintaining expertise in subject areas relevant to DOD.", "The Veterans Administration (VA) provides health care services to veterans through its Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and relies on its health information system called VistA. VistA is a complex system that supports health care delivery at over 1,500 locations and includes an electronic health record (EHR) and various other functionalities like billing and time management. The VA has decided to replace VistA with a commercial off-the-shelf system called Cerner Millennium, which will be implemented over a 10-year period. However, the VA has not fully defined VistA, including site-specific customizations, which has posed challenges for the transition to the new system. Efforts have been made to better define VistA, but more work is needed.", "The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), to establish historic preservation programs to protect historic properties. Historic properties are defined as buildings, structures, objects, sites, or districts listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) advises the President and Congress on matters related to historic preservation and coordinates activities between federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nSection 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their projects on historic properties and provide the ACHP with an opportunity to comment. Part 800 of the Code of Federal Regulations outlines the procedures for meeting these responsibilities. State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs) assist federal agencies, including the DOD, in their Section 106 duties and ensure that historic properties are considered in project planning.\n\nProgrammatic agreements are negotiated and executed by federal agencies, the ACHP, and SHPOs to address adverse effects on historic properties. These agreements can be used in various circumstances, such as when effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or when the effects cannot be fully determined prior to project approval.\n\nSection 110 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to establish preservation programs and designate qualified preservation officers. Executive Order 13287, Preserve America, instructs executive branch departments to integrate historic preservation into their activities. DOD Instruction 4715.16 establishes a department-wide program for managing cultural resources, including historic properties.\n\nDOD uses historic properties to support mission needs or house service members and their families. Consultation with SHPOs allows for repurposing or renovation of historic properties to meet current needs. However, DOD has only evaluated a portion of its roughly 375,000 properties for historic significance.\n\nData discrepancies and gaps exist in DOD's recording and reporting of historic properties. Inaccurate and incomplete data in the Real Property Assets Database (RPAD) hinder oversight and management of real property needs. Gaps in data regarding historic properties were identified between installation and department-level databases.\n\nRecommendations were made to improve DOD's recording and reporting processes for historic properties. DOD plans to develop corrective action plans to address data discrepancies.\n\nResponsibility for identifying and evaluating historic privatized military homes is often transferred to private developers. Some private developers do not actively identify or evaluate homes for historic significance, while others hire third parties to do so. Verification of the identification and evaluation process by installation personnel could ensure that historic properties are appropriately managed and preserved.\n\nOverall, DOD has established programs and processes for historic preservation, but there are areas for improvement in data management and oversight of historic properties.", "Federal policy for rental housing focuses on assisting low-income households through rental assistance and incentives for affordable housing development. However, the current funding does not meet the needs of all households with worst case housing needs, which include those with very low incomes who spend more than half of their income on rent or live in inadequate conditions. In 2015, there were 8.3 million households with worst case needs, an increase from 7.7 million in 2013. Many federal rental assistance programs have income eligibility requirements that determine program eligibility and identify populations in need. The national rentership rate has increased over the years, with an estimated 36 percent of households renting their homes in 2017. This increase is due to factors such as lasting financial effects of the financial crisis and rising home prices outpacing wage growth. Rentership rates have increased for all age categories except for older households. Late middle-aged households (50-64 years old) experienced the largest increase in the number of renter households. Black households have higher rentership rates than White, Hispanic, and Asian households, and rentership rates among White households have remained stable. Higher-income households have seen the greatest increase in rentership, becoming the second largest renter group in 2017. The majority of renter households are burdened by rent, with an estimated 48 percent of renter households considered rent burdened in 2017. Severe rent burden, where more than 50 percent of income is spent on rent, has also become more common. Factors contributing to the increase in rent burden include limited housing supply, demographics, foreclosures during the financial crisis, and tighter credit standards. Rent burden is more common among minorities, older adults, and in dense metropolitan areas. Low-income households have seen the greatest increase in rent burden, while higher-income households have seen fewer rent burden challenges. The consequences of rent burden are particularly severe for lower-income households, who may struggle to afford other necessities and may be at risk of eviction and homelessness. Challenges can vary across cities and regions due to differences in local market rents and incomes. While moderate-income households face less dire consequences, they still experience significant challenges due to rent burden. The lowest-income households face the most difficulties in securing affordable rental units.", "CERCLA, also known as the Superfund program, was established to clean up contaminated sites in order to protect human health and the environment from hazardous substances. The program requires the President to establish procedures and standards for prioritizing and responding to releases of hazardous substances. PRPs (Potentially Responsible Parties) are responsible for conducting or paying for the cleanup of contaminated sites. EPA and PRPs can undertake two types of cleanup actions: removal actions, which are short-term cleanups for immediate threats, and remedial actions, which are long-term cleanups aimed at significantly reducing contamination. The process for cleaning up nonfederal National Priorities List (NPL) sites includes site assessment, site listing on the NPL, remedial investigation and feasibility study, record of decision, remedial design and remedial action, construction completion, postconstruction completion, and deletion from the NPL. Nonfederal NPL sites may contain various contaminants, with arsenic, lead, mercury, vinyl chloride, and polychlorinated biphenyls being the highest-priority contaminants. These contaminants can be found in groundwater and soil. The cleanup of nonfederal NPL sites may involve various on-site or off-site remedies, including treatment, containment, disposal, and institutional controls. Flood hazards, storm surge from hurricanes, wildfires, and sea level rise are potential climate change effects that may impact nonfederal NPL sites. Data on these effects are available from various federal agencies, but the data may not fully account for the number of sites that may be impacted. Enterprise risk management, which considers risks across the entire organization, including risks from climate change effects, is an essential element in managing risk at nonfederal NPL sites. Approximately 60% of nonfederal NPL sites may be located in areas that could be impacted by one or more climate change effects. However, these estimates may not be comprehensive due to limitations in the available data and uncertainties associated with climate change projections.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) uses the Defense Acquisition System to acquire new weapon systems for its warfighters. This system is guided by two key acquisition policies, DOD Directive 5000.01 and DOD Instruction 5000.02, which establish the framework and procedures for the acquisition process. Each military service also has its own acquisition policies.\n\nThe oversight of DOD weapon system acquisition programs is carried out by several entities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments. This includes the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, who is responsible for policies and supervision of defense research and engineering activities. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment is responsible for policies and supervision of acquisition and sustainment matters.\n\nAt the military department level, the service acquisition executive is responsible for all acquisition functions within the department and can serve as the milestone decision authority. Congress has recently devolved decision-making authority for major defense acquisition programs from OSD to these service acquisition executives.\n\nReliability is an important factor in weapon system acquisition, as poor reliability can negatively affect warfighters through low operational availability and increase operating and support costs. DOD's approach to reliability has evolved over time, with a shift towards increased focus on reliability engineering during system design and development.\n\nIn the commercial sector, companies proactively address reliability from the beginning of the development process. They include reliability engineers as part of their development teams and implement reliability tools and methods to identify and address potential failures. They also emphasize the importance of realistic reliability requirements, reliability with suppliers, and continuous improvement of system design.\n\nOverall, reliability is a critical aspect of weapon system acquisition that can significantly impact operational availability and cost. Both DOD and commercial companies recognize the importance of addressing reliability early in the development process to ensure high-quality and reliable systems.", "The Secretary of the Army is responsible for recruiting personnel, while the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs serves as the principal advisor for personnel management. The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-1, advises on manpower matters. The Army contracts with an advertising agency to develop and implement its marketing and advertising program. The Army conducts marketing activities to create awareness, engage potential recruits, and activate them to enlist. To improve contract oversight, the Army has implemented processes such as creating a project management office and implementing training to evaluate contractor performance. The Army is also taking steps to measure the effectiveness of its marketing and advertising program and has revised its strategic goals.", "The number of federal data centers in the U.S. has increased significantly over the years, causing substantial costs to the government. In 1998, there were 432 data centers, while in July 2010 the number had risen to 2,094, and by August 2016, there were 9,995 data centers. The cost to operate these centers has also been substantial, with the Environmental Protection Agency estimating that annual electricity costs for federal servers and data centers in 2007 were around $450 million. Furthermore, the low server utilization rates, at just 5 percent, and the high energy use intensity compared to commercial buildings, led to the recognition of the need to improve efficiency and performance in federal data centers. The Federal CIO established the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) in February 2010 to address these concerns. The initiative's goals were to reduce energy and real estate footprint, cut costs, improve IT security, and shift to more efficient technologies. In May 2018, agencies reported a total of 12,062 data centers in their inventories, a significant increase since 2011. To address these issues, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) in August 2016, which requires agencies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security, and achieve cost savings. OMB's guidance also included new metrics for measuring progress in data center closures, cost savings, and optimization. In November 2018, proposed changes to DCOI were published, focusing on larger, tiered data centers and revising the classification and metrics used for data centers. Since the enactment of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) in 2014, agencies have made progress in closing data centers and achieving cost savings, although many recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have yet to be fully addressed.", "Technology assessments (TAs) are becoming increasingly important for policymakers due to the growing impact of science and technology (S&T) on society and the economy. TAs help policymakers understand and evaluate the potential risks and benefits of technological changes, ensuring national security and global competitiveness. TAs can assist in decision-making by highlighting the impacts, risks, benefits, status, viability, and maturity of a technology, as well as informing federal investments in S&T. Congressional committees often request TAs to make decisions on resource allocation, rulemaking, legislative agendas, and national strategies. TAs also consider the policy context surrounding a technology and may analyze policy options. Developing a written TA design helps coordinate and guide the project team's activities and ensures the collection and analysis of relevant and appropriate data. Sound TA design involves three phases: situational analysis, design development, and implementation. These phases are iterative and nonlinear, allowing for adjustments based on new information and changing circumstances. Considerations for sound TA design include addressing the needs of the requester, producing a quality and independent product, providing useful information to stakeholders, using valid evidence, meeting time and resource constraints, and identifying and assessing policy options when applicable. Various challenges can arise during TA design and implementation, such as readability, uncertainty in policy outcomes, complexity of TAs, and stakeholder engagement. These challenges can be mitigated through strategies such as clear communication, flexible designs, data triangulation, and inclusive stakeholder engagement.", "IDEA, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, was enacted to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free appropriate public education. It provides grants to states for Early Intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays or diagnosed conditions. It also provides grants to states to assist in providing special education and related services to eligible children with disabilities. In fiscal year 2019, the total appropriation for IDEA Parts B and C was approximately $13.2 billion. Each state has a designated lead agency responsible for administering and monitoring Part C. States have different processes for identifying and evaluating children, and eligibility criteria can vary. Challenges in identifying and evaluating children can result in some infants and toddlers not receiving Early Intervention services. In addition, challenges in the identification process for Part B can result in some students inappropriately being determined eligible or ineligible for services.", "The Coast Guard has 11 statutory missions, including both homeland security and non-homeland security missions. These missions are divided among different units, such as boat stations, cutters, and Specialized Forces. Specialized Forces units are deployed from major U.S. port areas to conduct operations domestically and internationally. The Coast Guard is the lead federal maritime law enforcement agency beyond 12 nautical miles offshore. The Coast Guard reorganized its Specialized Forces units in 2007 to create the Deployable Operations Group, but disbanded it in 2013 and returned to the previous regional command structure. The reorganization aimed to address safety concerns, increase standardization, and improve coordination with other agencies. The Coast Guard has generally applied key practices for agency reform, such as establishing goals and involving employees and stakeholders. However, it has only partially applied other practices, such as using data and evidence to assess workforce needs and evaluating overlap or gaps in capabilities among Specialized Forces units. An analysis of Coast Guard data suggests variations in the number of operations requested for some units, which may impact efficiency and utilization.", "Under the APA, agencies engage in three phases of the rulemaking process: initiating rulemaking actions, developing proposed rulemaking actions, and developing final rulemaking actions. Public comments are a crucial part of the rulemaking process, with three phases: comment intake, comment analysis, and comment response. Agencies are required to consider relevant and substantive comments and provide a response in the final rule. The APA does not require agencies to verify the identity of commenters. Agencies are required to publish notice of proposed rulemaking, allow interested parties to comment, issue a final rule, and publish the final rule before it becomes effective. The E-Government Act of 2002 and Executive Order 13563 emphasize the importance of public participation in the rulemaking process. Agencies are encouraged to provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to participate online. Regulations.gov is a widely used platform for submitting comments, but some agencies have their own websites. Various comment systems exist, including Regulations.gov, FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), and SEC's Comment Letter Log. Anonymous comments are accepted by most agencies and there is no mechanism to check the validity of identity information. Agency-specific comment websites and Regulations.gov collect some identity information but allow for anonymous comments. FCC requires submission of commenter's name and mailing address but allows anonymous comments. Information about public users' interaction with comment websites is collected separately from the comment submission process for security and performance purposes.", "Local educational agencies, or school districts, receive funding primarily from state and local sources. They use this funding for maintenance and operations, which includes routine replacements and emergency repairs. For larger construction projects, districts use separate capital funding, often obtained through bonds. Some federal funding is also available for school facilities, such as the Impact Aid program and funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for natural disasters. Many districts need to update or replace building systems, such as HVAC, interior lighting, roofing, safety and security systems, and plumbing. HVAC issues can lead to health and safety problems, while roofing and lighting issues also pose challenges. About 65% of districts have conducted a facilities condition assessment, but funding limitations and reliance on informal walkthroughs are common reasons for not conducting assessments. Some states have conducted state-level assessments, but most have not. Districts prioritize security, student access to technology, monitoring hazards, and improving telecommunication features when updating facilities. Health hazards and security are often addressed with urgency, while modernizing spaces is also a priority when possible.", "The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is responsible for securing the country's borders between ports of entry. The agency's Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations (AMO) divisions are in charge of securing the land, air, and maritime borders. The Border Patrol is responsible for securing the land borders, with eight sectors divided along the northern border. Each sector has multiple stations assigned to different geographic areas. The AMO is responsible for securing the air, marine, and land domains, with three branches and multiple units along the northern border. Both divisions use various technologies, facilities, and resources to secure the border. CBP also takes part in collaborative efforts with other law enforcement agencies, including task forces and partnerships, to enhance border security. The agency works closely with Canadian law enforcement and partners with other DHS components to address threats along the northern border. The primary threats along the northern border are contraband smuggling and violations of immigration and travel controls. CBP faces staffing and resource challenges to secure the northern border, but efforts are being made to address these challenges through the Northern Border Strategy. However, competing priorities with the southwest border may affect the resolution of these challenges.", "FEMA's Public Assistance program provides grant funding to governments and nonprofit organizations to assist with responding to and recovering from disasters. The program includes categories for emergency work, permanent work, and indirect costs. Grants can also be used for hazard mitigation measures. Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have used alternative procedures for large permanent work projects, allowing for fixed-cost estimates and additional funds for cost-effective hazard mitigation. As of April 2019, FEMA had obligated about $7.4 billion in grant funds for Public Assistance projects in Puerto Rico and the USVI. The majority of funding has been used for emergency work projects, such as debris removal, due to the immediate threats posed by the disasters. Challenges have been identified in the implementation of the Public Assistance program, including unclear guidance and the need for sufficient resources. FEMA has taken steps to address these issues, but their effectiveness is still being assessed.", "CMS oversees states' Medicaid programs, which provide comprehensive health benefits to vulnerable populations. States have flexibility in designing and implementing their Medicaid programs, resulting in over 50 distinct programs. States may offer Medicaid services under a fee-for-service or managed care model, while ACOs provide coordinated care to reduce spending and improve quality. Studies show that a small share of Medicaid beneficiaries account for a large portion of expenditures. Care management programs aim to manage costs and improve outcomes for high-expenditure Medicaid populations. States and MCOs use various methods to identify high-expenditure beneficiaries, such as risk scores, service utilization analysis, and diagnoses. Many states provide care management services to high-expenditure beneficiaries, but implementation barriers exist, such as difficulties in contacting beneficiaries and addressing social determinants of health.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning to complete approximately 70 new major medical projects between 2020 and 2024 to provide veterans with medical services. Activation is a key step before veterans can access care at these facilities and involves activities such as planning, purchasing, and installing new furniture, fixtures, and equipment, as well as hiring staff. Activation expenses can be one-time purchases or ongoing expenditures, and the total cost can be substantial. The VA's Activations Office, regional networks, and local medical centers play different roles in the activation process. Building acceptance and providing medical services to the first patient are important milestones in the activation process. Activation tasks include determining furniture and equipment needs, ordering items, planning for workforce needs, and training staff. After a building is accepted, activation tasks focus on moving into the space, such as equipment installation and staff training. Once a facility begins providing medical care, activation tasks are related to facility operations. Some activation tasks, like hiring staff, may occur after a facility begins serving patients. Delays in providing services can be caused by staffing issues, equipment size, commissioning problems, and procurement issues. The appropriate amount of time needed to provide clinical services after building acceptance varies based on the project scope. VHA lacks processes to develop total cost estimates for major activations and does not have documentation on allowable activation costs. This lack of information makes it difficult for VHA officials to make decisions about resource allocation and investigate deviations from planned spending. The current cost estimation process does not cover the full duration of activation and does not reflect best practices. VHA now has the accounting mechanisms to compare total activation costs against estimated costs, but the process for how to use this information has not been documented.", "In 2017, transit agencies in the United States provided over 10 billion rides, using various modes of transportation including buses, trains, ferries, and paratransit services. The transit workforce consists of a variety of occupations, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) supports workforce development through grants and technical assistance. However, there is a lack of clear data and projections on the future transit workforce, leading to confusion among stakeholders. The FTA has used combined data on transit and ground passenger transportation to communicate needs and projections, but this can be misleading as it includes services that do not meet the statutory definition of transit. There is a need for more specific transit workforce data, but stakeholders have varying opinions on the extent of this need. Transit agencies and organizations are taking various actions to address workforce needs, including career enhancement programs, courseware development, internships, managerial training, and research. The FTA has also provided workforce grants to support these efforts. It is important for the FTA to carefully consider the costs and benefits of collecting additional transit-specific workforce data and to ensure that stakeholders have the information they need to make informed decisions.", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule to pay physicians and other providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Providers bill Medicare using billing codes developed by an AMA panel. Each year, the panel reviews proposals for new or revised codes and applies criteria to determine if they should be added. CMS pays providers a fixed amount, based on relative values, for each code. Primary care providers have expressed concerns that the current codes do not fully reimburse them for care coordination and planning services. There are currently 58 billing codes that providers may use for these services, including broadly-defined codes and narrowly-defined codes introduced in 2013. Spending on narrowly-defined services has increased at a higher rate than broadly-defined services, due to increased utilization. The number of beneficiaries and providers receiving these services has also increased. Some stakeholders are in favor of a new billing code for a Comprehensive Longitudinal Care Planning (LCCP) service, while others believe the existing codes are sufficient or that a new code would overlap with existing codes.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are responsible for overseeing consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), which handle consumer data. The FTC investigates and enforces regulations concerning data security and consumer information, while the CFPB has enforcement authority for violations of consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB also has supervisory authority over larger CRAs. Data breaches, which involve the unauthorized exposure or loss of sensitive information, have occurred at various organizations, including Equifax. The Equifax breach compromised the personal information of millions of individuals due to software vulnerabilities and inadequate security measures. The FTC enforces compliance with consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). It has the authority to issue fines for violations but lacks civil penalty authority for GLBA's privacy and safeguarding provisions. The CFPB, on the other hand, enforces compliance with most provisions of FCRA, GLBA, and the Dodd-Frank Act. It has settled cases with several CRAs for violations of FCRA and unfair practices. The CFPB may not be identifying all CRAs subject to its oversight, and it could benefit from additional sources of information. Both the FTC and CFPB provide educational information to consumers on identity theft protection. Consumers have limited recourse against CRAs in the event of a data breach due to difficulties in linking the breach to identity theft and the lack of choice in the consumer reporting market. In light of the Equifax breach, it is important for the CFPB to consider data security risks when prioritizing examinations of CRAs.", "The text discusses the issue of employment-related identity fraud and its impact on the U.S. tax system. It explains that individuals who do not have a Social Security number may obtain an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the IRS to fulfill their tax obligations. The text highlights that employment-related identity fraud can occur when individuals use someone else's Social Security number to report income or obtain employment. The IRS can identify cases of employment-related identity fraud through its Nonfiler and Automated Underreporter programs, as well as through Employment-Related Identity Theft notices. The text also mentions various entities involved in verifying employment eligibility and processing wage information, such as employers, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the IRS. The text provides data on the risk characteristics associated with employment-related identity fraud, including individuals with multiple wage records, deceased individuals, children, and elderly individuals. It reveals that a significant number of individuals with risk characteristics did not report all their wage records to the IRS. The text asserts that the IRS did not identify all cases of reporting deficiencies, and suggests that the IRS should consider implementing additional checks to identify taxpayers at risk of employment-related identity fraud. The text also notes that federal income tax withholding was lower for individuals who did not report all their wage records and that some individuals did not withhold any federal income taxes despite earning significant wages. Overall, the text emphasizes the need for improved detection and prevention of employment-related identity fraud to protect the integrity of the U.S. tax system.", "The military retirement system has historically been considered an important incentive for recruiting and retaining career military personnel. Until recently, the High-3 retirement system was used, where servicemembers who served at least 20 years earned a defined benefit annuity based on their average highest 36 months of basic pay. However, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended changes to the system, leading to the establishment of the Blended Retirement System (BRS). Under the BRS, servicemembers receive a lower defined benefit annuity, but also have access to a defined contribution plan with employer contributions. The BRS also offers additional features, such as a continuation payment at the mid-career point and the option to convert a portion of the annuity to a lump-sum payment. The Department of Defense (DOD) developed three courses to educate servicemembers about the BRS, including an Opt-In Course, a course for financial management professionals, and a course for military supervisors. DOD also created a centralized website and used various media formats to provide information about the BRS. The service branches also developed their own outreach campaigns and supplemental trainings. DOD provides ongoing financial literacy training for servicemembers, with the service branches responsible for developing and delivering the training. While the BRS trainings met several effective financial literacy training practices, there were some shortcomings in assessing the effectiveness of the courses.", "In the United States, the authority to regulate elections is shared by federal, state, and local officials. While Congress has the power to regulate elections based on constitutional sources, the responsibility for administering elections lies mostly at the state and local levels. Each state has its own regulations and procedures for voter registration, absentee voting, and Election Day processes. Local election jurisdictions, of which there are about 10,300 nationwide, are responsible for managing and conducting elections.\n\nThe election process consists of pre-election, Election Day, and post-election activities. Pre-election activities include voter registration, training poll workers, preparing voting materials, and qualifying candidates. Election Day activities involve opening and closing polling places, checking in voters, and providing opportunities to cast ballots. Post-election activities include securing equipment and ballots, determining election outcomes, and performing recounts if necessary.\n\nThe election process relies on physical, cyber, and human assets, all of which are susceptible to unintentional and intentional threats. Unintentional threats include equipment failures, human errors, and natural disasters, while intentional threats can come from criminal groups, hackers, foreign nations, and terrorists. These adversaries vary in their capabilities and motives.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating the security of the Election Infrastructure Subsector (EIS). The EIS is part of the nation's critical infrastructure and includes the physical, cyber, and human components of the election process. DHS, through its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), works with federal, state, and local governments as well as private sector entities to protect the election infrastructure.\n\nCISA provides services in three areas to assist election officials in securing the election infrastructure: regional support and assistance, education and awareness, and information sharing and analysis. Regional personnel with expertise in cyber and physical security work with election officials to identify services that CISA can provide. These services include vulnerability scanning, risk assessments, and physical inspections of election-related facilities. CISA also disseminates educational materials, conducts tabletop exercises, and collaborates with state and local election officials to raise awareness of election security issues and best practices.\n\nOverall, the United States has a decentralized election system with shared authority and responsibilities between federal, state, and local officials. Efforts are being made to secure the election infrastructure and protect against unintentional and intentional threats through coordination and collaboration between government agencies and private sector entities.", "Flood risk management is a key mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers, who requested more than $3 billion for construction projects between 2015 and 2017. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains water resource development projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps follows a six-step planning process to identify and evaluate the effects of alternative plans for flood risk management. This includes identifying objectives, forecasting water and land resources conditions, formulating alternative plans, evaluating and analyzing each plan, comparing the plans, and selecting a recommended plan. The Corps evaluates the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan using categories such as National Economic Development and Environmental Quality. The Corps includes reduced damages and emergency costs avoided as benefits in its economic analyses, and considers costs such as construction, operation, maintenance, and real estate.", "The federal Health Center Program was established in the mid-1960s to help low-income individuals access healthcare services. The program makes grants to four types of health centers that primarily serve low-income populations: community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for residents of public housing, and migrant health centers. Total funding for these grants increased from $2.1 billion to $4.9 billion from fiscal years 2010 to 2017. Health centers are required to provide comprehensive primary health services to all residents in their service area and must have a sliding fee scale based on a patient's ability to pay. The number of health centers increased from 1,124 in 2010 to 1,373 in 2017, while the number of patients served increased from 19.5 million to 27.2 million. The share of revenue received from grants decreased, while the share of revenue from Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurance increased. The share of revenue from Section 330 grants, funded by the CHCF, increased from 15.7% in 2010 to 18.0% in 2017. The CHCF grants support ongoing operations and services at health centers, including uncompensated care costs for uninsured patients and services not typically covered by public health insurance. The grants also support increasing services at existing health centers and expanding the number of health centers and sites. From fiscal years 2011 to 2017, HRSA provided health centers with $15.8 billion in Section 330 grants funded by the CHCF. Most of this funding was awarded for service area funding, with the remaining funds awarded to increase services, establish new health centers and sites, and support other special initiatives.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a federal agency responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair markets, and facilitating capital formation. They require public companies to disclose financial and other information, examine regulated firms, and investigate potential violations of securities laws. Each year, SEC brings enforcement actions against individuals and companies, such as those involved in Ponzi schemes or misconduct in sales practices. SEC's Division of Enforcement conducts investigations and recommends enforcement actions, which are litigated and settled. The division maintains a database that tracks enforcement-related activities. They have two groups of Case Management Specialists (CMS) responsible for recording data and conducting quality checks. However, Enforcement lacks written procedures for generating the annual report, which includes compiling and verifying statistics. They rely on informal processes to ensure accuracy. The lack of written procedures increases the risk of errors and turnover. SEC has made changes to its public reporting over the years, including the creation of a stand-alone Enforcement Annual Report in 2017. GAO recommends that the Co-Directors of Enforcement develop written procedures for generating public reports, including compiling and verifying statistics. SEC generally agreed with the findings and concurred with the recommendation.", "The M\u00e9rida Initiative, created by Mexico and the United States in 2007, aimed to address crime and corruption in Mexico and domestic drug demand and trafficking of firearms to Mexico in the United States. The initiative initially focused on purchasing equipment for Mexican security forces, but later expanded to prioritize institution building, community engagement, and human rights efforts. The primary U.S. agencies involved in the initiative are State/INL and USAID, who work with Mexican officials to develop and fund projects. The funding for the initiative comes from three appropriations accounts: the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account, the Economic Support Fund account, and the Development Assistance account. From fiscal year 2014 to 2018, about $723 million was allocated for M\u00e9rida Initiative projects, with over 80% of the funding going towards Rule of Law and Human Rights, and Counternarcotics efforts. Both State/INL and USAID implement projects through various funding mechanisms, including contracts, grants, and agreements with international organizations. The projects funded by State/INL focused on criminal justice, border and port security, professionalizing the police, and counternarcotics efforts. Meanwhile, the projects funded by USAID prioritized crime and violence prevention, human rights, rule of law, and transparency and accountability.", "The summary text outlines the challenges faced in implementing the FEMA Public Assistance program in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in 2017. The program provides grant funding to assist in disaster response and recovery. The text discusses the different categories of funding, the roles of various entities involved in the program, and the challenges encountered in developing and estimating costs for projects. The text also mentions the additional direction provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Supplemental Relief Act of 2019. It concludes by noting the progress made in funding and completing projects in Puerto Rico, but also highlights the ongoing challenges and issues that need to be addressed.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a plan, known as the 921 plan, which includes eight initiatives aimed at reforming various activities within the department. The initiatives cover areas such as civilian hiring improvement, human resources regulatory reform, human resources service delivery, strategic sourcing, maintenance work packages, munitions readiness, service requirements review boards, and category management. The plan provides a schedule and cost estimate for most of the initiatives, with implementation costs estimated at $116.3 million to $116.8 million through fiscal year 2021. However, there is one initiative for which the cost estimate is still under development. \n\nThe plan aims to address issues such as the need to streamline civilian hiring, simplify personnel policies, establish common human resources systems, improve procurement practices, and enhance maintenance processes. Some of these initiatives align with prior recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). GAO has found that there is fragmentation and overlap within DOD's human resources services, lack of metrics for supply and maintenance operations, and ineffective service requirement review boards. The DOD's initiatives intend to address these issues, but there are some gaps in their coverage of GAO's recommendations.\n\nDOD claims that progress has been made on five of the eight initiatives, but the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment (OASD-S) did not provide sufficient documentation for independent assessment. While the objectives and performance metrics are included in the initiatives, some of the groundwork for implementing the reforms is still being laid. For example, drafting project charters, collecting information, and developing implementation plans are ongoing activities.\n\nRegarding cost savings, DOD has reported that its reform efforts have saved $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, with expected savings of $6.0 billion in fiscal year 2019 and $7.7 billion in fiscal year 2020. However, the underlying documentation to validate these savings was not provided, and GAO has previously found shortcomings in DOD's ability to demonstrate achieved savings from reform efforts. DOD is taking steps to address this challenge and establish cost baselines.\n\nWhile some initiatives have been funded through the regular budget process or with existing resources, funding needs for four initiatives have not been fully determined or met. The funding needs for the human resources service delivery initiative are expected to be met as part of the stand-up costs for the Office of Fourth Estate Management. The funding needs for the human resources regulatory reform initiative have been determined, but confirmation of funding has not been provided. The strategic sourcing of sustainment and commodity procurement initiative has yet to determine its funding needs.\n\nIn conclusion, DOD's 921 plan includes eight reform initiatives, with a schedule and cost estimate provided for most of them. The plan aims to address various issues within the department, but there are gaps in addressing previous recommendations by GAO. Furthermore, progress on the initiatives has been claimed but not sufficiently documented. DOD has reported cost savings from its reform efforts, but the underlying documentation to validate these savings has not been provided. Some initiatives have been funded, but funding needs for others have yet to be determined or met.", "The federal government uses cost-based contracts to ensure that contractors appropriately allocate costs. These contracts include both cost-type contracts and certain fixed-price contracts where the contractor's estimated or actual costs play a role in determining the payment. In fiscal year 2018, the government obligated around $172 billion on cost-type contracts alone. The need for uniform cost accounting standards arose in the late 1960s, and in 1970, Congress created the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) to establish these standards. The CASB issued 19 cost accounting standards between 1972 and 1980. GAAP, on the other hand, is a set of U.S. accounting standards focused on financial performance measurement for companies. The CASB and the GAAP are separate entities with different purposes. Over the years, there have been discussions and recommendations to revise and streamline the CASB's standards, with some concerns raised about the burden they impose on contractors. The CASB is currently working to conform the standards with GAAP, and the Board has released a staff discussion paper outlining its approach and priorities for reviewing the standards.", "Federal agencies provide billions of dollars in funding for university research in STEM fields, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) providing the most funding compared to other agencies. Sexual harassment in academia is more common in STEM fields, particularly among female students in engineering and medical majors. Several factors contribute to the prevalence of sexual harassment in STEM programs, including the tolerance for harassment, male-dominated environments, hierarchical power structures, symbolic compliance with Title IX, and uninformed leadership on campus. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that addresses sex discrimination in educational institutions. Federal agencies enforce Title IX by conducting compliance reviews and investigating written complaints of sex discrimination. The agencies administer grants through a life cycle of pre-award, award, implementation, and closeout stages, and they require grantees to submit an assurance of compliance with anti-discrimination laws during the pre-award stage. Different offices within the agencies handle grant compliance, and funding for these offices is separate from STEM research funding. The number of sexual harassment complaints received by the agencies varies, with four of the five agencies receiving three or fewer complaints from 2015 to 2019. The agencies have established sexual harassment prevention policies for grantees and have taken steps to evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. They also promote information sharing and collaboration on Title IX compliance reviews through the Title IX STEM working group, although challenges exist in obtaining and sharing information on sexual harassment cases. Efforts are being made to address the culture of sexual harassment in STEM research through interagency collaborations and joint committees. The agencies also engage in collaborative efforts with universities and other federal agencies to address the issue. The ongoing work aims to determine if additional federal actions are needed to promote effective prevention and addressing of sexual harassment in STEM research.", "The General Services Administration (GSA) has a government-wide telecommunications program called Networx. GSA awarded two sets of Networx contracts in 2007, which were set to expire in 2017 but have been extended until May 2023. The contracts provide voice and data services, wireless services, and management/application services to federal agencies. GSA also provides telecommunications services through the Washington Interagency Telecommunications System 3 and Regional Local Service Agreements programs. These contracts were set to expire in 2020 and 2023, respectively, but GSA plans to extend them until May 2023. In fiscal year 2019, federal agencies spent approximately $2.5 billion on services acquired through these contracts. GSA has developed the Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) program to replace these contracts and expects to complete the transition to EIS by May 2023. GSA has issued guidance and established milestones to ensure a smooth transition, and agencies are responsible for coordinating their own transitions. However, agencies have been slow to meet the transition milestones, and GSA has faced challenges in overseeing the process.", "The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) for the Department of Defense (DOD). The program involves the sale of defense articles and services to foreign countries or international organizations. The process begins with a request from an eligible entity, followed by the preparation of a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). Once the LOA is signed, the responsible DOD component manages the contracting and delivery of the items or services to the foreign partner.\n\nForeign partners have the option to arrange their own transportation for FMS items, but certain hazardous or sensitive items must be transported via the Defense Transportation System. The transportation fee for FMS items is calculated based on the agreed upon terms in the LOA.\n\nThe transportation fees collected from FMS purchasers are held in transportation accounts within the FMS trust fund. DFAS is responsible for collecting and paying transportation fees, while DSCA has oversight responsibility over the collections. However, DSCA does not have a standard process for reviewing DOD components' annual case reviews, which could lead to inaccurate fee collections.\n\nDSCA also does not monitor the timeliness of delivery reporting by components, which could result in untimely collection of transportation fees. DSCA relies on DFAS to provide reports on delivery reporting, but does not have a process to verify the accuracy of the reporting.\n\nFurthermore, DSCA's oversight of expenditures from the transportation accounts is insufficient. Although DSCA established internal guidance for monthly reviews of expenditures, the guidance lacks procedures and is not fully documented. DFAS also lacks consistent internal guidance for reviewing and realigning expenditures.\n\nTo address these issues, DSCA is working on initiatives to improve oversight, including the implementation of a routine analysis of annual case reviews. However, until these initiatives are fully implemented, there remains a risk of inaccurate fee collections and improper use of transportation accounts.\n\nOverall, the lack of routine oversight and monitoring of key processes within the FMS program increases the risk of financial inaccuracies and misuse of funds.", "Federal agencies, including HHS, USDA, and EPA, are involved in various activities related to animal research. These activities include funding intramural and extramural research, establishing guidelines for regulating products tested on animals, and overseeing the welfare of animals used for research. Under the Animal Welfare Act, USDA's APHIS oversees the treatment of warm-blooded animals used in research, while HHS's NIH establishes guidelines for vertebrate animal care and use programs. Both agencies require researchers to consider alternatives to animal research. Other laws, such as the NIH Revitalization Act and the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act, also promote the consideration of alternative methods to animal testing. HHS, USDA, and EPA ensure that researchers consider alternatives by requiring written descriptions of their consideration of alternatives and recommending database searches to identify alternatives. These agencies also provide training to researchers and animal care committees. In addition, individual research facilities may have their own requirements, and agencies may require additional information on animal use in grant proposals. APHIS and NIH oversee research facilities and their animal care committees to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act, respectively. Overall, these agencies take steps to ensure that researchers consider alternatives to animal research.", "The International Safety Management (ISM) Code was established to establish a global standard for the safe operation and management of ships and pollution prevention. The code includes safety management objectives and requirements for the development and implementation of a Safety Management System (SMS) by vessel operators. Vessel operators are responsible for developing and maintaining an SMS, and they obtain certification from authorized organizations called Recognized Organizations (ROs). The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for overseeing the compliance activities and audits performed by ROs, as well as conducting its own vessel inspections to verify SMS compliance. The Coast Guard also maintains a list of vessels that require additional oversight based on risk factors. The Coast Guard has taken steps to enhance its oversight of ROs, including establishing a new group to monitor their performance, developing guidance and work instructions, increasing direct observations of RO audits, and developing key performance indicators to evaluate RO performance. The Coast Guard has also implemented a mechanism called quality cases to address deficiencies identified during vessel inspections. The SMS plans reviewed vary in scope and format but generally address the identification of potential shipboard emergencies and applicable response procedures.", "The Secret Service's primary responsibility is to physically protect the President, Vice President, their families, and visiting foreign dignitaries, as well as the White House complex. They are also responsible for investigating financial crimes, identity theft, and cybercrimes. The Secret Service has implemented some of the recommendations made by the Protective Mission Panel (PMP) in 2014, but they are still working on implementing others. The Secret Service has identified protection as its priority, but training for special agents assigned to the Presidential Protective Division (PPD) and Vice Presidential Protective Division (VPD) has not increased significantly. The Secret Service plans to increase staffing levels over time, but they have not developed a plan to meet near-term training targets. The agency also lacks complete and appropriate training data for Uniformed Division officers, who protect the White House. Developing a plan for meeting training targets and implementing a policy to collect accurate training data would better prepare the Secret Service to carry out their protection responsibilities.", "Each year, the President submits a budget request for VHA health care, including funding for the upcoming fiscal year and an advance appropriation request to Congress.\n\nFunds are allocated to VISNs and medical centers based on the advance appropriation and are updated once appropriations for the fiscal year are enacted.\n\nGeneral purpose funds are allocated to VISNs through the VERA model, with adjustments made by VISNs to the funding levels determined by the MCAS model for each medical center.\n\nSpecific purpose funds are allocated to program offices that manage various health care programs and are then allocated to medical centers.\n\nRedistributions of funds can occur to address unfunded needs or surpluses.\n\nGeneral purpose funds increased by 33% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2019, while specific purpose funds increased by 24%.\n\nVA receives appropriated funds for health care through four appropriation accounts.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program, established in 2014, allowed veterans to receive care from community providers when certain criteria were not met at VA medical centers.\n\nThe Veterans Community Care Program, established in 2019, replaced the Veterans Choice Program and allows veterans to receive care from community providers when certain eligibility criteria are met.\n\nThe VERA model uses patient workload data from prior fiscal years, but not the most recently completed fiscal year, to determine funding levels.\n\nThe MCAS and community care models also use patient workload data from two years prior to the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nNot using the most up-to-date patient workload data may result in funding levels that do not reflect the actual workload of medical centers.\n\nVISNs can make adjustments to the funding allocations determined by MCAS, but these adjustments are not adequately monitored and may lead to inefficiencies.\n\nVHA does not adequately review the adjustments made by VISNs and does not require sufficient information to be provided on how the adjustments were determined.\n\nMonitoring activities, such as reviewing and documenting adjustments, can help improve the allocation process.\n\nOverall, VHA should consider incorporating the most recent patient workload data and improve the monitoring of adjustments made by VISNs to ensure the efficient allocation of funds.", "Congress allocated $12.8 billion in federal funds under Part B of IDEA for fiscal year 2019. IDEA requires states to have policies consistent with IDEA requirements, including procedural safeguards and due process procedures. Dispute resolution options available to parents include mediation, due process complaints, and state complaints. States are required to annually report data on the use of these options, including the number of mediation requests, due process complaints, and state complaints. Education monitors states' implementation of IDEA through various methods and provides technical assistance to both states and parents. Over the past decade, the total number of mediation requests has increased while the number of due process complaints has declined. However, due process complaints still make up the majority of dispute resolution options used. Mediation is viewed as less adversarial and costly than due process hearings. State complaints are the least common option used. The rate of dispute resolution activity varies widely across states and within states. Parents commonly engage in dispute resolution due to concerns about evaluations, placement, services and supports, and discipline related to their child's education. Dispute resolution activity tends to be higher in very high-income districts compared to very low-income districts. There is no consistent pattern in the results of dispute activity across districts with different income levels and racial/ethnic characteristics. Challenges faced by parents in using dispute resolution options include the cost of attorneys for due process hearings, which can be a significant barrier, especially for low-income parents. Some parents may have access to free or low-cost attorneys provided by school districts or Protection and Advocacy agencies. Overall, stakeholders agree that parents face challenges in utilizing dispute resolution options.", "The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has a High-Risk program that identifies agencies and program areas at risk of mismanagement or in need of transformation. Since 1990, a total of 62 different areas have appeared on the High-Risk List, with 26 areas being removed. To be removed from the list, agencies must meet five criteria: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress. Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) have shown some progress in meeting these criteria, but additional progress is needed. These agencies face challenges, particularly in retaining permanent leadership and a sufficient workforce. They have made efforts to address the weaknesses identified by the GAO, but more work needs to be done in order to fully address the criteria and improve management.", "State's reform efforts have faced challenges due to leadership transitions and a lack of direction and communication about changes in leadership priorities. Despite this, the bureaus and offices responsible for implementing reform projects have developed implementation plans and monitor progress through various reporting mechanisms. The projects continue to be implemented, although some have been scaled back or slowed down due to shifting priorities. The lack of dedicated teams and senior leadership involvement has also impacted the progress of some projects. Overall, effective implementation of these reforms requires strong leadership and dedicated teams.", "Data from the CDC\u2019s 2015 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) shows that a significant number of individuals in the United States have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, and stalking by an intimate partner. Approximately 43.6 million women and 37.3 million men have experienced this type of violence. The survey also found that about 21.4% of women and 14.9% of men experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner. Additionally, 30 million women and 12 million men reported some effect from the violence. Intimate partner violence can also result in death, with about 16% of homicide victims in the US being killed by an intimate partner. Certain factors increase the risk of experiencing intimate partner violence, such as younger age, less education, unemployment, pregnancy, childhood victimization, and mental illness. Exposure to intimate partner violence as a child is also associated with a greater risk of experiencing it in adulthood. Adults with disabilities are also at a higher risk of violence. However, victims of intimate partner violence may be less likely to obtain medical or other services, and brain injuries resulting from this violence can have a range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Several government agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), provide support for individuals affected by intimate partner violence. Non-federal entities also lead initiatives that focus on education, screening, and treatment for brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence. These initiatives receive federal funding from HHS or DOJ, or they are funded with state, local, or private dollars. However, data on the overall prevalence of brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence in the US are limited, and HHS agencies treat brain injuries and intimate partner violence as separate issues, limiting their ability to understand the connection between the two.", "In most cases, only lawful permanent residents (LPRs) are eligible to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, there are special provisions that allow noncitizens who have served honorably in the military to apply for naturalization. These provisions apply to both current and recently discharged service members. The Department of Defense (DOD) determines if a service member meets the requirements for naturalization by certifying their military service. In order to naturalize, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces must also meet the requirements and qualifications for citizenship, including good moral character and knowledge of the English language and U.S. government. Qualified members of the U.S. Armed Forces are exempt from certain naturalization requirements, such as application fees and continuous residence in the United States.\n\nDOD also has the authority to recruit certain nonimmigrants and other lawfully present aliens into the military. From 2008 to 2016, the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program allowed nonimmigrant visa holders, asylees, refugees, and individuals with Temporary Protected Status to enlist if they possessed skills deemed vital for military operations. However, this program has since been discontinued.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for enforcing U.S. immigration laws and removing foreign nationals who are in violation of these laws. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the agency within DHS that carries out these responsibilities. ICE has developed policies for handling cases involving potentially removable veterans, including requirements for additional assessments and documentation before initiating removal proceedings. However, our analysis found that ICE does not consistently follow these policies. ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters, which makes it difficult to determine whether all veterans have received the appropriate level of consideration prior to removal proceedings. Furthermore, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data on veterans who have been placed in removal proceedings or removed.\n\nOverall, ICE could benefit from taking action to ensure the consistent implementation of its policies for handling cases of potentially removable veterans, as well as developing a policy to identify and document all military veterans encountered. This would help ICE provide the appropriate level of review and consideration to veterans before initiating removal proceedings, and also improve the tracking of veterans within their databases.", "The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) serves two purposes: (1) to protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of commercial property/casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and (2) to allow the private markets to stabilize and build capacity to absorb future losses. TRIA only applies to certain types of insurance and requires insurers to make terrorism risk coverage available, although commercial policyholders are not required to purchase it. Insurers can charge a separate premium for terrorism risk coverage. TRIA covers insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism that are dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure, but does not cover losses from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. Cyber risk insurance is considered eligible for TRIA coverage. Under TRIA, the federal government and insurers share losses for certified acts of terrorism, with insurers responsible for 20% and the government responsible for 80% of losses above the insurer's deductible. The government recoups losses through mandatory and discretionary recoupment, imposing a premium surcharge on policies until industry payments reach a certain threshold. Insurers have implemented risk-mitigation strategies to reduce their exposure to terrorism risk. TRIA has been effective in stabilizing the terrorism risk insurance market, with insurance available at a relatively low cost and private reinsurance capacity increasing. However, there may be differences in the interpretation of how policyholder retention amounts are calculated, which could lead to disputes between insurers and the government.", "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space telescope designed for infrared observations. It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and will be used to study stars, planets, and galaxies. JWST will operate in an orbit about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth and will have a 6.5-meter diameter mirror. It will be about 100 times more sensitive than the Hubble telescope and will rely on a sunshield to protect its instruments from the sun's heat. The project is divided into three segments and is being developed by NASA, contractors, and international partners. However, the project has faced significant delays and cost increases. NASA has revised the project's cost and schedule estimates and now requires additional resources and more time to complete the project. The project has also faced technical challenges and has had to use most of its available schedule reserve. Despite these challenges, the project has achieved several milestones and has taken steps to address the technical issues. However, new issues have been identified that may further delay the project. As of October 2019, the project had used 76 percent of its total schedule reserve and is working towards a launch date in March 2021.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for overseeing and authorizing flight operations for both manned and unmanned aircraft in the national airspace system. The FAA\u2019s UAS Integration Office works to integrate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the airspace while ensuring safety. The FAA has released a roadmap for integrating UAS, allowing for increasing complexity in operations. The FAA envisions UAS operating without prior approval in the same airspace as manned aircraft. The integration of UAS has potential economic and safety benefits. Currently, certain routine UAS operations are allowed under specific conditions, while others require case-by-case authorization. Large UAS (55 pounds and over) require authorization from the FAA for each flight. The FAA established test sites to develop processes for UAS research and testing, with seven designated test sites in operation. These test sites facilitate UAS flight testing and research, providing valuable data to inform integration efforts. Working with a test site can provide quicker access to testing and expertise in obtaining authorizations or waivers. The test sites have supported over 440 public and private users in conducting research and development for a variety of UAS activities. Test site users have reported benefits from working with test sites, including opportunities to improve UAS technologies and learn about UAS use in the airspace. Future UAS activities are expected to occur routinely, pending legal restrictions and technological advancements. Some users have conducted extensive hazard and risk mitigation testing to gain approval for complex UAS operations. The test sites have also been involved in federal UAS research efforts, such as the UAS Integration Pilot Program, aimed at evaluating different concepts for UAS operations.", "The U.S. government provides democracy assistance through various agencies, including the State Department (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). State and USAID categorize their democracy assistance activities into six program areas: rule of law, good governance, political competition and consensus building, civil society, independent media and free flow of information, and human rights. State's democracy assistance is provided by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and other State bureaus and offices. DRL focuses on promoting human rights and democracy globally, while INL supports programs to combat crime and narcotics trafficking. USAID considers democracy, human rights, and governance to be central to its core mission and plays a primary role in providing democracy assistance. State and USAID allocated over $8.8 billion for democracy assistance between fiscal years 2015 and 2018, with State allocating 33% of the funds and USAID allocating 67%. Both DRL and USAID provided democracy assistance to many of the same countries, but focused on different program areas. DRL directed a greater percentage of its funding to less democratic countries, while USAID focused on promoting good governance. Overall, the funding allocations for democracy assistance in the selected countries generally aligned with the defined roles and strategies of DRL, INL, and USAID. However, embassy officials in the selected countries reported having incomplete information about DRL's projects, highlighting a need for improved coordination between the agencies and embassies.", "The Defense Working Capital Fund (DWWCF) receives its initial working capital through an appropriation or a transfer of funds from existing appropriations. Ongoing operations are funded through reimbursements from customer payments. The primary consumers of goods and services provided by the DWWCF are the military departments. In fiscal year 2018, the military departments ordered approximately $36.3 billion worth of goods and services from DFAS, DISA, and DLA. Most of these purchases were for supply chain management and energy management. The DWWCF agencies set rates each year to recover the costs of goods and services. However, setting accurate rates can be challenging and may result in losses or excessive gains for the DWWCF. Steps have been taken to establish an equitable pricing methodology, but customers from the military departments lack transparency into the factors that determine their costs and how rates are set.", "Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria or slow their growth, but some bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics, allowing them to survive and multiply. This resistance can be passed on to future generations of bacteria and spread through various sources, such as contact with infected individuals or contaminated environments. The spread of antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health, as it limits the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections and can reverse medical advancements. The CDC has identified 17 bacterial pathogens as urgent threats due to their resistance to antibiotics, with gram-negative bacteria being a particular concern. One specific threat is Candida auris, a highly resistant fungus that is difficult to address due to limitations in diagnostic tests and the lack of available antifungal drugs. The inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as unnecessary prescriptions and incorrect selections, is a significant issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Vaccines can play a role in preventing antibiotic resistance by reducing the need for antibiotics through the prevention of infections. The National Action Plan, initiated by an executive order, sets goals and milestones for combating antibiotic resistance, including slowing the emergence of resistant bacteria, improving surveillance efforts, developing diagnostic tests and new treatments, and improving international collaboration. The CDC has made progress in expanding surveillance for antibiotic resistance, but challenges remain in tracking resistance across all healthcare settings, reporting complete and timely information, and assessing the global threat. The CDC has taken actions to address these challenges, such as establishing the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network and expanding efforts in its Emerging Infections Program.", "Federal law and regulations require that contractors receiving contracts above a certain threshold must provide opportunities for small businesses to receive subcontracting work. Contractors typically use one of three types of subcontracting plans: individual, commercial, or comprehensive. These plans outline subcontracting goals and achievements and must be submitted to the government. Contractors must also submit periodic subcontracting reports to track progress towards meeting these goals. Contracting officers are responsible for reviewing and approving subcontracting plans and monitoring compliance. Small Business Administration (SBA) staff also play a role in reviewing and advising on subcontracting plans. SBA negotiates goals with agencies and assists small businesses in meeting subcontracting requirements. The SBA and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) may conduct joint compliance reviews for certain contracts. Agencies aim to promote the use of small businesses through their subcontracting plans. However, in our review of four agencies, we found that some did not follow procedures related to subcontracting plans and PCR reviews for all contracts.", "VA, through VHA, operates the nation\u2019s largest integrated healthcare system with 172 VA medical centers organized into 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. VA's intramural research program aims to improve veterans' health by funding research, developing effective treatments, and recruiting VA researchers. VA's medical and prosthetic research appropriation funds the intramural research program, while other appropriation accounts support associated costs. VA researchers focus on a variety of areas such as spinal cord injury, mental health care, and rehabilitation research. The research findings are used to inform clinical practice and policy within VA. ORD leadership sets VA's national research priorities based on input from internal and external stakeholders. Researchers can submit proposals in response to specific or general requests for applications. ORD also funds research centers and entities that focus on specific areas. VA research findings can be translated into clinical practice by implementing new tools, changing treatment protocols, or developing clinical guidelines. ORD officials determine national research priorities through input from internal stakeholders, external stakeholders, and other factors. Strategic priorities focus on research capabilities and resources, while cross-cutting clinical priorities focus on specific clinical conditions. Other priorities are based on input from Congress, veterans service organizations, and non-ORD stakeholders. ORD's four research services have autonomy in setting their own research priorities, based on national priorities and other factors such as VA data on veterans' health conditions and input from stakeholders. These service-level research priorities cover a wide range of areas, including service-connected conditions and conditions that veterans may experience as they age.", "States have three options when designing their CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) programs: Medicaid expansion CHIP, separate CHIP, and combination CHIP. Medicaid expansion CHIP allows states to expand income eligibility levels for children beyond those of the state's Medicaid program. Separate CHIP programs are not required to follow the same rules as Medicaid, giving states more flexibility in designing their programs. Combination CHIP programs involve both a separate CHIP program and a Medicaid expansion CHIP program for different populations of children.\n\nThe type of CHIP program a state chooses affects the amount of federal funding available to the state. If a state with a Medicaid expansion CHIP program exhausts available CHIP funding, they may apply Medicaid funds at the Medicaid matching rate to remaining expenses. However, a state with a separate CHIP program that exhausts funding does not have access to such funding.\n\nStates have flexibility in how they design their CHIP programs, including the services they cover, income eligibility limits, and fees they charge. As of January 2019, 19 states had CHIP upper income eligibility limits of 300 percent of the FPL or higher.\n\nCHIP crowd-out may occur when employers modify or decide not to offer health insurance to their employees or dependents due to CHIP availability. It may also occur when employees drop or decide not to enroll in employer-offered insurance and enroll their children in CHIP instead.\n\nStates with separate CHIP programs are required to submit CHIP plans that describe procedures to prevent crowd-out and report annually to CMS on crowd-out related indicators. Medicaid expansion CHIP programs are not required to take steps to prevent crowd-out unless consistent with the Medicaid statute or under an approved section 1115 demonstration. CMS provides general guidance for minimizing crowd-out for states with separate and combination CHIP programs.\n\nStates vary in their estimates and tracking of crowd-out. Some states directly measure crowd-out, while others do not view it as a prevalent issue. Research studies on crowd-out have produced varied estimates, and more research is needed on the topic.\n\nOverall, states have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs and addressing potential crowd-out, but the extent of crowd-out and its impact on the program varies.", "Explosives are categorized into three types: high explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics. High explosives are the most commonly used in nuclear weapons, and there are two classes: insensitive high explosives (IHE) and conventional high explosives (CHE). IHEs are safer to handle due to their reduced susceptibility to accidental detonation. The process of producing high explosives involves four steps: synthesis, formulation, pressing, and machining, with testing occurring after each step. Various tests, such as safety and performance testing, are conducted to ensure that the explosives meet safety and quality requirements. The main charge of U.S. nuclear weapons is made of high explosives, such as HMX (high melting explosive) and TATB (triaminotrinitrobenzene). The production of explosive components involves collaboration between different sites and suppliers. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has implemented an enterprise-wide approach to improve the management and coordination of explosives activities across its sites.", "A recent report discusses the progress made in addressing high-risk areas in government agencies. The report outlines the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, which are leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress. The report states that two areas, DOD Supply Chain Management and Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data, have been removed from the High-Risk List due to progress made in addressing the issues. However, two new areas, Government-Wide Personnel Security Clearance Process and VA Acquisition Management, have been added to the High-Risk List. The report highlights the challenges and recommendations for each area. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of sustained leadership commitment and action to address high-risk areas in government agencies.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) uses military commissions as a form of military tribunal to try individuals for unlawful conduct associated with war. The use of military commissions began in the 19th century and was preceded by military tribunals in previous conflicts. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the President issued an order to establish military commissions to try certain individuals for violations of the laws of war. However, the Supreme Court invalidated these commissions in 2006. In response, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. In 2009, the President ordered a review of military commissions which led to a halt in proceedings. Congress then passed the Military Commissions Act of 2009, which replaced the previous Act, and criminal proceedings were reinstated. The current commissions' proceedings include alleged terrorists accused of attacking the United States, such as the USS Cole attack and the 9/11 attack. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 establishes procedures for trying alien unprivileged enemy belligerents engaged in hostilities against the United States. These procedures are based on military court-martial practice. The commissions' proceedings are conducted at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay (NSGB) in Cuba and are overseen by several DOD organizations. The Convening Authority is responsible for managing the overall process, including convening the commissions and reviewing records of trial. The Office of the Chief Prosecutor coordinates investigative efforts, prepares charges, and represents the government in the proceedings. The Military Commissions Defense Organization provides defense attorneys for the accused, who can be military or civilian. The Military Commissions' Trial Judiciary consists of military judges who preside over the trials. NSGB has an Expeditionary Legal Complex that includes a multi-defendant courtroom, a viewing gallery, and a media operations center. DOD has taken steps to facilitate public access to the proceedings, including communicating with victims and family members, allowing selected members of the public to view proceedings in-person, providing CCTV sites for remote viewing, and making court documents available on the commissions' website. However, there are challenges to public access, including the location of the proceedings, the presence of classified information, and the length of time awaiting trial. DOD has limited ability to address these challenges.", "A review of SBIR and STTR awards from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 found that component agencies were able to notify awardees within the required time for 84% of the awards. However, 16% of the awards were notified after the required time period. Three agencies met the notification requirement for every award, while nine agencies did so for at least 90% of their awards. The remaining 16 agencies did not meet the requirement for the majority of their awards. Factors that affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees included the availability of reviewers, the number of proposals received, and agency-specific factors. Some agencies reported delays due to the need to recruit external reviewers or conflicts with regular duties of reviewers. The number of proposals received also affected the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors included participating in longer review processes led by other agencies and delays due to continuing resolutions or government shutdowns. In terms of issuing awards, 76% of the awards were issued within the recommended time period, while 24% were issued after the recommended time. Some agencies consistently issued awards within the recommended time period, while others had substantial changes from year to year. Factors that increased the time spent issuing awards included the type of contract, availability of grants or contracting officers, coordination among agency officials, responsiveness of awardees, and availability of funding. Cost reimbursement contracts took significantly longer to issue than fixed-price contracts. Limited availability or experience of agency staff, coordination delays, small business responsiveness, and funding availability also contributed to delays in award issuance.", "States have the flexibility to design and implement their Medicaid programs within federal requirements. They are responsible for assessing and verifying individuals' eligibility for Medicaid, including assessing financial and nonfinancial information. States must use a uniform method to calculate income for most applicants, but have more flexibility for individuals based on age or disability. States also have flexibility in verifying applicants' financial eligibility and citizenship or immigration status. Once individuals are determined to be eligible, they are enrolled in Medicaid under a specific basis of eligibility, such as children, pregnant women, or low-income adults. CMS provides oversight of Medicaid eligibility by conducting reviews and audits of states' eligibility determinations. These audits have identified several accuracy issues, such as incorrect income or asset information and unresolved discrepancies. These issues can lead to errors in eligibility determinations. Overall, states have some flexibility in how they implement Medicaid eligibility, but there are ongoing challenges in ensuring accuracy and compliance.", "The MIECHV program provides voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services for at-risk eligible families with children up to kindergarten entry. States receive grant funds based on the proportion of children living in poverty. States target resources to at-risk communities and must provide home visiting services using an evidence-based program model. The program aims to improve the lives of children and families by providing services tailored to their specific needs. States may also have other home visiting programs that differ from the MIECHV program. States are required to report their spending on home visiting programs to demonstrate compliance with the MOE requirement. HRSA monitors the program through grant application reviews, site visits, and financial assessments. There have been instances of inaccurate state-reported MOE spending, and HRSA is taking steps to improve monitoring of the requirement.", "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for managing national nuclear security missions, including maintaining a safe nuclear deterrent, supplying nuclear fuel to the Navy, and supporting nonproliferation efforts. NNSA relies on contractors to carry out these missions at eight sites, with the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee being the primary site for enriched uranium capabilities. However, NNSA has identified shortcomings in Y-12's operations, including an inefficient workflow, rising costs, and hazardous processes. To address these issues, NNSA has developed plans to replace aging infrastructure and relocate processing equipment. The initial plan was to construct a consolidated facility called the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at an estimated cost of $1.4-3.5 billion. However, by 2012, it was clear that the UPF as designed would not provide enough space, and in 2014, NNSA established its uranium program within its Office of Defense Programs and revised its approach. The new plan involves phasing out mission dependency on certain buildings, including Building 9212, and upgrading existing buildings at Y-12. The UPF will be re-scoped to be smaller and cost no more than $6.5 billion. NNSA is required to follow DOE Order 413.3B for managing the project, including five critical decisions, independent cost estimates, and external independent reviews. The UPF project also relies on cutting-edge technologies and technology readiness levels. Effective program management is important, and NNSA should follow best practices for cost estimating and scheduling.", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has two review processes for evaluating new drugs: priority review and standard review. Priority review is given to drugs that prevent, diagnose, or treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in safety or effectiveness compared to available drugs. The goal for completing a priority review is 6 months. Standard review is given to drugs that do not meet the criteria for priority review, and the goal for completing a standard review is 10 months. The FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety and efficacy of drugs and biological products in the United States. A drug sponsor must submit evidence of a drug's safety and effectiveness before it can be marketed. The FDA also administers three programs to encourage drug development for tropical diseases, rare pediatric diseases, and medical countermeasures. To be awarded a priority review voucher (PRV), a drug application must meet specific criteria and the drug sponsor must submit a request in their application. Once a PRV is awarded, it can be redeemed by the drug sponsor to shorten the review time for a future drug application. The drug sponsor can also sell or transfer the PRV. As of September 30, 2019, the FDA has awarded 31 PRVs, with the majority being awarded through the rare pediatric disease PRV program. Drug sponsors have redeemed 16 of the PRVs to obtain priority review for their drug applications. The decision to keep, sell, or redeem a PRV is influenced by factors such as the drug development pipeline, market competition, and the likelihood of FDA approval. The FDA collects PRV user fees to cover the additional costs associated with reviewing drug applications with a PRV. However, the agency does not track the specific resources used for the PRV programs. Studies have found mixed evidence on the impact of PRV programs on drug development.", "The federal government and states are jointly responsible for funding and administering the Medicaid program. Medicaid is financed through a combination of federal and state funding, with different matching rates depending on the state. States have administrative responsibilities such as determining eligibility and enrolling beneficiaries, while the federal government oversees the program and ensures funds are used appropriately. Inaccurate eligibility determinations can have significant implications, especially with the expansion of Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) to improve data collection and oversight. While progress has been made, there are still recommendations that have not been fully implemented, such as targeting high-risk areas for review and using T-MSIS data for oversight. State auditors play a crucial role in Medicaid program oversight and recent changes to the Compliance Supplement will allow them to audit eligibility determinations. It is recommended that CMS engage state auditors further to improve program integrity.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides long-term care services to over 500,000 veterans through institutional and noninstitutional programs. These programs offer a range of services, including assistance with daily activities and clinical care for various conditions. Eligibility for these services is determined by a veteran's disability status and priority for care. Utilization and spending for VA's long-term care programs have increased in recent years, and projections indicate that they will continue to grow in the future. VA plans to expand the availability of noninstitutional care and provide care to more aging veterans and those with high service-connected disability ratings. However, the VA faces challenges in meeting the growing demand for long-term care, including workforce shortages, geographic alignment of care, and difficulty meeting veterans' specialty care needs. To address these challenges, the VA needs to establish measurable goals and improve consistency at the VAMC level. The VA has concurred with these recommendations and is working towards addressing these issues.", "IHS (Indian Health Service) was established to provide health services to federally recognized AI/AN tribes primarily in rural areas. The organization oversees the provision of healthcare services through a decentralized system of area offices. These offices monitor the operations and finances of IHS facilities and provide guidance and assistance. The facilities provide various services, including primary and emergency care. If they are unable to provide the necessary care, they may contract with private providers through the PRC program. The PRC program is funded through annual appropriations and administered locally. The program has five medical priority levels that determine the allocation of funds. PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility, which resulted in increased health insurance coverage for patients at IHS facilities. Overall, the percentage of patients with health insurance coverage increased from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2018, with the largest increase seen in Medicaid coverage. Third-party collections at IHS facilities also increased during this period, with Medicaid collections accounting for the majority of the increase. The increases in coverage and collections have helped IHS facilities to continue their operations, expand services, and meet required standards.", "In 2015, President signed Executive Order 13693, which called for federal agencies to advance waste and pollution prevention by diverting at least 50% of nonhazardous solid waste in federal facilities. In 2018, this order was replaced by Executive Order 13834, which no longer included specific diversion goals. The EPA oversees municipal solid-waste management and has established guidelines for recycling and waste reduction. The USDA has developed programs and policies to reduce food loss and waste, and the 2018 Farm Bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to take actions to address food loss and waste. The FDA has limited involvement in food loss and waste reduction. There are different definitions and methodologies for measuring and reporting food loss and waste, leading to challenges in data collection. Nonfederal stakeholders identified three key challenges to reducing food loss and waste: limited data and information, lack of awareness and education, and limited infrastructure and capacity. Stakeholders suggested that federal agencies could address these challenges by improving data collection, raising awareness, and providing resources.", "The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the largest educational program offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that provides benefits to veterans who served on active duty for at least 90 days beginning on or after September 11, 2001. The program offers full benefits to veterans who served on active duty for 36 months, paying for in-state tuition and fees at public schools and offering a maximum annual amount at nonprofit and for-profit schools. VA pays schools directly for tuition and fees and provides additional payments for housing and books to eligible veterans. Student veterans may also be eligible for grants and loans from federal student aid programs administered by Education. Nearly 700,000 student veterans received Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in fiscal year 2017 to attend almost 6,000 schools. A relatively small number of schools received the highest amounts of Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments, accounting for over 30 percent of all benefits. Student outcomes at these schools were generally comparable to the national average, but varied more widely across sectors. School closures pose challenges for student veterans, as abrupt closures can disrupt their education and transferring credits to a new school may result in credit loss and delays in graduation. School closures can also lead to financial losses for the government and taxpayers. The risks and challenges associated with school closures are particularly relevant for student veterans as the number of closures has increased in recent years.", "The Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program, managed by the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Veterans Administration (VA), provides federal agencies with an easy way to purchase commercial supplies and services at volume prices. The program consists of catalogs of pre-approved vendors that offer a range of goods and services, including medical equipment and supplies. The VA manages nine schedules within the FSS program, which are used to streamline the purchasing process for medical centers and other agencies. However, the VA's FSS program has seen flat sales on non-pharmaceutical schedules, despite an increase in overall health care spending by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VA lacks controls to ensure that vendors are providing complete sales data, and there is limited visibility into the user experience of the FSS program. Additionally, the VA does not analyze data on the participation of veteran-owned small businesses in the FSS program, which impacts the ability of contracting officers to use the program. To improve the effectiveness of the FSS program, the VA needs to implement controls for data completeness, analyze veteran-owned business participation, and gather feedback from users.", "The number of pedestrian fatalities and the percentage of pedestrian fatalities in overall highway fatalities have increased since 2008. Additionally, the number of pedestrians injured in crashes has also increased. Factors that can influence pedestrian fatalities include pedestrian exposure to crashes, roadway characteristics, and driver and pedestrian behavior. Data suggests that there has been a change in the number of people walking. Most pedestrian fatalities occur in urban areas on high-traffic roads, and distracted driving and walking can contribute to these fatalities. Most pedestrian fatalities occur after dark and at non-intersection locations. Automakers have developed crash avoidance and mitigation features to improve pedestrian safety. The United States is involved in international efforts to establish global technical regulations for vehicle safety. Pedestrian safety tests are conducted in other countries but are not currently part of the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). The age, body type, and speed of vehicles are associated with the increase in pedestrian fatalities. Older vehicles, SUVs, and vehicles traveling at higher speeds are involved in more pedestrian fatalities. The rise in pedestrian fatalities involving older vehicles may be due to the average age of vehicles in operation increasing. SUVs represent a growing share of the vehicle fleet, and the size and weight of vehicles can increase the risk of injury for pedestrians. Higher vehicle speeds are also associated with more severe injuries to pedestrians. However, speed data is often not reported for pedestrian fatalities.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made updates to its High-Risk List, which identifies areas of government operations that are at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement. Two areas, DOD Supply Chain Management and Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data, have been removed from the list due to progress made in addressing the high-risk issues. Two new areas, Government-Wide Personnel Security Clearance Process and VA Acquisition Management, have been added to the list. The GAO has outlined the criteria for removal from the list, including leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress. The GAO will continue to monitor the areas that have been removed to ensure sustained improvements, and if significant problems arise again, they may be readded to the list.", "In 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security directed the TSA to address allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers. The TSA has taken several actions in response to these directives, including revising training materials and procedures to prevent profiling, collecting data on passenger referrals for behavior detection screening to identify any disparities, and establishing a policy for handling passenger complaints. Since 2017, the TSA has eliminated the stand-alone behavior detection officer position and transferred those officers to the screener workforce. Screeners trained in behavior detection continue to use these techniques in certain situations, such as with passenger screening canine teams. The TSA provides training on behavior detection and prohibits screeners from selecting passengers for additional screening based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors. The Multicultural Branch of the TSA is responsible for handling passenger complaints regarding civil rights violations, including profiling and discrimination. Complaints are reviewed, investigated, and appropriate actions, such as corrective training or termination, are taken. The TSA conducts evaluations and training on behavior detection to ensure compliance and effectiveness. Supervisors are required to conduct routine checks on behavior detection operations, but these checks do not specifically include monitoring for compliance with anti-profiling procedures.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) reported an estimated environmental liability of $494 billion in its fiscal year 2018 financial statement, with the majority of the liability attributed to cleanup work overseen by the Office of Environmental Management (EM). EM accounted for over 75 percent of DOE's total liability, primarily due to the costs of storing and treating radioactive tank waste. The Hanford and Savannah River sites accounted for more than 70 percent of EM's environmental liability in fiscal year 2017. EM's environmental liability has grown annually at a faster rate than the department's spending on cleanup activities, and the liability may continue to increase. The current estimate of EM's environmental liability does not include the costs of all future cleanup activities, and the cost of some of EM's largest projects is underestimated. EM has not conducted a formal root cause analysis to determine the reasons for the growth in its environmental liabilities and has not resolved long-standing management challenges. EM does not have a program-wide cleanup strategy and relies on individual sites to negotiate cleanup activities and establish priorities, resulting in inconsistent decision-making. EM manages most of its cleanup work as operations activities, which have less stringent requirements than capital asset projects. EM's cleanup policy does not follow program and project management leading practices, and its performance measures for operations activities do not provide a clear picture of overall performance. The DOE's contract management has also been identified as posing a high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Overall, the DOE and EM need to address these management challenges in order to effectively manage the cleanup program and reduce environmental liabilities.", "The U.S. Census Bureau is responsible for counting every person in the decennial census. The Bureau uses the concept of \"usual residence\" to determine where people should be counted. This means that people are counted at the place where they live and sleep most of the time. The Bureau also has specific criteria for counting people in certain complex living situations, such as military personnel, college students, and people living in group quarters. The Bureau has issued updated guidance for the 2020 Census, taking into account feedback from stakeholders. The Bureau must meet several deadlines for counting and tabulating the population, and it carries out numerous activities before, during, and after data collection to ensure an accurate count. The Bureau has made some changes to how it counts certain populations, such as military and civilian employees stationed overseas, crewmembers of maritime and merchant vessels, and juveniles in non-correctional residential treatment centers. The Bureau also plans to continue counting prisoners at their correctional facilities, but will provide states with tools to \"move\" the prisoner population to their pre-incarceration addresses for redistricting purposes. The Bureau has plans to resolve data quality issues, such as multiple responses from a household, missing responses, or incomplete/conflicting answers. The Bureau will use an algorithm to determine whom to count at addresses with multiple responses and will use count imputation to fill in missing data about the existence and number of people living at certain addresses. The Bureau plans to use administrative records in conjunction with door-to-door follow-up efforts to reduce the need for count imputation.", "The military justice system is designed to maintain discipline and order in the armed forces. It applies to all active-duty servicemembers, as well as other individuals associated with the military. The system includes three types of military courts called courts-martial, which handle different levels of offenses. Nonjudicial punishment is also an option for disciplinary actions. The Military Justice Act of 2016 brought reforms to the UCMJ, including changes to punishment limitations and data collection. Data shows that from 2013 to 2017, over 258,000 active-duty servicemembers were disciplined. The process of disciplining a servicemember involves an initial report, investigation, and court-martial if charges are preferred. Post-trial processes and appeals are available. Racial and gender disparities exist in the civilian criminal justice system, but it is unclear if they are present in the military justice system.", "The text discusses five key challenges related to the nation's ability to detect and respond to biological events: enterprise-wide threat determination, situational awareness and data integration, biodetection technologies, biological laboratory safety and security, and emerging infectious disease surveillance. The text also mentions the National Biodefense Strategy and the governance structure established to guide its implementation. It acknowledges the ongoing work in assessing the strategy and early efforts to implement it, as well as the need for a more systematic approach and cross-government examination of existing programs. Additionally, the text addresses issues with the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), the BioWatch program, multiplex point-of-care technologies, and the safety and security of high-containment laboratories. Recommendations are made throughout the text to improve various aspects of biodefense.", "The Navy plans to continue developing critical technologies for the Columbia class submarine over the next 10 years. The schedule for delivering the lead submarine was found to be aggressive, with extensive overlap between development, design, and construction. Shipbuilding programs with high overlap often experience cost and schedule growth, as well as quality and performance issues. The Navy must submit matrices to Congress that identify key milestones, events, performance goals, and costs associated with the design and construction of the Columbia class program. Several critical technologies for the submarine were not identified by the Navy, and some of the identified technologies were immature. General Dynamics Electric Boat is the prime contractor for design and construction, while Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News serves as a subcontractor. The design process includes three activities: arrangements, disclosures, and work instructions. The submarine will be constructed in six large hull segments known as super modules. The Navy's cost estimating process involves multiple entities. The shipbuilder's progress in completing design arrangements and disclosures has fallen short due to challenges with a new design software tool. The shipbuilder's cost performance has also fallen below expectations. The Navy plans to mitigate risks associated with the construction schedule by accelerating the building of certain components and beginning advance construction. However, this advance construction is starting with less than 40% of the total design disclosures completed. The Navy continues to develop critical technologies for the Columbia class program, but recent challenges have eroded available schedule margin.", "Federal land management agencies employ law enforcement officers to protect their employees and secure their facilities across nearly 700 million acres of federal lands. These officers patrol the lands, respond to illegal activities, and conduct investigations. Each agency maintains a law enforcement data system to record and track incidents of illegal activity. The agencies covered in the text are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Forest Service, and the Park Service. The ISC Standard requires agencies to assess the risks faced by each facility and implement appropriate countermeasures. The text also provides data on threats and assaults against agency employees and investigations into potential threats by the FBI. Some incidents are not reported or recorded in the agencies' data systems, and some are investigated by state or local law enforcement instead.", "The 340B Program provides discounts on covered outpatient drugs to certain eligible hospitals, clinics, and other entities. The program allows participants to stretch federal resources to reach more eligible patients and generate revenue through drug purchases and insurance reimbursements. Participation in the program has increased over the years, and hospitals must meet certain eligibility criteria and undergo regular verification and audits by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Nongovernmental hospitals must have contracts with state or local governments to provide healthcare services to low-income populations, but the contracts have few details about the obligations. HRSA relies on self-reported data from hospitals to determine nonprofit status and does not independently evaluate the reliability of the data. The agency has proposed requiring hospitals to submit documentation of their nonprofit status during registration.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published a reform plan in June 2018, and has provided updates on the proposals in the plan. The reform plan was based on executive orders and guidance from OMB to federal agencies. Progress of the reforms is being tracked through the use of cross-agency goals, agency goals, and Performance.gov. In July 2019, the administration reported on the first year of progress toward the reform proposals, including moving personnel security clearance background investigations from OPM to DOD, solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage, establishing the GEAR Center, and reorganizing OPM. However, the customer experience improvement capability reform is not being pursued in fiscal year 2020. The transfer of background investigation functions from OPM to DOD was completed by September 30, 2019, and OMB, OPM, and DOD have generally addressed most key reform practices in implementing the transfer. Communication with affected employees and key stakeholders has been ongoing, and the transfer plan included strategic communication activities. However, the reform proposals do not address the challenges in the personnel security clearance process, which remains on the High-Risk List. The OPM Inspector General has identified the background investigation legacy information systems as an ongoing top management challenge. The transfer of functions from OPM to DOD was achieved according to the goals and requirements outlined in the NDAA and executive order. DOD established a working capital fund for funding background investigations and is now the primary provider of national security background investigations. Leadership focus and attention has been demonstrated through the roles and responsibilities outlined in the executive order, and a dedicated implementation team at DOD. Monitoring and management of the transfer has been conducted through the use of a joint transfer plan, implementation plans, and a dashboard to track progress. Overall, OMB, OPM, and DOD have addressed most key practices in implementing the transfer of background investigation functions, but challenges in the personnel security clearance process and the background investigation legacy information systems remain.", "Water flows from higher elevations in Mexico into the United States in the Santa Cruz River Basin and Tijuana River Valley watersheds along the U.S.-Mexico border. Both countries have infrastructure, including sewers, pipelines, and treatment plants, to manage and treat wastewater. The U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) operates two international wastewater treatment plants in the Nogales and South Bay areas. In 2018, the USIBWC treated a total of 14 billion gallons of sewage at these plants. The Nogales plant treats sewage from the city of Nogales in Sonora, Mexico, as well as from the Arizona cities of Nogales and Rio Rico. The treated wastewater is discharged into the Santa Cruz River. The South Bay plant treats sewage from the City of Tijuana in Baja California, Mexico, and discharges the treated wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. Both watersheds are located in arid regions with infrequent but intense precipitation that leads to high levels of stormwater runoff. Urban stormwater is a significant contributor to pollution in rivers and oceans and can cause disease outbreaks, beach closings, and flooding. USIBWC's mission is to provide binational solutions to water quality and flood control issues in the border region. The agency manages and maintains infrastructure, including wastewater treatment plants, levees, dams, and hydroelectric plants. It is funded through the Department of State's budget process and has seen a decline in funding over time. Other federal agencies involved in water infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the North American Development Bank. EPA is responsible for implementing the Clean Water Act, which includes regulating discharges of pollutants into water bodies and issuing permits for wastewater treatment plants. Stormwater runoff and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are also regulated under the Clean Water Act. Wastewater and stormwater utilities in the United States and Mexico are mostly managed by local municipal governments.", "A reverse mortgage is a type of home equity loan that doesn't require monthly mortgage payments as long as certain conditions are met. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgages have no fixed term and are \"rising debt, falling equity\" loans. The amount of money a borrower can receive depends on factors such as the borrower's age, appraised value of the home, and expected interest rate. Borrowers can receive funds in various ways, with most opting for a line of credit. If the borrower fails to meet certain conditions, the loan can become due and payable, and the borrower has options such as paying the loan balance, selling the home, or providing a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. FHA insures reverse mortgages and has made several policy changes in recent years to strengthen the program's financial performance. The reverse mortgage market includes lenders, investors, and servicers, with most HECMs being originated, owned, and serviced by nonbank entities. Various federal agencies have oversight roles in the reverse mortgage market, including FHA, CFPB, and federal depository institution regulators. The HECM program includes consumer protections, such as preloan counseling and limits on costs and fees. FHA has made changes to the program to help borrowers who have defaulted on property charges, and has implemented measures to track borrower defaults and servicer advances.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) implemented the Secure Flight program in 2009 to identify potential security risks among passengers before boarding an aircraft. The program requires airlines to collect and transmit passenger information, including personally identifiable information, to TSA. Through the Secure Flight program, passenger information is matched against federal government watchlists to determine if any passengers may pose a security risk. The program assigns passengers a risk category, but this information is not communicated to the airlines. Passengers may receive expedited screening, standard screening, enhanced screening, or be denied boarding based on their risk category. In addition to matching against watchlists, the Secure Flight program also screens passengers against lists such as the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists. These lists are created using information from the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and by reviewing intelligence to identify elevated passenger risk. The program also randomly selects passengers for enhanced screening. The TSA is required to review and identify its screening rules every 120 days and provide notification to stakeholders within two days of making a rule change. Quarterly review meetings are held with DHS and TSA stakeholders to discuss rule changes and ensure they are based on current intelligence and specific threats. TSA I&A has implemented the two-day notification requirement, but their standard operating procedures have not been updated to reflect these changes. TSA I&A conducts vetting processes for rule changes, but their SOPs are unclear about when the exigent review process should be used and who should make that decision. Clarifying the review procedures in the SOPs would provide greater assurance that screening rule changes are reviewed as intended. TSA I&A tracks operational data on passenger screening rules, such as the number of individuals on the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists and the number of rules triggered by passenger travel. However, they have not identified a means to measure the effectiveness of these rules.", "The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 to provide additional funds for the FDA to support the review process of new drug applications (NDAs). PDUFA authorized the FDA to collect user fees from drug sponsors to supplement its annual budget. PDUFA has been reauthorized every five years since 1992, with the most recent reauthorization being PDUFA VI, which covers the years 2018 to 2022. As part of each reauthorization, the FDA sets goals for the timely review of NDAs, including commitments to review a certain percentage of applications within specified time frames. These goals are linked to key features of the NDAs, such as priority designation, expedited programs, and major amendments. The FDA also uses real-world evidence, obtained from sources other than traditional clinical trials, to support the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. The FDA has implemented initiatives to evaluate and facilitate the use of this evidence in regulatory decision-making. There are variations between FDA divisions in terms of the proportion of NDAs they review with key features linked to review time goals and expedited programs. These variations are due to the different products regulated by each division. There are also differences in the time taken by FDA divisions to complete initial reviews, with some divisions being slightly faster than others. These differences are influenced by the key features of the NDAs, especially the target time frame for review and the number of expedited programs. The FDA has implemented initiatives to promote the use of real-world evidence and other nontraditional sources of evidence in NDAs. These initiatives include public workshops, guidance for industry and FDA staff, pilot programs, and staff training. Although implementation is still in progress, the FDA has seen some positive outcomes, such as an increase in the use of model-informed drug development and complex innovative trial designs. The FDA expects that fully implementing these initiatives will further increase the use of nontraditional evidence sources in NDAs.", "Federal agencies and the nation's critical infrastructure are at risk from cyber threats that can have serious impacts on operations, assets, individuals, and national security. Cybersecurity incidents continue to occur, with federal agencies reporting thousands of incidents each year, including hacking, phishing, and data breaches. These incidents pose challenges to economic and national security and personal privacy. The Department of Justice, for example, recently indicted two individuals for hacking into the Securities and Exchange Commission's computer systems to profit from stolen information. The risks to IT systems are increasing as threats become more sophisticated, making it crucial for agency leaders to effectively manage cybersecurity risks. Risk management involves activities such as protecting IT and data, maintaining awareness of threats, detecting and responding to incidents, and recovering from them. Several federal laws and policies establish requirements for protecting federal systems and managing cybersecurity risks. The role of key agencies, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is to develop and oversee implementation of policies, standards, and guidelines for information security. To assist federal agencies in protecting their computer networks, DHS is spearheading initiatives such as providing technical assistance, issuing alerts, and conducting vulnerability assessments. NIST has developed a framework for managing risk to federal information and assets, which involves activities at the organizational, mission/business process, and system levels. The framework is supported by a suite of NIST special publications that provide guidance for federal agencies' cybersecurity risk management programs. These programs should include elements such as establishing a cybersecurity risk executive, developing a risk management strategy, documenting risk-based policies, conducting agency-wide risk assessments, and establishing coordination with enterprise risk management. However, not all agencies have fully established these elements in their cybersecurity risk management programs. It is important for agencies to effectively manage cybersecurity risks and share risk information with stakeholders in order to protect their operations, assets, and individuals.", "Patients seeking access to investigational drugs have multiple pathways to consider. The first option is to participate in a clinical trial, which is a step in the drug development process where the safety and effectiveness of the drug are assessed through human testing. Clinical trials have eligibility criteria that define the patient population to be studied, and both inclusion and exclusion criteria are used. Inclusion criteria specify the characteristics required for participation, while exclusion criteria disqualify patients from participating. Certain patient populations, such as children and pregnant women, may be excluded for ethical reasons.\n\nThe drug manufacturer, FDA, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) all have responsibilities in the clinical trial process. The manufacturer must submit an application to FDA to test an investigational drug on human volunteers, and FDA reviews this application before granting permission for the trials to proceed. IRBs review and approve the clinical trial protocols and informed consent forms.\n\nClinical trials typically go through three phases before an application for marketing approval is submitted to FDA. Phase I tests the safety of the drug on healthy volunteers, phase II assesses safety and effectiveness on patients with a specific disease or condition, and phase III gathers more information on safety and effectiveness on a larger scale. If the clinical trials are successfully completed, the drug can move on to FDA's review and approval process.\n\nIf a patient is unable to participate in a clinical trial, they may still be able to access an investigational drug through FDA's expanded access program or the federal Right to Try (RTT) Act. The expanded access program allows licensed physicians to request access to investigational drugs for their patients who have serious or life-threatening conditions and no other treatment options. The RTT Act provides another pathway for patients who have exhausted approved treatments and cannot participate in a clinical trial.\n\nFDA has been working to help drug manufacturers broaden their eligibility criteria for clinical trials to include more patients who have traditionally been excluded, such as those with compromised liver and kidney function. They held a workshop in 2018 where stakeholders discussed ways to safely broaden eligibility criteria, and FDA issued guidance documents in 2019 recommending the inclusion of certain patient populations in cancer trials. Some drug manufacturers have already started to broaden their eligibility criteria, but there are challenges to consider, such as balancing the need for a well-defined population with the desire to include more patients.\n\nIn addition to broadening eligibility criteria, drug manufacturers are also addressing other barriers to clinical trial participation, such as geographic barriers and lack of information about ongoing trials. Efforts include covering travel costs for patients, using decentralized trial locations, and launching clinical trial registries. There are also ongoing efforts to increase diversity in clinical trial participation and address historical mistrust of research.\n\nOverall, the goal is to provide patients with more options for accessing investigational drugs while maintaining patient safety and the integrity of the clinical trial process.", "In fiscal year 2018, OJJDP administered 16 programs and awarded 295 grants. The Title II Formula Grant Program, youth mentoring, and missing and exploited children received the most funding. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 implemented requirements for accountability and oversight in OJJDP grant programs. Grant monitoring and compliance auditing are used to ensure programmatic and financial integrity and accountability. OJJDP collects performance data but it was found to be unreliable. OJJDP has established goal statements and performance measures but has not set numeric targets to assess progress. OJP uses various tools to assess fraud risks, including a financial capability questionnaire and a grant assessment tool. OJP coordinates with the DOJ OIG to address fraud risks in OJJDP grant programs.", "Summary:\n\nOrganizations track their financial activities through accounting systems to ensure sound management and stability. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses multiple accounting systems within its various components, which are then consolidated by the DOD agency, DFAS, to create department-wide financial reports. Financial statements provide information about an organization's financial position and performance. However, DOD faces challenges in maintaining accurate and reliable financial information due to the large volume of accounting adjustments it has to record. Some adjustments are routine and expected, such as eliminating intragovernmental transactions, while others, known as forced-balance adjustments, are recorded to match account balances with Treasury. Forced-balance adjustments are unsupported and affect the reliability of an organization's financial information. DOD is implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to address these challenges, but the reliance on forced-balance adjustments is likely to continue until ERP transitions are completed. DOD lacks clear policies and procedures for recording accounting adjustments and insufficiently documents system-generated adjustments, which account for the majority of adjustments recorded. Improved policies and documentation are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and validity of accounting adjustments.", "Within the executive branch, both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) play a role in managing federal real property. OMB issues policies and memorandums related to real property, including a policy called the Real Property Efficiency Plan (RTF). GSA supports the implementation of OMB's policies and provides guidance to agencies on real property management. GSA is also responsible for acquiring, managing, and disposing of federally-owned real property. Agencies obtain office space through GSA and enter into occupancy agreements with the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS), paying rent, operations, and maintenance costs. Some agencies have independent authority to lease or acquire their own property.\n\nThe RTF policy, implemented in 2015, aims to promote more efficient use of real property assets by reducing space and improving utilization. Agencies are required to submit annual Efficiency Plans to OMB, which include reduction targets, maximum utilization rates, and a prohibition on increasing square footage. GSA tracks and reports cost performance measures related to real property changes, including estimated cost avoidance and average cost per square foot. The policy is effective until the end of fiscal year 2020, and discussions are underway for a successor policy.\n\nGSA's method for calculating cost performance measures has limitations. The estimated cost avoidance measure does not include agencies' investment costs, and the average cost per square foot measure is understated for GSA-managed space due to the use of rental rates instead of actual annual costs. This understatement has implications for accurately assessing agencies' progress in reducing costs and may lead agencies to make ineffective decisions.\n\nGSA's PBS emphasizes cost savings and early planning when working with agencies on real property projects. They analyze project costs and cost savings, consider opportunities to improve efficiency, and recommend projects to agencies. PBS has a tool to compare potential space projects based on factors such as market and move costs. They also perform cost analysis of alternative options for high-cost projects.\n\nIn conclusion, while OMB and GSA play leadership roles in managing federal real property, there are limitations and challenges in accurately assessing cost performance measures and ensuring efficient use of space. GSA's PBS focuses on cost savings and early planning to identify cost-effective projects, but there is room for improvement in the cost analysis process.", "Federal law requires executive agencies to maintain proper inventory controls and accountability systems for property under their control. They are also required to continuously survey their property to identify excess and promptly report it to the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal. Each agency determines what property should be tracked as accountable, based on factors such as cost and sensitivity. Non-accountable property, such as office furniture, is typically not tracked unless necessary. Some agency property is stored in warehouses, which are classified as buildings used for storage. GSA's role in property management is limited until property is declared excess. GSA has issued regulations and administers a web-based system for property disposal. Agencies are not required to adhere to GSA's guidance. Property management responsibilities are shared between property officials and property custodians within agencies. The selected agencies have warehouses that contain a wide range of property, specific to their missions. While agencies track certain direct costs for warehouses, they do not systematically determine the overall cost of storing property in warehouses. Two of the agencies have policies in place for property custodians to assess the ongoing need for property. DOE has specific requirements for retaining equipment for future projects. Beyond that, agencies rely on professional judgment to determine ongoing property needs. However, there have been instances where agencies have retained unneeded property in storage. Overall, the agencies face challenges in managing and assessing property stored in warehouses.", "A recent report conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not consistently adhering to policies regarding the employment, credentialing, and privileging of healthcare providers. The report identified several areas where the VA fell short, including inadequate oversight, lack of awareness of key policies, and gaps in policy interpretation. In particular, the VA failed to take appropriate disciplinary action against some providers with adverse information in the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and hired or retained providers with revoked or surrendered licenses. The report also highlighted the lack of timely and comprehensive reviews of providers' clinical care, which could potentially compromise patient safety. The GAO made several recommendations to address these issues and improve oversight and accountability within the VA.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) ensures that eligible military personnel and their families have access to affordable and quality housing. They achieve this through the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI), which allows the military departments to partner with private developers to provide housing. However, oversight of privatized housing has been limited in key areas. The scope of oversight of housing condition is limited, performance metrics may not accurately reflect housing conditions, there is a lack of reliable data on housing condition, and DOD's reports on resident satisfaction have been inconsistent. Each military department conducts daily oversight of management and operations of privatized housing and reviews compliance with business agreements, but the effectiveness of these activities varies. The military departments use performance metrics to monitor private partner performance, but they may not accurately reflect housing conditions. The data on housing condition from work order tracking systems is unreliable and inconsistent. Reports to Congress on resident satisfaction have been unreliable and misleading. Overall, there is a need for improved oversight and monitoring of privatized military housing.", "The platform economy has grown rapidly since the launch of the iPhone and Apple's app store in 2008. This has led to the emergence of platform companies that connect buyers and sellers of goods and services. The platform economy can be divided into marketplaces for services or goods, such as transportation or retail. Platform companies generally classify their workers as independent contractors, which has implications for tax obligations and labor protections. Estimating the size of the platform workforce is challenging, but studies suggest that it is growing. Platform workers often work part-time for secondary income and earn relatively low wages. The IRS faces challenges in identifying and providing assistance to platform workers due to limitations in its data and lack of information on tax forms. Platform workers may be less aware of their tax obligations, have limited information on their earnings, and struggle with estimating and remitting quarterly tax payments. The IRS is developing a strategy to promote compliance among platform workers.", "Airline customer service agents have various duties to assist passengers at the airport, including checking passengers into flights, handling checked bags, and boarding and deplaning passengers. They also assist passengers during service failures, such as lost bags. Airlines, airport law enforcement, airport management, and prosecutors are responsible for preventing and addressing passenger assaults. Limited data exist on the frequency and nature of such assaults, but a survey of customer service agents found that verbal harassment, threats, and physical assaults were reported. Factors that contribute to passenger assaults include alcohol consumption, airline business practices, and crowded airports. Customer service agents reported negative impacts on their well-being as a result of these incidents. Airlines are required to develop assault-prevention and response plans, but not all have submitted them to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Current state and local laws are considered sufficient to address passenger assaults, although some stakeholders suggest opportunities exist to strengthen penalties. Stakeholders generally believe that current resources are sufficient to address passenger assaults, although some suggest increasing the number and presence of law enforcement in airports.", "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is currently conducting four weapon modernization programs: the B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP), the W88 Alteration 370, the W80-4 LEP, and the W87-1 Modification program. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review also calls for NNSA to consider additional weapon programs, including a program to develop a modern nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile and a new submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead (W93). To support these programs, NNSA plans to spend billions of dollars on capital asset projects to modernize its production infrastructure. However, any delays or technical challenges in modernizing the production facilities may result in delays and challenges to the weapon programs. NNSA has made improvements in its management of some programs but could still take additional actions to enhance its management. The President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for NNSA indicates a significant increase in funding for Weapons Activities. It is important for NNSA to assess the affordability of its portfolio of modernization programs and consider options to bring its funding estimates into alignment with potential future budgets.", "IRA owners are not allowed to engage in certain prohibited transactions involving IRA assets. Prohibited transactions fall into two categories: transactions involving disqualified persons, such as family members or IRA fiduciaries, and transactions involving self-dealing, where the IRA owner personally benefits. Prohibited transactions are more likely to occur with unconventional IRA investments, such as real estate or virtual currency. Engaging in a prohibited transaction can result in adverse tax consequences, including the loss of the IRA's tax-favored status and additional income and excise taxes. The Department of Labor (DOL) has the authority to grant exemptions to the prohibited transaction rules. The DOL evaluates exemption applications based on certain criteria and follows administrative procedures. The application process can take anywhere from a few months to over a year. The DOL's internal policies and procedures for managing the exemption process are not well-documented. Limited collaboration exists between the DOL and IRS on applications for prohibited transaction exemptions, but no formal mechanism is in place to guide their collaboration. Sharing more information between the two agencies could improve their oversight of prohibited transactions.", "Insurance is a risk management tool that compensates individuals and businesses for certain losses or expenses. In the United States, there are thousands of insurance companies offering various types of coverage. The insurance industry has been impacted by advances in technology, with many companies using technology to offer simpler products and streamlined customer experiences. Insurtech companies, including startups and technology providers, play a significant role in the insurance market. Established insurers also use technology or partner with insurtech companies to enhance their services. Insurance companies are licensed at the state level and are subject to regulations regarding solvency, market conduct, and licensing of agents and brokers. State regulators oversee insurance rates and forms and may require insurers to maintain specific levels of capital. The insurance market is divided into two sectors: admitted insurers (traditional insurers) and surplus lines insurers (nonadmitted insurers). Surplus lines insurers provide coverage for risks that traditional insurers are unwilling or unable to cover, and they are regulated differently than admitted insurers. The insurance industry has increasingly adopted technology, such as mobile apps, AI, big data, the internet of things, drones, and telematics, to improve risk monitoring, reduce costs, and enhance underwriting. Blockchain technology also has the potential to improve insurance processes.", "The Bureau of the Census is making significant changes to its operations for the 2020 Census. It plans to use technology to manage fieldwork more efficiently, reduce the number of offices required, and streamline its staffing structure. The Bureau will provide temporary staff with mobile devices to perform administrative and data collection tasks remotely, reducing the need for office space. It also plans to use a blended training approach, including instructor-led, computer-based, and hands-on training, to maximize learning and performance. The Bureau has opened 39 area offices for early operations and plans to open 209 more by September 2019. Recruiting enough temporary workers is a challenge due to factors such as low unemployment rates, but the Bureau is on track to meet its recruiting goals. The Bureau has faced some delays in finding office space and completing construction, but it is actively addressing these issues and has exceeded its recruiting goals for early operations.", "In 2017, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused extensive damage and created a high demand for federal disaster response and recovery resources. The cost of these hurricanes ranked among the top five costliest on record. Puerto Rico was particularly affected, with power outages lasting up to 11 months and a need for commodities such as food and water. The federal response was complicated by factors such as the remoteness of the island and outdated infrastructure. The Emergency Relief Program provides assistance to repair or reconstruct highways and bridges damaged by natural disasters. FHWA is responsible for allocating funds and overseeing the program. FHWA has allocated $634 million to repair hurricane-related damage in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. However, there are concerns about FHWA's management and oversight of the program, including the classification of projects as emergency repairs instead of permanent repairs.", "The ASD(HA) serves as the principal advisor for all DOD health policies and programs. They have the authority to issue instructions, publications, and memorandums that govern the management of DOD medical programs. The ASD(HA) also has control over the President of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and sets the maximum special and incentive pay amounts for military physicians and dentists. Currently, each military department is responsible for recruiting and retaining physicians and dentists, with their own organizational structures and resources. DOD has two primary sources of recruitment for military physicians: the scholarship program and the University. Participants in these programs receive tuition-free education and financial benefits in exchange for active-duty service obligations. After completing medical or dental school, graduates may choose to specialize by applying to residency training programs. Residency training typically lasts 3 to 7 years for physicians and 1 to 6 years for dentists. After completing residency, physicians and dentists become credentialed and privileged to practice their specialty and are eligible for board certification. Cash compensation for military physicians and dentists is generally less than private sector civilian compensation, but the military offers deferred benefits such as retirement pensions and healthcare that may be valuable to servicemembers. The decision to stay with or separate from the military is influenced by multiple factors, including cash compensation, non-cash benefits, deployment frequency, administrative requirements, family considerations, and retirement eligibility.", "Summary:\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has several organizations responsible for preventing, responding to, and resolving incidents of child abuse, including child-on-child abuse. These organizations include the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the DOD Family Advocacy Program (FAP), Military Service Family Advocacy Programs, Military Criminal Investigative Organizations and Military Police, the DOD Office of the General Counsel and Service Judge Advocates, the DOD Education Activity, and other DOD organizations. Additionally, the DOD works with the Executive Office for United States Attorneys and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prosecute crimes and resolve incidents of child abuse. Community partners, such as the National Children's Alliance, children's advocacy centers, state and local child welfare agencies, and civilian law enforcement, also assist in responding to and resolving incidents of child abuse.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) oversees various programs designed to support small businesses. These programs provide resources such as access to capital, assistance with federal contracting opportunities, and counseling and training for entrepreneurs. To determine eligibility for these programs, SBA establishes size standards based on factors like average number of employees or annual receipts. SBA periodically reviews and updates these size standards. The agency also negotiates small business contracting goals with federal agencies to ensure that 23 percent of prime contract dollars are awarded to small businesses. SBA offers mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, contractor team arrangements, and joint ventures to help small businesses compete for contracts. It is generally possible for a small business to continue performing under its contract even if it outgrows the size standard, provided it qualified as small at the time of the initial award. Recertification of size status may be required under certain circumstances, especially when mergers or acquisitions occur.", "FEMA's Individuals and Households Program provides assistance to disaster survivors, but a report found that individuals with disabilities faced challenges in accessing this assistance. Some of the issues identified include long wait times, unclear registration questions, and ineffective communication across FEMA programs. The report recommended implementing new registration-intake questions to better identify and address disability-related needs and improving communication of disability-related information across programs. It also highlighted difficulties faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing basic services, such as food, water, and medication, during and after the 2017 hurricanes. The report recommended that FEMA develop and disseminate a set of objectives for its disability integration approach, provide comprehensive training on disability issues to all staff, and develop a timeline for a replacement training course for nonfederal partners. FEMA has taken steps to address these recommendations, but further progress is needed to ensure better support for individuals with disabilities in disaster situations.", "In the United States, various federal agencies and aviation stakeholders are responsible for preparing for and responding to communicable disease threats in the civil aviation system. The lead agencies for responding to these threats are the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They focus on protecting borders and the nation from domestic and foreign health, safety, and security threats. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for flight safety and the movement of air traffic in the national airspace system. In the case of a communicable disease threat, multiple entities may be called upon to respond, depending on legal authority and timing. There is currently no comprehensive national aviation-preparedness plan to limit the spread of communicable diseases through air travel, though individual airport and airline plans exist. It is recommended that the DOT work with relevant stakeholders to develop such a plan, which would provide a coordination mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors. Additionally, FAA's management of its research and development portfolio has been found to be inconsistent with statutory requirements and leading practices. Recommendations have been made for FAA to develop a more strategic approach to identifying research priorities and to ensure compliance with reporting requirements. FAA has partially addressed these recommendations. While FAA has sponsored limited research related to disease transmission on aircraft and in airports, its research goals do not specifically focus on this area. The agency primarily looks to HHS and the CDC for guidance on passenger health issues. Overall, a national aviation-preparedness plan and strategic research efforts are necessary to effectively respond to communicable disease threats in the aviation sector.", "The analysis of FHA data found that from fiscal years 2014 to 2018, a total of 272,155 Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) terminated. The number of terminations increased from around 24,000 in 2014 to a peak of roughly 82,000 in 2016, and then declined to about 60,000 in 2018. A growing percentage of HECMs terminated due to borrower defaults, which increased from 2 percent in 2014 to 18 percent in 2018. The most commonly reported reason for termination was the death of the borrower. Many defaults were due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or failing to pay property charges. The analysis also found that HECM servicers have limited use of foreclosure prevention options, with only about 22 percent of borrowers receiving repayment plans for property charges. Additionally, it is difficult to estimate the number of HECMs eligible for mortgagee optional election assignments, which allow nonborrowing spouses to stay in their homes after the death of a borrowing spouse. FHA's monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the HECM program have weaknesses, including incomplete data on termination reasons and limited performance indicators. FHA has not conducted comprehensive on-site reviews of HECM servicers since 2013 and does not have updated review procedures. The report recommends that FHA take steps to improve the quality and accuracy of termination data, establish performance indicators for the HECM program, develop analytic tools for better monitoring, analyze the implications of its foreclosure prioritization process, and conduct on-site reviews of HECM servicers. It also recommends that FHA and CFPB complete an information-sharing agreement and that FHA improve the collection and analysis of consumer inquiry and complaint data.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in strengthening its management functions, but there are still areas that need improvement. DHS has met three out of five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, including leadership commitment, action planning, and monitoring progress. The top leadership has demonstrated commitment and support for addressing management challenges and has taken steps to institutionalize this commitment. DHS has produced an Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management and has made updates over the years. However, DHS has partially met the criteria for capacity and demonstrated progress. It needs to make additional progress in areas such as acquisition, IT, and financial management to fully demonstrate its capacity. DHS has made particular progress in the areas of human capital and IT management in the last 2 years. However, challenges remain in areas such as acquisition management, IT management, financial management, human capital management, and management integration. The department needs to continue implementing its strategy for high-risk management and demonstrate measurable, sustainable progress in achieving outcomes. Continued effort is required to build and integrate a department as large and complex as DHS, and it is important for top leadership to maintain support and commitment to ensure progress. The GAO will continue to monitor DHS's efforts in this high-risk area.", "Federal agencies should prioritize continuous communication with employees regarding human capital guidance and employee concerns during a pandemic. They should also consider the varying levels of exposure risk for employees working onsite and make decisions based on local pandemic conditions rather than applying across-the-board decisions. To protect employees, agencies should implement appropriate protection measures, such as workplace reconfiguration and the provision of personal protective equipment. Social distancing strategies, including maximizing the use of telework and avoiding unnecessary travel and in-person meetings, should also be implemented. Agencies should develop plans for the distribution of medical countermeasures and ensure clear communication and contingency planning. The example of the Bureau of the Census illustrates the phased approach to resuming operations and the implementation of operational changes, worker safety measures, communication plans, and contingency planning. Furthermore, agencies should implement key practices in telework programs to contribute to continuity of operations, including policies and guidance, technology infrastructure, performance management, and program evaluation. In conclusion, federal agencies must address workforce safety issues and consider various factors to continue their operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program allows the US to transfer surplus defense equipment to foreign governments and international organizations. These transfers support US foreign policy and national security objectives. The program includes items such as aircraft, ammunition, clothing, radios, trucks, and spare parts. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees the program, and the military departments determine which items are no longer needed and can be offered as EDAs. Transfers can be made as grants or sold at a reduced cost. The EDA program has been particularly popular for transferring Humvees, but approvals have halted since 2017 due to a legislative requirement to modernize the vehicles prior to transfer. The modernization requirement has proved costly for foreign governments, leading to a decrease in approved requests. DSCA plans to resume the program after the requirement expires in December 2020. Currently, the agency is encouraging foreign governments to look for alternatives, such as purchasing new Humvees. However, this may not be feasible for all countries, as there is a limited supply of the newer model Humvees that can support the weight of added armor. The approval of Humvee transfers is largely influenced by objections from the manufacturer, with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency taking those objections into consideration when making decisions. The Bureau of Industry and Security also provides input on potential industrial base effects.", "The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for overseeing and coordinating drug control efforts across federal agencies. However, the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy did not fully comply with the law, prompting recommendations for improvement. ONDCP subsequently issued the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy, which made progress but still fell short in meeting some requirements. Drug misuse has been designated as an emerging issue requiring attention, and efforts to address the opioid crisis have been authorized through grants provided by the Department of Labor (DOL). These grants are intended to support workforce development programs and help individuals affected by substance use disorders (SUD) obtain employment. States receiving these grants are required to partner with community organizations and local workforce development boards to provide supportive services and training for job seekers in recovery. Partnerships with health care organizations, justice organizations, educational institutions, and other organizations are crucial in addressing the employment readiness and support needs of those affected by SUD. States not receiving targeted grants are also striving to address the workforce aspects of SUD through partnerships and initiatives. The services provided to individuals in recovery from SUD under these grants are intensive and involve longer processes to ensure that barriers are addressed and ongoing support is provided. States are utilizing grant funds to provide job training, direct job placement, on-the-job training, and support services that help individuals prepare for and retain employment in high-demand industries.", "Victims of sexual assault may undergo a sexual assault forensic examination performed by a medical provider, which may include collecting physical evidence and documenting the victim's medical history. The Department of Justice and other organizations recommend that these exams be conducted by specially trained medical providers called sexual assault forensic examiners (examiners). However, data on the availability of examiners is limited, and many states do not have enough trained examiners to meet the demand for exams. The limited availability of training, lack of technical assistance and supportive resources, weak stakeholder support, and low retention rates all contribute to the challenges of maintaining a supply of trained examiners. Various strategies have been employed by states to address these challenges, including alternative training methods, web-based technical assistance, and the development of sexual assault response teams.", "Airlines commonly overbook their flights to prevent revenue losses from passenger no-shows. They use historical data to predict the number of passengers who won't show up. Factors such as passenger type and flight timing affect the likelihood of passengers showing up. Factors like safety, operation, or personnel needs can also lead to denied boarding. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates oversales but not overbooking. Airlines must follow a standard process for denying boarding and compensating passengers. The number of denied boardings has decreased over the years, with most being voluntary. Passengers who are denied boarding may incur costs and travel disruptions. Rebooking options for involuntarily denied passengers are limited due to fewer empty seats and aircraft substitution. Some airlines have reduced or eliminated overbookings to reduce denied boardings. Improvements in predicting no-shows and better communication with passengers have also been implemented.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) requires each Military Service to establish its own Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) for active duty servicemembers. The EFMP has three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. Servicemembers are required to enroll in their Service's EFMP once eligible family members are identified. Before finalizing assignments, the Military Services must consider the special needs of family members, including medical and educational services. The EFMP is also responsible for helping families identify and access programs and services. The Office of Community Support for Military Families with Special Needs (OSN) oversees the EFMP and works to standardize its components. However, there are variations in the type, amount, and frequency of assistance provided by each Military Service, which could lead to gaps in support. The Military Services have also created relatively few services plans for families with special needs. DOD has not fully implemented recommendations to assess the extent to which each Service is developing these plans or providing sufficient resources for family support. There are also no common performance measures or a systematic evaluation process in place. DOD relies on each Service to monitor its own EFMP and assess performance based on standards developed by a national accrediting body. OSN does not systematically review monitoring results. Recommendations have been made to develop common performance metrics and implement a systematic process for evaluating monitoring activities. Overall, DOD needs to ensure that the EFMP adequately supports families with special needs and addresses any gaps in services.", "The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided funding for veterans to receive healthcare services from community providers through the Choice Program. The program was separate from other existing programs and was extended multiple times. Two third party administrators, Health Net and TriWest, were responsible for managing networks of community providers and scheduling appointments for veterans. The VA issued contracts for the VCCP, a permanent community care program set to replace the Choice Program. The VCCP will have medical facilities handle appointment scheduling while TPAs will process and pay claims from community providers. The VA is working to establish access standards for the VCCP based on drive times and wait times. Issues with administrative burden, communication, and network inadequacies have affected veterans' access to care through the Choice Program. The VA has made efforts to address these issues, such as implementing a secure e-mail system, but more work needs to be done. Data limitations have hindered the VA's ability to monitor access to care through the Choice Program. The VA has taken steps to improve payment timeliness to community providers, but there are still factors that need to be addressed. The VCCP launch in June 2019 will come with risks and challenges, and oversight will be necessary to ensure timely access to care and avoid past problems.", "Date labels on packaged foods are not required by federal regulations, except for infant formula. However, manufacturers may choose to provide date labels to help consumers and retailers determine the food's quality. These labels may carry phrases like \"best by,\" \"sell by,\" or \"use by,\" but there is no consistent understanding of what these labels mean among consumers. This confusion can lead to unnecessary food waste, as consumers may discard safe-to-eat food based on the date label. The Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association have launched a voluntary initiative to standardize date labels, using \"best if used by\" for product quality and \"use by\" for certain perishable items. Some advocacy groups are also working to reduce consumer confusion about date labels. Internationally, the Consumer Goods Forum has called for standardized date labels to reduce food waste. In the UK and Canada, date labeling regulations are in place to address confusion. The USDA and FDA have taken steps to address consumer confusion, including issuing guidance and providing information to consumers and industry. USDA's FoodKeeper app provides information to consumers on food storage and shelf life, and FSIS has promulgated regulations related to date labeling on poultry and meat products.", "ATF and USMS have policies and procedures in place to investigate and adjudicate employee misconduct. Allegations can come from various sources, including agency staff and the general public. Each component has an intake or hotline function to assess the seriousness of the allegation and determine the appropriate next step. Investigations involve fact-finding to make informed decisions on the merit of the allegation. The DOJ OIG has the opportunity to open an investigation or send the allegation back to the component for action. Each component has its own office responsible for investigating employee misconduct, and the appropriate disciplinary action is determined based on the severity of the offense. ATF and USMS have case management systems to track employee misconduct data. Analysis of the data shows that job performance failure is a common allegation for ATF, while violations of the code of professional responsibility and conduct unbecoming are common for USMS. The majority of outcomes for both components result in corrective or disciplinary actions, while adverse actions such as suspensions and removals are less common. Both components also handle claims of management retaliation, with ATF handling 70 cases and USMS handling 21 cases from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. The majority of these cases resulted in no action or insufficient evidence. Employees can also file EEO claims of management retaliation, and data shows that a portion of these employees were also subject to employee misconduct investigations.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for implementing and overseeing security operations at commercial airports. This includes screening passengers, their luggage, and carry-on bags for prohibited items. The TSA uses various screening technologies to carry out its mission, and it develops specific detection standards for each technology. These standards specify the prohibited items that the technology should detect, as well as the required probability of detection and probability of false alarm. The TSA works with the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) to analyze the characteristics of explosive materials and develop new detection standards as needed. Once a detection standard is approved, the TSA acquires and deploys new technologies to meet the standard. The TSA also has a process for developing new detection standards in response to emerging threats involving homemade explosives. However, our review found that the TSA has not updated its guidance for developing detection standards since 2015 and has not consistently documented key decisions and steps in the testing and analysis process. By documenting its processes and decisions, the TSA could improve its assurance that detection standards are developed in accordance with established policies and practices.", "The Coast Guard owns or leases over 20,000 shore facilities, including buildings and structures. Many of these facilities are in need of recapitalization, new construction, or deferred maintenance, with backlogs totaling at least $2.6 billion as of 2018. Additionally, approximately 46 percent of the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure is beyond its overall service life. Climate change poses risks to the Coast Guard's infrastructure, particularly from extreme weather events such as hurricanes. The Coast Guard has taken steps to improve the resilience of its facilities, including rebuilding or relocating damaged facilities to better protect against natural disasters. The Coast Guard also follows updated building codes and standards to ensure more resilient construction. The Coast Guard has conducted a vulnerability assessment of its buildings to identify risks and develop contingency plans. However, further analysis is needed to determine the vulnerability of some buildings to hurricane winds, earthquakes, or tornadoes.", "According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the number of federal data centers has been increasing over the years, leading to significant costs for federal agencies. In 2010, OMB launched the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to address this issue and improve efficiency. Congress also enacted the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) in 2014, which required agencies to submit inventory and strategy to consolidate data centers. OMB issued guidance and set performance metrics for agencies to meet. In June 2019, OMB updated the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) and revised the definition of a data center. As of fiscal year 2019, agencies reported closing and planning to close data centers, but there are challenges in tracking agency progress due to lack of reporting on a fiscal year basis. The revised definition also exempts certain facilities that were previously categorized as data centers, raising concerns about security risks.", "Private health insurance is the main source of coverage in the United States, with small and large employers offering fully insured or self-funded group plans. Most small employers purchase fully insured plans, while large employers self-fund their employee health benefits. Individuals without access to group coverage can purchase insurance directly from an issuer through the individual market. The high concentration in health insurance markets is mainly due to consolidation among existing issuers, making it difficult for new issuers to enter the market. However, the establishment of health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) creates incentives for issuers to compete on price and value. While overall individual and small group insurance markets remain concentrated in most states, there have been fluctuations in the extent of concentration in recent years. The same trend is seen in individual market exchanges, with a small number of issuers holding the majority of the market share. The small group market, including SHOP exchanges, also remains concentrated, with minimal enrollment in most states. Overall, concentration levels in health insurance markets have remained relatively high.", "The Mexico City Policy, also known as the PLGHA policy, was reinstated and expanded by the Trump Administration in 2017. The policy requires foreign NGOs to agree not to perform or promote abortion in order to receive U.S. assistance for family planning. The policy applies to all global health assistance provided by U.S. departments and agencies, rather than just family planning and reproductive health assistance. The policy does not apply to global health contracts, assistance provided directly by U.S.-based organizations, or assistance to national governments and multilateral organizations. Congress provided about $8.7 billion for global health programs in fiscal year 2018, but not all of it was subject to the PLGHA policy. The majority of planned funding subject to the policy was allocated to HIV/AIDS assistance in Africa. Some NGOs declined to accept the policy's terms and conditions, resulting in about $153 million in planned funding that was not obligated. Notable NGOs that declined the policy include Marie Stopes International and International Planned Parenthood Federation.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) manages 57.2 metric tons (MT) of surplus plutonium, with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) managing over half of that amount. Since 1997, the DOE's strategies for disposing of surplus plutonium have changed, including plans for immobilization, vitrification, and irradiation as MOX fuel. However, no high-level waste repository has been constructed, making disposal difficult. Currently, the DOE's strategy is to dilute and dispose of surplus plutonium at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The DOE plans to convert surplus plutonium to plutonium oxide using the ARIES facility at LANL, with the eventual goal of producing 1.5 MT of plutonium oxide per year by 2033. However, issues with pit production and shipping newly produced plutonium oxide to SRS have caused uncertainties in the long-term plan.", "The federal disaster workforce, managed by FEMA, is designed to scale up or down depending on the timing and magnitude of disasters. It consists of permanent full-time employees, CORE employees, reservists, local hires, Surge Capacity Force volunteers, FEMA Corps members, and technical assistance contractors. The workforce is organized into different position categories and cadres that support various functions and missions. FEMA uses the FEMA Qualification System to track the training and demonstrated performance of its incident management staff. During the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons, FEMA faced staffing shortages in many of its cadres and had a high declination rate for deployment requests. These shortages may have been caused by policy changes in 2012. FEMA took steps to address the shortages, including using Surge Capacity Force volunteers, local hires, and expanding the local hiring process. The agency also conducted a review and established a new force structure target for its incident management workforce.", "Resellers maintain large databases with consumer information, which they obtain from public records, publicly available information, and nonpublic information. This information can include credit histories, insurance claims, criminal records, employment histories, and more. There is no overarching federal privacy law that governs the collection, use, and sale of personal information among private-sector companies, including resellers. However, there are specific federal laws that address privacy issues in certain sectors or entities, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). These laws provide some protections for consumer information, but they are limited in scope. Additionally, federal privacy laws have not kept pace with new technologies and methods of data collection, such as facial recognition technology and online tracking. There is a need for Congress to strengthen the current consumer privacy framework to address these issues. In the absence of comprehensive federal privacy laws, states and other countries have adopted their own privacy rules to regulate the collection and use of personal information.", "The federal agencies VA, HUD, and DOL provide programs to assist homeless veterans. These agencies work together to coordinate efforts and establish criteria for communities to be certified as having ended veteran homelessness. There are 16 federal programs that target homeless veterans, providing housing, healthcare, employment assistance, and supportive services. The programs follow the \"Housing First\" approach, which prioritizes providing housing without preconditions. However, there are challenges in addressing the complex needs of homeless veterans, including substance use and mental illness, aging veterans, resistance to program participation, eligibility requirements, VA staffing shortages, and limited housing availability and affordability. These challenges impact the ability of VA and service providers to effectively assist homeless veterans.", "The Navy's small surface combatant concept, known as LCS, was intended to be a flexible platform that could swap out mission packages for different mission needs. However, the Navy's vision for LCS evolved over time due to diminished capabilities and cost and schedule growth. In 2014, the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to evaluate alternatives to LCS, leading to the development of the FF program, which aimed to provide a more lethal and survivable multi-mission ship. However, the planned upgrades for FF did not significantly improve survivability and lacked capabilities prioritized by fleet operators. In 2017, the Navy revised its plans and began pursuing the FFG(X) program, which aims to address the shortcomings of LCS and meet increased requirements. The Navy used a conceptual design phase to refine requirements and identify opportunities for cost savings. The conceptual design phase facilitated dialogue between industry and the Navy and improved industry's understanding of requirements. The Navy also implemented a cost savings effort, incorporating partially or fully accepted cost reduction measures into FFG(X) system specifications. The Navy has streamlined the acquisition approach for FFG(X) to accelerate the time between planning and ship delivery and fielding. However, recent policy changes have created uncertainty for Navy cost estimation activities.", "The military has been privatizing utility systems at military installations since 1988. Congress gave the military permanent statutory authority in 1997 to privatize utility systems on military installations. Utility systems include electric power, water, wastewater, and natural gas. The decision to privatize a utility system is made by the Secretary of a military department, and a contract is awarded for utility services. The military departments can choose to maintain ownership of utility systems for security or economic reasons. Once a utility system is privatized, the contractor is responsible for maintenance and repairs. The Office of the ASD(Sustainment) oversees the program. The military departments determine which systems to privatize, and installations assist in the privatization process. DLA Energy is the contracting agent for the majority of privatized utility services contracts awarded on behalf of the Army and Air Force, while NAVFAC handles the Navy and Marine Corps contracts. As of December 2019, approximately a quarter of utility systems have been privatized, and there are still more systems available for privatization. The pre-award contracting process for privatizing a utility system involves several phases, including acquisition planning, solicitation, initial evaluation, discussion/negotiation, and contract award. Lessons learned from previous privatization efforts can help improve the program. Since 2005, several reports have been issued identifying management weaknesses and making recommendations for improvement. Concerns about the length of time to award contracts have been raised, and the average time to complete the pre-award process for privatized utility services contracts is around 4 years. The time required can be affected by various factors, including changes to requirements and the complexity of the contracts. Data on the entire process is not consistently maintained, which makes it difficult to determine the complete time required.", "Commercial airports in the United States have two main areas - security-restricted areas and unsecured areas. Security-restricted areas include boarding areas and areas with restricted access for authorized personnel. Unsecured areas are public areas that can be accessed freely by the general public. Securing airport public areas presents challenges due to the large number of people and the need to maintain efficient operations. Airport operators, law enforcement, and TSA officials collaborate to secure these areas. TSA is responsible for implementing and overseeing aviation security measures, while airport operators determine the boundaries of security-restricted areas. Law enforcement personnel respond to security incidents, and airport operators are responsible for implementing security requirements. Active shooter incidents at airports have prompted actions to enhance security, such as active shooter training for TSA employees and the installation of duress alarms at screening checkpoints.", "The responsibility for suppressing wildfires falls primarily on the states and federal agencies with land management missions. FEMA can provide reimbursement to support wildfire suppression, and if a wildfire becomes a major disaster, a governor can request federal assistance through a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). FEMA can also provide funds and coordination for response and recovery efforts after a major disaster declaration. FEMA has provided over $2.4 billion in assistance for wildfire disasters from 2015 to 2018. State and local officials have reported both successful practices and challenges in wildfire response and recovery, including complex documentation requirements for FEMA grants and a shortage of temporary housing for survivors. FEMA has introduced a new delivery model for the Public Assistance program to address these challenges.", "The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes to provide quality education for Indian children with disabilities. BIE schools have a significant number of students with disabilities, and the most common disability category is specific learning disabilities. Each eligible student with a disability must have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), which outlines the student's unique needs and the services to be provided. BIE schools are required to develop and update IEPs in an online data management system. However, there have been significant problems with BIE's implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) has found ongoing noncompliance with IDEA and in some cases, students have not received required services. OSEP has withheld a portion of BIE's IDEA funds due to these issues. BIE schools have also struggled to provide the required amount of special education services, and there is inconsistent documentation and practices for missed services. Overall, BIE's management and oversight of Indian education programs, including special education, have been problematic, and the agency has been added to the High Risk List.", "Import alerts serve several purposes according to FDA documents and officials. They prevent the distribution of products that violate FFDCA, free up agency resources by automatically detaining shipments without examination, and place the responsibility of compliance on importers. Import alerts can apply to specific products, firms, or geographic areas and may cover an area within a country, entire countries, or worldwide. FDA uses the PREDICT screening tool to evaluate import entries and target shipments with high levels of risk. Imported seafood that violates FFDCA can be refused entry, exported, destroyed, or reconditioned to comply with regulations. FDA establishes new import alerts to respond to human health hazards and may place firms or products on these alerts for violations such as insanitary conditions, restriction for sale, or adulteration. Firms can request removal from import alerts if they provide evidence of compliance. FDA relies on private laboratory analyses to support removal decisions and conducts audits and on-site assessments to ensure the validity of the laboratory's analysis. However, the FDA does not monitor the extent to which it meets its audit goals, requirements, and expectations related to sampling and inspections.", "The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council is responsible for developing recommendations for revisions to the DFARS, which supplements the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The DFARS contains additional requirements of law, DOD-wide policies, deviations from FAR requirements, and policies that have a significant impact on contractors or offerors. Stakeholders in the acquisition process include program and contracting officials, members of Congress, industry and contractors, and the public. The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council makes implementation recommendations to the DOD and DARS staff implements those recommendations. The Council is composed of the DARS Director, DARS Deputy Director, and representatives from the Defense Contract Management Agency, and Defense Logistics Agency. DFARS changes can come from legislation, recommendations from DOD offices, court decisions, executive orders, or policy changes within DOD. DARS staff reviews proposed legislation and committee report language to stay informed about provisions that may need to be implemented. DARS staff tracks each potential change in case files and can implement provisions through various methods, such as the rulemaking process or issuing DFARS class deviations. DARS staff identifies the provisions that require action and coordinates across the department for implementation. However, there is no publicly-available summary reporting of the status of regulatory changes linked to specific NDAA provisions, making it difficult for Congress and industry representatives to determine the status of pending changes. DARS staff publishes public status updates on cases, rule changes, and changes to DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI). DOD has taken action to address all 180 NDAA provisions from fiscal years 2010-2018. The average time for implementation of the 112 implemented provisions was just under 1 year. Some implementation efforts took longer due to reconciling multiple years of NDAA requirements or dealing with complex topics. The DARS staff publishes case reports and provides input for regulatory priorities through the publicly-available Unified Agenda. However, there is no readily available mechanism for external stakeholders to determine the implementation status of specific legislative provisions. This lack of communication affects oversight of acquisition reforms by Congress and visibility for federal contractors.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act allows US employers to bring non-immigrant workers into the country through the H-2B visa program. Employers can apply for these visas when they can prove that they need temporary workers, there are no qualified US workers available, and the employment of H-2B workers will not negatively affect US workers' wages or working conditions. The authorized stay for H-2B workers is typically no more than 10 months but can be extended up to three years in certain cases. There is an annual cap of 66,000 H-2B visas, with half of them available in the first half of the fiscal year and the other half available in the second half. There is also a returning worker exemption that allows H-2B workers who were previously counted against the visa cap to not be counted again. The Department of Labor screens employers to ensure eligibility, and the Department of Homeland Security screens nonimmigrant workers to determine their eligibility. The Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing H-2B employer requirements and investigating complaints from workers. The H-2B visa program has seen increased demand from employers as the economy has strengthened, with the number of certifications and workers approved increasing each year. H-2B employers are concentrated in certain industries and counties with stronger labor markets and lower unemployment rates. Many employers have expressed concern about the uncertainty of receiving H-2B visas, and some have reported negative impacts on their businesses when they did not receive all the visas they requested.", "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) carries out its nuclear stockpile missions at eight sites managed by seven contractors. These sites include three national security laboratories and four nuclear weapons production plants, among others. The NNSA is organized into program offices that oversee various programs and allocate funds to the contractors. The contractors are responsible for executing specific program functions and achieving cost savings. Oversight of the Cost Savings Program involves both contractor representatives and NNSA officials. The program is divided into six phases, including the Annual Controlled Baseline phase, the Cost Reduction Proposal phase, and the Verification phase. The verified net savings from cost reduction initiatives are distributed to the contractor, the government, and for site reinvestment projects. CNS, the contractor for Y-12 and Pantex, has focused on merger and consolidation activities, as well as achieving savings through process improvements. The contract with CNS has been modified to ensure that delivery of cost savings is assessed alongside the contractor's performance. The first 2-year option term has been exercised, and the gateway decision for the second option term will be made by the end of June 2020. Various offices and committees, both within CNS and NNSA, are involved in the administration and oversight of the Cost Savings Program.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) operates Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) to provide strategic value and support the department's goals. These FFRDCs are managed by military departments or divisions and are operated by universities, nonprofit organizations, or private firms under long-term contracts. They provide specialized research and development services that cannot be easily fulfilled by government personnel or private contractors. The FFRDCs are grouped into three categories: research and development laboratories, study and analysis centers, and systems engineering and integration centers.\n\nTo ensure the proper functioning of the FFRDCs, DOD and each center have a sponsoring agreement that outlines the purpose and mission of the FFRDC, as well as the conditions and requirements for its operation. The primary sponsor, typically a military department, must include provisions in the agreement to prevent conflicts of interest and protect sensitive information. The FFRDCs may perform work that is closely associated with inherently governmental functions or critical to maintaining control of the department's missions and operations. They may need access to acquisition data, which can be obtained through DOD personnel, government databases, or directly from prime contractors.\n\nIn December 2017, DOD launched a 3-year pilot program to streamline the process for FFRDCs to access sensitive data. Under the program, FFRDC researchers no longer have to obtain individual nondisclosure agreements with each data owner. Instead, the FFRDC and DOD sponsor must ensure certain protections are in place to safeguard the data. Six out of the 10 DOD FFRDCs elected to participate in the program, primarily based on their data needs and the availability of alternative methods of obtaining the data. Participating FFRDCs reported 33 projects enrolled in the pilot program from January 2018 to September 2019.\n\nThe pilot program has yielded several benefits for the participating FFRDCs. For example, it has facilitated access to sensitive data that was previously difficult to obtain, enabling FFRDC researchers to conduct in-depth analyses and provide valuable insights. The streamlined nondisclosure agreement process has also saved time and effort for both the FFRDCs and data owners. However, DOD officials acknowledge that establishing a causal relationship between the pilot program and acquisition process improvements may take years to determine. \n\nWhile the pilot program has implemented important protections to mitigate the risks of unauthorized disclosure or use of sensitive data, there are some gaps in the incorporation of these protections into the sponsoring agreements. The Laboratories and Personnel Office, responsible for managing the pilot program, does not have a procedure to verify whether the protections have been implemented. Overall, the pilot program has been successful in providing access to sensitive data and streamlining the process for FFRDC researchers, but there are areas that need improvement to ensure the proper implementation of protections.", "The Constitution gives Congress the power to coin money, and Congress has specified the coins that can be produced and their metal composition. The Department of the Treasury produces notes and the Mint produces coins. The Federal Reserve orders new notes and coins to meet public demand and distributes them to depository institutions. The government incurs costs to produce, process, and circulate notes and coins, but these costs are offset by the financial benefit of issuing currency. Other countries have replaced notes with coins to reduce costs. The production costs of the penny and nickel are higher than their face value, resulting in net losses for the Mint. The government has conducted research on alternative metals for coins, but replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would likely result in a net loss over 30 years. Replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would incur upfront costs and benefits would accrue gradually. Stakeholder industries would incur additional costs if there was a switch to a $1 coin, and some industries see no benefit in the switch.", "The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is the head of the Intelligence Community (IC) and advises the President on intelligence matters. The IC consists of 17 agencies and organizations, known as IC elements. The DNI has emphasized the importance of diversity in the workforce to address the challenges faced by the IC. A pilot project was started in 2004 to promote equality of employment opportunities for women, minorities, and individuals with diverse backgrounds. Initially, the pilot was conducted at Trinity Washington University, and then expanded to three more colleges. In 2005, the IC Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program was established, and by 2007, 65 scholars had participated. The program continued to expand to more colleges, and by 2009, a total of 17 colleges were participating. In 2010, the IC CAE program was codified and transferred from the DNI to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for management. DIA issued grants to colleges on a competitive basis to establish and support intelligence-related programs. The IC CAE program also includes other learning experiences, such as professional development summits, summer seminars, and internships. DIA has been issuing grants for the program, but has not effectively planned or overseen the program since taking over in 2011. This includes lacking goals, a strategy, evaluation of external factors, performance measures, and a plan to assess program performance.", "Two offices within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) are responsible for managing data related to federal real property. The Public Buildings Service (PBS) acts as a landlord for the federal government and manages three databases that provide information on federally owned and leased properties. The Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) manages the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database, which collects and reports on all federal real property data. The FRPP contains details for approximately 398,000 assets.\n\nThe FRPP database is not publicly accessible, but it is used as the basis for a public database that was released at the end of 2017, as required by the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act (FASTA). The public database is available as a downloadable spreadsheet or a searchable mapping application. However, there are issues with the data in the public database, particularly regarding street addresses and geo-coordinates. Many of the street addresses provided are incomplete or incorrectly formatted, making it difficult to locate assets accurately. Additionally, more than half of the geo-coordinates provided do not meet the required level of precision.\n\nTo address these issues, GSA has implemented a validation and verification (V&V) process. Agencies are given 10 months to review and correct any questionable entries (anomalies) identified by GSA. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of this process, as agencies have confirmed only a small percentage of the identified anomalies as errors. Many anomalies remain unresolved, and agencies have expressed difficulties in validating the large number of anomalies generated annually.\n\nFurthermore, certain useful information has been withheld from the public database. GSA decided to withhold 15 categories of data without consulting agencies or assessing the specific sensitivity of the information. Additionally, selected agencies have withheld information inconsistently within their own organizations, even if it is already publicly available.\n\nOverall, there are reliability issues with the FRPP and the public database, particularly regarding street addresses and geo-coordinates. The V&V process has not been efficient in identifying errors, and certain useful information has been withheld from the public database without proper consultation or assessment.", "Nursing homes and assisted living facilities provide long-term care to vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly and disabled, in institutional or residential settings. Nursing homes offer skilled nursing care for individuals with physical and cognitive limitations, while assisted living facilities provide a residential alternative for those who want to maintain their independence but need some assistance. The demand for assisted living services is expected to increase due to the aging population and desire to remain in the community. Oversight of nursing homes is a shared federal-state responsibility, with federal law imposing quality standards and federal and state oversight responsibilities. Assisted living facilities are primarily overseen by state agencies, but CMS indirectly oversees them through their oversight of state Medicaid agencies. There are differences in federal requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement about elder abuse in nursing homes compared to assisted living facilities. CMS officials are taking steps to gather and disseminate best practices to help states better manage their response to elder abuse incidents in assisted living facilities. Three selected states with HCBS waivers\u2014Connecticut, Oklahoma, and South Dakota\u2014have their own requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement about elder abuse in assisted living facilities. GAO has issued reports reviewing CMS\u2019s oversight of nursing homes and assisted living facilities and has made key recommendations to improve oversight.", "The majority of railroads subject to the mandate to implement Positive Train Control (PTC) are currently implementing one of three PTC systems: Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS), Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES), and Enhanced Automated Train Control (E-ATC). These systems have similar functionalities but differ in the technologies they use. Railroads are required to go through multiple stages of testing, including laboratory testing, field testing, and revenue service demonstration, to ensure that the PTC systems meet functional requirements. Once a railroad's safety plan is approved by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), they receive system certification and can operate the PTC system in revenue service. Achieving interoperability, where different railroads' PTC systems can communicate and respond to each other, is another key goal. Railroads prioritize achieving interoperability with different tenants based on factors such as passenger safety and the sharing of track miles. As of March 31, 2019, almost all railroads were either in the field testing or revenue service demonstration stage, with full implementation expected to occur in the last quarter of 2020. However, several challenges, including software issues and coordinating schedules between host and tenant railroads, remain for railroads implementing PTC and achieving interoperability.", "Boeing won a contract to develop the KC-46, the Air Force's next generation aerial refueling tanker aircraft. The KC-46 is equipped with subsystems that allow for two types of refueling - a refueling boom and a hose and drogue system. The aircraft is based on Boeing's commercial 767 aircraft and is being modified to meet military requirements. The Federal Aviation Administration certified the design of the KC-46 in September 2018, and the Air Force granted a limited duration airworthiness certification in November 2018. Boeing has experienced delays and cost overruns during development, but the program's total acquisition cost estimate is currently about $43 billion, or $9 billion less than the original estimate. The Air Force conditionally accepted the first seven KC-46 production aircraft in early 2019, about 3 years later than planned, with three critical deficiencies related to the refueling subsystems. Boeing is producing the remaining 45 aircraft associated with the first four production lots, and delivery is expected to be completed by mid-2020. The Air Force stopped accepting KC-46 aircraft in February 2019 due to foreign object debris found in the aircraft, but deliveries resumed after Boeing implemented corrective actions.", "Consumers receive broadband service from various types of companies that own and operate the necessary infrastructure. There are fixed technologies like cable or fiber, which provide broadband to single locations, and mobile technologies which provide internet access wherever there is a signal. The FCC has set a benchmark speed for what qualifies as \"advanced telecommunications capability\" at 25 megabits per second for downloading and 3 megabits per second for uploading. The federal government provides funding to subsidize broadband deployment in areas where private investment is lacking, such as rural areas. The largest share of federal support comes from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, which includes programs to ensure access to affordable communications for various groups, such as schools, libraries, rural health care providers, and low-income consumers. From 2009 to 2017, the telecommunications industry spent an estimated $795 billion on capital expenditures, with the majority being used to improve existing infrastructure and expand into new areas. Federal investment in broadband infrastructure totaled about $47.3 billion from 2009 to 2017, with FCC's high-cost program providing the bulk of the support. These federal programs have used metrics to measure progress in closing deployment gaps, such as the number of new locations served and miles of fiber deployed. The impact of these programs goes beyond just infrastructure, as they have also stimulated economic development and created jobs.", "To adjudicate a self-petition filed by a foreign national claiming to have suffered domestic abuse, USCIS determines if the petitioner meets the eligibility requirements. The requirements include having a qualifying relationship with a U.S. citizen or LPR, experiencing abuse during the relationship, residing with the abuser, and having good moral character. The petitioner must also demonstrate that the marriage was entered into in good faith. USCIS conducts a background check and maintains confidentiality of the petitioner's information. The self-petition process involves submitting the petition and supporting evidence, a pre-adjudication phase by the Vermont Service Center, and an adjudication phase where the petition is either approved, denied, referred for investigation, or adjudication is withheld. Self-petition fraud is a concern, but USCIS has implemented measures to combat it.", "USDA administers nutrition education programs through multiple agencies within two mission areas. The Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNS) mission area oversees programs like SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition programs. The Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area oversees programs like EFNEP and FINI. These programs provide nutrition education through various intervention methods and in various settings, targeting low-income populations. USDA also provides nutrition education through other research and guidance directed at the general public. Participation and expenditure data are available for these programs, although detailed information on spending by type of intervention is lacking. Some studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of USDA's nutrition education interventions.", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is responsible for providing postal services to all communities. It operates a network of retail facilities that offer a range of services to customers. While customer visits and transactions have declined in recent years, the size of the retail network has remained largely unchanged. USPS has faced challenges in reducing the number of facilities due to stakeholder concerns and legal restrictions. The retail facilities account for a small portion of USPS's operating costs and revenue. While many facilities are profitable, a significant number in rural areas are not. Despite the decline in customer visits, retail facilities still play an important role in providing economic, social, and civic benefits to communities. USPS also offers nonpostal products and services, primarily passport applications and photo services, money orders, and postage sales. These offerings generate a small amount of revenue and may drive increased foot traffic in facilities. USPS has conducted pilots to provide nonpostal services on behalf of other federal government entities, such as identity proofing and biometric capture. These pilots have provided benefits to the partnering agencies and generated revenue for USPS. The nonpostal products and services offered at retail facilities enhance consumer convenience and provide non-revenue benefits.", "The Open Source Software (OSS) pilot program established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2016 has not been fully implemented by the Department of Defense (DOD). The program requires the release of at least 20 percent of newly custom-developed code as OSS, as well as the development of a consistent measure to gauge program performance. As of July 2019, DOD had only released less than 10 percent of its custom-developed code. The department has also not fully implemented the supporting requirements of issuing an OSS policy, conducting OSS analyses, securing data rights and inventorying new code, and facilitating the OSS community. DOD officials believe that OSS can provide financial benefits and increase efficiency, but until the pilot program is fully implemented, the potential cost savings and efficiencies will not be realized.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for ensuring the security of the nation's civil aviation system by screening passengers and belongings at airports. They have over 43,000 Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) stationed at approximately 440 commercial airports across the country. TSA has two offices, Training and Development (T&D) and Security Operations, that work together to manage TSOs and ensure their training is current and relevant. T&D develops initial and ongoing training based on TSA's standard operating procedures, while Security Operations allocates TSO staff to airports and schedules their work hours and training availability.\n\nTSO training consists of various courses, including basic, recurrent, remedial, and return-to-duty training. They are required to complete a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training, as well as pass an examination. In 2016, TSA centralized TSO training at the TSA Academy in Georgia, and in 2018, they introduced the TSO Career Progression program.\n\nSince 2015, T&D has made numerous changes to TSO training in response to covert tests and emerging threats that identified risks to aviation security. Changes have included updating training to emphasize certain aspects of standard operating procedures, address failures in detecting simulated explosive devices, and cover new or updated procedures for using technologies. T&D also develops job aids and briefings for TSOs to help address identified risks.\n\nTSA follows the ADDIE model for training development, which includes analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. T&D's training development process incorporates leading practice attributes, such as being formal, allowing for quick updates, addressing identified needs, including measures of effectiveness, preventing duplication, and allowing for stakeholder feedback and continuous evaluation.\n\nT&D uses the Kirkpatrick model to evaluate TSO training effectiveness, specifically focusing on Level 1 evaluations, which measure participants' reactions and satisfaction. They also conduct curriculum reviews every 5 years to ensure content validity.\n\nTSA tracks TSO training compliance through its Online Learning Center database, but the processes for monitoring training compliance were not documented. Field personnel, such as Federal Security Directors (FSDs) and Executive Directors, have the responsibility of ensuring TSOs meet their training requirements and use the database to verify compliance. However, the specific processes for analyzing training compliance data, reporting results, and taking action were not documented. FSDs are assessed on training compliance during their annual performance reviews.", "Federal agencies have different roles when it comes to infrastructure projects, including funding, construction, and permitting. Agencies that manage federal lands must approve infrastructure projects on those lands. The need to consult with tribes varies depending on the agency's responsibilities and the project's potential impact on tribes. Federal agencies are responsible for identifying and notifying relevant tribes, initiating consultation, and implementing best practices for consulting with tribes. Laws like ARPA, NAGPRA, and section 106 of the NHPA apply to Native American cultural resources and require consultation with tribes in certain circumstances. However, there are challenges and concerns related to effective consultation, including late initiation of consultation, agencies not considering tribal input, lack of respect for tribal sovereignty, and limited agency accountability. Factors that limit effective consultation include difficulties obtaining tribal contact information, resource constraints, and a demanding workload. Some agencies have taken steps to facilitate consultation, such as developing information systems to contact tribes and providing training for staff involved in consultation. Sustained attention and improvement efforts are needed to minimize negative impacts on tribal cultural resources.", "The military services maintain their own prepositioned stock programs to support their operations. These stocks are stored on land in various countries, aboard ships, and in Norway. The Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force each have their own configurations and types of equipment and stocks. These stocks are used by the geographic combatant commanders to respond to different scenarios during the initial phases of an operation until the supply chain has been established. However, the Department of Defense's implementation plan for managing prepositioned stocks does not fully address all of the required elements. Specifically, the plan lacks a comprehensive list of the department's prepositioned materiel and equipment programs, a detailed description of how the plan will be implemented, a description of the resources required to implement the plan, and a description of how the plan will be reviewed and assessed to monitor progress. Without addressing these elements, the department provides incomplete information to Congress and stakeholders on its prepositioned stock programs. Additionally, the department has made limited progress in developing a joint oversight framework for these programs, as required by Congress. While there have been updates to existing documents and issuance of new policy documents, these documents do not provide a detailed description of what is needed for effective joint oversight.", "FEMA initiated the IPAWS program in 2004 to create a comprehensive public-alerting system. IPAWS serves as a centralized gateway to deliver alerts to the public through multiple pathways, including the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), and internet services. FEMA is responsible for operating and maintaining IPAWS, while the FCC establishes rules for EAS and WEA. Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local alerting authorities can use IPAWS to send alerts, and industry organizations develop the infrastructure for creating and delivering alerts. There are gaps in access to IPAWS at the local level, which can delay the issuance of critical alerts. The usage of WEA messages has increased since 2012, primarily driven by a small group of alerting authorities. NWS sends the majority of WEA messages, mostly related to weather emergencies. Nationwide tests of IPAWS have been conducted to assess the system's effectiveness, and improvements are being made based on the results. Benefits of using IPAWS include its wide reach and ability to reach visitors to an area. However, there are limitations, such as the need for manual opt-in to receive certain WEA tests.", "The chemical industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the US and produces a wide range of products. Sustainability is a goal for many companies in the industry and involves considering economic, environmental, and social aspects. To achieve sustainability, companies must assess the entire life cycle of their products, from raw material sourcing to disposal or recycling. Federal requirements and directives, such as the Toxic Substances Control Act, help regulate chemicals and protect public health and the environment. Consumers are increasingly seeking more sustainable products, and companies are responding by developing products made with safer chemicals and using recycled or renewable materials. However, there are challenges in the market for sustainable products, such as upfront costs and uncertainty about consumer demand. Government entities can provide incentives and information to encourage the development and adoption of sustainable products. Stakeholders have different definitions of sustainable chemistry, but common themes include improving resource efficiency, reducing the use of hazardous substances, and considering the entire life cycle of a product. There is a lack of standardization in assessing sustainability, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to compare products. Various technologies, such as catalysts, solvents, and continuous processing, can improve the sustainability of chemical processes. The federal government and other stakeholders play roles in supporting research, developing new processes, and promoting the use of more sustainable chemicals. Federal programs fund research on the impacts of chemicals, support the development of sustainable processes, and aid in market growth for sustainable products.", "CMS and private payers use quality measures to assess healthcare quality. These measures can be process measures, which assess how well providers implement clinical practices, or outcome measures, which track the results of healthcare. Providers collect data for quality measures manually or electronically. CMS has created various quality reporting programs within Medicare that offer financial incentives for providers to report their performance on quality measures. CMS sets strategic objectives for these measures, but does not have complete and accurate funding information for quality measurement activities. CMS maintains unobligated balances, which can carry over from year to year, for quality measurement activities. These unobligated balances can impact the scope and timing of CMS's quality measurement activities.", "The Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) program provides financial assistance for the education of eligible American Indian and Alaska Native students. Eligible students are generally Indian students aged 3 through grade 12 who are either a member of an Indian tribe or have at least one-quarter degree Indian blood descendant. The program is administered by tribal organizations, Indian corporations, school districts, and states, known as JOM contractors, who disburse funds to schools and programs providing JOM services. Funds are used to support various educational programs, such as cultural and language enrichment, academic support, dropout prevention, and the purchase of school supplies.\n\nHowever, there are several issues with the administration of the JOM program. Firstly, there is no complete and accurate list of all JOM contractors, which hinders effective communication and oversight of the program. Additionally, the number of eligible students has increased since 1995, but there has been no official count, so the funding received by contractors may not reflect the actual number of students served. Disbursements of JOM funds to contractors are often delayed, affecting program planning and implementation. Additionally, BIE has not assessed the usefulness of the information collected from JOM contractors in over 25 years, and the forms used to collect information are outdated and burdensome. Finally, there is a lack of training provided to JOM contractors on essential aspects of program management.\n\nOverall, there are significant challenges and deficiencies in the administration of the JOM program, resulting in inadequate communication, inaccurate funding allocations, delayed disbursements, and outdated information collection methods. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the program.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified three key initiatives aimed at improving cybersecurity practices and cyber hygiene across the department. These initiatives include the DC3I, the CDIP, and the Cyber Awareness Challenge Training. The DC3I, signed in September 2015, aims to transform DOD's cybersecurity culture by improving individual human performance and accountability. The CDIP, signed in October 2015, reinforces basic cybersecurity requirements for commanders and supervisors. The Cyber Awareness Challenge Training is intended to maintain awareness of cybersecurity threats and reinforce best practices. However, as of January 2020, DOD has not fully implemented these initiatives and has not implemented several of the assigned tasks. This lack of progress is due in part to the DOD CIO not taking steps to ensure implementation. If these initiatives are not properly implemented, it may compromise the security of mission-critical information on DOD networks.", "The prevalence of obesity and the associated medical spending have increased over the past two decades. Obesity drugs are an option for treatment, with nine prescription drugs approved by the FDA. The drugs work in various ways and can help individuals lose between 3 and 9 percent more body weight than those not taking drugs. However, the use of obesity drugs is relatively low among US adults, with fewer than a million adults using them out of an estimated 71.6 million adults with obesity. This may be due to factors such as concerns about safety, lack of insurance coverage, high costs, and gaps in knowledge among healthcare providers. Limited data on individuals using obesity drugs show that they range in BMI, using drugs in combination with other services leads to greater weight loss, and adherence to using the drugs typically drops off after 30 days.", "In September 2017, two Category 5 hurricanes caused significant damage to the US Virgin Islands (USVI) and neighboring Caribbean islands. The hurricanes severely damaged critical infrastructure, housing units, and the economy of the territory. In response, the President declared a major disaster and activated FEMA's Public Assistance program to provide funding for disaster response and recovery. The program supports a variety of projects, including emergency work and permanent work, as well as cost-effective hazard mitigation measures. As of October 1, 2018, FEMA had obligated over $1.4 billion for 475 projects in the USVI. The majority of funds were allocated to emergency work projects focused on debris removal and emergency protective measures. Permanent work projects, which involve repairing and restoring public infrastructure, received a smaller portion of the funding. FEMA is also working with the USVI to transition to using the Public Assistance alternative procedures program, which provides more flexibility and financial incentives for the timely and cost-effective completion of projects. FEMA and the USVI are currently identifying and developing future permanent work projects using the alternative procedures.", "Identity proofing is a crucial process in securing online transactions to prevent fraud and protect individuals and organizations. It can be done in person or remotely. In-person identity proofing involves a trained professional verifying an individual's identity by comparing physical features and credentials with official records. Remote identity proofing, on the other hand, is done entirely online, where individuals provide electronic information or perform verifiable actions to prove their identity. Remote identity proofing involves two steps: resolution, where an organization determines the identity being claimed, and validation and verification, where steps are taken to verify the individual's identity. Knowledge-based verification, which involves asking personal questions, is a commonly used technique for remote identity proofing. However, it poses security risks as attackers can obtain personal information and impersonate the individual. NIST has issued guidelines on remote identity proofing, discouraging the use of knowledge-based verification and recommending alternative methods such as remote assessment of physical credentials, verification of mobile device possession, verification through mobile device confirmation codes, and verification through postal mail confirmation codes. These alternatives have limitations and implementation challenges, but in-person identity proofing is considered a strong method.", "Social Security provides retirement benefits to older Americans, but the program is facing financial difficulties due to an aging population and increased life expectancy. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) was enacted to address concerns about the security of pension benefits and establish requirements and standards for employer-sponsored retirement plans. However, the PBGC, which insures private sector pension plans, is also facing financial challenges. Medicare and Medicaid, which provide healthcare coverage for retirees, are also projected to have financial problems in the future. The federal government provides funding for home and community-based services for older adults, but there is a gap between funding and the growing number of older adults needing assistance. The third pillar of the retirement system is individual savings, but not everyone has access to employer-sponsored plans. Overall, the U.S. retirement system faces various risks and challenges.", "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides insurance on mortgage loans to help home buyers obtain financing. The program is particularly important for first-time, minority, and low-income home buyers. FHA requires servicers to take actions to help delinquent homeowners catch up on mortgage payments before initiating foreclosure. If these actions are unsuccessful, the servicer can pursue foreclosure. Most foreclosed properties are either sold to a third party or become the property of the servicer. FHA requires servicers to maintain and protect foreclosed properties before conveying them to FHA for sale. Servicers must complete repairs and pass an FHA property inspection before conveyance. The time to complete the conveyance process can vary widely, but FHA officials believe it should take about 37 days. FHA reconveys properties to servicers when there are condition or title issues that need to be resolved. This prolongs the conveyance process and results in additional costs for FHA.", "Congress has provided the Department of Defense (DOD) with the authority to use \"other transactions\" (OTs) for research and development projects since the late 1980s. OTs are intended to spur innovation and benefit both commercial companies and the government. The authority has been expanded over time to include prototype projects and follow-on production. DOD can use OTs for projects that enhance the mission effectiveness of military personnel and improve platforms, systems, components, or materials. There are four conditions that must be met to use a prototype OT, including significant participation from non-traditional defense contractors or non-profit research institutions, cost-sharing, or exceptional circumstances. Notably, OTs can be awarded to both traditional defense contractors and consortiums, which may include a mix of non-traditional companies, traditional defense contractors, and non-profit research institutions. The Army, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Air Force accounted for the majority of new awards and obligations on prototype OTs from fiscal years 2016 to 2018. Most of the obligations were awarded to consortiums and traditional defense contractors. The use of prototype OTs has increased significantly during this time period. However, there are limitations in the data collected on prototype OTs, and DOD is working to address these limitations to improve reporting and management of the authority. A report to Congress on DOD's use of prototype OTs is expected to be submitted in November 2019.", "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, four relief laws were enacted as of June 2020, amounting to $2.6 trillion in government appropriations. The six largest spending areas include the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Distressed Sectors, unemployment insurance, economic impact payments, the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, and the Coronavirus Relief Fund. As of May 31, 2020, obligations for these areas totaled $1.3 trillion and expenditures totaled $643 billion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported incomplete and inconsistent data on viral testing nationwide, hindering efforts to track and mitigate the spread of the virus. The distribution of critical supplies, such as ventilators, has been a challenge, and concerns remain about the adequacy and fairness of distribution. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has processed over $512 billion in loans, but questions about eligibility criteria and program integrity remain. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury disbursed over 160 million economic impact payments, but difficulties in delivering payments and the risk of improper payments to ineligible individuals, including deceased individuals, have been identified. States have received 42 million unemployment insurance (UI) claims, but there is no mechanism to capture real-time information on UI claimants who may receive wages from PPP loans. Government-wide contract obligations related to the pandemic have totaled about $17 billion. Lessons from the initial response to COVID-19 highlight the importance of clear goals, communication, data analysis, transparency, and accountability. Congress should consider legislative actions to address gaps in preparedness and oversight. Ongoing efforts and preparations are needed to respond to future waves of infection.", "The accuracy of the census depends on a complete and accurate address list, which is used to send out questionnaires and follow up with non-respondents. The process of building this address list involves partnerships with various organizations and government entities. Data collected through this process is protected under Title 13, which means it cannot be used for non-statistical purposes or shared with unauthorized parties. The LUCA program, which allows governments to review and update the address list, has remained largely unchanged since it was first implemented in 2000. The Bureau has made some changes to promote participation and reduce barriers, such as extending review timelines and allowing state governments to participate. The Bureau assesses the contribution of LUCA to the final census counts and has made efforts to reduce costs by relying on in-office address canvassing instead of door-to-door canvassing. Non-response Follow-up is another important operation of the census, where non-respondents are enumerated through multiple attempts. Address updates from LUCA participants become eligible for enumeration. The Bureau also receives address updates from other sources throughout the decade, such as the USPS and other government entities. The Bureau's implementation of LUCA 2020 largely followed its operational plan and included outreach and training activities. However, the participation of tribal, state, and local governments varied greatly, with only 21% participating in LUCA 2020. The degree of local participation is important for improving address data accuracy. The Bureau received more address updates than expected, which led to increased fieldwork costs for in-field address canvassing. The Bureau made decisions to streamline the address validation process, resulting in additional address updates being included in the census enumeration universe without review. These decisions could potentially lead to unnecessary fieldwork costs. The Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 requires a process to adjudicate differences between the Bureau and LUCA participants, which is currently underway. The LUCA appeals process has historically resulted in a high approval rate for participant appeals.", "The Caregiver Support Program Office, VISNs, and VAMCs all play a role in administering and overseeing the Family Caregiver Program within the VHA. The Caregiver Support Program Office develops policy and procedures and provides guidance and support for the program, while VISNs have a lead official for the program who provides guidance and coordination within the VISN. VAMCs administer the program at the local level and have staff assigned to the program, including primary program staff called CSCs, administrative staff, and clinical staff. Caregivers and veterans submit applications to their local VAMC or VHA's Health Eligibility Center, and CSCs manage the application process and determine eligibility. Once enrolled in the program, CSCs or other VAMC clinical staff periodically monitor the health and well-being of veterans and caregivers. The VA Office of Inspector General conducted a review of the program and made recommendations for improvement, which have not all been implemented. The VA MISSION Act requires the implementation of an IT system to support the program and the expansion of program eligibility. The Caregiver Support Program Office does not have complete and accurate staffing information for the program, and efforts are being made to address this issue. A staffing model is being developed in anticipation of future program growth.", "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an international organization responsible for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and materials are used for peaceful purposes. Its policy-making bodies include the Board of Governors and the General Conference, and its staff is organized into several departments, including the Division of Nuclear Security.\n\nIAEA's nuclear security role is supported by its statutory authorities and international treaties, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.\n\nThe agency funds its programs through its regular budget, extra-budgetary contributions, and the Technical Cooperation Fund. The United States, through the State Department, coordinates its policy and financial contributions to IAEA.\n\nThe agency conducts nuclear security activities under its nuclear security program, which consists of four subprograms: Nuclear Security of Materials and Facilities, Nuclear Security of Materials Outside of Regulatory Control, Information Management, and Program Development and International Cooperation. These subprograms involve the development of nuclear security guidance, the provision of assistance to member states, training and education, and coordination of international efforts.\n\nIAEA develops and promotes the use of nuclear security guidance documents, provides assistance to member states in establishing nuclear security infrastructure, conducts training and education programs, and coordinates international nuclear security efforts. The agency also assists with converting reactors to run on low-enriched uranium, repatriating fissile and radioactive material, and supporting member states hosting major public events.\n\nIAEA conducts various types of training and education activities, including workshops, exercises, and e-learning courses. It also supports the development of Nuclear Security Support Centers and the International Nuclear Security Education Network to enhance nuclear security knowledge and skills.\n\nThe agency coordinates international nuclear security efforts through information exchange meetings, events and conferences, and promoting the adoption of international legal instruments.\n\nOverall, IAEA plays a crucial role in promoting and ensuring nuclear security worldwide.", "The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing systems to defend against ballistic missile attacks. Its mission is to integrate these systems into the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to achieve capabilities that individual elements cannot accomplish alone. MDA has flexibility in setting requirements and managing acquisitions, allowing for expedited fielding of assets and capabilities. Congress and the Department of Defense (DOD) have implemented measures to enhance oversight, including establishing cost, schedule, and performance baselines for each element. MDA delivers capabilities to military services for operational use, supported by evidence from models and simulations, ground testing, and flight testing. Undefinitized contract actions are used when negotiation of a definitive contract is not possible in time to meet government requirements. MDA encountered challenges in meeting original goals for the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) and recommendations have been made to improve testing practices and reduce risk. In fiscal year 2018, MDA focused on regional capabilities for the Korean Peninsula and achieved a milestone in deploying 44 operational ground-based interceptors (GBI). However, it did not meet all asset delivery goals due to various factors, including quality issues and test failures. MDA conducted seven flight tests in fiscal year 2018 but faced challenges in adhering to the schedule. Legislation expanded and accelerated several MDA programs, including increasing the inventory of GBIs and accelerating the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA program. MDDE provided funding to address the North Korean missile threat.", "Federal agencies rely heavily on computer systems and electronic data to carry out their operations and protect vital information. However, these systems and data are vulnerable to cyber threats, and incidents continue to occur. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a crucial role in the cybersecurity of federal agencies and critical infrastructures. DHS issues binding operational directives to federal civilian agencies to align with cybersecurity policies set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These directives aim to address known threats and vulnerabilities and improve security measures. However, DHS has not consistently followed its process for developing and overseeing these directives, including early stakeholder involvement and validation of implementation. Coordination with key stakeholders, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the General Services Administration (GSA), has been lacking, leading to potential conflicts and missed technical considerations. Overall, while progress has been made in safeguarding federal systems, there is room for improvement in implementing cybersecurity recommendations and ensuring effective oversight.", "Underride crashes occur when a passenger vehicle collides with a large truck and slides underneath the truck's body. These crashes can cause severe injuries or fatalities, especially if the truck intrudes into the passenger compartment. Underride guards on large trucks can prevent these crashes by lowering the truck's profile and providing an effective point of impact. Currently, there are federal requirements for rear underride guards on most large trucks, but no requirements for side or front guards. Data on underride crashes may be underreported in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) due to inconsistent reporting methods and documentation. Stakeholders have called for a standard definition of underride crashes to improve data accuracy. Underride crashes account for a small proportion of total traffic fatalities but have a higher risk of severe outcomes.", "Space transportation involves the movement of objects to and from space using vehicles such as satellites and cargo-carrying vehicles. In the United States, commercial space transportation is carried out by private companies using orbital and suborbital launch vehicles. Key players in this industry include commercial launch providers, launch customers, and launch site operators. The U.S. holds a significant share of the global commercial space transportation market, with the number of launches increasing in recent years. Commercial launch providers use a range of vehicles, including both expendable and reusable launch vehicles. Launch site infrastructure varies across different sites, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for regulating and overseeing commercial space transportation activities in the U.S. The FAA requires launch providers and site operators to obtain licenses or permits for their operations. The federal government has played a significant role in building the infrastructure for commercial space launches, but state and local governments have also invested in infrastructure improvements to attract space-related businesses. The U.S. commercial space transportation industry is part of the global market, and the selection of a launch provider is influenced by factors such as the capabilities of the launch vehicle and launch site, as well as the cost of the launch.", "The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is responsible for enforcing the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) through issuing regulations and working with other federal agencies. U.S. financial institutions assist in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing by establishing compliance programs, monitoring customers and transactions, and reporting suspicious activity. FinCEN has overall authority for enforcing compliance under the BSA and can seek penalties and injunctions for non-compliance. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has delegated authority from FinCEN to investigate criminal violations of the BSA. The Department of Justice prosecutes BSA violations. The federal banking regulators review banks' compliance with BSA/AML requirements. Money transmitters must register with FinCEN and obtain licenses from states in which they operate. Banks and money transmitters are required to have AML compliance programs, conduct customer due diligence, monitor transactions, and report certain activity. They are also required to file currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports. Money transmitters pose money laundering and terrorist financing risks due to the decentralized nature of their agent system, certain high-risk customers, specific geographic locations, and products such as mobile payments and virtual currency. There have been instances of money transfers being used for illicit activities such as human smuggling and drug trafficking. In 2005, FinCEN and federal banking regulators issued guidance to clarify BSA/AML requirements for banks that provide services to money transmitters, with a focus on conducting due diligence and risk assessments.", "Traditional IRAs, created under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, provide tax advantages to individuals who want to save for retirement. There are two types of IRAs for individuals: traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs allow individuals to make tax-deductible contributions and accumulate tax-deferred investment earnings, while Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions and accumulate tax-free investment earnings. Individuals can invest their IRA savings in different asset types, but some custodians offer \"self-directed IRAs\" that allow investments in unconventional assets like real estate, precious metals, private equity, and virtual currency. However, there are complex rules that apply to IRA owners investing in unconventional assets, including restrictions on certain investments, prohibited transactions, rules regarding unrelated business income, and reporting of fair market value. Noncompliance with these rules can result in consequences for IRA owners, including losing the tax-favored status of the account and potential tax liability. The IRS is responsible for enforcing IRA tax laws and has resources available, such as publications and online tools, to provide information to taxpayers. However, current IRS publications, such as Publication 590-A and 590-B, do not provide comprehensive information for IRA owners with unconventional assets. The IRS has taken steps to identify and mitigate risks of noncompliance with IRAs, but enforcing rules for IRAs investing in unconventional assets can be challenging. IRS audits are often necessary to detect noncompliance, but the 3-year statute of limitations for assessing taxes owed can be an obstacle for pursuing noncompliance that spans many years of an IRA investment. The IRS has supported expanding the statute of limitations for IRA noncompliance but has not released a legislative proposal as of October 2019.", "The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states on outpatient drugs as a condition of having their drugs covered by Medicaid. The 340B Program allows covered entities to purchase outpatient drugs at discounted prices. HRSA and CMS have roles in overseeing compliance with the prohibition on duplicate discounts. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program helps to offset the federal and state costs of outpatient prescription drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Rebates are based on a statutory formula and are shared by the federal government and states. Covered entities and drug manufacturers both have incentives to participate in the 340B Program. Covered entities must follow certain requirements, such as not subjecting manufacturers to duplicate discounts. Both states and covered entities play key roles in preventing duplicate discounts and forgone rebates. HRSA and CMS conduct audits to ensure compliance with program requirements. CMS receives states' Medicaid rebate requests and reviews the data for errors. State Medicaid programs have varying policies on the use of 340B drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. States use different procedures to identify and exclude 340B drugs from rebate requests. Some states' policies are not documented and may not prevent duplicate discounts.", "The CORD Project is focused on reducing obesity among low-income children. CDC funding was made available through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to implement strategies such as BMI screening, promoting healthy behaviors, and educating parents. The project is divided into three phases, with the first phase already completed. The scope of the project shifted from prevention to treatment in phase 2 and 3, specifically focusing on pediatric weight management interventions. Common outcome measures were used in phase 1, but the cross-site evaluation was removed for phases 2 and 3. The study design for phase 3 involves packaging evidence-based interventions to be implemented in low-income communities. Participation by state Medicaid and CHIP programs is encouraged to ensure reimbursement and sustainability.", "The Secret Service has different vetting processes based on the proximity of individuals to the President. Physical screening and background checks, including enhanced background checks, are used to ensure security. The Secret Service establishes layers of security at the travel location, including physical screening measures for the outer layer, physical screening measures for individuals and rooms in the middle layer, and background checks and enhanced background checks for individuals in the inner layer. The Secret Service collaborates with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies for enhanced background checks. The Executive Office of the President is responsible for identifying individuals who will meet the President and providing the Secret Service with the necessary information for vetting. The Secret Service is responsible for physically screening individuals and recommending whether they should be granted access. \nDOD's White House Communications Agency and the Secret Service work together to establish secure communications and secure areas for handling classified information during the President's travel. \nThe Secret Service and DOD have procedures for reviewing and reimbursing travel-related expenses when personnel travel with the President to Mar-a-Lago. The Secret Service follows the Federal Travel Regulation, while DOD follows the Joint Travel Regulations. \nTreasury has processes for receiving payments designated as gifts to the United States or gifts to reduce the public debt. Payments received from The Trump Organization or the President would be handled using these processes. \nNo additional payments were identified from The Trump Organization or the President between January 21, 2017, and August 1, 2018, except for one payment of $151,470 received in February 2018. \nDHS provided written comments on the report. The Executive Office of the President and The Trump Organization did not provide any comments.", "TRICARE, a healthcare program for non-Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, provided benefits through three plan options before January 2018. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 terminated two of these plans and introduced TRICARE Select. Ratings of TRICARE by beneficiaries did not significantly change after the transition. However, more beneficiaries reported problems finding civilian providers that accepted TRICARE, especially for specialty care. Managed care support contractors developed networks of providers to ensure access to care, and DOD officials stated that nearly 100% of beneficiaries in the East had adequate access to a network provider. The percentage of providers accepting new TRICARE patients did not significantly change overall, although there was a decrease among mental health providers. Reimbursement and provider availability were the main reasons for not accepting TRICARE patients.", "In 1994, Executive Order 12898 directed federal agencies to develop environmental justice strategies to address the disproportionate impact of their programs on minority and low-income populations. The order created an interagency working group to coordinate efforts and outlined eight areas that agencies should address. In 2011, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed to revitalize the working group. However, agencies have not made clear progress toward their environmental justice goals and have not updated their strategic plans regularly. Of the 14 agencies that developed strategic plans after 2011, only seven assessed how their efforts aligned with their overall missions. Most agencies also lack a way to measure progress. Therefore, there is a need for agencies to update their strategic plans and establish methods to assess progress.", "The Stevens Amendment, which requires grantees receiving federal funds to disclose the amount of federal funding, has been included in most full appropriations acts passed in Congress since 1993. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the 2019 appropriations for the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Education renewed this requirement. In federal fiscal year 2017, these three departments distributed approximately $504 billion in grant funding to state and local governments, with HHS distributing the largest amount. Different agencies within these departments provide guidance to grantees on complying with the Stevens Amendment, either through exact or paraphrased language. The DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has included the amendment in its terms and conditions template for grant awards since fiscal year 2014. Other DOL agencies, such as the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, have their own separate guidance for grantees. HHS publishes a Grants Policy Statement that contains language equivalent to the Stevens Amendment and directs grantees to disclose federal funding information. Some HHS operating divisions provide grantees with exact language, while others refer grantees to the Grants Policy Statement. The Education Department provides grantees with information on the Stevens Amendment through a Grant Award Notification attachment. HHS and Education also have monitoring processes in place to identify instances of noncompliance with the Stevens Amendment and remedy the situation. ETA conducts monitoring reviews of grantees and issues monitoring reports with corrective actions for noncompliance.", "Previous reports have found that aligning federal, state, and local efforts to improve disaster resilience and preparedness can lead to a reduction in the impact of disasters. However, there are still opportunities to improve nationwide disaster resilience. One key aspect of building resilience is hazard mitigation, but states and localities have encountered challenges in using federal funds for resilient rebuilding. It was recommended in 2015 that a National Mitigation Investment Strategy be created to help prioritize disaster resilience, and FEMA is on track to address this recommendation. Additionally, the federal government has not conducted strategic planning on the potential economic effects of climate change, and it was recommended in 2015 that this be done. However, no action has been taken to address this recommendation. FEMA has taken some actions to promote hazard mitigation, but more consistent planning and performance measures are needed. FEMA is also working on completing a national preparedness assessment to identify capability gaps, but this assessment has not been finalized. In terms of response efforts, progress has been made since Hurricane Katrina, but challenges still exist, particularly in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Providing short-term housing and mass care for disaster survivors has also been a challenge, and ongoing evaluations are being conducted to address these issues. FEMA has relied heavily on advance contracts and post-disaster contracts, but there have been inconsistencies and challenges with these contracts. Recommendations have been made to improve the management of these contracts, and FEMA has reported taking steps to implement these recommendations. Overall, there are ongoing efforts to improve national preparedness and response efforts, but there are still areas that require attention and action.", "According to a report, FEMA programs have encouraged disaster resilience and reduced the effects of disasters when federal, state, and local efforts align. However, there are still opportunities to improve disaster resilience and preparedness nationwide. Some challenges include difficulty navigating federal grant programs to maximize resilient rebuilding after a disaster and lack of strategic planning on the potential economic effects of climate change. FEMA has taken steps to address these issues, but more work needs to be done. FEMA's response to the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires showed progress, but challenges still exist, particularly in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. There are also challenges in providing short-term housing and mass care after disasters. FEMA has relied heavily on advance contracts and post-disaster contracts to provide necessary goods and services, but there have been inconsistencies and challenges in coordination and transparency. FEMA is working on implementing recommendations to improve its recovery efforts.", "DOD space systems provide a wide range of capabilities to various users, but they are expensive to acquire and often experience cost increases and schedule delays. The DOD is in the beginning phases of acquiring new satellites and ground processing capabilities for several programs. The agency is exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications and developing new launch vehicles. DOD faces challenges in replenishing its satellite constellations due to growing threats in space, changes in leadership, and resource and capacity limitations. The space systems also face intentional and unintentional threats from countries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. To increase survivability, DOD could build more disaggregated systems and make satellites more maneuverable and defended. However, there are potential barriers to making satellites more resilient, including cultural and process changes, acquisition management challenges, and difficulties synchronizing schedules. DOD has limited use of commercially hosted payloads due to logistical challenges and limited knowledge and data on costs and benefits. Protecting weapon systems from cyber threats is also a mounting challenge for DOD. The fragmentation and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and oversight have contributed to program delays, cancellations, and inefficient operations. Recently, steps have been taken to change space leadership, including the proposal to establish a United States Space Force.", "The National Park Service (NPS) was responsible for organizing and executing Fourth of July events on the National Mall from 2016 to 2019. They worked with federal agencies, state and local jurisdictions, and private entities to ensure the safety and security of attendees. The events included the National Independence Day Parade, A Capitol Fourth Concert, Independence Day Fireworks Display, and in 2019, A Salute to America. Various federal agencies and local authorities provided security personnel and assets for the events. Medical resources were also coordinated by federal agencies and state and local jurisdictions to handle any emergencies. The costs of these events varied each year and included general event costs such as personnel salaries and supplies, as well as specific event costs for each individual event. The National Independence Day Parade, Capitol Fourth Concert, and Independence Day Fireworks Display incurred separate costs. The concert cost the federal government an estimated $4 million annually, primarily for the contractor that planned and executed the concert. The fireworks display event costs ranged from $253,000 to $409,000 annually and included the cost of a contract with a private entity responsible for the display. Overall, federal agencies and state and local jurisdictions spent millions of dollars each year for the Fourth of July events on the National Mall.", "The Federal Protective Service (FPS) has undergone several organizational changes throughout its history. Originally created by the General Services Administration (GSA) in the 1970s, FPS was responsible for protecting GSA-owned or leased facilities. After the September 11 attacks, FPS was moved to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its responsibilities expanded to include homeland security activities. In 2009, FPS was transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) within DHS. However, in 2018, legislation was enacted that allowed the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine a new placement for FPS within DHS. Various agencies within DHS were evaluated as potential placement options for FPS, but none met all the organizational placement criteria. Ultimately, it was determined that FPS reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary of DHS would meet several key criteria. This placement option was found to be similar to FPS in terms of mission, goals, responsibilities, organizational culture, information sharing and coordination, and mission support. However, further assessment of placement options is still pending. Throughout its organizational placements, FPS has faced challenges in meeting its mission of protecting federal facilities. These challenges include transferring mission support functions, managing contract guards, and collaborating with other agencies on facility security. Some progress has been made in addressing these challenges, but additional work is still required. Overall, the organizational placement of FPS within DHS is ongoing and efforts are being made to address persistent challenges.", "The text discusses the progress that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made in improving employee morale and engagement. The text mentions that DHS has implemented several recommendations related to employee engagement and workforce planning. These efforts include seeking employees' input, basing hiring decisions on competencies and performance, enhancing cybersecurity workforce planning, and improving employee engagement scores as measured by the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). Although DHS has made progress, it still falls behind other federal agencies in terms of employee morale and engagement. The text also highlights the importance of senior leadership involvement and filling critical vacancies in improving employee morale and engagement. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will continue to monitor DHS's progress in this area.", "Promoting the rule of law abroad has been a priority for the U.S. government for decades. The U.S. government invests resources in supporting rule of law and justice sector reform in various regions around the world. The Department of State's definition of the rule of law includes principles such as accountability, fairness, legal certainty, and equality before the law. The State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) leads rule of law assistance efforts and works to effectively coordinate assistance with other agencies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) designs and manages rule of law programs primarily through country-level missions. The Department of Justice (DOJ) implements rule of law programs with funding from State, USAID, and the Department of Defense (DOD) through interagency agreements. From fiscal years 2014 to 2018, State and USAID allocated $2.7 billion for rule of law assistance, with allocations increasing from $496 million to $551 million. Justice systems and institutions received the most funding for rule of law activities in fiscal year 2018. The top recipients of rule of law assistance were the Western Hemisphere Region, Afghanistan, Mexico, and Colombia. Strategic documents such as the National Security Strategy and joint strategic plans between State and USAID highlight the importance of improving the rule of law in partner countries. The budgeting process for rule of law assistance involves agencies developing annual budget requests and coordinating with other agencies and bureaus to align funding with foreign assistance goals. The funding is used to engage in partnerships with implementing partners overseas. DOJ's ICITAP and OPDAT offices provide rule of law assistance, primarily in the areas of law enforcement and prosecuting and courts. The Integrated Country Strategy and Country Development Cooperation Strategy are used to plan and implement rule of law assistance at the country level.", "Job Corps is a federal program that provides education and job training to young people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are low-income and facing barriers to employment. The program operates through a network of residential centers across the country, offering comprehensive services such as housing, meals, medical care, academic instruction, and job training. The program is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL), which oversees the contracting process for the operation of Job Corps centers. Most centers are operated by contractors under contracts with various businesses, Native American tribes, and nonprofit organizations, while a smaller number are operated by the USDA's Forest Service. The contracting process for Job Corps centers involves several phases, including acquisition planning, proposal evaluation, and contract administration. However, the program has faced challenges in the contracting process, including high turnover of contracting staff, protests by contractors, and the need to divert staff to implement changes brought about by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. As a result, the program has relied heavily on \"bridge contracts,\" which are short-term extensions or new contracts awarded on a sole-source basis to avoid a lapse in services. Nearly three-quarters of Job Corps centers operated under bridge contracts at some point during program year 2016, with some centers using bridge contracts for extended periods of time. These challenges in the contracting process have impacted the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.", "Enrollment is the first step for veterans to access health care services through the VA or community care. The VA's Health Eligibility Center manages the enrollment process. Once enrolled, veterans can make appointments to access VA health services. Wait times for appointments are measured and published by the VA. In addition to VA facilities, veterans may receive care through community care programs. Congress has taken steps to expand community care options for veterans. The VA has taken actions to address deficiencies in wait-time measurement and scheduling policies. These actions include changes to wait-time definitions, training for schedulers, and improved oversight through audits. However, there are still concerns about the reliability of wait-time data and the accuracy of scheduling. The VA is implementing a new nationwide scheduling system to address these challenges.", "The effective management of federal agency records is crucial for transparent, participatory, and collaborative government operations. The Federal Records Act (FRA) establishes requirements for managing records in federal agencies, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has oversight responsibilities for records management. In response to a presidential memorandum, the Managing Government Records Directive was issued to create a framework for managing electronic government records. By December 2016, agencies were required to manage all permanent and temporary email records in an accessible electronic format, and by December 2019, they were to manage all permanent electronic records in an electronic format. NARA also requires agencies to maintain an inventory of electronic information systems and develop policies and procedures for retaining and disposing of electronic records. However, agencies have not fully addressed all requirements related to electronic records management, including maintaining inventories and issuing retention and management requirements for email records. Additionally, not all agencies have established an active and continuing records management program. Thirteen of the 17 selected agencies have submitted lists and schedules of records to the Archivist, with four agencies partially addressing this requirement. Overall, agencies need to improve their compliance with electronic records management requirements to ensure proper documentation and efficient management of agency operations.", "Retirement income in the United States is comprised of three main pillars: Social Security benefits, employer-sponsored or other retirement savings plans, and individual savings and assets. Social Security benefits provide cash payments to individuals who have paid Social Security taxes and meet certain requirements. Employer-sponsored retirement plans, like 401(k) plans, allow individuals to accumulate tax-advantaged savings for retirement. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) also provide tax advantages for retirement savings. Individuals can supplement their retirement income with their own savings and assets.\n\nIn terms of support for caregivers, there are several federal and state programs that may provide assistance. Medicaid, a federal-state health financing program, provides long-term services and supports for disabled and aged individuals. Tax-related provisions, like dependent care accounts and tax credits, can help with caregiving costs. The Family and Medical Leave Act provides unpaid leave for eligible employees to care for a loved one, and the Older Americans Act provides funding for services for older individuals, including caregivers. Some states also guarantee paid sick leave or family leave for specific workers.\n\nDemographically, women are more likely than men to be parental or spousal caregivers. Parental caregivers tend to be younger, while spousal caregivers are typically older. The majority of caregivers are white, and parental caregivers tend to be more educated and have higher earnings compared to spousal caregivers. Women caregivers are more likely to work part-time and have lower earnings than men caregivers. Differences in earnings and education were significant between men and women caregivers, even after controlling for age and education.\n\nCaregiving frequency and duration vary. Spousal caregivers are more likely to provide daily care compared to parental caregivers. Women and minority caregivers tend to provide care more frequently. Caregivers with lower levels of education and earnings are more likely to provide daily care. Most caregivers provide care for at least 3 years, with an average of about 5 years.", "The Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 established compulsory pilotage on the Great Lakes to ensure maritime safety. U.S. and Canadian registered pilots are required for oceangoing commercial vessels in the Great Lakes-Seaway. The U.S. waters are divided into three pilotage districts, each operated by an association of pilots. The rates for pilotage services are established by the Coast Guard through a rulemaking process. Stakeholder input is obtained through mechanisms such as public comment periods and annual meetings of the Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Committee (GLPAC). Shipping industry stakeholders and pilots have raised issues related to the Coast Guard's rate-setting methodology, vessel traffic estimates, pilot compensation and staffing, and billing and dispute resolution. The GLPAC provides advice and recommendations to the Coast Guard on issues relating to Great Lakes pilotage. The Coast Guard also communicates with stakeholders through ad-hoc communications and operational coordination efforts.", "The federal government is facing challenges in managing its workforce effectively. There are skills gaps in various areas, including information technology and veterans' health care. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has implemented some recommendations to address these challenges but needs to take further action. The federal government's current employment policies are outdated and do not meet the needs of the modern workforce. There are structural challenges in the federal human capital system, such as the outdated General Schedule classification system and difficulties in recruiting and hiring. The government also faces the potential loss of institutional knowledge due to retirement eligibility. It is important for agencies to align their human capital strategies with current and future mission requirements. This includes identifying skills gaps and developing strategies to acquire and assign talent effectively. Agencies can also incentivize and compensate employees in ways that appeal to their desires for work-life balance and location flexibility. Engaging employees through effective performance management and training programs is crucial for productivity and retention. Overall, agencies should take action to strategically manage their workforce and address the challenges they face.", "The boards overseeing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are separate entities but have the same set of trustees. The boards issue two separate Trustees reports each year, providing information on the present and projected statuses of the trust funds. The reports include projections, assumptions, and estimates of the trust funds' costs and incomes. The reports include three projection scenarios: intermediate, low-cost, and high-cost alternatives. Officials from the SSA and CMS work together with trustees to develop assumptions and draft the reports. The working group, consisting of agency officials and trustees, oversees the report development process. The reports are finalized and approved at a spring board meeting and then issued to Congress. Public trustees, when confirmed, play a unique role in the report development process by representing the public and providing input and feedback. The Trustees reports have been late in recent years due to various reasons, including including late-breaking legislation or policy changes.", "SAMHSA and other organizations recognize recovery homes as an important step in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and recovery. Recovery homes are peer-run and peer-managed homes that provide supportive living environments for individuals recovering from SUD. The terms and definitions for recovery homes can vary, and these homes may offer different types of services and have various resident requirements.\n\nRecovery homes are typically not considered residential treatment centers and are not eligible to be licensed providers for the purposes of billing private insurance or public programs like Medicaid. Residents usually have to pay rent and other expenses themselves, while outpatient clinical SUD treatment may be covered by health insurance. Recovery homes may also encourage participation in mutual aid or self-help groups and require residents to undergo drug screening.\n\nThe prevalence of recovery homes nationwide is unknown due to incomplete data and the lack of a federal agency overseeing them. However, two national organizations, NARR and Oxford House, collect data on recovery homes. NARR has certified nearly 2,000 recovery homes with a capacity to house over 25,000 individuals, while Oxford House reported 2,542 houses in 45 states.\n\nSome states, including Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah, have taken steps to increase oversight of recovery homes. These states have established certification or licensure programs, which may be voluntary or mandatory. For example, Florida has a voluntary certification program for recovery homes and recovery home administrators. Massachusetts also has a voluntary certification program, while Utah has a mandatory licensure program. These oversight programs include requirements for training, documentation submission, and onsite inspections.\n\nFraud and abuse in the recovery home industry have been investigated by state agencies in several states. In Florida, extensive investigations uncovered fraud related to deceptive marketing practices, patient brokering, and excessive billing for urine drug testing. Law enforcement agencies charged over 40 individuals with patient brokering, resulting in convictions and fines or jail time. Massachusetts uncovered Medicaid fraud involving self-referrals and kickbacks related to urine drug testing. Ohio and Utah have also investigated instances of potential insurance fraud.\n\nIn response to these investigations, Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah have taken action to increase oversight of recovery homes. Their certification or licensure programs aim to ensure compliance with program standards through monitoring, inspections, and grievance processes. These programs have the authority to take action against homes that do not comply with standards, from issuing recommendations to revoking certificates or licenses.\n\nOther states, like Ohio and Texas, have not established state oversight programs but have provided resources and technical assistance to recovery homes. Ohio encourages recovery homes to seek certification through its NARR affiliate, while Texas is in the process of developing guidance for providers.\n\nOverall, recovery homes play a crucial role in SUD treatment and recovery, but more comprehensive data and oversight are needed to address issues of fraud and ensure quality care.", "Depots are government-operated installations that maintain and repair military equipment for the Department of Defense. There are 17 depots operated by the military services that perform maintenance on various vehicles and assets. These depots are part of a larger logistics enterprise within the DOD. To share best practices and lessons learned, depots use networking, working groups, and benchmarking. Networking occurs through personal contacts and conferences, with the DOD Maintenance Symposium being the most attended venue. Working groups and communities of practice allow depots to collaborate and share expertise on specific topics. Benchmarking involves depot officials visiting other depots to compare performance and find improvement ideas. However, there are communication challenges within the DOD that hinder the sharing of best practices and lessons learned. The lack of awareness of available venues and high staff turnover contribute to these challenges. Additionally, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has not maintained a comprehensive list of sharing venues and points of contact. While the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have initiatives and organizations to encourage knowledge sharing, the Army has not maintained its lessons learned organizations.", "Wireless broadband allows users to connect to the internet using spectrum to transmit data between the customer's location and the service provider's facility. This can be done through fixed wireless or mobile technologies. Spectrum frequency bands have different characteristics that affect the ability to cover distances, penetrate objects, and carry large amounts of information. Some frequency bands are licensed, meaning exclusive rights are given to transmit on specific bands, while others are unlicensed, allowing for shared frequencies without a license. Tribal entities have reported facing barriers in accessing licensed spectrum, such as high costs and difficulty participating in secondary market transactions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken some steps to increase tribal access to spectrum, including proposed rulemakings and training and outreach efforts. However, FCC has not consistently collected data on tribal access to spectrum or communicated important information to tribes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) made recommendations to FCC to collect data on tribal access, analyze the extent of unused spectrum over tribal lands, and make spectrum license holder information more accessible. FCC agreed with these recommendations and plans to take action.", "The establishment of Army Futures Command in January 2019 is reported to be a significant change for the US Army, aimed at providing unity of command, accountability, and modernization at a faster pace. The command is headquartered in Austin, Texas and is expected to be fully operational by July 2019. It will be responsible for overseeing the development of the Army's six modernization priorities, which include next generation combat vehicles, air and missile defense, and soldier lethality. The command is organized into three major components: Futures and Concepts Center, Combat Capabilities Development Command, and Combat Systems Directorate. The Army has also established eight cross-functional teams to expedite requirements and technology development for modernization. These teams are led by a general officer or senior civilian official and consist of subject matter experts from various fields. The Army has identified the need for additional resources and funding for near-term and long-term modernization efforts. However, the Army needs to improve its evaluation and cost estimation processes for these efforts. Additionally, the Army has a history of failed weapon system procurements and should focus on maturing technology before system development to reduce risk.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest U.S. government department and manages various business functions, including logistics, procurement, healthcare, and finance. It relies heavily on IT to support these functions. The DOD's IT budget is divided into four mission areas: enterprise information environment, business, warfighting, and intelligence. Within the business mission area, the budget is further divided into segments such as logistics/supply chain management, human resource management, and financial management. In 2016, the U.S. Code established requirements for DOD's management of its business system investments, including the issuance of policy and guidance, development and maintenance of a defense business enterprise architecture, establishment of a Defense Business Council, and obtaining approvals before system development. GAO has designated the DOD's business systems modernization efforts as high risk since 1995 and has made recommendations for improvement. As of June 2019, the DOD had implemented 15 of the 29 recommendations. While progress has been made, further actions are necessary to fully comply with the requirements and strengthen the management of defense business system investments.", "The auditors have found that the financial statements of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are presented fairly and in accordance with accounting principles. While there is room for improvement in internal controls, the auditors believe that IRS maintained effective controls over financial reporting. There were no significant compliance issues found with laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements. However, there were two significant deficiencies identified in IRS's internal controls over unpaid assessments and financial reporting systems. The auditors also noted ongoing financial management challenges related to safeguarding taxpayer receipts and preventing fraudulent refunds. Recommendations were made to address these deficiencies and challenges. The auditors did not evaluate all internal controls but focused on controls related to financial reporting. They also conducted limited procedures on required supplementary information and other information included with the financial statements. Compliance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements was also tested, with some limitations. Overall, the auditors believe that IRS's financial statements are fairly presented, but there are areas for improvement in internal controls.", "The nation's critical infrastructure, which includes banking institutions, telecommunications networks, and energy facilities, is susceptible to both unintentional and intentional threats, both cyber and physical. The private sector owns most of the critical infrastructure, so it is important for public and private sectors to work together to protect these assets. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has designated sector-specific agencies (SSAs) to lead, facilitate, and support security and resilience programs for different critical infrastructure sectors. The DHS has also developed a cybersecurity framework, which is a set of standards and procedures to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the adoption and use of the framework by entities within the critical infrastructure sectors. Most SSAs have not developed methods to determine the level and type of framework adoption, limiting their ability to assess the success of protection efforts. Some SSAs have taken steps to encourage the use of the framework, but more needs to be done to evaluate progress and focus resources on cyber risk mitigation.", "Human management practices, such as fire suppression, timber harvesting, and grazing, have altered the frequency and intensity of wildfires in forest and grassland ecosystems, reducing their resilience to fire. Accumulation of surface fuels and overstocking of forests with trees have increased the risk of intense and rapid-spreading fires. Changes in vegetation composition, including the invasion of non-native species, have further increased fire risks. Approximately 70,000 communities in the US are considered at risk from wildfires, and factors such as flammable vegetation, construction materials, and proximity of structures to vegetation affect the level of risk. The Forest Service, BLM, FWS, NPS, and BIA manage over 670 million acres of federal land, and over 100 million of those acres are at high risk from wildfire. These agencies allocate fuel reduction funds through regional offices to individual field units to implement projects. Mechanical treatments, prescribed burns, herbicides, and targeted grazing are used to reduce fuels, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Fuel reduction projects aim to reduce the intensity of future wildfires and protect communities and ecosystems. Examples of fuel reduction methods include prescribed burns and mechanical treatments performed by BIA on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona, prescribed burns and mechanical treatments at the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge in Mississippi, and a combination of mechanical treatments and prescribed burns in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico.", "Coastal communities face threats from coastal storms and flooding, including erosion and damage from waves, wind, and storm surges. Rising sea levels and development along coastlines can exacerbate these risks. The US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructs projects to reduce these risks using both hard structures, such as revetments and seawalls, and natural infrastructure, such as mangroves and coral reefs. Natural infrastructure has the potential to provide additional benefits, such as enhancing fisheries and creating recreational opportunities. The Corps follows a planning process outlined in the Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies, considering both costs and benefits, including damage reduction benefits and incidental recreational benefits. However, the Corps does not include all incidental benefits, such as environmental and social benefits, in its economic analysis. In some cases, the Corps may deviate from its planning process to select a project alternative that does not meet the maximum net benefits requirement, but aligns with local priorities and environmental concerns.", "The United States tracks deaths from all causes through a multi-step registration process. A death certificate is filed with the state, which includes demographic information and cause of death. The information is verified by the local registrar and transferred to the state vital registration office. CDC receives electronic death certificate information from state vital records offices. In 2003, a pregnancy checkbox was added to the death certificate, but not all states included it until 2019. CDC collects maternal mortality data from two surveillance systems, NVSS and PMSS. NVSS uses death certificate information to compile vital statistics files, but due to concerns about the accuracy of the pregnancy checkbox, CDC has not published NVSS statistics on maternal mortality since 2007. PMSS is exclusively focused on pregnancy-related deaths and collects data by linking death certificates to birth or fetal death certificates. PMSS data are considered the most reliable source for national data on pregnancy-related deaths. CDC also developed the MMRIA system, which collects and reviews data from various sources to determine preventability and contributing factors to pregnancy-related deaths. CDC recently took steps to improve the accuracy and timeliness of PMSS data by gaining direct access to vital records through a pilot project. PMSS and MMRIA data are not published annually, but CDC provides aggregate information periodically. CDC also identifies racial and age disparities in pregnancy-related deaths, as well as the leading causes of death, which vary by race/ethnicity and age. Most pregnancy-related deaths occur within 42 days of delivery or the end of pregnancy. Understanding the timing of these deaths is important for intervention strategies.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines Fixed Base Operators (FBOs) as businesses that have permission from airports to provide various aeronautical services such as fueling, hangars, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and more. FBOs can also manage parking ramps for transient aircraft. These services are primarily aimed at general aviation pilots but can also support commercial flights. The number of FBOs has declined in recent years due to a drop in general aviation activity and the introduction of fuel-efficient aircraft and decision-making software. While FAA ensures fair access to airport facilities, it does not regulate FBO prices. FBOs have the responsibility to make their services available and price them without discrimination. There have been calls for increased price transparency in the FBO industry, and some FBOs have started posting fees online. The prices of FBO services are influenced by factors such as airport leases, infrastructure investment, fuel transportation costs, labor costs, state taxes, and security requirements. Demand for FBO services, influenced by factors like airport congestion, seasonal traffic, and location, also affects pricing. The extent of market competition in FBO services can also influence prices. While most airports have only one FBO, competition from FBOs at nearby airports can affect pricing. Pilots often compare fuel prices and service fees at different FBOs and airports to make informed decisions.", "The Food and Nutrition Service at USDA is responsible for overseeing the school meals programs at the federal level and issuing regulations and guidance. The programs are administered at the state level by designated state agencies. Students can be certified to receive free or reduced-price meals through a household application or direct certification. Schools can also serve meals at no charge to all students through the community eligibility provision. USDA and state agencies conduct oversight of the programs through management evaluations and administrative reviews. USDA estimates improper payments for the programs through the APEC study, conducted every 5 years. USDA has reported various actions to lower improper payments, but the effect of these actions is currently unknown. USDA changed what it considers to be an improper payment in fiscal year 2018 reporting, resulting in a decrease in estimated improper payment error rates. USDA has not assessed fraud risks in the school meals programs and does not have a specific process for conducting fraud risk assessments. USDA\u2019s efforts to assess overall program integrity risks are not designed to identify or address fraud risks.", "The Bureau of the Census conducts an address canvassing operation to update its address list and maps for the decennial census. This operation is critical for ensuring an accurate count of the population and proper congressional apportionment and redistricting. The bureau's approach for the 2020 Census involved using satellite imagery to identify areas with housing changes and conducting in-field address canvassing for unresolved areas. Field staff used laptops to verify addresses and collect data on the ground. The operation was completed on time and under budget, with higher productivity rates than expected. However, some listers did not consistently follow procedures, potentially leading to errors in the address file. The Bureau implemented a quality control component to detect and correct deficient work. Preliminary results show that about 4.3 percent of addresses failed the quality control review. The Bureau has ongoing studies to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the address canvassing operation. Despite hiring delays and attrition, the operation was completed on schedule, but unplanned costs were incurred due to travel expenses. These hiring challenges are an early warning for potential issues during nonresponse follow-up for the census. The Bureau has implemented changes to its hiring and onboarding processes to address these challenges.", "The Air Force requires pilots to complete various phases of training before they are considered mission ready. This includes attending initial flight training and specialized undergraduate pilot training for traditional aircraft. Once assigned to a specific aircraft, pilots go through three stages of training: Initial Qualification Training, Mission Qualification Training, and Continuation Training. The Ready Aircrew Program establishes the minimum number of live training events and simulator missions that aircrews must complete to maintain mission readiness. A recent RAND report reviewed and assessed the effectiveness of the Ready Aircrew Program and made nine recommendations for improved management of training requirements. The Air Force concurred with some of the recommendations and partially concurred with others, but it lacks the resources to implement them. The Air Force has taken some actions to address the recommendations but has not fully implemented them. The current Air Force actions may not fully address prior recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO continues to believe that the recommendations should be implemented to ensure effective training for aircrews. The Department of Defense (DOD) has stated that it is addressing training infrastructure and aircrew proficiency through two initiatives: the Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan and efforts to align training events with current and evolving threats. However, these plans are still under development and further details are needed to assess their potential impact. The GAO will continue to analyze DOD efforts to address their recommendations.", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created in 1968 to reduce the costs of providing federal flood assistance. NFIP has four key elements: identifying and mapping flood hazards, floodplain management, flood insurance, and incentivizing flood-risk reduction. Property owners in participating communities can purchase flood insurance, and the community must enforce NFIP regulations. NFIP provides different coverage levels and premium rates based on property characteristics and location. The program also offers grants and premium discounts for flood-risk reduction. FEMA maps flood hazard zones on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which communities must adopt. FIRMs set insurance premium rates and minimum floodplain management standards. As of May 2020, over 22,000 communities participate in NFIP. FEMA supports community-level flood mitigation activities through its Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) grant programs. These activities include hazard mitigation planning, floodplain management regulations, and the use of flood control structures. Flood insurance premium rates are discounted for communities that exceed NFIP requirements. At the individual level, mitigation options include property acquisition (buyouts), elevation, relocation, and floodproofing. FEMA administers three HMA grant programs: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA). The programs fund various mitigation projects based on state or tribal priorities. Eligible activities differ for each program. HMGP is based on the amount of disaster assistance a state or territory receives, while PDM and FMA receive annual appropriations. Funding levels for the programs vary. HMGP is the largest, followed by PDM and FMA. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program will replace PDM in fiscal year 2020. HMA funding also varies by state, with Louisiana receiving the most funding.", "National Science Foundation (NSF) major facilities projects go through five stages: development, design, construction, operations, and divestment. Each project is sponsored by an office within one of NSF's research directorates, which assesses the scientific merit of the project and proposes it for funding. The design stage includes conceptual, preliminary, and final design phases, where the project's details are refined. The construction stage begins when NSF awards contracts for the acquisition or construction of the research infrastructure. Operations involve the day-to-day work necessary to operate and maintain the facility, and divestment may include transferring the infrastructure to another entity or decommissioning it. NSF uses external panels of experts to review projects at various points during their life cycles. The total project cost for construction of major facilities projects is based on estimates developed during the design phase, but final costs are only known once construction is complete. Currently, NSF is continuing construction on three major facilities projects with no changes to their authorized costs or completion dates. They have also approved a new construction project and completed one.", "Traditionally, federal surface-transportation funding has been distributed through formula grant programs, but discretionary grant programs like INFRA offer another approach. These programs allow Congress or federal agencies to establish desired goals and outcomes and review grant applications against selection criteria to choose projects for funding. INFRA funding is available to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as multistate or multijurisdictional groups. Notable requirements for INFRA funding include reserved funds for small and rural projects, limitations on funding for freight or other intermodal projects, and the need to meet certain statutory requirements. In the evaluation process for INFRA projects, applications go through multiple phases of review by technical and senior management teams, with a focus on merit criteria. The Secretary considers the project's alignment with goals, cost-effectiveness, and other factors when selecting projects for funding. The process includes steps to ensure consistency and transparency, such as the Quality Control and Oversight Team and communication with unsuccessful applicants. In the fiscal year 2019 INFRA funding cycle, DOT awarded approximately $1.54 billion to 26 projects, with a focus on rural and highway projects. DOT made improvements to the evaluation process based on previous recommendations, but there were still some issues with following up with applicants and determining eligibility for large projects. Overall, the INFRA program aims to allocate federal funds to transportation projects of national or regional significance in a fair and accountable manner.", "The evolving nature of individual identity theft (IDT) refund fraud and the challenges the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) faces in keeping up with fraudsters' tactics have been highlighted in prior work. The complexity of the business tax environment further compounds these challenges. Businesses are required to file different forms for each type of tax they pay, and they may file forms to claim various tax credits. This complexity makes it more challenging to detect, research, and resolve potential business IDT cases compared to individual cases. Fraudsters may be attracted to the potential large payout associated with business tax refunds, which are significantly higher than individual tax refunds. Business IDT may also lead to other types of tax fraud, such as using stolen employer identification numbers (EINs) and business information to support individual income tax refund schemes. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 created requirements for agencies to establish financial and administrative controls for managing fraud risks. The Fraud Risk Framework provides key components and leading practices for agencies to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based way. The IRS uses computerized checks and fraud filters to screen incoming tax returns for known or suspected characteristics of fraud. From January 2017 to August 2019, fraud filters stopped about 188,500 incoming business returns as potential IDT, claiming $47.6 billion in refunds. Out of these, about 4% were confirmed business IDT cases claiming $384 million in fraudulent refunds. IRS has also established more advanced fraud detection efforts through the Return Review Program (RRP) and collaborates with states and industry partners. IRS initiated a pilot project with the Alabama Department of Labor to help detect and prevent business IDT. One component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for agencies to create an organizational culture conducive to combating fraud. IRS leadership has demonstrated commitment to identifying and combating overall IDT refund fraud. Four IRS entities have responsibility for detecting, preventing, and resolving business IDT, but IRS has not designated a lead entity to design and oversee business IDT fraud risk management activities across the agency. IRS officials stated that the business IDT efforts are relatively new and that they may not require additional oversight because they are smaller in volume and staff compared to individual IDT efforts. However, the absence of a designated entity may contribute to issues related to identifying and assessing business IDT fraud risks and delays in resolving cases. The Fraud Risk Framework's leading practices provide flexibility in structuring the designated entity to best support an agency's fraud risk management efforts. Without a designated entity, it is not clear which entity is responsible for assessing business IDT risks and documenting the results.", "Mass transit rail operators are primarily responsible for securing their own systems, unlike aviation where the TSA handles screening. The TSA partners with mass transit operators to conduct vulnerability assessments, share intelligence information, and mitigate security risks. Mass transit systems are challenging to secure due to their design and the large number of passengers. Common security measures include public awareness announcements, canine teams, access controls, station design, and video surveillance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) coordinates R&D efforts to improve the security of public transportation systems. DHS, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and the TSA have different roles in this process. S&T undertakes R&D projects to address capability gaps identified through DHS's integrated product team process. The TSA sponsors testing of commercially available security technologies for mass transit, and they have a program that places these technologies in operational environments for testing. Mass transit operators work with the TSA to test and implement technology solutions. The S&T Explosives Division has a program called Surface Transportation Explosive Threat Detection (STETD) focused on developing technologies to address the threat of IEDs in mass transit security. The program consists of four separate technologies in different stages of development. However, funding for mass transit R&D has decreased in recent years, causing delays in the development of these technologies. Milestones used to track progress on the STETD program do not fully adhere to DHS guidance.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced challenges in acquiring and managing IT, resulting in failures and inefficiencies. In 2014, federal IT acquisition reform provisions were enacted to improve IT management practices. Agile software development, which emphasizes rapid delivery of software and iterative development, has been identified as a valuable tool for mitigating schedule and budget risks. In 2016, DHS announced an effort to pilot Agile development methodologies, resulting in five pilot programs. DHS issued an Agile instruction in 2017, making it the preferred approach for IT projects. However, there have been programmatic and technical challenges in implementing Agile. DHS has made progress in implementing leading practices, but there are areas where improvement is needed. These areas include ensuring senior stakeholders understand Agile, establishing incentives for Agile teams, and providing training for all program staff. DHS has fully implemented some leading practices in terms of agency activities and technical environments, but there are still improvements to be made in program processes and project planning controls.", "Civil aviation, particularly flights to the United States, remains a target for terrorist activity. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued several reports on the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) foreign airport and air carrier inspection programs, Cuban aviation security, TSA's process for reviewing security directives and emergency amendments, public area security, insider threats at airports, screening rule changes, resource allocation for surface transportation programs, and roles and responsibilities for pipeline security. The GAO has made recommendations for improvement in various areas, including better data tracking, enhanced coordination with industry stakeholders, and the development of strategic plans. TSA has agreed with many of the recommendations and plans to take appropriate action.", "The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) System consists of 11 banks located in different districts across the United States. These banks are cooperatively owned by various financial institutions. The Office of Finance, which is part of the FHLBank System, handles the fiscal responsibilities for all the banks. The FHLBanks obtain funding by issuing debt, which they use to provide loans to their member institutions. They also invest in securities to generate additional income. They rely on broker-dealers to conduct their debt transactions and are compensated through fees. The Office of Finance approves these broker-dealers based on their track record and eligibility criteria. The FHLBanks are also required to have diversity programs and report on their diversity efforts, including the representation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) conducts examinations of the FHLBanks, which includes reviewing their diversity and inclusion efforts. Representation of women and minorities in senior management positions across the FHLBanks has increased slightly from 2011 to 2017. However, there is still room for improvement in increasing diversity at the board level and in the overall workforce. The FHLBanks face challenges in recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The representation of women and minorities is higher in first- and mid-level management positions compared to senior management. When compared to the broader financial services industry, the FHLBanks have similar representation of women, minorities, and women and minorities combined in senior management. However, there is more variability among individual FHLBanks compared to the industry in their respective districts. Overall, the FHLBanks have lower representation of women in their workforce compared to the financial services industry. Minorities are similar in representation. The FHLBank System should continue to focus on improving diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels of the organization.", "The economic effects of climate change in the United States are significant and will likely increase over time, according to national-scale studies and experts. These effects can be unevenly distributed across sectors and regions, with the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains regions expected to experience greater combined economic effects. The federal government faces fiscal exposure in several areas, including disaster aid, federal insurance for property and crops, and operation and management of federal property and lands. The government's investments in resilience to climate change have been limited, but enhancing resilience can reduce fiscal exposure. There is a need for strategic planning and coordination of federal efforts to address climate risks and prioritize projects. Implementing recommendations to reduce fiscal exposure could help mitigate the impacts of climate change.", "The Department of Transportation's (DOT) top priority is to reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries. This can be achieved through addressing unsafe driver behaviors and improving road infrastructure. The DOT provides grant funding to states through NHTSA and FHWA to tackle these issues. NHTSA provides funding to improve driver behavior, such as seatbelt use and reducing impaired driving. FHWA provides funding for infrastructure projects like rumble strips and safety audits. States have flexibility in setting targets for reducing fatalities and injuries based on state-specific factors. However, many states have struggled to meet these targets due to factors like population increases, economic conditions, and changes in state laws. States are required to submit annual plans and reports to establish targets and show their progress in achieving them. NHTSA relies on states to collect and report fatality and serious injury data. However, data collection and validation can take up to 24 months. From 2014 to 2017, many states did not achieve their targets for reducing fatalities, and overall fatalities increased nationwide. Achieving targets does not necessarily reflect whether fatalities have decreased. States that set increasing targets were more likely to achieve them than states that set decreasing targets. States are required to assess their progress in their annual plans and reports, but many states have not provided these assessments. NHTSA does not communicate to the public and stakeholders about whether states eventually achieve their targets. NHTSA is required to report on state performance on its website, but it does not specifically report on whether targets are met.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates an extensive health care delivery system to provide medical care, benefits, and support to veterans and their families. The VA consists of three major components: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which provides health care services; the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which provides various benefits to veterans; and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), which provides burial and memorial benefits. The VA heavily relies on information technology (IT) to support its operations and maintain electronic health records for veterans. The VA has been designated as a high-risk area for the federal government due to IT challenges, including outdated systems and a lack of interoperability. The VA has made efforts to modernize its IT infrastructure, including the planned acquisition of an electronic health record system from the Department of Defense. The VA's IT management is overseen by the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), which is responsible for strategy, policy, and managing IT resources. The VA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes funding for OI&T and the electronic health record system. The VA has also faced challenges in implementing the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and improving cybersecurity. The VA has made limited progress in addressing IT management challenges for critical initiatives such as VistA, the Family Caregiver Program, and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS). The VA has pursued multiple efforts over the years to modernize VistA, its health information system, but has faced governance and implementation challenges.", "The VHA's Family Caregiver Program provides support and services to family caregivers of post-9/11 veterans with serious injuries. Caregivers receive a monthly stipend, training, and other support services. Eligibility requires the veteran to have a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty after September 11, 2001. Caregivers must meet certain requirements, including being competent to care for the veteran and completing required training. The program is administered by the Caregiver Support Program office, and a web-based system called CAT is used to exchange information. However, VA has faced difficulties in implementing a replacement system for CAT. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 required VA to implement an IT system by October 2018, but the department has not been successful in its efforts. VA is now working on a third effort to acquire a replacement system called CARMA, but there is currently no completion date. It is recommended that VA apply critical success factors to enhance the likelihood of a successful replacement IT system.", "Private employers subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and federal contractors must submit data to the EEOC on the racial/ethnic and gender characteristics of employees by occupations for various industries, including financial services. Representation of minorities in managerial positions in the financial services industry increased from 2007 to 2015, with the largest gains seen among Asians. Representation of minorities also increased at different levels of management, with the largest increase among first- and mid-level managers. Representation of women in management positions remained generally unchanged. Management-level diversity varied across sectors within the financial services industry, with representation of minorities being highest in banks and other credit institutions. Representation of women varied by sector, with the insurance sector having the highest proportion of women in management positions. Representation of minorities in overall management positions increased as firm size increased, while the representation of women in management remained the same across firm sizes. Recruitment and retention of diverse talent in the financial services industry face challenges such as negative perceptions of the industry and a lack of awareness of career paths. Practices to improve recruitment and retention include recruiting students from diverse academic disciplines and offering programs to increase awareness of careers in financial services. Practices to improve retention include establishing management-level accountability for diversity goals and analyzing demographic data to understand progress on workforce diversity.", "The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) are two independent countries located southwest of Hawaii. They have a history of relations with the United States dating back to World War II, and in 1986, the United States entered into a compact of free association with both countries. This compact provided economic assistance, defense rights, and migration opportunities for citizens of the FSM and RMI. In 2003, amended compacts were approved that established financial assistance to be given to the two countries from 2004 to 2023, with decreasing base amounts and partial inflation adjustments. These financial assistance grants, known as compact sector grants, support six core sectors including education and health. The compacts also established trust funds to be managed by committees consisting of representatives from the United States and the respective country, with the United States holding the majority of votes. The trust funds consist of three accounts and are intended to provide disbursements from 2024 onward. However, there is a risk that the funds may provide no disbursements or reduced disbursements in some years. The FSM and RMI also receive other U.S. grants, programs, and services, some of which end in 2023. After 2023, the countries will need to bear additional costs to provide these services themselves.", "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) carries out its missions at eight sites managed by seven M&O contractors. These sites include three national security laboratories, four nuclear weapons production plants, and the Nevada National Security Site. NNSA is organized into program offices that oversee various programs, and it is subject to different cost accounting requirements than its contractors. The contractors use indirect cost pools to distribute costs to programs, but different contractors may allocate similar costs differently. NNSA and its program offices have developed separate systems to track and compare costs, as the contractors' financial systems do not provide detailed information. To address this issue, NNSA is implementing common financial reporting by collecting contractors' financial data in a common reporting framework using an NNSA-wide data reporting and analysis tool called CostEX. NNSA has made progress in implementing common financial reporting but faces challenges in fully implementing the effort.", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for regulating communications in the United States. This includes overseeing radio, television, cable, and internet services. The FCC issues licenses for broadcast TV and radio, regulates the use of radio spectrum, investigates complaints and violations, and addresses issues related to public safety and emergency management. The FCC relies on computer systems and information security measures to carry out its operations. In May 2017, the FCC experienced a disruption in its system due to a surge in comments during a public comment period. In response, the FCC took actions such as conducting internal assessments, deploying additional virtual hardware, optimizing system software, and updating incident response policies. However, a review found that the FCC had not consistently implemented the necessary cybersecurity measures to protect its systems and information. Deficiencies were found in all five core security functions outlined by the NIST cybersecurity framework. Specifically, deficiencies were identified in identifying risk, protecting systems, detecting cybersecurity events, responding to events, and recovering system operations. The FCC had not reviewed or updated the risk assessment for one system for over 22 months and continued to operate two systems on expired authorizations. These actions put sensitive information at risk. After the report, the FCC updated the risk assessment for the system and granted a full authorization to operate for one system, with plans to grant authorization for the other system in 2020.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a policy to ensure that eligible military personnel and their families have access to affordable and quality housing. The DOD uses a privatized housing model, where private developers are responsible for managing and maintaining military housing. Each military department leases land to private developers for 50-year terms and the developer is responsible for renovating and constructing new housing. The DOD delegates oversight responsibilities to the military departments, but there are limitations in their oversight efforts. Specifically, the oversight of the physical condition of housing is limited, performance metrics do not accurately reflect the condition of housing, there is a lack of reliable data on housing conditions, and reports on resident satisfaction are inconsistent. The military departments conduct daily oversight of management and operations, but the scope and implementation of these activities vary. They also conduct periodic reviews of compliance with business agreements, but these reviews have been narrow in assessing the physical condition of housing units. The military departments use performance metrics to monitor private partner performance, but these metrics do not provide meaningful information on the condition of the housing units. Additionally, data on the condition of housing units are not captured reliably or consistently for ongoing monitoring. Without updates to guidance and the establishment of consistent oversight activities and metrics, there is a risk that private partners may not provide adequate quality housing.", "Executive retirement plans are offered by companies to supplement benefits provided by qualified retirement plans or as an alternative to qualified retirement plans. These plans allow select managers or highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of compensation earned in one year to be paid in a future year, generally at or after retirement. Executive retirement plans have certain advantages over qualified retirement plans, as they are not subject to certain statutory limits, such as limits on benefits received, contributions made, or compensation used to determine benefits and contributions.\n\nExecutive retirement plans can be structured as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans base executives' benefits on a plan account balance, which is determined by the performance of selected market indices or investment options. Defined benefit plans, on the other hand, calculate executives' benefits based on a formula that considers salary and years of employment.\n\nThese plans are exempt from many of the protections provided by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) because of the recognition that certain individuals, due to their position or compensation level, have the ability to negotiate the design and operation of their deferred compensation plans. The Department of Labor (DOL) permits administrators of executive retirement plans to submit a simplified filing statement to satisfy reporting requirements. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provides preferential tax treatment to qualified retirement plans, but executive retirement plans do not qualify for the same benefits. Instead, executives benefit from tax deferral as long as the plan is considered \"unfunded and unsecured\" and their rights are no greater than those of general unsecured creditors in the event of company bankruptcy or insolvency.\n\nExecutive retirement plans provide several advantages to executives, including tax substitution of investment earnings, additional company compensation for investment earnings and personal income taxes, and allowable distributions during working years. These advantages can help reduce potential tax liability and increase retirement savings for executives.\n\nAccording to analysis, the majority of the largest U.S. public companies offer executive retirement plans to top executives, with accumulated plan benefits totaling around $13 billion in 2017. The average accumulated plan benefit for top executives at large companies is higher than that of smaller companies. CEOs generally accumulate more plan benefits than other top executives. Plan benefits are concentrated among a subset of executives based on job title, company contributions, and plan type.\n\nCompanies offering executive retirement plans can defer their tax deductions for plan contributions until executives are taxed on those benefits. Other federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), also have roles related to executive retirement plans.\n\nIn summary, executive retirement plans offer additional retirement benefits to select managers or highly compensated employees. These plans have certain advantages over qualified retirement plans and are subject to different tax treatment. The accumulated plan benefits are concentrated among a subset of top executives, and companies can enjoy tax advantages through tax substitution of investment earnings.", "Key requirements related to improper payments during the audit period were outlined in the Information and Privacy Interagency Agreement (IPIA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-18-20, and OMB Circular A-136. These requirements include conducting risk assessments, developing improper payment estimates, analyzing root causes of improper payments, developing corrective actions, and reporting on the results. Agencies are responsible for maintaining documentation to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. Additionally, agencies must implement payment recapture audits to recover any federal dollars lost due to improper payments, unless legislation prevents such recovery. The Department of Energy (DOE) oversees contractor and other activities and assists in implementing improper payment reporting requirements. However, DOE's reporting of improper payments may be inaccurate or incomplete due to errors in identifying, tracking, and reporting improper payments. Some payment reporting sites did not correctly report improper payments, resulting in understated or overstated amounts. DOE should improve its procedures for tracking and reporting improper payments to ensure accurate and complete reporting.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been providing online services to taxpayers since the 1990s. These services have expanded over time and now include features such as checking the status of a refund, setting up payment plans, and requesting tax transcripts. In addition to online services, the IRS website also offers static web pages with information on various topics, as well as online calculators for tax planning purposes. The IRS website received over 600 million visits in fiscal year 2018. The IRS is working on improving its online services through its Office of Online Services (OLS) and Information Technology division. The agency is also subject to requirements set by Congress and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA Act), which emphasize the importance of improving online services. However, the IRS is restricted from offering its own online filing services by an agreement with a consortium of tax preparation companies known as Free File, Inc. The income limit for taxpayers to use these services has evolved over time and for the 2020 filing season, taxpayers must have an income below $69,000 to be eligible. The IRS offers 10 online services for individual taxpayers, with the most popular being \"Where's My Refund?\" In comparison to revenue agencies in other countries and some state revenue agencies, the IRS lags behind in terms of integrating services into a single online account and offering electronic filing directly on their website. The IRS does collect feedback from users of its website, but it does not specifically measure the satisfaction or effectiveness of individual online services. The IRS is also researching the burden that taxpayers face in complying with their tax obligations, but the impact of expanding online services on this burden has not been assessed.", "The character of warfare is changing, with every operating domain likely to be contested by great-power competitors. The Army is developing a multi-domain operations concept to confront these adversaries in contested environments. This concept involves presenting adversaries with multiple challenges through the combining of capabilities across different domains. The Army is updating its doctrine, organizations, and training to develop a more lethal and capable force by 2028. This includes updating the Army's field manual, creating new organizations focused on cyber and electronic warfare, and revising training to focus on operations in contested electronic warfare, cyber, and space environments. The Army is also creating new cyber and electronic warfare units, although challenges remain in terms of staffing and equipping these units.", "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) recommends that all veterans who receive VHA services be screened for HIV as part of routine medical care, regardless of their perceived risk. The goal is to diagnose veterans with HIV as early as possible, provide them with proper care, and prevent the spread of the virus. VHA has established requirements for providers in VAMCs (Veterans Affairs Medical Centers) to achieve early diagnoses and prompt linkage to HIV care. HIV screening involves three stages: offering HIV tests to veterans, communicating test results to veterans, and linking HIV-positive veterans to care.\n\nVHA utilizes information technology solutions, such as clinical reminders, to facilitate the offering of HIV tests to veterans. Clinical reminders prompt providers to offer HIV tests to veterans who have not been tested or who are at higher risk for acquiring HIV. Providers are required to obtain verbal consent from veterans to be tested, and this can be documented through clinical reminders. Providers also order the most current CDC-recommended HIV test, and laboratories follow the CDC-recommended testing algorithm.\n\nVAMCs use various strategies to communicate test results to veterans, including phone calls, face-to-face visits, letters, and electronic health records. Protocols are in place to prevent delays in communicating positive test results, and in cases where the ordering provider is unavailable, designated staff or VAMC leadership communicate the results. HIV-positive veterans may be referred to community care for treatment, and telehealth options are available for those who cannot be seen in person.\n\nVHA monitors the offering of HIV tests through data collection and dissemination, allowing VAMCs to track their testing rates and compare them to other facilities. VHA also collects data on the offering of HIV tests to veterans who are prescribed preventive medication known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, VHA does not currently monitor the timeliness of communicating HIV test results or the linkage of HIV-positive veterans to care. VAMCs may use data on the offering of HIV tests to support local efforts to improve screening.\n\nVHA has made improvements to its policy on obtaining verbal consent for HIV testing, no longer requiring documentation of consent. VHA recently reviewed VAMC laboratory protocols to ensure compliance with CDC recommendations, and all VAMCs were found to be following the recommended testing technologies. Data on the timeliness of communicating test results are published quarterly, but HIV lead clinicians may not be aware they have access to this information.\n\nOverall, VHA has implemented strategies and policies to ensure the early diagnosis, care, and prevention of HIV in veterans, with the use of information technology solutions and data monitoring to support these efforts.", "Federal agencies can provide disaster assistance when state and local governments are unable to effectively respond and recover from a disaster. The President can declare a major disaster in response to a request by a governor or tribal government. The Small Business Administration (SBA) can also issue physical disaster declarations for events that do not qualify as major disasters. The SBA administers disaster assistance programs along with FEMA and other federal agencies. The SBA provides direct loans to help businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters repair or replace property damaged in a declared disaster. The SBA has various offices and centers that handle different aspects of the disaster loan program. The SBA also works with resource partners like SBDCs to provide assistance to businesses. The SBA offers two types of direct disaster loans: physical disaster loans for rebuilding and replacing damaged property, and economic injury disaster loans to meet working capital needs for businesses affected by a disaster. The SBA has procedures in place for processing and approving disaster loan applications, including inspections and eligibility determinations. The agency also conducts long-term disaster planning, participates in disaster simulations, maintains an outreach plan, and creates action plans for specific disasters. However, the agency's major planning documentation lacks an in-depth discussion of risks and does not include risk mitigation techniques. The action plans created for specific disasters varied in detail and did not always discuss resource requirements. The SBA participates in external and internal disaster simulations to prepare for disaster response. The agency has a staffing strategy for disaster response and uses a model to forecast staffing needs. However, the SBA encountered challenges in hiring and training staff during the response to the 2017 hurricanes. Overall, the SBA could improve its disaster planning and response by identifying and addressing risks, providing guidance for action plans, and improving its hiring and training processes.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on commercial industry transportation service providers (TSPs) to move and store servicemembers' household goods. However, there has been a decline in servicemember satisfaction during the peak moving season. DOD has conducted studies and implemented initiatives to address these issues, including the development of a Global Household Goods Contract. This contract is intended to improve servicemember satisfaction and includes initiatives such as increasing the use of shipping containers, replacing the current Defense Personal Property System with a new mobile-friendly platform, and increasing liability limits for damaged or lost shipments. However, there are concerns regarding the cost implications and manpower requirements of the contract. Additionally, TRANSCOM has developed performance metrics for the Global Household Goods Contract, but has not developed metrics for other activities that government personnel will continue to perform.", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is facing financial challenges and is seeking to improve its financial condition by offering innovative products and services. However, current statutory restrictions limit the range of innovations USPS can offer, such as shipping alcoholic beverages and providing services to state, local, and tribal governments. USPS has established policies and handbooks for piloting key innovations, which involve the coordination of cross-functional teams to design, evaluate, and implement the pilots. USPS has piloted various innovations, including same-day delivery, grocery delivery, Informed Delivery, and keyless parcel lockers. However, USPS's policies for pilot design and evaluation do not fully reflect leading practices, such as establishing measurable objectives and performance measures, consistently documenting lessons learned, and drawing conclusions about scalability based on pilot results. By addressing these gaps in its policies and improving its pilot design and evaluation processes, USPS can better assess the effectiveness and potential scalability of its innovations.", "Ballistic missiles are becoming increasingly important weapons for foreign adversaries, as they continue to proliferate and show advances in mobility, reliability, accuracy, and range. The defense intelligence community has seen a dramatic increase in ballistic missile capabilities over the last decade, with over 20 countries expected to pursue further expansions in their quantities and capabilities. Ballistic missile threats are categorized by their range, and different missiles have different configurations and capabilities. Adversaries may also employ countermeasures and tactics to confuse missile defense systems, such as using decoys or launching multiple missiles simultaneously. Hypersonic missiles, which can travel at high speeds, perform maneuvers, and remain in the atmosphere for longer durations, pose a challenge for missile defense systems. The defense intelligence community plays a crucial role in producing threat assessments and providing advice on threat-related issues for missile defense systems. However, challenges such as an upsurge in threat missile activity, recent revisions to threat assessment processes, and constrained manpower and resources have impacted the availability and timeliness of threat assessments for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). These challenges could result in setbacks and increased risks for MDA's weapon system design, development, and testing. MDA has opportunities to mitigate these challenges by prioritizing its threat assessment requests and working with the defense intelligence community to secure additional resources and support.", "As of May 2019, there are 573 Indian tribes recognized by the federal government as independent political communities with powers of sovereignty and self-government. These tribes vary in culture, language, population size, land base, location, and economic status. Around 21 percent of American Indians live on tribal lands, which include various land types. The federal government holds about 46 million acres in trust for tribes and more than 10 million acres in trust for individual Indians. Some tribes also have reservations. In terms of agriculture, about 75 percent of farms and ranches on selected Indian reservations are operated by American Indian or Alaska Native producers, who hold 61 percent of total farm and ranch acreage. However, the market value of agricultural products sold from Indian-operated farms and ranches is significantly lower than that of non-Indian operated operations. Native American farmers and ranchers have previously settled a class action lawsuit against the USDA for discrimination in farm loan programs, resulting in the establishment of the Native American Agriculture Fund to provide assistance and support. Agricultural loans are categorized as short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term loans, and are primarily provided by Farm Credit System (FCS) and commercial banks. FCS is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) and primarily lends money through its lending associations. However, there is limited commercial lending on tribal lands due to difficulties in using tribal lands as collateral. Federal laws and constraints prohibit lenders from obtaining ownership interest in tribal trust and restricted fee lands, and fractionation of individual trust and restricted fee lands makes it difficult to obtain consent from all owners for leases and mortgages. These barriers make it challenging for tribes and tribal members to access different types of agricultural loans, particularly long-term loans that require real estate as collateral.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to federal managers on how to improve accountability and effectiveness of federal programs through risk management. OMB Circular No. A-123, updated in July 2016, establishes management responsibilities for enterprise risk management (ERM) in federal agencies. This includes the consideration of risks across the entire organization and their potential impact on the agency's goals and objectives. The Air Force, as part of the Department of Defense (DOD), is required to identify and manage risks and establish an effective system of internal control. However, the Air Force has struggled with material weaknesses in internal control, leading to its inability to pass a financial statement audit. The Air Force is in the early stages of implementing ERM and plans to fully incorporate it into its management practices by fiscal year 2023. Currently, the Air Force lacks a thorough and integrated ERM governance structure to manage risks associated with material weaknesses. The Air Force's internal control assessment process does not adequately assess all required elements of internal control, particularly in areas with the greatest risk. The process also lacks test plans and management validation of results. The Air Force uses unit managers' supporting statements of assurance to develop the overall annual Statement of Assurance, but this process does not effectively evaluate the effectiveness of internal control. The Air Force did not have a uniform testing process in place to support its assessment of internal control. Overall, the Air Force needs to improve its ERM and internal control practices to reduce risks and improve mission delivery.", "The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) requires executive branch agencies to take steps to address improper payments. These steps include reviewing programs and activities for susceptibility to improper payments, developing estimates for programs identified as susceptible, analyzing root causes of improper payments, and reporting on their efforts. Agencies are also required to report on the causes of improper payments, actions taken to correct them, and reduction targets approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB provides guidance to agencies on implementing IPIA requirements, including the need to categorize improper payments by root cause. Agencies are directed to develop corrective action plans and measure their effectiveness annually. The text provides summaries of improper payment estimates and root causes for various federal programs, including SNAP, Direct Loans, Pell Grants, CHIP, EITC, Prosthetic and Sensory Aids, OASDI, and SSI. The text also explains the processes used by agencies to identify root causes and develop corrective actions for improper payments.\n", "The federal government relies on commercial communications networks to obtain various services, including video conferencing, telephone calls, email, text messages, and file transfers. Federal agencies also rely on call centers to handle public inquiries on government programs and services. Agencies report information about these contracts and their obligations in the federal government's primary database for contract information. The federal government has developed other contract reporting systems to collect contracting information related to subcontracting. Federal telecommunications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment and products, as well as services. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring information security controls are put in place. Various federal laws exist to protect workers, establishing requirements related to wages, hours worked, and worker safety and health. Federal contractors are subject to the requirements set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by executive agencies. Federal agencies reported obligating over $30 billion to acquire telecommunications products and services during fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Federal agencies procured telecommunications products and services from an average of 1,500 vendors each year, with over half of the contractors classified as small businesses. Federal agencies also reported an average of $800 million annually for call center obligations, with one agency accounting for at least 80 percent of total spending. Three federal reporting systems provide limited information about subcontracting and no information about offshoring. The federal government has worker protection requirements in place for federal contractors, including protections related to wages and hours, workplace safety and health, and protections against certain employer actions.", "The Military Health System (MHS) is a complex organization that consists of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Health Agency (DHA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Several leaders are responsible for overseeing the MHS, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Secretaries of each military department, Surgeon Generals of each military department, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)), and the Director of the DHA. The DHA is responsible for the administration of each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) as of September 30, 2021. MTFs provide various healthcare services to military personnel and their families, with different levels of capabilities and specialties. They also serve as training platforms for active-duty medical providers and maintain readiness through clinical skills development. The MHS also uses a purchased-care system of civilian providers to supplement MTF capabilities. Under the TRICARE program, beneficiaries have options for obtaining healthcare services, including TRICARE Prime (managed care) and TRICARE Select (self-managed, preferred provider). DOD has made efforts to reform and improve the MHS, including restructuring MTFs and prioritizing readiness. However, there have been shortcomings in the methodology and implementation of these reforms.", "The Marine Corps' budget is formulated and executed by multiple organizations, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Department of the Navy, the Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources (DC P&R), and the Marine Corps Director for Civilian Human Resources (DCHR). The OMB provides guidance for budget formulation and directs federal agencies to assess and resize their workforce as needed. The Department of the Navy provides budget formulation guidance and instructions to the Marine Corps. The DC P&R is responsible for determining and allocating the civilian labor budgets. The DCHR provides program direction and technical advice for managing civilian personnel. However, there have been issues with the Marine Corps justifying its civilian personnel pay requirements and determining funding levels based on projected hours to be worked. The Marine Corps formulates its budget request using inputs from various sources and the Deputy Commandant, Programs and Resources presents it for approval. The budget request is then reviewed by the Department of the Navy and OUSD(C) before being submitted to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Marine Corps manages its civilian personnel budget based on dollar amounts rather than FTE workload forecasts through a \"Manage to Payroll\" approach. This approach provides flexibility but leads to discrepancies between the number of FTEs requested and reported. The Marine Corps' use of Manage to Payroll puts Navy resources at risk of reduction, and the Navy recommends managing civilian personnel resources using FTE requirements. The Marine Corps' policy does not provide guidance for managing civilian FTEs, which increases the risk of overspending or underspending. Analysis of spending data shows discrepancies between requested dollar amounts and actual spending by major subordinate commands.", "In fiscal year 2019, states are required to spend at least 8 percent of CCDF funding on quality activities for improving child care services. These activities can include professional development for child care workers and improving the quality of child care programs for infants and toddlers. After setting aside funds for quality activities and administrative activities, states must spend at least 70 percent of discretionary funds on subsidies for eligible families. Many states used CCDF funds in fiscal year 2017 to fund activities such as child care resource and referral systems, consumer education, and health and safety standards. These activities help improve the quality of child care services and affect both subsidized and nonsubsidized children. Consumer education, licensing and monitoring of child care providers, and professional development were identified as activities that affect nonsubsidized children. States also use subsidy funds to support child care providers, which indirectly benefits nonsubsidized children. However, state increases in payment rates for CCDF providers may negatively impact nonsubsidized families by making child care more expensive for them.\n", "The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for acquiring space on behalf of federal agencies through construction and leasing. They currently lease space in over 8,600 buildings, providing workspace for 1.1 million federal employees. GSA can delegate its leasing authority to agencies if it is in the government's best interest. However, in the past, there have been issues with incomplete documentation and excessive rental rates in the delegated leasing program. GSA has made efforts to reform the program by clarifying requirements and centralizing data management. They have also implemented an electronic system called G-REX for reviewing and processing lease applications. However, there are still data quality issues with the system, as it overstates lease contract values and contains errors in rental rates. GSA is working to address these issues in an updated version of G-REX. Additionally, GSA is supposed to reconcile data between G-REX and the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) annually, but has been unable to do so due to the complexity of the task. As a result, GSA is potentially losing opportunities to enhance its oversight of the delegated leasing program. GSA also lacks control activities to regularly assess agencies' policies and procedures for managing delegated leases, which could help identify deficiencies and prevent issues. Furthermore, GSA does not track agencies' performance in meeting management goals, such as keeping lease rates at or below private sector rates and avoiding holdover status. The current system for submitting post award documents does not allow GSA to monitor these goals. Overall, there is a need for improved data quality, better control activities, and tracking of agency performance in the delegated leasing program.", "The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 established the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, which provides subsidies to carriers willing to provide air service to communities that would not otherwise have access to it. To be eligible for EAS, a community must meet certain criteria, such as being located more than 70 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport and having a subsidy per passenger of $200 or less. EAS is funded through appropriations and overflight fees, with the amount of overflight fees increasing in recent years. The level of service each community receives is established in law, with requirements such as service to a hub airport and a minimum number of round trips per day. The Department of Transportation (DOT) awards contracts to air carriers based on proposals and selects carriers based on factors such as service reliability and user preferences. Several communities receiving EAS cited economic benefits, such as increased tourism and job creation. Studies have shown a correlation between aviation activity and economic development, with greater activity leading to population growth, employment increases, and higher per-capita incomes. Since 2010, several statutory changes have limited the number of communities eligible for EAS, while also providing some flexibility for carriers. Overall, EAS plays a crucial role in connecting communities and supporting economic development.", "The U.S. government implements export controls to manage risks associated with exporting sensitive items while ensuring legitimate trade and advancing national security objectives. State and Commerce each play a role in implementing export controls. State controls the export of sensitive military items, while Commerce controls the export of dual-use and less sensitive military items. Certain items require a license or other authorization to export, and the intended destination, end-use, and item classification determine whether a license is necessary. Export controls also apply to the transfer of U.S. technology or source code to foreign persons in the United States. U.S. universities may be exempt from export controls if the information they plan to release falls into specific categories. However, vulnerabilities in protecting U.S. research from exploitation by foreign entities have been identified. Foreign students and scholars studying or working at U.S. universities pose both benefits and risks, as they contribute to research but also create opportunities for foreign actors to exploit academia. The U.S. government has developed guidance and conducted outreach to help exporters understand and comply with export control regulations, but university officials have raised concerns that these efforts do not adequately address university-specific issues. More outreach efforts are needed to inform universities about export compliance in the university context.", "There is no universally agreed-upon definition of insurance, but it generally involves the transfer and spreading of risk. Private insurers offer various types of insurance products and spread risk over a group of insured parties. The federal government also engages in activities that compensate or provide benefits to individuals or third parties who suffer losses from an adverse event, but these activities do not necessarily follow the same principles as private insurance. The Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes accounting principles for both private and federal entities. In terms of federal activities, the government has several insurance programs, including the Federal Crop Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and pension insurance programs. These programs collect premiums, but differ in their ability to cover future losses. There are also federal loan guarantee programs, which transfer the risk of borrower default from private lenders to the government. These programs estimate the cost of guaranteeing credit and report the liabilities associated with the guarantees.", "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require federal personnel decisions to be made without discrimination and establish equal employment opportunity programs for federal employees. Each federal agency must designate an EEO director who is responsible for counseling individuals, processing complaints of discrimination, and advising agency leadership on EEO matters. The EEOC's Management Directive 715 (MD-715) provides guidance for agencies to implement effective affirmative programs and sets standards for EEOC review. Agencies are required to report annually on their EEO programs, including conducting barrier analyses and eliminating identified barriers. USAID's Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD) administers programs to promote equal opportunity and diversity, including recruitment strategies, partnerships with employee resource groups, and addressing allegations of discrimination. USAID also provides training and mentoring programs to support diversity and inclusion. USAID's workforce includes Civil Service employees, U.S. personal services contractors, and foreign nationals. USAID promotes employees based on competitive and noncompetitive procedures, and the number of promotions varies by rank.", "The Improper Payments Information Act requires executive branch agencies to identify and address programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments. They must estimate and publish improper payment data, implement corrective actions, and report on their progress. However, the government's ability to understand the full scope of improper payments is hindered by incomplete or unreliable estimates and risk assessments. In fiscal years 2018 and 2019, government-wide estimated improper payments totaled about $151 billion and $175 billion, respectively. The largest contributors to improper payments were Medicaid, Medicare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit program. Many agencies were found to be noncompliant with the criteria outlined in the Act, particularly in the areas of publishing and meeting reduction targets and maintaining a gross improper payment rate below 10 percent. Overall compliance with the Act has improved slightly since 2016, but there are still programs that have been consistently noncompliant.", "The F-35 development program began in 2001 with the goal of producing next-generation aircraft to replace aging military aircraft. The program has developed three variants of the F-35 for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, each with unique operating requirements. In 2005, it was found that the program started without adequate knowledge and design. The program has faced significant cost and schedule growth, leading to restructurings and revised cost estimates. The program plans to spend $270.3 billion to purchase aircraft over the next 26 years, with a total estimated acquisition cost of $406 billion. The program has pushed the procurement of aircraft into the future and has experienced delays in operational testing. The program has faced deficiencies and unexpected grounding issues, which have caused delays in testing. The program has made progress in reducing the number of open deficiencies but still has category 1 and category 2 deficiencies. The program is also working to improve reliability and maintainability but has not set specific goals for improvement. Substantive actions have not been taken to address these issues.", "Under traditional Medicare, hospitals are paid for inpatient and outpatient services under two different payment systems. Inpatient stays are paid under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) which is a flat fee per beneficiary stay. Outpatient services are paid under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System, with a flat fee per service. Adjustments can be made to these payments based on factors such as hospital-specific criteria or geographic factors.\n\nCongress has established payment adjustments for certain hospitals under the IPPS, such as the Medicare-Dependent Hospital (MDH) designation. To qualify as an MDH, a hospital must have at least 60 percent of their inpatient days or discharges attributable to Medicare beneficiaries, be small with 100 or fewer beds, and be located in a rural area. MDHs can receive additional payments based on their historic reported inpatient operating costs, trended forward to adjust for inflation and other factors.\n\nThe MDH designation differs from other rural payment designations in terms of eligibility criteria, financial benefit, legislative permanence, and size. Unlike most other rural payment designations, the MDH program is temporary and must be periodically extended by Congress. MDHs make up a relatively small share of rural hospitals, with 138 MDHs out of 2,204 rural hospitals in fiscal year 2017. MDHs also have a smaller financial benefit compared to other rural designations and the benefit only applies to inpatient services.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the number of MDHs declined, as well as the number of MDHs receiving additional payments. MDHs varied on operational and financial metrics, including the share of Medicare revenue coming from inpatient care, measures of Medicare dependence, and profit margins. The MDH program targets smaller, rural hospitals that are Medicare-dependent in terms of inpatient volume. However, MDHs generally received a smaller share of their total care revenue from Medicare compared to other hospitals. Medicare profit margins and total facility profit margins declined for MDHs from fiscal year 2011 through 2017.\n\nOverall, the MDH designation provides additional payments to certain hospitals that meet the eligibility criteria, but the program is temporary and the financial benefit is relatively small compared to other rural payment designations.", "The report provides an overview of the use of the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) process in federal contracting. It explains that the LPTA process is used when the requirements are well-defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal. Under the LPTA process, cost or price plays a dominant role in the source selection, and non-cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis. On the other hand, the report states that the trade-off process is used when the requirements are less definitive, more development work is required, or there is a greater performance risk. In the trade-off process, non-cost factors may play a dominant role, and trade-offs between price and non-cost factors are allowed.\n\nThe report also discusses the status of regulatory changes required by the defense and civilian provisions for using the LPTA process. It explains that the Department of Defense (DOD) has issued proposed DFARS rules to address the defense provisions, and plans to issue the final rule by the end of fiscal year 2019. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) has initiated efforts to incorporate the civilian provisions into the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), with a proposed FAR rule scheduled to be published in September 2019.\n\nIn terms of agency usage of the LPTA process, the report finds that DOD used the LPTA process for about 25% of competitive contracts and orders valued at $5 million or more in fiscal year 2018. This is consistent with previous findings. Among the selected civilian agencies, the LPTA process was used in about 7% of such contracts and orders. The report provides insights from agency officials on why the LPTA process is used less frequently in civilian agencies compared to DOD.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of the LPTA process in federal contracting, including the regulatory changes and agency usage.", "The military justice system consists of three types of military courts - summary, special, and general courts-martial - to handle different levels of offenses. There is also a nonjudicial punishment process available for commanders to discipline servicemembers without a court-martial. The military justice process begins with an allegation and an investigation, followed by the preferral of charges and referral to a court-martial. The accused can be tried by a military judge alone or with a military jury. Convictions can be appealed in higher courts. The military services do not collect consistent data on race and ethnicity, which limits the assessment of racial or ethnic disparities in the military justice system. Recommendations have been made to collect and maintain this data and to include it in annual reports on military justice actions. Racial disparities exist in investigations, disciplinary actions, and punishments in the military justice system, with Black and Hispanic servicemembers more likely to be subjects of investigations and courts-martial. Changes have been proposed to address these disparities and ensure a fair and just military justice system.", "There are approximately 51,000 drinking water systems and 15,000 public wastewater systems in the United States that provide clean and safe water to communities. However, smaller systems often struggle to meet state and federal requirements due to financial and technical limitations. Drinking water and wastewater facilities are made up of infrastructure such as tanks, pipes, pumps, and buildings that treat and test water. Many of these utilities were built decades ago and have aging infrastructure that needs to be replaced or rebuilt. Utilities use historical data to plan for infrastructure replacement, but they do not typically account for future climate conditions. The federal government invests in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, but the majority of funding is provided by state and local governments. Various federal agencies collect and manage climate information to assist decision-makers in adapting to climate change. The Water and Wastewater Sector is among the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified in a presidential directive, and the EPA is responsible for coordinating security and resilience efforts within this sector. Climate change poses risks to drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, including degraded water quality, increased treatment costs, and infrastructure failures during extreme weather events. The severity of these impacts will vary by region. The federal government can improve the provision of climate information to aid decision-making and should invest in disaster resilience and hazard mitigation to protect critical infrastructure.", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is one of the largest civilian employers in the country, employing approximately 634,000 people in 2018. It is also a leading employer of minorities, women, veterans, and disabled veterans, with about 100,000 military members and veterans currently employed. The USPS workforce is represented by four unions and is divided into \"career\" and \"non-career\" employees, with career employees receiving more benefits and privileges. USPS compensation costs account for 72% of its operational costs, and the majority of these costs are payments to current employees. USPS negotiates contracts with its unions through a collective bargaining process, and the total cost of compensation for current employees has decreased since 2009, but has been rising since 2014. USPS has implemented changes to decrease employee compensation costs, including lowering pay for new career employees, increasing the use of non-career employees, and reducing contributions to employee health insurance premiums. USPS estimates that these changes have saved approximately $12 billion from 2016 to 2018, but a review found that the savings may have been overstated. USPS also has significant unfunded liabilities for retirement benefits, totaling about $110 billion, which poses a risk to its long-term sustainability. Overall, USPS compensation has grown more slowly than in the private sector and federal government, but USPS has implemented changes to decrease compensation costs and address financial challenges.", "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) utilizes professional support service contractors (SSCs) in its program offices, headquarters offices, and field offices. The program offices are responsible for planning and overseeing NNSA's programs and projects, while the headquarters offices provide leadership and functional support across the agency. The field offices oversee NNSA's management and operating contractors. The decision to hire an SSC is governed by an agency document that outlines the necessary procedures. Once an SSC is awarded, key personnel within NNSA oversee the contractor's performance. NNSA has three funding sources for SSCs: the Federal Salaries and Expenses account, the Weapons Activities account, and the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account. Concerns have been raised about the risk of contractors performing tasks reserved for the government. NNSA has made efforts to address these concerns, including developing policies, providing training, and issuing guidance documents. The agency has also conducted internal reviews and workforce studies to assess the use of SSCs and the overall balance between federal and contractor personnel. NNSA's obligations for SSCs have increased from about $139 million in fiscal year 2010 to about $193 million in fiscal year 2018.", "The lack of comprehensive federal privacy legislation in the United States has raised concerns about the protection of consumer privacy, especially in light of recent data breaches and incidents of misuse of personal information. Currently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) primarily enforces privacy protection through its authority to address unfair or deceptive practices. However, stakeholders have differing opinions on the effectiveness of this approach, with some advocating for the issuance of regulations and the imposition of civil penalties. The FTC has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties for violations of certain statutes and regulations, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. However, it generally addresses privacy cases through settlement agreements that require companies to implement privacy and security measures. Stakeholders have suggested that an overarching federal privacy statute, notice-and-comment rulemaking authority, and expanded civil penalty authority would better protect consumer privacy. They believe that such legislation would provide clarity, flexibility, and deterrence, while also promoting fairness by giving companies notice of prohibited actions. It is suggested that the lack of a comprehensive federal privacy statute limits the FTC's enforcement authority and that statutory changes could enhance its ability to take action against unfair and deceptive trade practices related to internet privacy. In addition, recent data breaches highlight the need for better security and privacy protections for personally identifiable information. Congress is urged to consider comprehensive legislation on internet privacy that provides specific standards, notice-and-comment rulemaking authority, and first-time violation civil penalty authority. This legislation would enhance consumer protections, provide certainty in the marketplace, and ensure that consumer privacy is adequately protected.", "The consumer reporting process involves consumers, consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), furnishers of consumer information, and users of consumer reports. Consumers provide their information to CRAs, who then share it with users to make decisions about credit, insurance, or employment. CRAs obtain data from various sources and generate revenue by selling consumer reports to third parties. Furnishers of consumer information include banks, lenders, and credit card issuers, who provide CRAs with information on consumers' accounts. Users of consumer reports include banks, landlords, and employers, who use the reports to determine eligibility for various products and services. Consumers can dispute inaccurate information on their reports and request copies from CRAs. There are also different types of CRAs that provide specialized reports for employment or rental housing decisions. Federal laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), govern the accuracy, security, and use of consumer information. FCRA requires CRAs and furnishers to ensure the accuracy of information in consumer reports and to address disputes from consumers. GLBA regulates the sharing of nonpublic personal information collected by financial institutions. Consumers have limited legal rights to control their personal information in the consumer reporting market and federal and state agencies have oversight authority for CRAs and furnishers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has supervisory authority over certain larger participant CRAs and shares enforcement and rulemaking authority with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). State agencies also have enforcement authority over CRAs.", "During the audit of the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS), it was found that the Treasury had deficiencies in its financial reporting procedures and internal controls. Three new internal control deficiencies were identified, including the lack of procedures to analyze and include appropriate disclosures related to new federal accounting standards in the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report. Additionally, Treasury did not have adequate procedures to support and report restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning net position. Finally, Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not have sufficient processes and procedures to report appropriate information regarding legal contingency losses in the fiscal year 2018 CFS. Recommendations were made to enhance Treasury's processes and procedures to address these deficiencies.", "The Partnership Program is an important part of the Bureau's efforts to spread awareness and encourage participation in the census. It consists of two main components: the National Partnership Program (NPP) and the Community Partnership and Engagement Program (CPEP). The program aims to engage and motivate people to respond to the census, raise awareness throughout the census period, support recruitment efforts for a diverse census workforce, and disseminate census data to stakeholders and the public. The Bureau has a goal of establishing 300,000 community partners nationwide for the 2020 Census. The program also supports inter-governmental outreach activities through state complete count commissions and complete count committees at the tribal and local levels. The Bureau plans to use various paid media outlets and digital advertising to promote awareness and participation in the census. They will also conduct outreach to the media and have developed a crisis communications plan to handle any events or actions that could affect census participation. The Bureau's social media strategy for 2020 includes utilizing platforms such as Snapchat and Facebook Messenger to raise awareness and provide information about the census. The Bureau has also implemented the Statistics in Schools (SIS) program to engage students and encourage them to communicate the importance of counting everyone in their households. The Bureau has taken actions to address challenges and ensure that hard-to-count populations are accurately counted in the census. They have developed strategic frameworks to target advertising and messaging to these populations and have created a publicly-available tool to monitor response rates in hard-to-count areas. The Bureau has also implemented a mobile questionnaire assistance initiative to assist residents of low-response areas in filling out the census. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is still being monitored and evaluated. The Bureau has also made efforts to address challenges related to staffing and the availability of promotional materials for the Partnership Program. They have increased the number of partnership specialists hired and have successfully secured over 307,000 community partners. Additionally, they have encouraged the creation of state complete count commissions and complete count committees at the local level.", "The National Drug Control Program involves multiple federal agencies responsible for drug prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is tasked with leading the national drug control effort, coordinating policy implementation, and evaluating effectiveness. The ONDCP was reauthorized in 2018 and issued the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy. However, the strategy lacks quantifiable objectives, a 5-year projection for program and budget priorities, specific assessments on drug use reduction, and a performance measurement system. Previous reports have emphasized the importance of clear goals and measurement in federal drug control efforts. Without these elements, it is difficult to determine if taxpayer dollars are being used effectively. The lack of information in the 2019 strategy reflects findings from previous reports that highlighted the need for improvements in performance measurement. Ongoing work will continue to monitor and assess federal drug control efforts.", "The U.S. freight rail network is a major industry in the country, responsible for moving 40 percent of U.S. freight across 140,000 miles of track. There are three classes of freight railroads, with Class I railroads being the largest and most influential. Class I railroads account for over 90 percent of the annual revenues and employ 90 percent of the industry's employees. Freight trains operate on different types of tracks, including main line tracks and sidings. Proper train makeup is important for ensuring stability and preventing derailments. The length of trains has been increasing, with some Class I railroads operating trains as long as 16,000 feet. Longer trains offer advantages such as increased efficiency and decreased costs. However, proper train makeup and handling are crucial for the safe operation of longer trains, as improper makeup can contribute to derailments. The use of technologies such as distributed power units and electronically controlled pneumatic brakes can help improve train handling and safety.", "The Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), enacted in 1995 and amended in 2018, extends 13 federal civil rights, workplace, and labor laws to legislative branch employees. The Office of Compliance (OCWR) is responsible for administering and enforcing the CAA. The Reform Act expanded OCWR's duties and responsibilities, including changing the office's name to OCWR, modifying the administrative dispute resolution process, appointing advisers for employee rights, and expanding CAA protections to unpaid staff. To meet the requirements of the Reform Act, OCWR initiated the SOCRATES project to implement an electronic system for claims. Testing of SOCRATES revealed problems, but the system was deployed in June 2019. OCWR relies on the Library of Congress and an external contractor for IT support and to upgrade its legacy claims management system. The report also highlights the risks and challenges associated with IT security in federal agencies and mentions previous reports on weaknesses in OCWR and the Library's information security programs. The report recommends incorporating key management practices into project planning and ensuring the necessary skills and capacity to meet mission requirements.", "The cost of conducting the United States Census has been increasing with each decade. The 2010 Census was the most expensive in history, costing about $12.3 billion, which was 31% more than the 2000 Census. The estimated cost of the 2020 Census is about $14.1 billion, with an additional $1.5 billion for contingency funds. The increasing costs are due to factors such as a growing population, declining mail response rates, and the need for additional resources to conduct the enumeration. The Census Bureau also faces internal management challenges, such as acquiring IT systems and preparing cost estimates. Additionally, there have been recent developments regarding the addition of a citizenship question to the census, which was ultimately ruled against by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Bureau has faced budgetary uncertainties but has received adequate funding to carry out the 2020 Census. The Bureau is implementing changes to how the census will be conducted, including the use of new IT applications and systems, and offering an option for households to respond online. The Bureau is relying on contractors for IT development and testing, as well as technical integration. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified the 2020 Census as a high-risk area and has provided recommendations for addressing the risks and challenges. The Bureau has partially met four out of five criteria for removal from the GAO's high-risk list. The risks associated with the 2020 Census include untested innovations, challenges in IT implementation, cybersecurity risks, and an unreliable cost estimate. The Census Bureau's plan for the 2020 Census includes innovative approaches to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data collection.", "The text discusses the multi-agency framework created by Congress to secure the nation's transportation systems. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Coast Guard are the primary federal agencies responsible for transportation security. TSA is responsible for security in all modes of transportation, while Coast Guard focuses on maritime transportation security. The authorities and responsibilities of these agencies vary across modes, with TSA having more regulatory authority in aviation and Coast Guard having more authority in maritime transportation. Other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Transportation (DOT), also play a role in transportation security to varying degrees. \n\nThe text also highlights the creation of a national strategy for transportation security following the 9/11 attacks. The national strategy, developed by TSA and Coast Guard, is intended to guide federal transportation security efforts. However, it plays a limited role in guiding these efforts, with agencies relying more on mode-specific documents and department and agency guidance. There is also overlap and redundancy among the various strategic documents, and the national strategy is not consistently used to allocate resources or guide decision-making. While the 2018 national strategy is generally consistent with desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy, it lacks hierarchical alignment with other strategic documents and does not fully guide transportation security activities. Efforts have been made to streamline and consolidate reporting requirements, but the ultimate value of the national strategy is limited due to its unclear position among other documents.", "The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program aims to reduce poverty, empower low-income individuals and families, and revitalize low-income communities. Administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CSBG program provides funding to states, which then distribute funds to over 1,000 local agencies. These local agencies use CSBG funds to provide services to participants and fill gaps in funding from other sources. OCS and states are responsible for overseeing CSBG grantees and ensuring compliance with federal grant standards. OCS conducts compliance evaluations of states, provides training and technical assistance, and submits an annual report to Congress. The CSBG Act also requires states to conduct oversight of local agencies and submit plans and reports detailing the use of funds. OCS has implemented initiatives to improve program oversight and performance measurement, including the Results Oriented Management and Accountability (ROMA) approach. OCS and states conducted required oversight activities and provided training and technical assistance to CSBG recipients. Compliance evaluations identified primarily administrative issues, but also instances of non-compliance and serious issues that required corrective actions. OCS conducts onsite compliance evaluations in a select number of states each year based on a risk assessment. The risk assessment considers factors such as program size, findings from audits, spending rate, time since last visit, and feedback from program managers. OCS conducts comprehensive reviews of states' plans, annual reports, documentation, fiscal controls, and accounting procedures during onsite evaluations. Administrative errors were commonly identified, but instances of non-compliance and financial mismanagement were also found. Overall, OCS and states play a vital role in ensuring the effective use of CSBG funds and the achievement of program goals.", "Hospice care provides comfort and pain relief for patients who are terminally ill. Patients are eligible for hospice care if they have a life expectancy of six months or less. Most hospice care is provided at home, and patients may receive controlled substances, like opioids, for pain relief. Hospice teams are required to include a physician, nurse, social worker, and counselor. The primary caregiver, usually a family member, provides most of the care for the patient and communicates with the hospice team. The Controlled Substances Act regulates the use and disposal of controlled substances, including those used in hospice care. The act has been amended to allow patients and their caregivers to deliver unused controlled substances to another person for disposal. The act also allows employees of qualified hospices to dispose of a patient's unused controlled substances after their death. Medicare-certified hospices are required to have written policies and procedures for the disposal of controlled substances in a patient's home. Hospices utilize strategies such as education, prescription drug counts, lockboxes, pharmacy cooperation, witnessed disposal, and in-home disposal products to mitigate the risk of diversion. However, challenges still exist, including cost, time-consuming disposal, lack of witnesses, refusal to dispose by family members, and inconsistencies between state and federal laws.", "The US Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for managing and overseeing the Civil Works program, which includes various environmental infrastructure projects across the country. These projects, known as Section 219 projects, involve activities such as drinking water treatment and distribution, wastewater treatment, and stormwater management. The Corps works with nonfederal sponsors to plan, design, and construct these projects. From 1992 to 2007, Congress authorized a total of 310 Section 219 projects. However, as of November 2018, 58 projects had been deauthorized and were no longer active. The Corps allocates funding for Section 219 projects from the construction account, and from fiscal years 1992 to 2017, it expended over $440 million on these projects. The Corps follows a standard budget process to prioritize and allocate funding to Section 219 projects. Currently, the Corps does not have written criteria to guide the ranking of these projects.", "The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a range of tools and policies to ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations. These tools include compliance monitoring, compliance assistance, and enforcement actions. Enforcement actions can lead to penalties and requirements to remedy violations. OECA stores and manages compliance data in the Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS), which feeds into the EPA's public access website, ECHO. However, data on informal enforcement actions and compliance assistance activities are not consistently collected or maintained by regional offices. The lack of complete information on these actions hinders the evaluation of EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement performance. While EPA has issued guidance on defining formal and informal enforcement actions, it has not provided guidance to regional offices on how to collect and maintain data on these actions. Similarly, EPA stopped requiring regional offices to collect data on compliance assistance activities, resulting in inconsistent information on these activities. This lack of information is contrary to EPA's goal of increasing the use of compliance assistance. EPA's communication of compliance and enforcement results relies on making data available to the public through its websites and annual reports. However, these websites acknowledge certain data limitations and EPA has not provided clear guidance on collecting data on compliance assistance activities to ensure consistent reporting.", "The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 aimed to improve joint officer management policies, enhance military operations, and strengthen civilian authority in the Department of Defense (DOD). The Act established joint officer management policies and mandated completion of Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) for certain joint assignments and promotions. The Act also required the Secretary of Defense, with the advice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to periodically review and revise the curriculum of JPME schools. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 required the implementation of a comprehensive framework for officer JPME. The Professional Military Education (PME) continuum consists of five levels corresponding to the phases of an officer's career. Intermediate and senior-level PME programs are designed for officers at pay grades O-4 through O-6 and are tailored to each service's needs. PME and JPME prepare officers for joint environments and are offered through distance learning programs. The oversight of PME and JPME programs is the responsibility of the OSD, Chairman, and military services. Civilian accreditation of PME programs is not required but provides assurance and attracts high-quality faculty. The military services' PME programs have been accredited by the Chairman to award JPME credit. These programs meet required joint learning areas and common educational standards. Examples of common educational standards met or partially met by the programs include employing active instructional methods, assessing student achievement, and assessing program effectiveness.", "Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code allows certain organizations to claim tax-exempt status and be exempt from federal income taxes. The most common type of tax-exempt organization is a charitable organization, which applies to about 1.3 million organizations. Individuals and organizations can reduce their taxable income by deducting contributions to charitable organizations on their tax returns. Charitable organizations provide assistance to various causes, and taxpayers can make financial or in-kind donations to support these activities. Tax-exempt organizations must file annual information returns, and although they are exempt from income tax, they still have to pay employment taxes and taxes on unrelated business income if applicable. The IRS reviews the applications for tax-exempt status and audits organizations' tax returns to ensure compliance. However, the budget cuts have resulted in a decrease in audits of individual tax returns since 2011. IRS also focuses on identifying and addressing abusive tax schemes, including ones involving charitable donations. Examples of abusive tax schemes include syndicated conservation easements and donor-advised funds. These schemes exploit the tax-exempt status of organizations and involve overvaluation of assets or providing impermissible economic benefits to donors. IRS has designated syndicated conservation easements as listed transactions and has identified taxpayer abuse of conservation easements as a risk area for noncompliance. Donor-advised funds have also seen an increase in activity, and IRS is concerned about potential abuses and improper use of these funds.", "The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established to assist the President in creating drug control policies for the nation. The ONDCP is responsible for leading the national drug control effort, overseeing the implementation of drug control policy, assessing the adequacy of national drug control programs and budgets, and evaluating the effectiveness of drug control efforts. The Director of ONDCP is required to develop and promulgate the National Drug Control Strategy, which outlines a plan to reduce illicit drug use in the United States. The ONDCP is also responsible for developing a consolidated budget proposal for drug control activities and assessing and certifying the budgets of other drug control agencies. The ONDCP did not issue a National Drug Control Strategy for 2017 or 2018, citing a lack of a Senate-confirmed Director and the administration's inaugural year as reasons. The ONDCP issued its 2019 National Drug Control Strategy in January 2019 but did not fully meet all the requirements set forth in the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006. The ONDCP plans to issue the next National Drug Control Strategy in February 2020, in accordance with the SUPPORT Act. The 2019 Strategy did not include annual quantifiable objectives or specific targets, a 5-year projection for program and budget priorities, or specific drug trend assessments, as required by law. The SUPPORT Act continues to require these elements in future Strategy iterations.", "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is a U.S. territory consisting of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean. The majority of the population resides on the island of Saipan. In 2018, the CNMI was hit by Super Typhoon Yutu, causing significant damage to the islands' infrastructure. The CNMI has a unique political relationship with the United States, granting it self-governance over internal affairs while the U.S. handles foreign affairs and defense. The CNMI has a transition program called the CW-1 program, which allows temporary foreign workers to work in the CNMI. The CNMI's economy, mainly driven by tourism and the casino industry, experienced growth from 2012 to 2017 but declined in 2018. Visitor arrivals dropped significantly in fiscal year 2019 due to the impact of Super Typhoon Yutu, with a shift in the composition of visitors from Japan to China and South Korea. The CNMI's casino industry has faced challenges, with the closure of the Tinian Dynasty Hotel and Casino and delays in the completion of a casino and hotel complex in Saipan. The casino operator has also faced fines for labor violations and reported significant financial losses. The CNMI's workforce consists of both U.S. and foreign workers, with the number of foreign workers decreasing in 2018.", "Congress and executive branch agencies have made progress in addressing actions identified since 2011, with nearly 80% of the actions fully or partially addressed as of March 2020. These actions have resulted in approximately $429 billion in financial benefits, including $166 billion since the last report. The benefits have contributed to various missions across the federal government, such as housing assistance, military and veterans health care, tax policies and enforcement, and overseas stabilization efforts. However, further efforts are needed to address the remaining open actions. The report presents new areas of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, as well as opportunities for cost savings and enhanced revenues. It also highlights various examples where additional action could lead to financial benefits of $1 billion or more, and where actions can achieve other benefits like increased public safety and effective service delivery.", "Different types of organizations can serve as representative payees for Social Security beneficiaries. These organizations include social service agencies, mental institutions, non-profit and private organizations, financial organizations, and public officials. The majority of organizational payees are low-volume payees, serving 34% of beneficiaries. Organizational payees must use the funds for the beneficiary's current maintenance, such as food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. They are also responsible for keeping records of payments and expenditures and participating in periodic reviews and onsite visits. However, there are gaps in the process for approving organizational payees, including insufficient detail in policies and documentation of suitability decisions. There are also challenges with approving replacement payees, such as a lack of local options and difficulty locating beneficiaries. SSA is reevaluating its policies and procedures for approving payees based on feedback received. Field offices are supposed to document their assessment of an applicant's suitability, but we found that this documentation is often lacking or incomplete.", "The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, aims to increase transparency in federal spending by requiring agencies to disclose expenditure information and link it to program activities. The Act also establishes government-wide data standards to ensure consistency and comparability in reporting. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Treasury are responsible for implementing the Act and creating the data standards. However, there is a need for a clear data governance structure to maintain the integrity of the standards over time. The OMB and Treasury have made some efforts in this regard, but more is needed to establish clear policies and procedures. Additionally, the governance of the DATA Act data standards has been integrated into broader efforts under the President's Management Agenda (PMA), which has led to some confusion about the relationship between different data governance initiatives. Furthermore, there is no documented procedure for updating data definitions, which could lead to inconsistencies in reporting. Overall, efforts are needed to establish a clear and comprehensive data governance structure to ensure the accuracy and consistency of federal spending data.", "VA provides nursing home care through three separate programs, each for different types of nursing home settings. The care provided is generally similar, but some homes may specialize in short-term or long-term care, as well as special needs care. VA oversees the care provided either by itself or in combination with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Depending on a veteran's eligibility, VA may fully or partially cover the cost of nursing home care. Veterans and their families are responsible for making decisions about nursing home care, with assistance from VA social workers and clinical care providers. VA uses inspections to assess the quality of care in each setting, similar to CMS. VA also provides information about nursing homes on its Access to Care website, and veterans can compare nursing home quality using VA's Nursing Home Compare website. The Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care oversees the quality of care in each setting. VA conducts regular inspections for CLCs and SVHs, but not for CNHs. VA projects an increase in demand for nursing home care in the future, particularly in CNHs. However, there are challenges in contracting with CNHs, and some homes have ended their contracts with VA. VA is working to expand the availability of special needs care in all settings. Expenditures for nursing home care have increased in recent years, reflecting increases in the number of veterans receiving care. CLCs account for the largest share of expenditures due to higher staffing levels and specialized equipment. VA can enhance its oversight of nursing home inspections by regularly monitoring contractors' performance and citing all deficiencies in SVHs. Additionally, VA should provide guidance for optional onsite reviews of CNHs.", "The USDA conducts the Census of Agriculture every 5 years to provide information on farms and farmers. The 2017 Census showed an increase in the number of reported producers, with about 3.4 million producers in 2017 compared to 3.2 million in 2012. The census also identified that 41% of all producers in 2017 were socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (SDFRs), with women accounting for the largest increase in SDFR producers and primary producers. SDFR farms tended to be smaller and had less revenue compared to non-SDFR farms. The Farm Credit System and commercial banks accounted for the majority of agricultural lending, while the USDA's Farm Service Agency provided assistance to beginning and underserved farmers. Data on lending to SDFRs is limited, as lenders are generally not allowed to collect personal characteristic data on loan applicants. A rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act would require financial institutions to report information on credit applications made by women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses, potentially including some agricultural loans. The USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey provides some insights into agricultural lending to SDFRs, but the sample size is small and the survey may underrepresent total outstanding farm debt. SDFRs received proportionately fewer loans and less agricultural credit overall than non-SDFRs, possibly due to factors such as operating smaller farms and difficulty qualifying for loans. SDFR primary producers borrowed from the same types of lenders as non-SDFRs, such as commercial banks and the Farm Credit System.", "The Coast Guard has a mission to promote safe waterways and maintain a system of maritime aids to navigation (ATON) to prevent disasters and assist mariners. There are two categories of ATON: fixed, which include lighthouses and towers, and floating, which include buoys and markers. The Coast Guard uses various vessels to place and service ATON. The ATON program consists of several offices and units that work together to carry out the mission. Coast Guard districts oversee the coordination of operations at individual ATON units. Routine and non-routine servicing of ATON is conducted, and data on the condition of ATON is collected and entered into a database. The Coast Guard's annual budget funds the ATON mission, but specific expenditures for ATON are not reported separately. The condition of ATON has declined slightly over the years, with some aids operating past their service lives. Weather conditions and geographic factors also impact the condition of ATON. Repair and recapitalization costs for ATON have increased over time. The Coast Guard faces challenges in managing ATON, including vessel availability and capacity limits. Overall, the availability and condition of ATON cutters and boats have varied, with most meeting availability targets.", "GDUFA and GDUFA II are programs that allow the FDA to collect user fees from the generic drug industry to improve the generic drug application review process. GDUFA provides funding for more application reviewers and aims to speed up reviews, while GDUFA II reauthorizes the program and sets certain performance measures for the FDA to meet. The generic drug application review process involves several steps, including determining if an application is acceptable for review, reviewing the application for bioequivalence, labeling, and pharmaceutical quality, and issuing action letters to applicants. Our analysis found that 12% of applications received approval in the first review cycle from fiscal years 2015 to 2017. Factors such as the sufficiency of the application, drug quality deficiencies, the complexity of the drug, and priority review status can influence the likelihood of approval in the first review cycle. The FDA has taken steps to increase communication and provide guidance to help applicants prepare approvable applications. However, there is still room for improvement in these efforts.", "The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted in 1970 to regulate the use of controlled substances while preventing them from being diverted for illegal purposes. The CSA requires DEA to maintain a \"closed system\" of distribution, where controlled substances are limited and tracked throughout the supply chain. Various entities, such as manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies, must register with the DEA to handle controlled substances. The CSA classifies controlled substances into five schedules based on factors such as medical use and potential for abuse. The prescription drug supply chain can present opportunities for diversion and abuse. DEA is responsible for preventing and investigating the diversion of controlled substances. DEA operates databases such as ARCOS and SORS to collect information on suspicious orders and track the flow of controlled substances. DEA also uses data analytics to detect patterns of diversion. DEA collaborates with state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to access prescription data for enforcement purposes. Overall, DEA works to ensure an adequate supply of controlled substances for legitimate purposes while combating diversion and abuse.", "According to the information provided, rural transit providers play a crucial role in supplying mobility and essential services to people living in rural communities. These providers often face challenges such as low budgets, limited resources, and long distances between transit providers. The Department of Transportation (DOT) supports rural transportation through formula grants and directly awards funds to federally recognized Indian tribes. The Coordinating Council, led by DOT and FTA, works to improve coordination across federal programs that fund transportation services for transportation-disadvantaged persons. Lack of resources, differing program requirements, limited technology access, and distance between providers are all factors that can affect rural transit coordination. Despite these challenges, rural transit providers make efforts to coordinate services to meet increasing demand, improve service, and reduce costs. They engage in activities such as sharing resources, pursuing funding from different programs, and participating in knowledge-sharing forums.", "The United States has over 19,000 airports, with roughly 3,300 designated as part of the national airport system and eligible for federal assistance for airport capital projects. The national airport system consists of commercial service airports, which have scheduled service and board at least 2,500 passengers per year, and general aviation airports, which have no scheduled service and board fewer than 2,500 passengers. Larger airports account for the majority of passenger traffic and receive more funding, while smaller airports rely on a combination of federal grants, airport revenue, and state grants. Funding for airport infrastructure projects comes from a variety of sources, including federal grants, passenger facility charges (PFCs), airport revenue, and capital contributions. The amount of federal grants allocated to airports has remained consistent since 2012, while PFC collections have increased due to higher passenger enplanements. Larger airports generate more airport revenue and rely on PFCs and bonding to fund infrastructure projects, while smaller airports generate less revenue and may experience fluctuations in PFC collections. Airport-generated revenue, derived from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical sources, has increased over time. Capital contributions make up a smaller portion of funding compared to other sources.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on space systems to provide a variety of capabilities to different users, such as positioning and navigation, meteorology, missile warning, and secure communications. However, DOD space programs often face significant cost increases and schedule delays. Major satellite programs like AEHF, SBIRS, and GPS III have experienced substantial cost growth and schedule delays. Additionally, ground systems and user equipment have also encountered similar challenges. DOD is working on acquiring new constellations of satellites and ground systems for various purposes. The department is also exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications and funding the development of new launch vehicles. Space systems face growing threats from countries like China and Russia, which pose challenges to the U.S. position in space. DOD is taking steps to make its satellite constellations more resilient and survivable against these threats, including through the use of disaggregation and defense systems. However, there are barriers to implementing these strategies, such as cultural and process changes in acquisition, logistical challenges, and limited knowledge on the use of commercial hosted payloads. DOD is also facing difficulties in protecting its space systems from cyber threats, due to the computerized nature of weapon systems and a late start in prioritizing weapon system cybersecurity. Fragmentation and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and oversight have contributed to program delays and cancellations, cost increases, and inefficient operations. To address these issues, the President's Administration and DOD are taking steps to change space leadership, including the establishment of a United States Space Force as a sixth branch of the military.", "Medicaid is a government program that provides health care coverage to low-income individuals. It is overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the federal level, while states administer their own Medicaid programs. Each state has flexibility in designing and implementing their programs, resulting in more than 50 different state-based programs. Medicaid covers certain mandatory services, but states can also choose to include additional optional services, such as prescription drugs. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide coverage for prescription drugs. Medicaid programs do not directly purchase drugs, but instead reimburse pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid beneficiaries can obtain medication-assisted treatment (MAT) medications through retail pharmacies, external delivery from specialty pharmacies, or buy-and-bill methods. The three main MAT medications are buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and naltrexone, which are used in the treatment of opioid use disorder. However, state Medicaid program policies related to prescription drug coverage and distribution can restrict access to MAT medications. Some states may not cover all MAT medications in all formats, and prior authorization requirements can cause delays in access to medication. These restrictions can have serious consequences for patients with opioid use disorder, as timely access to MAT medications is crucial for their treatment and recovery.", "The text discusses the roles and responsibilities of corporate and FHLBank boards and their directors. Corporate boards are responsible for managing the business and affairs of the corporation, while FHLBank boards are cooperatively owned by member institutions and have specific requirements for directors. The text also highlights the benefits of board diversity, such as better decision-making and reflecting a company's employee and customer base. However, despite progress, women and minorities are still underrepresented on both corporate and FHLBank boards. The text identifies three key factors that limit board diversity: not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts, limitations of the traditional board candidate pipeline, and low turnover of board seats. Strategies to increase board diversity include setting voluntary targets, requiring a diverse slate of candidates, filling interim board seats with women or minority candidates, emphasizing the importance of diversity, mentoring candidates, and improving disclosure on board diversity.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate a foreign country for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) based on ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or extraordinary and temporary conditions. The designation lasts for a period of at least 6 months but no more than 18 months. Before the designation period ends, the Secretary must review the conditions in the foreign country to determine if the designation should be extended, terminated, or redesigned. TPS provides temporary humanitarian protection to eligible foreign nationals in the United States who would otherwise be subject to removal. To be eligible for TPS, an applicant must have been physically present in the United States since the most recent designation's effective date and have resided in the United States continuously since a specified date. TPS beneficiaries are also authorized to work in the United States. Since TPS was established in 1990, 22 countries have been granted TPS, with varying bases for the designations. The designations have been extended, terminated, or redesigned multiple times for many of these countries. The number of TPS beneficiaries has increased over the years, with the majority being from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. The decision-making process for TPS involves three steps: initiation of a review, collection of information on country conditions, and the Secretary of Homeland Security making a decision on TPS for the country. Various factors can trigger consideration of a country for TPS, and subsequent reviews are required by statute. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collects information from sources such as USCIS, the Department of State, and other government agencies to inform the decision-making process. The time frames for conducting TPS reviews can vary.", "The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) oversees the implementation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and other anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. It has the authority to enforce the BSA through civil money penalties and other enforcement actions. FinCEN collects and analyzes information from financial institutions, identifies financial crime trends, and disseminates information to relevant agencies. It primarily relies on federal supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to conduct compliance examinations of financial institutions to ensure BSA and AML requirements are met. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the authority to examine certain financial institutions for BSA compliance. Other law enforcement agencies can also investigate BSA violations and start criminal investigations based on BSA reporting. Financial institutions are required to comply with BSA/AML requirements, such as maintaining effective internal controls and reporting suspicious financial activities. BSA regulations include recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and financial institutions must also establish risk-based procedures for conducting customer due diligence. Supervisory agencies and SROs conduct examinations of financial institutions based on risk assessments and use BSA data to plan and scope the examinations. However, there is a need to improve the risk-based approach to examinations and ensure consistency in the application of BSA requirements. Regulators are working on updating examination manuals and providing clearer guidance to examiners. The FFIEC has undertaken an Examination Modernization Project to improve the examination process. SEC shares examination responsibility with SROs for broker-dealers and has sole responsibility for mutual fund companies.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) experienced supply chain challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic due to global supply chain issues and longstanding problems within the VA's medical supply procurement system. These problems were highlighted in a report in November 2017, which found weaknesses in the implementation of the VA's MSPV-NG program. Recommendations were made to develop a strategy for the program, but delays in implementation occurred. The initial formulary for the program did not meet the needs of VA medical centers and had to be expanded. The MSPV 2.0 program was intended to address these shortcomings, but it has faced multiple bid protests, resulting in delays. Despite these efforts, there are still ongoing challenges with the current MSPV-NG program, such as inconsistent supply deliveries and manual maintenance of the formulary using spreadsheets. VA also faces difficulties in inventory management and is in the process of implementing a new inventory management system called DMLSS, but this implementation has also been delayed. During the COVID-19 response, VA had to use various contracting organizations and mechanisms to meet its supply needs, as the existing MSPV-NG program and other VA supply contracts were insufficient. VA made significant purchases through other contracting mechanisms, including government purchase cards and the Federal Emergency Management Administration's Strategic National Stockpile program. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for VA to modernize its supply chain management system to better serve veterans.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is significantly behind schedule in addressing five key requirements related to its organizational strategy and cross-functional teams. The requirements, outlined in section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), include issuing an organizational strategy, providing guidance for cross-functional teams, delivering training to team members and their supervisors, training presidential appointees, and reporting on the successes and failures of cross-functional teams.\n\nAs of June 2019, DOD has not fully met any of these requirements. The organizational strategy, which was due in September 2017, has been delayed and is currently under review. Guidance for cross-functional teams, due in September 2017, has also not been issued. Required training for team members and their supervisors has not been provided, and officials have not received training for presidential appointees. An analysis of the successes and failures of cross-functional teams, due in February 2019, has not been conducted.\n\nThe delays in meeting these requirements can be attributed to the Acting Chief Management Officer (CMO) not approving the draft documents and not coordinating them department-wide. Additionally, internal deadlines for completing the requirements have not been established, further exacerbating the delays.\n\nIn addition to these requirements, the DOD has also fallen behind on establishing an electromagnetic spectrum operations cross-functional team and providing necessary administrative support and funding for the team's operations. Disagreements over funding responsibilities have delayed the provision of funds, negatively impacting the team's ability to carry out its work effectively.\n\nOverall, the DOD's failure to meet these requirements has hindered the implementation and effectiveness of its cross-functional teams and organizational strategy. Without clear internal deadlines and sufficient resources, progress in these areas will continue to be impeded.", "The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, requires federal agencies to disclose their expenditures and link spending data to program activities. The act holds agencies accountable for submitting accurate and complete data and establishes government-wide data standards. The USAspending.gov website collects data from agencies and external award recipients. The DATA Act Broker is a key component that allows agencies to upload and validate financial data for publication. Agencies are required to submit three data files, including appropriations account data, object class and program activity data, and award financial data. The Broker also extracts data from four government-wide award reporting systems. Agency senior accountable officials must certify the data submissions. Federal financial management Shared Service Providers (SSPs) play a key role in helping agencies meet DATA Act requirements and provide a variety of services including preparing data files, consolidating files, reconciling data, and uploading files to the Broker. However, there are challenges associated with using SSPs, which can impact the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of agency submissions.", "Alaska's location in the Arctic region and its vast coastline make the United States an Arctic nation. The U.S. Arctic coastal regions, with a population of about 26,000, are sparsely populated and accessible mainly by air or water. As the Arctic sea ice declines, opportunities for maritime transportation and the extraction of natural resources have increased. The U.S. Arctic contains significant oil and gas reserves, as well as valuable minerals. However, the challenging Arctic environment and lack of maritime infrastructure pose obstacles for shipping and resource extraction. The U.S. government has established strategies and interagency groups to guide and coordinate efforts in the Arctic region. The number of vessels in the U.S. Arctic has been increasing, but maritime shipping in the area remains limited compared to global commercial shipping. Factors such as diminishing sea ice, natural resource development, tourism cruises, and research activities affect U.S. Arctic maritime shipping.", "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a mineral-rich nation with a troubled history, including political upheaval, armed conflict, and human rights violations. The country has experienced violence, including sexual violence, perpetrated by nonstate armed groups and members of the Congolese national military. Presidential elections were delayed until December 2018, leading to an increase in human rights violations. The DRC is known for its production of conflict minerals, including tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which are used in various industries. The SEC adopted a conflict minerals disclosure rule in 2012 to bring awareness to the sources of these minerals and promote due diligence in supply chains. In 2018, 1,117 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures, reporting the use of tantalum, tungsten, gold, and tin in their products. Many companies faced difficulties in determining the country of origin of these minerals due to complex supply chains. Companies conducted country-of-origin inquiries and due diligence, but most could not definitively confirm the source of the minerals or whether they financed armed groups. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance in 2017 indicating that enforcement action would not be recommended for non-compliance with certain due diligence disclosure requirements. Some companies chose not to report on due diligence efforts due to this guidance, but others planned to continue reporting. The SEC's long-term regulatory agenda includes addressing the effect of litigation over the conflict minerals rule, and State has conducted public outreach to remind stakeholders of the rule. There is no new information on rates of sexual violence, and case-file data are unsuitable for estimating rates.", "Since the early 1990s, a high-risk program has been implemented to identify government operations that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Qualitative factors such as public health and safety, national security, and economic growth, as well as exposure to monetary loss, are considered when designating high-risk programs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for leading the national drug control effort and coordinating efforts with other federal agencies. Rates of drug misuse and overdose deaths have been increasing in the United States, and the costs associated with drug misuse are significant. The federal government faces challenges in addressing the drug crisis, including the need for sustained leadership, strengthened coordination, and effective measurement and evaluation. While progress has been made, there are still many recommendations that have not been implemented by federal agencies. Improved leadership and coordination, as well as effective collaboration with stakeholders, are necessary to address the drug crisis effectively.", "Accreditation is a process that ensures schools provide a quality education to students. Accrediting agencies, which are non-governmental entities, work with education departments to oversee schools participating in federal student aid programs. To be recognized by the education department, accrediting agencies must meet certain criteria, including applying their own standards when accrediting schools. When schools do not meet the standards, accrediting agencies can impose sanctions. Education departments also conduct annual financial reviews of schools participating in federal student aid programs to determine if they are financially responsible. They use a financial composite score based on three financial ratios to assess a school's financial condition. If a school fails to meet the financial responsibility standards, additional oversight measures may be imposed. Furthermore, the education department monitors schools' cohort default rates to determine if they are financially stable. Despite these oversight measures, there have been challenges in effectively ensuring academic quality and identifying at-risk schools. The composite score used to assess financial responsibility has limitations and does not incorporate new financial metrics. Additionally, the cohort default rate has been manipulated by schools using forbearance options to avoid default and improve their rates. It is important for the education department to update the composite score formula, consider sanction data, and address the limitations of the cohort default rate to improve oversight and protect students and federal funds.", "Black lung benefit payments consist of both cash assistance and medical care. The maximum cash assistance payments range from about $670 to $1,340 per month in 2019, depending on the number of dependents. Beneficiaries also receive medical treatment for their black lung-related conditions, which can include hospital care, rehabilitation services, and reimbursement for drug and equipment expenses. The average annual cost for medical care in fiscal year 2019 was approximately $8,225 per miner. In 2019, there were about 25,700 beneficiaries receiving black lung benefits, a decrease from 174,000 in 1982. However, the number of beneficiaries could increase in the future due to the rising occurrence of the disease, particularly among Appalachian coal miners. The rise in black lung has been attributed to various factors, including increased exposure to silica. Black lung claims are processed by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, and contested claims can be appealed to the federal courts. In fiscal year 2019, about 33% of black lung claims were approved. Payment of benefits can be funded by responsible mine operators or the Trust Fund, depending on the circumstances. The Trust Fund pays benefits when responsible operators cannot be identified or do not pay, and reasons for this include operator insolvency and unclear employment history of miners. During self-insured operator bankruptcies, benefit liabilities can be transferred to the Trust Fund if the collateral provided by the operators is inadequate. The bankruptcies of Alpha Natural Resources, James River Coal, and Patriot Coal resulted in a transfer of estimated benefit liability of about $865 million to the Trust Fund. Other bankruptcies of self-insured operators did not affect the Trust Fund as their liabilities were assumed by reorganized companies or purchasers. The Department of Labor takes actions to protect the financial interests of the Trust Fund during self-insured operator bankruptcies, including filing claims in bankruptcy courts and negotiating with reorganizing companies or purchasers. Insurance companies play a role in providing coverage for black lung benefits, and their financial health is monitored by state insurance commissioners. Reinsurance can help insurers manage the risk of claims, although some reinsurance policies may exclude occupational disease claims such as black lung. State guaranty funds also reduce the potential for the Trust Fund to assume responsibility for paying claims if an insurer becomes insolvent. The Department of Labor has implemented a new self-insurance process that considers future benefit liability and reviews operators more frequently. However, there are still deficiencies in the process, such as the lack of procedures for self-insurance renewals and coal operator appeals. The Department of Labor also does not monitor whether operators that do not self-insure maintain adequate commercial insurance coverage.", "Throughout a construction project, there are often changes made to the contract. These changes can be bilateral, meaning both the contractor and contracting officer agree to the modification, or unilateral, meaning the contracting officer directs the change without the contractor's agreement. The process for each type of change typically involves identifying the need for a change, determining that it falls within the scope of the existing contract, receiving a cost estimate, and verifying that funds are available. The timing of contract changes can vary, and there are challenges in the process that can negatively impact cash flow and increase administrative and legal costs. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to these challenges due to limited resources. The government has made efforts to streamline the change process, including implementing guidance and monitoring time frames, but there are still issues to be addressed. Agencies are now required to gather information on the time it takes to finalize contract changes, and steps are being taken to improve the monitoring and tracking of data related to these changes.", "The federal government owns and leases thousands of office buildings and warehouses across the country. The General Services Administration (GSA) handles the acquisition and maintenance of these properties. GSA categorizes leases based on factors like size and location. Brokers are involved in the leasing process to supplement the work of GSA staff. However, there are limitations on what brokers can do, as some tasks are considered inherently governmental functions. GSA has changed its broker program over the years to increase flexibility and involve more brokers. The use of brokers in leases varies, and it's difficult to determine if they result in lower rental rates. Commissions are paid to brokers, with a portion given back to the federal tenant agency in the form of reduced rent. There are differing opinions on the benefits of using brokers, with some questioning the cost savings and others suggesting fixed-price structures could lower costs. GSA has set goals for its broker program, including achieving cost savings and improving the customer experience. The agency has metrics in place to demonstrate cost savings, but the effectiveness of the program is still unclear.", "The Coast Guard is responsible for maritime safety and security, environmental protection, and national security. As human activity increases in the Arctic, the Coast Guard faces expanding responsibilities in the region. In 2016, the Coast Guard identified various capability gaps in the Arctic, including communications, Arctic maritime domain awareness, infrastructure, training and exercise opportunities, and icebreaking capacity. The Coast Guard has worked with its partners to mitigate these gaps but has not systematically assessed their progress. The Coast Guard's 2019 Arctic strategy highlights the need to enhance capability in the region and notes that the current polar icebreaking fleet is insufficient. The Coast Guard's Polar Security Cutter acquisition program has faced risks in technology, design, cost, and schedule. Recommendations have been made to address these risks and ensure a sound business case for the program. The Coast Guard must remain committed to addressing these risks to mitigate capability gaps in the Arctic.", "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for meeting the logistics needs of the armed forces, including buying and distributing various items. One of its responsibilities is conducting reverse engineering to develop technical data packages or approve new suppliers. Reverse engineering is the process of replicating a design by examining and measuring an existing item. DLA uses reverse engineering to identify potential new sources for obsolete parts, increase competition, and achieve savings. Before starting reverse engineering, DLA personnel try to buy data from the original equipment manufacturer or other sources. DLA has two reverse engineering programs, one funded by contractors and one internally funded. These programs have resulted in cost savings and the creation of new suppliers. However, the completion rate for these projects is low, partly due to delays in obtaining approvals from military service engineers. Reverse engineering is generally beneficial for small businesses and helps them establish past performance ratings. DLA has processes in place to protect intellectual property during reverse engineering projects. However, there are some provisions specific to the contractor-funded program that safeguard against patent infringement. DLA does not release limited rights data for contractor-funded projects and does not allow the use of proprietary or limited release drawings or technical data. Overall, small businesses involved in reverse engineering projects do not express concerns about DLA's handling of intellectual property.", "The text discusses the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which were both enacted to increase voter registration and ensure accurate voter registration lists. The NVRA focuses on increasing voter registration opportunities and improving list maintenance, while HAVA requires states to implement an interactive computerized voter registration list and perform regular list maintenance. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for enforcing federal voting rights laws, including the NVRA, through civil investigations and enforcement, as well as criminal investigations and prosecutions. Private parties also have the right to bring civil actions against states or local agencies for violating the NVRA. State and local election officials are responsible for administering elections and maintaining accurate voter registration lists. They use various data sources and procedures to remove ineligible voters from the lists and ensure accuracy. The Voting Section within the DOJ enforces the NVRA by initiating investigations and filing cases related to registration opportunities and list maintenance. From fiscal years 2001 through 2017, the Voting Section initiated 99 NVRA matters, with the highest number in fiscal years 2008 and 2011. They also participated in 23 NVRA cases during this period, with more cases related to list maintenance allegations than registration opportunities. The DOJ has focused on both registration opportunities and list maintenance in their enforcement efforts, prioritizing different aspects at different times.", "As of November 2018, 43 states operated Medicaid programs under demonstrations, with federal spending on these demonstrations accounting for more than one-third of total federal Medicaid spending. In January 2018, CMS announced a new policy to support states interested in implementing work or community engagement requirements for Medicaid eligibility. As of May 2019, nine states had work requirements approved, seven states had applications pending, and three states faced legal challenges. Implementing work requirements can involve administrative activities such as developing eligibility systems and training staff. The estimated costs to implement work requirements varied among states, with federal funding covering the majority of these costs.", "The U.S. Army began its modernization efforts in 2017 and identified six priorities for enhancement, including long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, army network, air and missile defense, and soldier lethality. To fund these priorities, the Army realigned $1 billion in science and technology funding and plans to spend an additional $7.5 billion over the next five years. The Army Futures Command was established in 2018 to oversee these modernization efforts and has selected Austin, Texas, as its headquarters. The command consists of administrative offices, cross-functional teams, and major subordinate components. The Army has engaged with small businesses through contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and other arrangements. The Army Futures Command plans to continue small business engagement efforts and has implemented initiatives to enhance this engagement, such as the Army Research Laboratory Open Campus 2.0, Army Capability Accelerator, Army Strategic Capital, and Halo. These initiatives aim to support small businesses in developing and commercializing innovative solutions for the Army's modernization efforts.", "The national pipeline system in the United States consists of over 2.7 million miles of pipelines that transport natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids. There are three main types of pipelines: hazardous liquid pipelines, natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, and natural gas distribution pipelines. The system is monitored through automated control systems, but accidents can still occur from various causes such as third-party excavation, corrosion, mechanical failure, and operator error. The pipelines are also vulnerable to physical attacks and cyber attacks. Federal policy and public-private plans, such as Presidential Policy Directive /PPD-21 and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, establish the roles and responsibilities for the protection of critical infrastructure, including pipelines. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are the primary entities responsible for pipeline safety and security. TSA oversees the physical security and cybersecurity of transmission and distribution pipelines, while PHMSA regulates the safety of pipeline systems. Private sector pipeline operators also have a role in implementing security measures. The MOU Annex between TSA and PHMSA, which outlines their coordination and roles, has not been updated since 2006 and does not reflect current developments and distinctions between the agencies. A review and update of the MOU Annex, considering changes like the establishment of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), would help ensure that the roles and responsibilities of TSA and PHMSA accurately reflect current circumstances.", "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) uses the Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) system to measure and assess the quality, efficiency, and productivity of its medical centers. SAIL includes 29 performance measures and assigns a star rating of 1 to 5 to each medical center based on their overall quality. The system allows VHA to identify areas for improvement and compare performance to other medical centers. VHA officials also use other tools such as the opportunity matrix, geometric control charts, and Symphony action triggers to manage medical center performance. Medical center directors are assessed using an appraisal system that considers medical center performance information, and their ratings are used to determine pay increases and awards. While SAIL has been evaluated twice in the past, concerns about its effectiveness remain, including the accuracy of star ratings in reflecting medical center performance.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance on evidence-building activities for federal agencies. Evidence can be quantitative or qualitative and can come from various sources such as research, performance measurement, and program evaluation. OMB recommends building a portfolio of credible sources of evidence and understanding the limitations of different sources. The evidence-building cycle includes assessing existing evidence, prioritizing new evidence needs, generating new evidence, and using evidence for decision-making. There are challenges in generating evidence, coordinating activities, and addressing cross-cutting research and policy questions within the federal government. Congress and OMB have taken actions to strengthen evidence-building activities and improve coordination. Tiered evidence grants and evidence-based approaches have been implemented in various agencies to incorporate evidence into decision-making and improve program performance. The selected agencies have aligned their evidence-building activities with the implementation actions outlined by OMB for selected cross-agency priority goals. Federal evidence clearinghouses and learning agendas are also used to synthesize and prioritize evidence. Evidence-building activities are fragmented within the selected agencies, occurring at multiple levels and entities. However, coordination processes have been established to address evidence needs.", "Federal agencies have been required by Congress and several administrations to take steps to reduce the petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions of their vehicle fleets. In fiscal year 2017, agencies were required to acquire alternative fuel vehicles and low greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles, increase the use of alternative fuel, and decrease the use of petroleum and per-mile greenhouse gas emissions. However, these requirements were revoked by an Executive Order issued in May 2018. The Trump administration issued a new Executive Order requiring a review of existing federal vehicle fleet requirements. Federal agencies have reported meeting most fleet energy requirements for fiscal year 2017 by acquiring low greenhouse-gas-emitting and alternative fuel vehicles and improving fleet management. The majority of agencies have seen an increase in the number of alternative fuel vehicles in their fleets over the past 10 years, particularly flex-fuel vehicles. Acquiring low greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles, as well as improving fleet management, has helped agencies meet the targets for reducing petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions.", "Confucius Institutes are organizations that promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries. They are affiliated with Hanban, which is part of the Chinese government's Ministry of Education. In the United States, there are 96 Confucius Institutes located at colleges and universities in 44 states and Washington, D.C. These institutes are funded and arranged by Hanban, and their management varies by school. While some concerns have been raised about potential Chinese influence and restrictions on academic freedom, officials from case study schools have stated that Confucius Institutes offer valuable resources and opportunities for international connections. To improve the institutes, suggestions include making the agreements governing the institutes publicly available, clarifying the U.S. school's decision-making authority, and addressing concerns about teacher selection. Overall, Confucius Institutes aim to provide educational and cultural exchange between China and other countries.", "From fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, there were 445 State/INL and USAID M\u00e9rida Initiative projects active. State/INL funded 388 projects, while USAID funded 57. State/INL projects focused on training and assistance to Mexican officials, as well as providing equipment. USAID projects aimed to address corruption, promote trust in government, and prevent crime and violence. State/INL allocated $542 million and USAID allocated $182 million for assistance to Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative during this period. State/INL and USAID work with the Government of Mexico to outline plans and objectives for the projects. State/INL and USAID manage and fund the projects through contracts, grants, and agreements with various organizations. State/INL and USAID officials are responsible for monitoring the projects, including reviewing progress reports, conducting site visits, and communicating with implementers. However, a review of 15 State/INL projects found that the agency only followed key monitoring practices about half of the time. Specifically, there were gaps in documentation for staff certifications and designation letters, as well as a lack of monitoring plans and inconsistent collection of progress reports. State/INL also did not consistently track performance data against established measures for four selected projects. This lack of consistent monitoring practices hinders the agency's ability to assess project performance and make necessary improvements.", "Summary:\n\nThe United States has maintained a cooperative relationship with North Macedonia since it gained independence in 1991. The US recognized North Macedonia in 1994 and established diplomatic relations in 1995. The US and EU mediated a resolution to a civil conflict in 2001. In recent years, North Macedonia has experienced political turmoil and democratic backsliding. The US has provided democracy assistance to promote rule of law, political processes, citizen engagement, and free media. USAID has provided approximately $38 million in democracy assistance, focusing on civil society and political competition. NED has awarded 72 grants totaling nearly $4.2 million, mainly in the areas of good governance, independent media, and interethnic relations.", "Opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and methadone can be used to treat pain but have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a type of substance use disorder characterized by loss of control, risky use, impaired social functioning, tolerance, and withdrawal. Treatment for OUD typically includes medication and behavioral health services. Screening, outpatient counseling, inpatient services, and medication-assisted treatment are common treatment options. Medicaid programs vary by state but generally cover OUD services for pregnant women during and after pregnancy, with some states extending coverage beyond 60 days postpartum. Medicaid can also be supplemented with SAMHSA grants to provide additional coverage for pregnant and postpartum women with OUD. The federal government is also implementing efforts to improve access to services for pregnant and postpartum women with OUD under the Maternal Opioid Misuse model.", "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responsible for housing federal inmates and providing a safe environment for both inmates and employees. There are 122 prisons operated by the BOP, each with different security levels. In fiscal year 2019, there were 149,701 inmates housed in BOP prisons, with 15,664 correctional officers responsible for their supervision. In 2012, the BOP conducted a pilot study on the use of pepper spray to increase safety and prevent injuries to staff and inmates. Pepper spray was gradually implemented across different security levels in BOP prisons. It is used in incidents that require immediate or calculated use of force, and employees receive initial and annual refresher training on its use. In the pilot study, pepper spray was found to reduce containment time and staff injuries, but had a slight increase in minor inmate injuries. Overall, BOP employees reported that pepper spray has been effective in enhancing safety and deterring incidents. However, some employees noted that it may be less effective for inmates with mental illness or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In 2018, pepper spray was used in 1,680 incidents across different security levels. There have been allegations of inappropriate use of force incidents involving pepper spray, but the majority of cases have been closed without any wrongdoing found. The cost of pepper spray, including canisters and training, is relatively small compared to BOP's overall budget. Pepper spray canisters have a shelf-life of 5 years and are purchased in bulk by each prison. Training costs are combined with other employee training. Pepper spray is not issued to employees in minimum security prisons, but incidents still occur at these prisons. BOP officials have not provided documentation to support their decision to not issue pepper spray to minimum security prisons. Factors that impact BOP employee safety in prisons include corrections officer understaffing, inmate drug use, use of unauthorized communication devices, inmate gangs, and insufficient corrections training. BOP officials are taking steps to mitigate these challenges.", "Navy shipbuilding is a complex and costly process that involves the development, design, and construction of ships. The acquisition phase of shipbuilding only accounts for 30% of the total life-cycle cost, with the remaining 70% incurred during the operational support (O&S) phase. Long-term sustainment costs are largely determined by decisions made early in the acquisition process, with 80% of O&S costs fixed at the time shipbuilding program requirements are set and the ship is designed. Planning for and designing reliability, availability, and maintainability into the ship is crucial for ensuring sustainability and affordability over the ship's entire life cycle. The Navy follows DOD and Navy acquisition policies and processes, including the creation of key acquisition documents, milestone reviews, and Gate reviews, to ensure that shipbuilding programs progress successfully and meet sustainment goals. Sustainment considerations are also supported by Congress through laws and requirements related to sustainment planning and reporting. Key acquisition documents include the Capability Development Document, which defines operational requirements and key performance parameters, the Life-Cycle Cost Estimate, which provides the estimated cost of the ship class over its life cycle, the Acquisition Program Baseline, which outlines cost, schedule, and performance goals, the Life-Cycle Sustainment Plan, which governs sustainment planning and execution, and the Independent Logistics Assessment, which assesses the program's ability to meet sustainment requirements. Various Navy stakeholders, including the ASN (RD&A), program executive offices, and shipbuilding program offices, are involved in the acquisition and sustainment efforts for Navy ship classes.", "Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage to the US Virgin Islands (USVI) in 2017, leaving residents without basic necessities and damaging critical infrastructure. The US government declared a major disaster and provided assistance through various programs, including the Public Assistance program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. These programs provide funding for the repair, replacement, and mitigation of disaster-damaged public infrastructure. FEMA, within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating disaster response and recovery efforts. The USVI faced challenges in implementing these programs due to limited local staff, a shortage of construction crews, and a difficult fiscal situation. To address these challenges, the USVI hired contractors, established a new Office of Disaster Recovery, and used the alternative procedures program for funding. The alternative procedures program provides fixed-cost estimates for projects, but accurate forecasting is challenging due to the unique circumstances of the USVI. Overall, FEMA has obligated over $1.9 billion in grant funding for projects in the USVI, but there are still ongoing challenges in the recovery process.", "Climate change poses various risks to the environment and economy in the United States, including extreme temperatures, heavy precipitation, flooding, and forest fires. These risks are projected to increase in the future. Climate change also affects extreme weather events, making them more frequent and intense. Without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to enhance climate resilience, climate change will result in substantial economic losses. Future climate risks are uncertain and depend on factors such as greenhouse gas emissions. Enhancing climate resilience requires a risk management approach, and federal agencies can use enterprise risk management to identify, assess, and manage risks. The Disaster Resilience Framework provides guidance for federal action to promote resilience to natural disasters, including climate change. Climate resilience projects can have benefits in terms of protecting life and property, but more research is needed to assess the benefits comprehensively. Strategic federal investments in climate resilience projects are necessary to address the most significant climate risks, as mainstreaming efforts alone may not be sufficient. Currently, federal investment in such projects is limited, and there is a lack of government-wide strategic planning for climate change. The federal government can improve its approach by coordinating, prioritizing, and consolidating strategic priorities and investing in projects specifically designed to enhance climate resilience.", "The F-35 Lightning II program is a joint venture between the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as international partners and foreign military sales customers, with the goal of developing and fielding next-generation strike fighter aircraft. The program includes three F-35 variants that are intended to replace or complement legacy fighter aircraft. The program has been fielding and operating a growing fleet of aircraft since 2018, with plans to expand the fleet to over 1,100 aircraft by 2023. The F-35 program relies heavily on contractors, with Lockheed Martin responsible for managing the overall aircraft system and Pratt & Whitney responsible for the engine. Sustainment of the F-35 fleet is managed by the F-35 Joint Program Office and a Hybrid Product Support Integrator organization. The program has developed a common, global support solution, including a shared pool of spare parts. However, the F-35 aircraft performance is not meeting warfighter requirements, largely due to spare parts shortages. The F-35 supply chain does not have enough spare parts available, leading to lower aircraft availability and capability rates. The F-35 program is taking actions to increase the availability of spare parts and repair broken parts, but challenges remain. The program has also revised its sustainment plans to better align requirements and funding. However, the highly concurrent nature of the program, with ongoing development and redesign, poses additional challenges.", "The Cannon Building, the oldest congressional office building, is currently undergoing renovations to address its deficiencies and update its facilities. The project began in 2004 and is expected to be completed at a final cost between $828 million and $866 million. The renovation includes the replacement of outdated systems, refurbishment of windows and the installation of a new roof, preservation of the exterior, and improvements to accessibility and security. Phase 0 and Phase 1 of the project have been completed, and Phase 2 is currently in progress. The project has experienced cost pressures due to unforeseen conditions, design issues, and changes in scope. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has implemented risk analysis and mitigation strategies and is updating its cost estimates to better manage the project's costs.", "The purpose of federal banking supervision is to ensure the safe and sound operation of depository institutions and compliance with banking laws. The supervision is carried out by three federal banking regulators: the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC. These regulators have the authority to examine depository institutions both off-site and on-site. On-site examinations allow for continuous analysis and adjustments to the supervisory strategy. Each regulator conducts a full-scope, on-site examination of the institutions they oversee at least once every 12 months. They also issue supervisory guidance to outline their expectations and priorities for banking institutions. The regulators have made efforts to enhance the forward-looking nature of supervision and have revised policies and procedures to address management weaknesses and improve the identification and communication of supervisory concerns. They employ enforcement actions, both formal and informal, to address concerns that arise during the examination process. The regulators' policies and procedures related to risk management and supervisory concerns align with leading risk-management practices.", "The Army Facilities Standardization Program (AFSP) aims to achieve savings and benefits in the programming, design, and construction of Army facilities. The AFSP operates through nine Centers that develop and manage standard design packages for designated facility types. These standard designs must comply with the Department of Defense's Unified Facilities Criteria and general Army standards. The Centers also participate in project teams, review waiver requests, and conduct post-occupancy evaluations. However, the Army lacks performance measures to assess the consistent application of standard designs and the program's support for AFSP objectives. The Army also lacks data on the effects of standard designs in reducing costs and time and the number of change orders. Developing and implementing performance measures would enable the Army to track progress and support DOD's goals of simplifying and reducing costs in procurement.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in strengthening its management functions, but there is still more work to be done. As of March 2019, DHS had met three out of five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List. It has partially met the remaining two criteria. To fully meet these criteria, DHS needs to make additional progress in identifying and allocating resources, as well as demonstrating sustained progress. This includes addressing skills gaps in critical areas and improving employee engagement and morale. DHS also faces challenges in modernizing its financial management systems. Strong leadership commitment and involvement is crucial for successful management improvement. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified 26 priority recommendations for DHS, many of which require the attention of acting officials and top leadership. Committed and consistent leadership will be critical in addressing these recommendations. GAO will continue to monitor DHS's progress and work with the department to strengthen its management functions.", "The General Services Administration (GSA) acts as the primary real estate agent for the federal government, leasing privately owned buildings when federally owned space is not available. GSA delegates leasing authority to regional commissioners and leasing contracting officers. Under GSA leases, GSA serves as the lessee and pays rent to the lessor, while the tenant agency pays rent to GSA. GSA uses different processes to lease space depending on the size and cost of the lease. The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is used for certain office space leases larger than 500 square feet. For high-value leases, GSA must submit a prospectus to the House and Senate authorizing committees for approval. GSA manages over 8,000 leases, with 4% having annual rents above a certain threshold. GSA leases differ from commercial leases in that GSA proposes the lease requirements. GSA has made efforts to streamline its leases and developed leasing products and tools. Potential lessors find GSA leases attractive due to the government's creditworthiness and long average occupancy, but there are challenges such as the volume and complexity of lease requirements, the structure of rent payments, and reimbursement for tenant improvements. Lessors may increase bid prices in response to these challenges.", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to develop a Space Launch System (SLS) and continue development of a crew vehicle and infrastructure at Kennedy Space Center. The SLS program was established in 2011 and aligned with the requirements of the Orion program in 2012. The Exploration Systems Development (ESD) organization manages and integrates the human space exploration programs. The EGS program was established to modernize Kennedy Space Center for the integration, processing, and launch of the SLS and Orion. The Mobile Launcher, Vehicle Assembly Building, and Crawler-Transporter are key components of the EGS program. The SLS is intended to launch an uncrewed Orion spacecraft for Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1), and a crewed mission for Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2). NASA has established cost and schedule baselines for these programs and uses incentive contracts with Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The EM-1 launch readiness date has been delayed to December 2019, with a potential extension to June 2020. There has been a 31-month delay from the original baseline schedules. Ongoing technical challenges and production issues with the SLS and Orion have contributed to the schedule delays. NASA's reporting of cost data is not fully transparent, and there have been cost increases for both the SLS and Orion programs. The development of the core stage for the SLS has faced challenges, particularly with the Stage Controller hardware and software needed for testing. Additional delays in core stage development could further impact the schedule. NASA has identified 6 to 12 months of risk to the EM-1 launch date, which does not include the potential effects of the recent government shutdown.", "Medicare Part D beneficiaries in 2017 were frequently prescribed opioids, leading to significant spending of $3.4 billion. Beneficiaries who were at risk for opioid misuse were more likely to be under 65, female, and dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. To combat this issue, many state Medicaid programs have implemented lock-in programs to limit access to controlled substances. However, some individuals have found ways to avoid these programs by increasing out-of-pocket payments. State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) track controlled substance prescriptions to prevent misuse. Medicare also established a framework for plan sponsors to identify and mitigate at-risk beneficiaries through case management. This process includes two steps: identifying potentially at-risk beneficiaries based on key clinical factors, and using case management to determine which beneficiaries are actually at risk. Plan sponsors have three coverage limitation tools at their disposal: frequently abused drugs prescriber lock-in, frequently abused drugs-dispensing pharmacy lock-in, and beneficiary specific point-of-sale claim edit. After a 30-day period of case management, the plan sponsor will determine whether the beneficiary is at risk or not and send a second notification letter accordingly. The Medicare DMP framework also requires reporting of case management results and coverage limitations to CMS. While plan sponsors and experts generally viewed the Medicare DMP framework positively, communication, collaboration, and flexibility among stakeholders were identified as key factors for success. Additionally, the criteria for DMPs should be periodically reassessed and adjusted based on outcomes and evidence.", "The Air Force has identified ABMS (Advanced Battle Management System) as its solution to support the development of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities. ABMS is intended to replace and modernize the capabilities of the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). The Air Force has changed the scope of ABMS to align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy, and it is now a multidomain command and control family of systems. The Air Force plans to use a flexible acquisition approach for ABMS, breaking up technology development into short-term efforts to increase innovation and deliver capabilities more quickly. However, the Air Force has not established a plan or business case for ABMS, including requirements, mature technologies, cost estimates, and an affordability analysis. Congress has implemented reporting requirements and the Air Force has awarded short-term development contracts, but the full requirements and capabilities of ABMS are not yet defined. The Air Force has also not identified a development schedule for ABMS. Furthermore, the Air Force has started development activities without first identifying the technologies needed for ABMS, which raises concerns about the maturity of those technologies when needed. Overall, the lack of a solid business case increases the risk of cost and schedule overruns and may impact Congress's oversight responsibilities.", "The Office of Federal Student Aid within the Department of Education administers federal student aid programs, including the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Under this program, Education issues federal loans to students, which are then serviced by loan servicers. Currently, Education contracts with nine loan servicers to handle the billing and other services for over $1 trillion in outstanding student loans. Only Direct Loans are eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and the temporary expanded process. Borrowers interested in loan forgiveness under the PSLF program must eventually transfer their loans to Education's designated PSLF loan servicer. The PSLF program provides forgiveness on the remaining balance of Direct Loans after borrowers have met all program requirements, which include working full-time for at least 10 years in a qualifying public service job and making 120 on-time monthly loan payments. However, only a small percentage of borrowers have been granted loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. As of March 2019, the PSLF servicer had denied 99 percent of loan forgiveness applications, primarily due to borrowers not yet making 120 qualifying payments. Denial rates are also high for the temporary expanded process, with Education denying 99 percent of completed requests. Many borrowers are confused by the requirements of the PSLF program and the temporary expanded process, and Education has made efforts to provide more comprehensive guidance and instructions to loan servicers and borrowers. However, Education has not fully implemented some recommendations made to address these issues. In addition, the agency's outreach to borrowers about the PSLF program and the temporary expanded process is limited, which reduces awareness and understanding of these programs. To improve service to borrowers, Education must expand outreach efforts, streamline processes, and provide more information to help borrowers catch and resolve errors.", "Strategic human capital management is crucial for federal agencies like the VA to maximize performance and accountability. The effectiveness of personnel management efforts directly impacts an agency's ability to carry out its mission. The VA has faced challenges in areas such as disaster response and healthcare due to staffing shortages and poor leadership. The agency has struggled to recruit and retain skilled personnel, leading to significant healthcare shortfalls for veterans. The GAO has made several priority recommendations to address these issues, including improving performance management and employee misconduct reporting. Additionally, the federal government as a whole faces challenges in strategically managing its workforce, with skills gaps playing a significant role in many high-risk areas. The current federal personnel system faces structural challenges that hinder recruitment, retention, and development of workers. Going forward, it is crucial for the OPM and federal agencies to address these human capital problems through workforce analytics and the development of modern and effective systems.", "The F-35 program was initiated in 2001 to develop a fifth-generation fighter aircraft for the U.S. military. The program aims to replace aging aircraft and provide enhanced capabilities using radar-evading technology and advanced sensors. The program includes three variants of the F-35 aircraft: conventional takeoff and landing, short takeoff and vertical landing, and carrier-suitable. The complete F-35 air system consists of eight elements, including training and maintenance systems. However, there are challenges with the Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) that supports the program's logistics tools. The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to replace ALIS with a new system called ODIN. The program has faced significant cost and schedule growth, and as of 2019, the total cost estimate for the F-35 program is over $428 billion, with sustainment costs projected to be $1.2 trillion over its planned lifespan. Operational testing of the F-35 is ongoing, and deficiencies have been identified. The program's reliability and maintainability (R&M) performance has shown some improvement but more actions are needed to meet targets. The program is also transitioning to Block 4 modernization activities using a Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) approach. The F-35 program has experienced delays in completing testing, particularly in cybersecurity testing and the development of the aircraft simulator. Despite these challenges, the program plans to proceed with full-rate production between September 2020 and March 2021.", "The Secret Service has two main responsibilities: protection and criminal investigations. The Office of Protective Operations oversees protective divisions such as the Presidential Protective, Vice Presidential Protective, and Uniformed Divisions. These divisions provide protection for the President, Vice President, and their families, including during foreign trips. The Office of Investigations manages field activities and is responsible for investigating crimes related to the nation's financial systems, threats to protected persons and facilities, and cybercrimes. Special agents also investigate financial crimes and provide assistance in finding missing and exploited children. The Secret Service has three phases for a special agent's career: Career Entry/Field Office Assignment, Protective Assignment, and Post-Protective Field, Protection, or Headquarters Assignment. Special agents are paid according to the Office of Personnel Management's general schedule, with the option for law enforcement availability pay. The Office of Investigations supports protective operations by providing temporary protective assignments, investigating protective intelligence, and protecting critical systems. Special agents in the office can also support periods of increased protection demand and develop relationships with local law enforcement. Investigations work also helps maintain employee retention and work-life balance. It is important for Phase 1 special agents to work on certain types of investigations that can prepare them for protective assignments, such as protective intelligence and cyber investigations.", "Agencies dispose of excess property through GSA's property disposal process. Excess property is declared and reported as such by agencies on GSA's disposal system, GSAXcess. Other federal agencies can then request the excess property for their own use or provide it to non-federal recipients. If no federal agency requests the property, a State Agency for Surplus Property can request it and provide it to eligible non-federal entities. Unsold property may be auctioned or destroyed. Some agencies, like USDA and DOE, have independent authorities to provide excess property to non-federal recipients. USDA allows eligible recipients to screen for property before it is declared excess, while DOE makes property available to non-federal recipients after internal agency screening. Agencies are required to report property provided to non-federal recipients to GSA. However, monitoring and oversight of the property provided is often lacking or inconsistent. There are instances where property is disposed of prematurely, not used, or not used within required time frames. Agencies have assigned responsibilities for monitoring, but there is a lack of consistent monitoring practices. There are discrepancies between data provided by agencies and the data maintained by the non-federal recipients. Overall, there is a need for better oversight and communication to ensure that property provided to non-federal recipients is used appropriately.", "Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made efforts to improve its recruitment and hiring of law enforcement officers, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). CBP increased its recruitment budget and participation in recruitment events, and increased the use of recruitment incentives for hard-to-fill locations. As a result, CBP saw an increase in the number of applications for law enforcement positions. CBP also made improvements to its hiring process, including reducing the time-to-hire and increasing the percentage of applicants that are hired. However, CBP officials noted that the hiring process remained lengthy and that certain steps, such as the polygraph examination, were time-consuming and challenging for candidates. To address these challenges, CBP hired a contractor to help recruit and hire law enforcement officers. The contractor is responsible for enhancing CBP's recruitment efforts and managing the hiring process. While it is too early to determine the impact of these initiatives, CBP officials hope that they will help increase the number and quality of applicants and improve retention rates.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides long-term care to eligible veterans through a variety of programs. These programs include institutional-based care like nursing homes and noninstitutional programs like home health care. VA offers three institutional programs, including VA Community Living Centers, Community Nursing Homes, and State Veterans Homes. They also provide noninstitutional care through 11 home or community-based programs. VA strives to honor veterans' preferences for care and encourages them to age in their homes and communities. The number of veterans receiving care in VA long-term care programs has been increasing, particularly in noninstitutional programs. VA's spending on long-term care has also increased, with a higher proportion going towards noninstitutional programs. VA projects that the demand for long-term care will continue to grow, and their expenditures in this area are expected to more than double in the next 20 years.", "The ongoing GPS acquisition efforts are focused on modernizing and enhancing the existing GPS system. This includes adding a more cybersecure ground system to enable M-code, a stronger, encrypted, military-specific GPS signal. The aim is to overcome signal jamming and protect against spoofing. The Air Force's OCX program is responsible for developing and delivering the new ground system, which will replace the current system that lacks modern cybersecurity protections. The program has faced significant delays and cost increases since its inception in 2012. To mitigate the delays, the Air Force initiated two additional programs, COps and MCEU, to provide interim capabilities. However, they do not offer the full functionality of the new system. The program has had difficulties due to incomplete systems engineering, inadequate process discipline, and cybersecurity implementation challenges. Efforts have been made to address these issues, but they remain ongoing. The program's cost and schedule baselines have been unstable and unexecutable, leading to multiple rebaselines. The latest baseline, established in September 2018, resulted from a critical Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach. The program has implemented a new software development approach to improve efficiency and address defects. However, there are still risks to the proposed schedule, and new risks have emerged since its establishment. The program is expected to continue for approximately two more years, with delivery and acceptance of the new system. After acceptance, there will be government-run developmental testing before the system can be transitioned to operations. The program's current contract period ends in June 2021, so acceptance needs to happen before that date.", "The Summary for this text is: The DATA Act, signed into law in 2014, required the establishment of a pilot program to develop recommendations for standardized reporting elements, elimination of duplication in financial reporting, and reduction of compliance costs for recipients of federal awards. The pilot program had a grants component led by HHS and a procurement component led by OFPP. A report in 2016 found that the grants portion was on track, but the procurement portion needed improvement. OMB revised the plan for the procurement portion based on the report's recommendations. The findings from the pilot program informed the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and several Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals. The grant portion of the pilot met most of the statutory requirements and provided evidence to support recommendations for streamlining federal reporting. However, the procurement portion did not collect enough data to assess ways to reduce reporting burden. Contractors did not participate in the pilot, which affected the effectiveness of the pilot program. Overall, the pilot program had positive impacts on efforts to streamline reporting and reduce recipient reporting burden.", "The nine selected agencies reviewed in a 2019 report had policies consistent with the principles of scientific integrity outlined by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). These agencies addressed the components of scientific integrity either through their policies, related policies, or related actions. Each agency had policies in place to support the foundations of scientific integrity in government and the professional development of government scientists and engineers. However, not all agencies had taken actions to effectively communicate their scientific integrity policies to staff, provide oversight, and monitor and evaluate performance. Some agencies lacked scientific integrity training for staff and designated scientific integrity officials. Additionally, not all agencies had mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate the implementation of their policies or procedures for addressing alleged violations of scientific integrity. The report made recommendations for each agency to improve their practices in these areas.", "In response to Executive Order 13781, USAID established the Transformation Task Team (T3) in June 2017 to plan and lead the agency\u2019s reform efforts. USAID launched several internal reform efforts and participated in a joint State-USAID redesign process, resulting in a joint reform plan. USAID also developed a supplemental reform plan focused on internal issues. The reform efforts are intended to support bilateral partners in becoming more self-reliant and capable of leading their own development. USAID identified five objectives for its reform efforts: metrics for self-reliance, restructuring, national security, human capital processes, and maximizing investments. OMB generally approved the reform plans. As of July 2019, USAID has completed 19 projects and is implementing 12 others. USAID has identified approximately $33 million in estimated costs associated with its reforms. The reform efforts generally addressed nine out of the eleven key practices identified by GAO. USAID's reform efforts involve engagement with the private sector and the involvement of employees and key stakeholders. The reform plans were informed by external recommendations and employee feedback. USAID sought to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication through its reform efforts, including restructuring projects. The restructuring proposals were still awaiting approval from congressional committees as of June 2019. USAID is addressing high-risk areas and long-standing management challenges through its reform efforts, including the elimination of audit recommendations backlog. USAID's leadership has demonstrated focus and attention to the reform efforts. Overall, USAID's reform efforts have made progress in addressing key practices for organizational transformation.", "Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria impacted Puerto Rico in September 2017. The President declared a major disaster and FEMA's Public Assistance program was activated to provide funding for response and recovery efforts. The program includes funding for emergency work, permanent work, and hazard mitigation measures. Puerto Rico's agencies, public corporations, and municipalities are eligible to apply for the program. The alternative procedures of the program allow for fixed cost estimates for permanent work projects and provide financial incentives for timely and cost-effective completion of work. Puerto Rico requested to use alternative procedures for all large permanent work projects. Puerto Rico established COR3, a government office, to oversee the recovery efforts and administer the Public Assistance program. FEMA has obligated funds for emergency work and permanent work projects in Puerto Rico. However, the majority of funds have been expended for emergency work due to the immediate need for debris removal and assistance. Permanent work projects, such as the repair and restoration of infrastructure, take time to identify and complete. FEMA has implemented a manual reimbursement process to ensure fiscal accountability of the funds. The process is temporary and will be ceased once COR3's internal controls are reviewed and approved. There have been challenges with the recovery process, including workforce capacity constraints and delays in the reimbursement of emergency work. Various stakeholders have expressed the need for additional guidance and support.", "The National Defense Strategy is the primary strategy document for the Department of Defense (DOD), replacing the Quadrennial Defense Review. It is required to be updated at least once every 4 years and assesses the implementation of the strategy. The strategy identifies DOD's priority missions, force structure, and major investments required. The strategy falls under the President's National Security Strategy and is above the National Military Strategy. DOD uses the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) approach to provide analytic support to senior leaders, but SSA has not provided the needed support to evaluate force structure requirements. There are three main challenges with SSA: cumbersome and inflexible products, limited analysis that does not deviate from programmed force structures, and an absence of joint analysis evaluating competing force structure options and trade-offs. The SSA products are incomplete and outdated, and the services have been reluctant to conduct innovative analyses through SSA. The services also tend to make questionable assumptions in their analysis. Overall, SSA has not provided the analytic support needed by senior leaders.", "The U.S. commercial airline industry consists of network, low-cost, and regional airlines. Network airlines operate large hub-and-spoke operations, while low-cost airlines focus on point-to-point service. Regional airlines serve smaller communities on behalf of network airlines. These airlines rely on IT systems for various functions, such as booking, check-in, and flight planning. However, airlines face challenges in maintaining and enhancing their IT systems, particularly when it comes to replacing and upgrading older systems. The industry has also experienced consolidation, which has required airlines to merge different IT infrastructures. Additionally, the industry is shifting to digital merchandising and retailing, which requires access to real-time information. Airline IT outages can have various effects on passengers, including delayed and canceled flights, long lines, and increased costs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a limited role in responding to these outages but works with airlines to manage traffic when necessary. The Department of Transportation (DOT) focuses on ensuring airlines' compliance with passenger protection requirements and investigates complaints and incidents. However, DOT does not have specific regulations for airline IT outages. Data on airline IT outages are limited, but a review identified 34 outages affecting 11 airlines from 2015 to 2017. Outages were caused by a range of IT and infrastructure issues, such as hardware failures and software outages.", "Federal trust funds are used to link dedicated collections with their expenditure for a specific purpose or program. They are a way of accounting for money collected and spent by the federal government. Trust funds are different from private sector trust funds in that the government owns the assets, does not have a fiduciary responsibility to beneficiaries, and can change the purposes for which the money is used. There are different types of trust funds, including non-revolving trust funds, special funds, revolving trust funds, and public enterprise funds. These funds have their own dedicated collections and can retain accumulated balances. Trust funds can also invest their balances in U.S. Treasury securities. The total balance in federal trust funds has grown over the years, with some funds increasing and others decreasing. Many programs in the federal government are supported by trust funds, and some funds also receive income from general revenues.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides voluntary security guidelines to pipeline operators to enhance the security of their facilities. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified weaknesses in several areas of TSA's pipeline security program management. These weaknesses include updating and clarifying security guidelines, planning for workforce needs, assessing pipeline risks, and monitoring program performance. Pipeline operators and industry association representatives reported exchanging risk-related security information with federal and nonfederal entities, including TSA. TSA evaluates the vulnerability of pipeline systems through security assessments. The GAO made several recommendations to improve TSA's pipeline security program, including implementing a documented process for reviewing and revising security guidelines, clarifying key terms in the guidelines, developing a strategic workforce plan, updating the risk assessment model, and tracking the status of security improvement recommendations. DHS agreed to these recommendations and provided estimated completion dates for each effort.", "HUD's Working Capital Fund (WCF) was established in 2016 to centralize and fund federal shared services used across HUD offices and agencies. Its goals are to align incentives for efficient operations, establish accurate cost estimates, and improve planning and transparency. The WCF currently funds shared services agreements with external providers but plans to expand to include internal and additional external goods and services. The WCF is managed by several offices within HUD, including the WCF Division and business line offices. Business process analyses are conducted to identify efficiencies, but roles and responsibilities for implementing recommendations are not clearly defined. The WCF has performance metrics in place but does not assess the results of business process analyses. The WCF Handbook has been updated to include current policies and procedures. The WCF has recovered most of its costs through its price and cost allocation methodology.", "Approximately 2 million out of the 6 million veterans who received VHA services in fiscal year 2018 had at least one diagnosed mental health condition. The three most prevalent mental health conditions were Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Veterans with mental health conditions may be offered non-pharmacologic therapy, psychotropic medication, or a combination of both. Providers make treatment decisions based on factors such as VAMC resources, complexity of the condition, comfort level of providers, veterans' preferences, and logistics. VHA has established certain requirements for the documentation of mental health treatment plans, but there is a lack of clear guidance for mental health providers to document treatment plans in an easily identifiable way within veterans\u2019 medical records. This could lead to difficulties in accessing important treatment information during changes in a veteran's care. VHA is developing a new memo to address this issue.", "The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is designed to enhance the security of the United States and its partner countries by selling various types of items and services to foreign partners. This program provides multiple benefits, including reliable products, economies of scale, improved interoperability with the U.S. military, and stronger relationships with the U.S. government for foreign governments. It also expands the market for U.S. businesses and contributes to foreign policy and national security objectives. The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for the implementation of the program, with various components fulfilling different roles. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) administers the FMS program, sets policies, and oversees transportation operations. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) provides accounting services, while the military departments coordinate with purchasers and plan transportation. The U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) supports transportation through the Defense Transportation System (DTS), which includes military and commercial resources. Foreign partners can use their own funds or U.S. funds provided through grants or loans to purchase items through FMS. The fees charged to FMS purchasers for transportation services are calculated using either a percentage rate or an estimated price per item. These fees are collected into eight different transportation accounts and used to pay transportation bills. The combined FMS transportation account has experienced substantial growth over the years, reaching a balance of $680 million in fiscal year 2018. Collections have consistently exceeded expenditures since 2014, contributing to the account's growth. The main account has grown faster than the smaller accounts related to Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs. Management oversight of the FMS transportation accounts has been limited, with unclear guidance and a lack of reporting on the causes of balance growth. Daily reviews of the account balances have been inconsistently implemented due to unclear internal guidance. DSCA does not have guidance in place to ensure that funds remaining in BPC-specific transportation accounts after program closure are transferred to the Treasury. Overall, the FMS transportation accounts have experienced significant balance growth, and improved management oversight is needed to address this issue.", "Executive Order 13548, issued in 2010, aimed to increase the hiring and retention of individuals with disabilities in the federal government. Federal agencies were required to take additional actions such as implementing strategies for retaining federal workers with disabilities, making increased use of hiring authority for persons with disabilities, and designating a senior-level official to be accountable for meeting the goals of the order. In 2017, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a final rule amending regulations requiring federal agencies to engage in affirmative action for individuals with disabilities. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), EEOC, and the Department of Labor each have roles in advancing the hiring and retention of persons with disabilities in the federal government. OPM is responsible for executing, administering, and enforcing civil service laws and ensuring compliance with merit system principles that prohibit discrimination. EEOC enforces employment discrimination prohibitions and reviews and approves agencies' affirmative action program plans. The Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) provides national leadership in developing policy to eliminate barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. Agencies have exceeded the government-wide goal of hiring an additional 100,000 persons with disabilities in the federal government by 2015. However, retention rates for individuals with disabilities are lower than those without disabilities. There is no routine tracking or reporting of retention data for individuals with disabilities, including targeted disabilities, in the federal government. Improving retention efforts for individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce is important to meet the government's goals and ensure equal employment opportunities.", "Oil and gas exploration and production involve activities that disturb land, such as drilling wells and constructing infrastructure. If these wells are not properly reclaimed once they cease production, they can pose physical and environmental hazards. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holds bonds from operators to ensure compliance with lease terms, including reclamation responsibilities. These bonds can be surety bonds or personal bonds accompanied by financial instruments. BLM regulations allow for bond reviews and potential increases if operators pose a risk or fail to reclaim wells in a timely manner. If operators reclaim their wells, BLM returns the bond, but if they do not, BLM may use the bonds to cover reclamation costs. However, bonds do not provide sufficient financial assurance to prevent orphaned wells because they often do not cover full reclamation costs. Most bonds do not fully cover reclamation costs, and regulatory minimums for bonds have not been adjusted for inflation since the 1950s and 1960s. Additionally, bond minimums do not adjust with the number of wells they cover or reflect characteristics of individual wells, such as depth or location, which can significantly affect reclamation costs.", "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) in 1997 to gather consistent information on the physical condition of its public and multifamily properties. REAC inspects properties every 1 to 3 years using a risk-based schedule. They use a standardized protocol called the Uniform Physical Condition Standards to identify health and safety deficiencies. REAC's data system generates an overall inspection score for each property. Before releasing the score, REAC conducts a quality assurance process to ensure accuracy. They primarily use trained contractors to conduct inspections and have various departments involved in the inspection process. REAC also evaluates the financial conditions of multifamily properties and the management performance of public housing properties. The inspection process includes a handheld data collection device and a software program to help inspectors record and classify deficiencies. There are several quality assurance processes in place to ensure accurate and consistent inspections. Property owners have the option to appeal deficiencies identified during the inspection. Some participants in discussions about REAC's inspection process found it comprehensive and effective, while others noted inconsistencies. REAC has made changes to the inspection process in recent years to improve accuracy and address concerns. Overall, most properties scored in the mid- to high-80s on inspections, but a small percentage failed inspections. REAC has not conducted a comprehensive review of its inspection process since 2001.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has made progress in fulfilling the requirements of section 911, but there are still three remaining requirements that have not been completed. So far, DOD has completed seven of the ten requirements, including awarding a contract for a study on cross-functional teams, establishing these teams, and reporting on their establishment. The DOD also approved an organizational strategy that addresses key requirements and identifies actions to streamline the structure and processes of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. However, the organizational strategy does not include specific implementation steps for promoting a collaborative culture, as earlier drafts did. The DOD has also approved guidance on cross-functional teams, but more detailed implementing guidance is still needed. In terms of training, DOD has not approved the curriculum for training cross-functional team members and their supervisors, nor has it provided training to presidential appointees as required. Additionally, DOD has not completed the analysis of the successes and failures of its cross-functional teams. The EMSO team, which is working to improve EMSO capabilities, is facing challenges regarding funding and office space. DOD has designated existing task forces as cross-functional teams, but some requirements are not being met. Overall, more progress is needed to fully address the requirements of section 911.", "Sanctions are tools used by Congress and the President to influence the behavior of foreign governments, individuals, or entities in line with U.S. national security or foreign policy goals. Sanctions can take various forms, such as trade restrictions, asset blocking, limiting access to the U.S. financial system, and denying foreign assistance. They can be comprehensive, targeting an entire country, or targeted, focusing on specific persons, entities, or sectors. The U.S. also employs secondary sanctions that target third-party actors doing business with targeted regimes. The implementation of sanctions involves multiple agencies, such as Treasury, State, and Commerce, each with specific roles and expertise. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for designating entities for sanctions and publishes a list of individuals and entities subject to asset blocking and trade restrictions. State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) coordinates sanctions implementation, builds international support, and provides guidance to other agencies. Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) restricts exports, reexports, and transfers involving U.S.-origin items subject to sanctions. The agencies also rely on intelligence offices, such as Treasury's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), for information and analysis to support sanctions targeting and enforcement efforts. While the agencies assess the impacts of specific sanctions, they do not conduct broader assessments of sanctions' effectiveness in achieving U.S. policy goals, as this is done through interagency discussions led by the National Security Council (NSC).", "Medicare and Medicaid FFS are federal health care programs that provide coverage to individuals. Medicare coverage policies are established at the national level, while Medicaid allows for more flexibility at the state level. Both programs estimate improper payments through medical reviews conducted by contractors. The main type of payment error identified in both programs is insufficient documentation, which means providers do not submit enough evidence to determine if a claim was proper. Medicare has a higher estimated FFS improper payment rate compared to Medicaid primarily due to insufficient documentation. The differences in coverage policies and documentation requirements between the two programs contribute to this variation. For example, Medicare has stricter requirements for face-to-face examinations and physician signatures, and requires documentation from referring physicians for certain services. Medicaid, on the other hand, has more flexibility in implementing prior authorization, which helps prevent improper payments before services are rendered.", "The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) was in effect from January 5, 2015, until February 20, 2017. It prioritized the apprehension, detention, and removal of aliens who posed a threat to national security, border security, and public safety. Executive Order 13768, issued on January 25, 2017, laid out the Trump administration's immigration enforcement priorities, which included the removal of criminals, fraudsters, and those who pose a risk to public safety or national security. The 2017 DHS memo implemented these priorities and gave ICE and CBP officials the discretion to prioritize enforcement activities, such as targeting convicted felons or gang members. ICE issued memos and guidance to further implement the executive order. Prosecutorial discretion is the authority of an agency to decide how to enforce the law on a case-by-case basis. ICE arrests, detentions, and removals increased overall from 2015 to 2018, with the majority of those detained or removed being male aliens from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The number of arrests, detentions, and removals of non-criminals increased following the implementation of the 2017 DHS memo. ICE provided various release options for aliens in its custody, including bond, supervision, and alternatives to detention. The agency also oversaw the detention of aliens in facilities across the country, providing medical and mental health services. Finally, ICE removed aliens who had been determined to be removable and were not eligible for relief or protection.", "The EPA conducts risk assessments to determine potential health and ecological risks. These assessments, along with other factors, influence the EPA's risk management decisions. The IRIS Program, part of the EPA, prepares chemical risk assessments that are used by program and regional offices in making environmental protection and risk management decisions. The IRIS assessments go through a seven-step process, including scoping, data collection, and peer review. The IRIS Program has made changes to improve the timeliness and transparency of its assessments, including the use of project management principles and specialized software. The program also tailors assessments to meet the needs of different offices, reducing the time and complexity of the assessment process.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) included numerous changes to the tax code, with 86 provisions relating to business and international taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had to implement these changes in a relatively short time frame, establishing working groups and a temporary centralized authority called TRIO to oversee implementation. The IRS used its usual practices for implementation, including developing guidance, training employees, and updating technology systems. However, the short implementation time frame posed challenges, and some planned work was postponed. The IRS prioritized 33 TCJA provisions for initial implementation, focusing on retroactive provisions and new provisions. The IRS released various types of guidance to help taxpayers understand the new tax law. There were challenges with taxpayers relying on guidance that had not been finalized, creating uncertainty and guesswork. The Chief Counsel collaborated earlier and more frequently with the IRS's business operating divisions (BODs) for TCJA implementation, leading to more efficient and effective guidance development. However, the IRS has not identified or documented criteria for when enhanced collaboration would benefit guidance development. Documenting the parameters and procedures for enhanced collaboration would better position the IRS for complex or time-sensitive changes to the tax code. Treasury and IRS did not always assess the distributional effects of the regulations they developed, as required by Executive Order 12866, which establishes standards for regulatory planning and review. Tax regulations were exempt from review under E.O. 12866 until 2018, but an agreement between Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget subjected certain regulations to review. However, Treasury was allowed a transition period to obtain resources for the additional analysis required for economically significant regulations.", "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that grants individuals and organizations the right to access government information. It establishes a \"right to know\" standard, meaning that individuals can access information held by a federal agency without having to prove a specific need. Anyone, including attorneys, corporations, and organizations, can file a FOIA request. The agency is then required to provide the requested information, unless it falls under certain exemptions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees immigration, border security, and law enforcement, receives the most FOIA requests of any federal agency. However, DHS has struggled to process these requests in a timely manner and has a large backlog of unprocessed requests. The department has implemented various requirements aimed at improving its FOIA processing, such as updating response letters, implementing tracking systems, providing training, and posting records online. Despite these efforts, the backlog has continued to grow. In 2018, a recommendation was made for DHS to develop a comprehensive plan to address the backlog, but the department has not yet fully implemented this recommendation. As a result, DHS will likely continue to struggle with processing requests and reducing the backlog. One of the most common types of FOIA requests made to DHS is for immigration files, which contain information related to immigrants, asylum applications, and law enforcement activities. USCIS, CBP, and ICE are the main components within DHS responsible for generating documents in these files. USCIS is the custodian of the files and processes FOIA requests for them. However, USCIS and ICE do not have an agreement in place for processing FOIA requests that contain documents generated by ICE, leading to duplicative processing and delays.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) uses both military and commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) to meet its global communications needs. DOD acquires wideband capacity through purpose-built systems, such as the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites, as well as through commercial contracts. The military SATCOM architecture includes protected, wideband, and narrowband systems. The primary wideband system is the WGS constellation, but its capabilities are expected to degrade in the late 2020s. The Air Force plans to add more satellites to the WGS constellation and is considering the possibility of adding a 12th satellite. DOD's wideband SATCOM systems involve four interrelated segments: space segment, ground segment, user equipment, and launch vehicles and facilities. Wideband satellites operate in different orbits and use different radio frequency bands. DOD typically relies on C, X, Ku, and Ka-bands for wideband connectivity. The Wideband Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) is a key step in DOD's acquisition process that assesses alternative solutions for future SATCOM needs. The Wideband AOA, completed in June 2018, identified 11 alternatives for future wideband architectures. The AOA process was comprehensive and involved input from various stakeholders, including military services, operational users, SATCOM partner nations, and commercial SATCOM vendors. DOD also conducted pilot and pathfinder studies to test and improve commercial SATCOM acquisitions. The Wideband AOA found that integrating purpose-built and commercial systems into a hybrid architecture would be more cost-effective and capable than relying on a single system. However, DOD does not have a plan to implement the recommendations from the AOA.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a travel pay program that provides payments to service members and civilian employees for travel expenses. The program uses authorizations and vouchers to document and reimburse travel expenses. There are various entities involved in the process, including travelers, authorizing officials, certifying officers, the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).\n\nThe DOD travel pay program is subject to the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) requirements, which aim to reduce improper payments. However, the DOD has not been in compliance with these requirements for seven consecutive years. The DOD has not published reliable improper payment estimates, included all required elements for corrective action plans, or met reduction targets for improper payments.\n\nTo estimate improper payments, DFAS conducts post-payment reviews of travel vouchers. The DOD's reported improper payment rate for fiscal year 2018 was 4.59%, totaling $365.32 million. The DOD's total travel payments increased during fiscal years 2016-2018, with active duty servicemembers accounting for the largest portion of travel expenses.\n\nDFAS estimates that the annual average of DOD improper travel payments for fiscal years 2016-2018 was about $322 million, totaling $965.5 million. These improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments, and not all of them represent a monetary loss to the government.\n\nDFAS has identified errors such as claiming expenses automatically generated by the travel system and duplicate paid vouchers as sources of monetary loss. The DOD has implemented a Remediation Plan to reduce improper travel payments but has not fully implemented its requirements and some components are unaware of these efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the DOD's travel pay program has struggled to comply with IPIA requirements and reduce improper payments. The DOD has taken steps to address these issues but further efforts are needed to effectively mitigate improper travel payments.", "The Coast Guard owns or leases over 20,000 facilities, including 200 stations for search and rescue operations. However, much of its infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather and needs costly repairs. From 2005 to 2019, the Coast Guard received $2 billion in funds to rebuild or relocate damaged facilities. The condition of the Coast Guard's infrastructure is deteriorating, with almost half of it past its service life. As of 2018, there was a backlog of at least $2.6 billion for construction projects and maintenance. The Coast Guard has taken steps to improve its infrastructure management, such as identifying risks and mission-critical assets, and assessing vulnerabilities. However, it has not fully applied leading practices and key risk management steps. Recommendations include employing models for predicting investment outcomes, disposing of unneeded assets, accurately reporting project backlogs, and fully implementing the Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces various price indexes to measure inflation. The accuracy of these indexes is assessed based on factors such as the use of appropriate formulas and large sample sizes. BLS uses data collected for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) to produce three other price indexes. The CPI-U is used as the primary index, while the CPI-W and CPI-E are subpopulation indexes focused on specific groups within the urban consumer population. BLS also creates a \"chained\" index that accounts for changes in consumption patterns in response to price changes. These indexes are used to determine cost of living adjustments for federal retirement benefits, particularly in the case of Social Security. BLS receives input on its processes from advisory committees, external commissions, panels, and public comment. The National Accounts, produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), are a set of statistics on U.S. production, income, consumption, investment, and saving. The data collected by BEA differ from those collected by BLS. BLS faces challenges related to the accuracy and timeliness of its price indexes, as well as challenges in measuring inflation for older Americans. BLS has not evaluated the adequacy of the data sources used to produce the CPI-E and CPI-W, which raises concerns about the accuracy of these subpopulation indexes. Experts suggest that cost-effective methods could be used to evaluate the existing data, such as comparing Consumer Expenditure Survey data to third-party data. BLS is currently working on a project to improve the estimation of subpopulation indexes.", "Sanctions are imposed by the United States government in order to alter or deter the behavior of foreign governments, individuals, or entities. Sanctions can include limiting trade, blocking assets, restricting access to the U.S. financial system, and denying foreign assistance. There are two types of sanctions: comprehensive sanctions, which involve broad trade restrictions with an entire country, and targeted sanctions, which restrict transactions with specific persons or entities. The U.S. agencies responsible for implementing sanctions are Treasury, State, and Commerce, with each agency having units dedicated to sanctions implementation. Other agencies, such as Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and financial regulatory agencies, also play roles in sanctions implementation based on their expertise or broader duties. These agencies are involved in roles such as proposing sanctions, designating targets, enforcing sanctions, and providing guidance and support. The agencies have generally received steady or increasing resources for sanctions implementation in recent years, but have faced challenges in filling some positions.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established policies and processes for managing its acquisition programs, including acquisition management, requirements development, test and evaluation, and resource allocation. These policies and processes are used to deliver systems that address critical capability gaps and help DHS to achieve its missions and goals. The DHS Acquisition Management Directive and Instruction outline the policies and processes for major acquisition programs. The Under Secretary for Management is responsible for managing the implementation of these policies, while Component Acquisition Executives oversee programs with cost estimates between $300 million and less than $1 billion. Major acquisition programs are reviewed at various acquisition decision events (ADE) to assess readiness and to review and approve key acquisition documents. The Acquisition Review Board provides oversight and accountability for major acquisition programs. The Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management supports the Acquisition Review Board and manages program performance data. Testing policies and responsibilities are also established, including the involvement of program managers, operational test agents, and the Director of the Office of Test and Evaluation. The planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process is used to allocate resources to acquisition programs, with the Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation and the Cost Analysis Division supporting this process. Overall, the majority of major acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals, with some programs needing to revise their baselines or facing funding gaps.", "In recent years, the FBI has been replacing its Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) with the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system, which incorporates advancements in biometrics, including face recognition technology. The NGI system includes the Interstate Photo System (IPS), which allows law enforcement agencies to search a database of criminal photos using a photo of an unknown person. In fiscal year 2018, NGI-IPS returned about 50,000 face recognition search results to law enforcement agencies. The FBI also has another unit called Facial Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation (FACE) Services, which provides face recognition capabilities and can search databases owned by the State Department, Defense Department, and 21 states. FACE Services received 153,636 photos of unknown persons from 2011 to 2019 and performed 390,186 searches of various databases. The FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) are responsible for ensuring privacy and civil liberties are protected in the use of these technologies. However, in a 2016 review, it was found that the FBI did not update the NGI-IPS Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and did not develop a PIA for FACE Services in a timely manner. The DOJ approved the NGI-IPS PIA in September 2015 and the FACE Services PIA in May 2015, over three years after the NGI-IPS pilot began and FACE Services began supporting FBI agents. In addition, the DOJ did not publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) for the FBI's face recognition capabilities in a timely manner. The DOJ has since implemented changes to expedite the PIA approval process and continues to review and update its privacy processes. The FBI has conducted audits of the use of NGI-IPS and FACE Services to assess compliance with policy requirements. The audit results have not identified significant findings of noncompliance. Prior to deploying NGI-IPS, the FBI conducted limited testing of the accuracy of face recognition searches. However, the tests did not include all possible candidate list sizes and did not specify the false positive rate.", "The Federal Home Loan Bank System consists of 11 banks located in different districts across the United States. These banks are owned by member institutions such as banks, credit unions, and insurance companies. Each bank has a board of directors made up of member directors and independent directors. In recent years, there have been efforts to increase diversity on the boards, including the addition of more women and minority directors. However, there is still room for improvement. The banks are required to report on their diversity efforts annually and FHFA provides guidance and support to promote diversity. The share of women on the boards has increased from 18% in 2015 to 23% in 2018, while the share of minority directors has also increased. However, there is variation among the banks in terms of diversity representation. Overall, the representation of women and minorities on FHLBank boards is similar to that of other corporate boards and senior management in the financial services industry.", "The Tobacco Control Act authorizes the FDA to collect tobacco user fees for the purpose of funding tobacco regulation activities. From fiscal year 2010 through 2018, the FDA collected approximately $4.5 billion in tobacco user fees. Starting in fiscal year 2019, the FDA has ongoing authority to assess and collect $712 million annually. These fees are used to fund FDA's activities related to regulating tobacco products, such as preventing youth use, educating the public, and issuing regulations on marketing and advertising. The Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is responsible for executing FDA's tobacco regulation responsibilities, with the Office of Management and the Office of Compliance and Enforcement being the main offices involved. The user fees are calculated based on market share and are billed quarterly to manufacturers and importers. The FDA has procedures in place to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of user fee calculations, billing, and collection. Additionally, the FDA conducts a year-end reconciliation process to verify the completeness and accuracy of the user fee assessments.", "Air ambulance providers use helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft depending on the distance and location of the patient. Helicopters are used for shorter distances, while fixed-wing aircraft are used for longer distances. The patients don't have control over the choice of provider and are at risk of receiving balance bills. Privately-insured patients may receive balance bills if the air ambulance provider charges more than what the insurer pays. The high prices and emergency nature of air ambulance transports make it less likely for providers and insurers to negotiate contracts. Legislation to limit balance billing can target providers or insurers, but both approaches have their downsides. State authority to address air ambulance balance billing is affected by federal laws, including the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has taken steps to increase transparency in the air ambulance industry but has not acted on recommendations to assess available data and consider consumer disclosure requirements. Air ambulance providers have been adding bases, especially in rural areas and areas with existing coverage. The availability of information on base locations is being assessed by the FAA. A majority of air ambulance transports for privately-insured patients are out-of-network, resulting in higher risk of balance billing. The prices charged for air ambulance transports have significantly increased since 2012, posing greater financial risks for individuals with private insurance. Limited data is available on the extent and size of balance bills, but some states are collecting information through consumer complaints. Air ambulance providers typically suggest patients appeal to their insurers for increased payments before offering payment options or discounts. Discounts may be given based on a patient's financial situation, but not all patients receive them.", "Opioids, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, are commonly prescribed for acute and chronic pain. These drugs come with serious risks, including addiction, overdose, and death. Many patients who receive opioid prescriptions do not use all of the medication, leading to concerns about the safe and proper disposal of unused opioids. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all have initiatives related to patient disposal of opioids. The preferred method for patients to dispose of unused opioids is through take-back options, such as semi-annual events and permanent collection sites, hosted by the DEA. Patients can also use mail-back programs to deliver opioids to a registered collector for destruction. If take-back options are not feasible, the FDA recommends flushing opioids on its flush list down the toilet, as this is a permanent way to remove them from the home. Trash disposal is another option, but it may not be permanent and the drugs can still be available for misuse. Patients should mix the opioids with an unpalatable substance before placing them in a sealed container and throwing them away. The environmental impact of disposal options varies. Take-back options result in incineration, which is the only method that ensures opioids are permanently destroyed. Flushing opioids can introduce them into wastewater streams, while disposal in the trash can lead to opioids entering landfills and potentially contaminating water sources. Many patients do not dispose of opioids properly, with studies showing that only a small percentage use federally recommended methods. It is important for patients to promptly dispose of unused opioids to prevent misuse.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing significant supply chain challenges that are affecting the readiness of the F-35 fleet. The shortage of spare parts throughout the supply chain is causing F-35 aircraft to be grounded or unable to perform as many missions as necessary. The F-35 supply chain, which involves a global pool of parts shared by various military services and international partners, is not able to meet the demand for spare parts. In addition, the F-35 parts are breaking more frequently than expected and there is limited capability to repair them. As a result, the average time to repair an F-35 part is over 6 months. The DOD has not fully implemented several recommendations to address these supply chain challenges, including revising sustainment plans and conducting a comprehensive review of the supply chain. The DOD also continues to face challenges with the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which is intended to support operations and maintenance of the aircraft but has been plagued with problems. The DOD lacks information about the technical characteristics and costs of the F-35, which hampers its ability to plan for the long-term sustainment of the fleet. Overall, insufficient planning and inadequate information are at the core of the DOD's sustainment challenges with the F-35.", "The IRS Form 990-series return or notice must be filed by most tax-exempt organizations under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The form collects information about the organization's employees, governance, revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, employment tax compliance, and organizational issues. There are different versions of Form 990, including Form 990-EZ, Form 990-N, and Form 990-PF, which are used by smaller organizations or private foundations. Larger organizations are required to electronically file their returns. TE/GE (Tax Exempt and Government Entities) uses data-driven approaches, referrals, and compliance strategies to select returns for examination. The use of data has increased efficiency in identifying potential noncompliance, but the scoring system of the Form 990 model has not consistently predicted examination outcomes. The change rate, or the percentage of closed examinations with a change to the return, has been slightly higher for examinations selected using data compared to other selection sources. However, the scoring system has not improved change rates compared to pre-model queries, and there is little relationship between model scores and change rates. TE/GE has also developed a weighted disposal score (WDS) to measure the severity of examination changes, but its use has been limited due to questions about the consistency of weight development.", "American Samoa is a group of islands and atolls in the South Pacific. The main island, Tutuila, is home to most of the population and economic activity. The territory faces the risk of tsunamis and other coastal hazards. In 2009 and 2018, American Samoa was hit by a tsunami and a tropical storm, causing significant damage. The population of American Samoa is around 58,000, with a high poverty rate and low median household income. American Samoa has been under U.S. control since 1899, and residents are U.S. nationals but not full citizens. The U.S. government provides assistance to American Samoa and funds the majority of its revenue. Minimum wages in American Samoa have been gradually increasing to reach the federal level, with the highest wage industries projected to reach the federal level by 2027 and 2036. The economy of American Samoa has largely contracted in the past decade, with fluctuations in employment and declining earnings. The territorial government and the tuna canning industry are key sectors of the economy, but efforts are being made to diversify and reduce dependence on these sectors. Ecotourism has been identified as a potential opportunity, but federal restrictions on passenger air carrier service hinder its development.", "In 2017, three major hurricanes and wildfires affected a large portion of the United States. When disasters occur, state and local entities are responsible for disaster response, but they can request federal assistance through the Stafford Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating federal preparedness actions through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA is the lead agency in coordinating federal disaster response efforts across 30 federal agencies, and it issues mission assignments to other agencies to direct their assistance. FEMA made 1,515 mission assignments for the 2017 disasters, with total obligations of $7.8 billion. FEMA's contracting workforce plays a key role in post-disaster contracts, and the majority of the workforce is located in headquarters, but there are also contracting officers in each of FEMA's 10 regional offices. FEMA's contracting efforts are supported by the Disaster Acquisition Response Team (DART), which consists of contracting officers and specialists. FEMA has struggled with attrition in its contracting workforce. FEMA has a formal agreement to oversee regional contracting staff, but there have been challenges in implementing this agreement. After a major disaster is declared, FEMA establishes a joint field office to coordinate response efforts, and contracts supporting the disaster are returned to the regional contracting office after the office is closed. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 included provisions related to contracting, such as a preference for local vendors, the use of noncompetitive contracts based on the urgency exception, and the establishment of advance contracts. FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) were the primary users of advance contracts, and as of June 2018, federal agencies obligated at least $5 billion through post-disaster contracts in response to the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. The majority of obligations on post-disaster contracts were for services, particularly repair and maintenance services and call center services. A significant portion of the obligations for goods on post-disaster contracts was for subsistence items and electric wire and power distribution equipment. The competition rate for post-disaster contracts was about 75 percent. Agencies were able to award contracts without full and open competition by using the urgency exception.", "The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was enacted to ensure accountability and integrity among public officials in the federal government. It requires political appointees and high-ranking officials to complete public financial disclosure reports to prevent conflicts of interest. The act also restricts post-employment activities and established the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to supervise the ethics program in the executive branch. Agency heads are responsible for leading their agency's ethics program, and designated ethics officials coordinate with OGE. Inspectors General and the Department of Justice can investigate potential ethics violations. Executive branch employees are prohibited from working on matters that conflict with their personal financial interests, and they must adhere to bribery and illegal gratuities statutes. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) maintain data on political appointees, but there are limitations to the data's usefulness. The public has a right to access government records on political appointees, and organizations like the Partnership for Public Service and ProPublica collect their own data. However, more comprehensive and timely data should be made publicly available to promote transparency and accountability. OPM or PPO could be responsible for providing this data, but there are obstacles to both agencies doing so effectively. Additionally, the three agencies reviewed (HHS, Interior, and SBA) generally met ethics program requirements, but improvements can be made in documenting procedures and addressing workforce challenges.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues aircraft registrations based on eligibility requirements set by law. These requirements ensure that every aircraft engaged in international air navigation bears the appropriate nationality and registration marks. The law specifies that aircraft must be owned by certain eligible individuals or entities, such as U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, noncitizen corporations organized and doing business in the U.S., or government entities. The FAA imposes safety obligations on registered aircraft owners, who must maintain up-to-date information about the aircraft's operators and operations. Only the owner of an aircraft can apply for registration, and false information or attempts to avoid registration requirements can result in criminal penalties and revocation of the registration. In addition to a $5 application fee, applicants must submit a completed application form and evidence of aircraft ownership to register an aircraft for a 3-year period. The FAA also issues dealer certificates, which allow manufacturers and dealers to demonstrate and sell aircraft without a standard registration certificate. In 2018, there were approximately 71,000 registration applications received by the FAA. Different registration types are associated with various aircraft ownership structures, including individual owners, corporations, and government entities. Legal entities must meet specific requirements to register aircraft, including qualifying as a U.S. citizen in most cases. The FAA's aircraft registry serves as an owner registry and does not include information about aircraft operators. Trusts can be used to own and register aircraft, with each trustee required to be a U.S. citizen or resident alien. The FAA collects and stores aircraft registration information, which is available to the public and various organizations in the aviation industry, international civil aviation agencies, federal safety officials, and law enforcement agencies. Over the years, the FAA has made updates and clarifications to its regulations regarding registration and information requirements, including the use of voting trusts and trust agreements for aircraft ownership. In 2018, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 mandated the modernization of the FAA's information technology systems and a potential extension of the registration duration for noncommercial general aviation aircraft from 3 to 7 years. Beneficial ownership and legal information can assist law enforcement and safety authorities by identifying individuals responsible for activities and aiding investigations. Adequate information on beneficial ownership is recognized as an international standard for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Internal controls and fraud risk management are important for ensuring the effective and proper use of resources. The FAA has implemented measures and controls to manage fraud risks and comply with federal requirements.", "The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to improve financial stability and protect consumers in the United States. Section 961 of the Act promotes the performance and supervision of SEC staff activities through internal supervisory controls. The SEC has submitted annual reports to Congress stating that its controls are effective. SEC's internal supervisory controls are defined as processes established by management to monitor the consistent and proper performance of staff procedures. The SEC is responsible for regulating the U.S. securities markets, and it has organized itself into five divisions and 24 offices. The Section 961 Working Group was established to enhance efficiency and coordination in complying with section 961. The Working Group developed a control framework based on federal internal control standards to assess the effectiveness of internal supervisory controls. However, divisions and offices have not developed systematic policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of staff procedures. Instead, they rely on informal methods and varied processes, and documentation is insufficient to support their conclusions. This lack of written policies and procedures hinders SEC's ability to systematically assess the effectiveness of staff procedures as required by section 961.", "Federal agencies and critical infrastructures rely on complex and dynamic information technology systems. These systems are at an increased risk of attack due to their interconnectedness with other systems and networks, including the internet. As federal agencies increasingly use cloud computing, implementing effective information security controls becomes crucial. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires federal agencies to develop and implement information security programs and evaluate their effectiveness. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for developing policies and standards for information security in federal agencies.\n\nOMB has developed cloud computing requirements and established the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP provides a standardized approach to securing and assessing security controls for cloud services used by federal agencies. The program involves the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO), the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), federal agencies, cloud service providers, and third-party assessors.\n\nAgencies can choose different cloud service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), as well as different cloud deployment models, including private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.\n\nSince June 2017, all 24 CFO Act agencies have participated in FedRAMP, and the number of FedRAMP authorizations has increased. The majority of cloud service authorizations were for Software as a Service (SaaS). However, agencies and cloud service providers still use cloud services that are not authorized through FedRAMP. Various reasons for this include providers not meeting unique agency needs, the labor-intensive and expensive process of becoming FedRAMP compliant, and the perception that certain cloud services do not need to be authorized through the program.\n\nOMB has not adequately monitored compliance with the requirement to use FedRAMP for authorizing cloud services, which may contribute to agencies authorizing cloud services outside of the program.", "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leases federal lands to private entities for oil and gas development through auctions. Competitive leases are awarded to the highest bidder who meets the minimum bid requirement, while noncompetitive leases are made available on a first-come, first-served basis. The government collects revenues from these leases through rental fees and royalties. Rental fees are paid until production begins, and royalties are a percentage of the value of production. Bonds are required to ensure proper reclamation of lands affected by energy development. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collects and verifies royalties paid by companies that produce oil and gas from federal leases. However, key lease terms have not been adjusted for inflation or market conditions, and federal lease terms and practices differ from those of selected states. Raising federal royalty rates could increase overall federal revenue. The competitiveness of federal lands for development depends on factors such as regulatory burden and the location of resources. Interior has taken steps to assess the oil and gas fiscal system but needs to establish procedures for periodic assessments. Potential reforms to the leasing process have been considered but no major action has been taken.", "The U.S. older adult population is projected to steadily increase in the coming decades, with adults 65 or older making up nearly one-quarter of the total population by 2060. Several federal nutrition assistance programs serve older adults, overseen by HHS's Administration for Community Living (ACL) and USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The characteristics of older adults served by these programs vary, as do the types of assistance provided and the amounts of federal expenditures. The nutrition assistance programs are generally administered by state and local entities, with state agencies working with regional and local agencies to provide meals and monthly food packages to participants. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) provide broad information and guidance on the nutritional needs of healthy populations. The majority of older adults have chronic conditions, and nutrition is associated with the development of these conditions. Poor nutrition can contribute to negative health outcomes, but nutrients and diet can also prevent, delay, or manage many chronic conditions. Age-related changes and impairments can impact older adults' ability to meet their nutritional needs. Some older adults may have difficulty obtaining groceries or meals due to physical or mental impairments, impacting their nutrition. Medications and food insecurity can also affect older adults' ability to consume adequate nutrients. The federal nutrition guidelines, the dietary guidelines, do not specifically address the nutritional needs of older adults or the varying needs of different age groups of older adults. The guidelines focus on the nutritional needs of healthy individuals and do not account for those with chronic conditions. The guidelines are expected to evolve to address the nutritional needs of specific populations, but current research on nutrition and chronic conditions in older adults is limited. HHS and USDA officials intend to address the nutritional needs of individuals across the entire lifespan in future updates to the dietary guidelines, including a focus on older adults. Currently, federal nutrition assistance programs have nutrition requirements for meals and food provided to older adults, based on the dietary guidelines. Some programs also require nutrition education and other services to support older adults' nutritional needs. However, two federal programs that provide benefits for older adults to purchase food do not have specific nutritional requirements.", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created in 1968 to reduce the costs of federal flood assistance. It has four key elements: identifying and mapping flood hazards, floodplain management, flood insurance, and incentivizing flood-risk reduction. NFIP allows property owners in participating communities to purchase flood insurance, while the community enforces floodplain management regulations. The coverage limits vary depending on the type of property. NFIP also provides grants for flood-risk reduction and offers Increased Cost of Compliance coverage for mitigation measures after a flood. FEMA maps flood hazard zones, which communities must adopt, and these maps determine insurance premium rates and minimum floodplain management standards. As of May 2020, over 22,000 communities participate in NFIP. FEMA supports community-level flood mitigation activities through its Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) grant programs. These activities include hazard mitigation planning, enforcement of floodplain management regulations, and the use of protective structures. FEMA also offers the Community Rating System, which rewards communities that exceed NFIP requirements. At the individual property level, mitigation options include property acquisition, elevation, relocation, and floodproofing. FEMA administers three HMA grant programs: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA). HMGP funds projects to improve community resilience after a disaster, such as acquisition and elevation. PDM funds projects that reduce overall risk from natural hazards, while FMA funds flood mitigation projects for properties insured under NFIP. FMA grants are only used for flood mitigation, while HMGP and PDM can be used for other hazards as well. The three programs have different funding levels and eligibility criteria. HMA grants cover a portion of project costs, with a percentage determined by the program and the type of property being mitigated. Funding levels for the programs vary and depend on disaster declarations and annual appropriations.", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 instructed NASA to develop the Space Launch System (SLS) and continue development of a crew vehicle. NASA established the SLS launch vehicle program in 2011 and aligned the requirements for the Orion program with the SLS and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) programs in 2012. NASA sets cost and schedule baselines for major projects, and if costs exceed the baseline by more than 30%, the program must be reauthorized by Congress. NASA tied the SLS and EGS baselines to the Artemis-1 mission originally planned for November 2018, but delays have pushed the expected launch date to June 2020, with a further 6 to 12 months of potential delay due to ongoing technical challenges. The SLS program has experienced delays due to underestimation of the complexity of manufacturing and assembling the core stage engine section. The Orion program has also faced delays, particularly with the European Service Module and avionics systems. NASA has not adjusted the SLS and Orion cost baselines to account for shifting costs and reduced mission scope, resulting in challenges in accurately reporting cost growth. The Orion program is tracking a potential Artemis-1 launch date of October 2020. The EGS program has overcome previous schedule delays and is now targeting an Artemis-1 launch date of August 2020. NASA is currently reevaluating the development cost performance of the EGS program.", "The USDA has created several nutrition assistance programs to help vulnerable populations meet their food needs. Currently, eight programs focus on providing food to children. The USDA is responsible for overseeing these programs at the federal level, with state agencies and local organizations playing key roles in implementation. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires agencies to estimate and reduce improper payments in susceptible programs. Improper payments refer to payments that should not have been made or were made in incorrect amounts. The USDA reports annual improper payment estimates for four child nutrition programs. Inspectors General are also required to assess agencies' compliance with criteria related to improper payments. The USDA has taken actions to improve the integrity of child nutrition programs based on previous audit findings. These actions include providing guidance and training to states on oversight and verification processes. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in documenting noncompliance and addressing issues related to SFA financial management and application verification. The USDA has taken steps to address these concerns, such as issuing memos and providing additional guidance and training. Overall, the USDA has made efforts to improve program integrity but more work needs to be done.", "CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO) inspects pedestrians, passengers, and cargo at 110 land ports of entry (POEs) in the United States. Travelers are required to present valid travel documents, such as passports, when entering the country. Commercial vehicles with cargo also have to submit information in advance, including vehicle details, cargo description, and weight. CBP uses law enforcement databases to identify and target higher-risk passengers, vehicles, and cargo for inspection. Inspections at land POEs include preprimary, primary, and secondary inspections. Preprimary inspections involve radiation scanning and data collection on vehicles and travelers. Primary inspections involve document verification, questioning, and database screening. Secondary inspections may include further questioning, physical examination, or the use of detection equipment. CBP uses various tools and teams, such as canines and anti-terrorism contraband enforcement teams, to enhance inspections. There are plans to implement facial recognition technology at land POEs. However, many of CBP's policies and procedures have not been reviewed and updated in accordance with OFO's policy management requirements, leading to outdated guidance that does not reflect current processes or technology. CBP is in the process of updating some policies but cites difficulties and resource constraints as challenges to timely updates.", "The federal government plans to invest over $90 billion in IT in fiscal year 2019. However, previous investments in federal IT have often resulted in failed projects with cost overruns and schedule delays. Examples of failed projects include the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the Secure Border Initiative Network program, the Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program, and the Expeditionary Combat Support System. These failures can be attributed to a lack of disciplined and effective management, as well as a lack of oversight and governance. In addition, federal agencies continue to face information security deficiencies, as highlighted by examples at the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Food and Drug Administration. Congress and the President have enacted reform legislation to address these issues, including the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). The administration has also initiated efforts to improve federal IT and cybersecurity, such as the establishment of the Office of American Innovation and the American Technology Council, as well as the signing of Executive Order 13800 and Executive Order 13833. Despite these efforts, the management of IT acquisitions and operations in federal agencies still requires significant improvement. OMB and federal agencies need to implement the requirements of federal IT acquisition reforms and continue to address previous recommendations to effectively invest in IT.", "The CCAMPIS program is the only federal program specifically designed to support low-income parents in postsecondary education by funding child care services. Grants are awarded to colleges to either support existing child care programs or establish new ones. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, CCAMPIS grantees received about $15 million and $33 million, respectively. Other federally funded programs that subsidize child care, such as CCDF, TANF, and Head Start, may also assist college students. Under Title IV, students can receive federal financial aid if they demonstrate financial need. Student parents make up about 20% of undergraduate students, and many face challenges in staying enrolled and completing their degree. CCAMPIS grantees reported that about 3,320 student parents received subsidized child care services during the 2016-2017 school year. These grantees used the funds for various child care services, including full-time and part-time care. CCAMPIS grants can help schools meet the demand for child care services that on-campus centers cannot accommodate. However, there have been flaws in the calculations used to measure the program's performance.", "The National Response Framework outlines how various organizations, including federal, state, tribal, and private sector entities, should respond to disasters and emergencies. State and local governments, along with their respective emergency agencies, are responsible for leading disaster response and recovery efforts. Federal agencies, such as FEMA, become involved when state and local capabilities are overwhelmed. FEMA is designated as the coordinating agency for Emergency Support Function 6 (mass care, emergency assistance, temporary housing, and human services), along with the Red Cross. FEMA and the Red Cross work together to coordinate mass care services, identify resource needs, and address coordination gaps. Other federal agencies, voluntary organizations, and state and local partners also play supporting roles in coordinating disaster response efforts. FEMA faced challenges in responding to the 2017 hurricanes, especially Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, due to staffing and logistical issues. State and local governments are required to regularly assess their response capabilities and progress in order to qualify for federal funding. Co-location of staff from different organizations during disaster response enhances collaboration and communication. Challenges encountered during mass care coordination include miscommunication, insufficient shelter staff, difficulties in serving individuals with disabilities, extensive damage to shelters, damaged infrastructure, and insufficient supplies. Early relocation of survivors to hotels also posed challenges for mass feeding operations.", "The text provides an overview of the impact of nuclear or radiological events, U.S. efforts to combat nuclear or radiological smuggling, the goals and phases of the STC program, how the program operates, and the activities of the program. It highlights the devastating consequences of a terrorist's use of nuclear or radiological devices and the importance of countering these threats. The GNDA is described as the framework that guides U.S. agencies in implementing programs to detect and report on nuclear or radiological materials that are out of regulatory control. The STC program aims to enhance regional capabilities, guide coordination among STC cities, and encourage sustainability of nuclear or radiological detection programs. The program operates through a cooperative agreement between CWMD and eligible cities, with a focus on developing, integrating, and sustaining detection capabilities. The program activities include the purchase of detection equipment, training, and administrative costs. However, the text highlights gaps in data collection and tracking of program funds and performance, which limit the effectiveness of the program.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for securing the nation's civil aviation system. This includes implementing security measures for domestic and foreign air carriers. TSA does this through approved security programs and may also issue security directives or emergency amendments when immediate action is necessary. These directives can be based on threat information, events, or the results of airport assessments and carrier inspections. Air carriers must comply with these directives, but TSA can approve alternative measures if they achieve the required level of security. TSA conducts inspections to ensure compliance. As of March 2019, there were 46 directives in effect, mostly applying to passenger operations in specific foreign locations. The characteristics of these directives vary, including whether they apply to foreign or domestic carriers, their duration, and the security policies they address. TSA has a process for reviewing and updating directives, but there are inconsistencies in coordinating with air carriers and other stakeholders. Improved coordination would lead to more efficient and effective security measures.", "Available federal law enforcement data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 show that employees of federal land management agencies face a range of threats and assaults. The incidents varied in severity, from threats conveyed over the phone to attempted murder. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had 88 incidents, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) had 66 incidents, the Forest Service had 177 incidents, and the Park Service had 29 incidents. The FBI initiated less than 100 domestic terrorism investigations related to threats against these agencies. Most of these investigations involved BLM and were motivated by anti-government ideologies. It is unclear whether the number of threats and assaults is underestimated, as not all incidents are captured in the agencies' databases. Some incidents may be reported to local or state law enforcement instead. Employees may also choose not to report threats, considering them a normal part of their job. The agencies use various approaches to protect their employees, including deploying law enforcement officers, building relationships with external law enforcement entities, and educating visitors. However, agencies face challenges in protecting their employees, such as the requirement for employees to interact with the public and the dispersed nature of their work. Finally, the four federal land management agencies have not completed all required facility security assessments, which may expose them to risks in protecting their employees and facilities.", "Transnational criminal and terrorist organizations employ various money laundering methods to hide the source and destination of their illicit funds. The United States has identified fraud, drug trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, organized crime, and government corruption as the major criminal activities generating illicit proceeds for laundering. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a primary method used, involving disguising the proceeds of crime through trade transactions to legitimize their illicit origins. The volume and complexity of international trade transactions make them vulnerable to abuse, as it becomes difficult to detect individual illicit transactions. TBML schemes involve misrepresenting the price, quantity, or type of goods or services in trade transactions to transfer value and obscure the origin of criminal proceeds. Misrepresentation can be done through under or overinvoicing, multiple invoicing, providing more or less goods or services, or falsely describing goods or services. TBML can also occur through the Black Market Peso Exchange, where criminal organizations shift the value of proceeds between countries without physically moving money. Various U.S. laws, regulations, and agencies combat TBML, including the Bank Secrecy Act, Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, and agencies like ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, DEA, State's INL, and Treasury's FinCEN. The U.S. also participates in international bodies like the Egmont Group, FATF, UNODC, and WCO to address TBML. Different criminal and terrorist organizations, such as drug trafficking organizations and Chinese criminal organizations, utilize TBML to launder their illicit proceeds.", "The FirstNet-AT&T network contract consists of five task orders, four of which relate to the network's deployment. Task order 1 and 2 required AT&T to develop and deliver individual network deployment plans for each state, all of which opted in to allow FirstNet and AT&T to build the network. Task order 3 involves deploying, operating, and maintaining the network's core and providing prioritization and preemption capabilities for public safety users. Task order 4 requires AT&T to deploy Band 14 coverage in the states and provide deployable cellular assets for FirstNet users. The contract outlines a phased approach for deploying the network's capabilities and coverage, with the final operating capability expected in 2023. AT&T has met the first required nationwide network coverage milestone and is on track to meet the next milestone. AT&T has delivered thousands of Band 14 cell sites and is making progress in meeting state-specific coverage commitments. AT&T is also on track to meet the first device connection milestone, but there is variation in adoption rates across different types of users and states. There are a variety of devices being used on the network, and user experiences can vary. FirstNet employs various mechanisms to oversee AT&T's deployment and monitor contract performance.", "The Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, located in Oregon and California, covers 1.8 million acres and is known for its ecological diversity and rugged terrain. The area is fire-adapted, meaning many native species depend on periodic wildfires. The Chetco Bar Fire, which burned in the forest in 2017, was preceded by several previous fires in the area. The occurrence of large fires in the western United States has been increasing due to climate change and land use practices. To combat wildfires, a coordinated effort between federal, state, tribal, and local firefighting agencies is utilized. A variety of strategies and tactics are used to manage fires, including direct attack, indirect attack, and the use of ground and air-based assets. The Chetco Bar Fire grew slowly at first before undergoing rapid growth driven by strong winds. The initial firefighting efforts were unsuccessful, leading to the assignment of a type-3 incident management team to manage the fire.", "Uranium enrichment is the process of increasing the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope relative to uranium-238 in a quantity of uranium. Natural uranium consists of approximately 0.7 percent uranium-235, while uranium used in nuclear reactors generally consists of 3 to 5 percent uranium-235. Uranium for nuclear weapons requires a higher concentration of uranium-235. The process of reprocessing can convert uranium in a reactor fuel into plutonium, which can also be used for weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for verifying that nuclear technologies and materials are not diverted from peaceful to military uses. Most countries have an additional protocol with the IAEA, which provides more information on nuclear activities and gives the agency expanded access. Nuclear cooperation agreements, regulated by Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), are required for the export of certain nuclear material and equipment. The United States has 23 such agreements with other nations and entities. These agreements include nonproliferation conditions and require congressional review. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regulates exports of commercial nuclear technology. In negotiating nuclear cooperation agreements, the United States has pursued nonproliferation measures beyond those required by the AEA, such as prohibiting enrichment and reprocessing. Stakeholders have identified potential benefits of a nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, including limiting weapons-usable material production and retaining U.S. influence. However, concerns have also been raised, including Saudi Arabia's nuclear weapon ambitions and commitment to obligations, the extent to which an agreement would mitigate proliferation risks, the thoroughness of U.S. assessments of Saudi proliferation risks, and the impact on regional and global nonproliferation norms. The United States and Saudi Arabia have not made significant progress towards a nuclear cooperation agreement due to disagreements over nonproliferation conditions.", "In 2014, Congress mandated the development of a national maritime strategy and a national sealift strategy to address challenges facing the U.S.-flag fleet and U.S.-citizen mariners. The national maritime strategy was originally due in February 2015 but has been delayed. Stakeholders have identified two primary challenges: maintaining the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels and addressing a potential shortage of U.S.-citizen mariners. The increasing cost of operating U.S.-flag vessels compared to foreign-flag vessels and the declining volume of government cargo have contributed to these challenges. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) has identified options to address these issues but has not yet proposed any formally. The national sealift strategy is addressing the potential shortage of mariners, although the number of available mariners is uncertain due to data limitations. MARAD, the Coast Guard, and the maritime industry are working to improve tracking of mariners and to conduct a survey to determine the number of available and willing mariners. The working group responsible for the national sealift strategy has also identified options to increase the number of U.S.-citizen mariners.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) has not fully addressed deficiencies in the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) program. As of June 2019, only one of the three changes authorized by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) had been implemented. The other changes, including the implementation of a certification process and the elimination of self-certification, had not been implemented. SBA officials have stated that self-certification will not be eliminated until the new certification process is in place, which is expected to be by June 2021. SBA has also not fully addressed program oversight deficiencies, including the lack of formal policies for reviewing certifiers' compliance with their agreements and the lack of procedures for reviewing monthly reports. SBA has taken some steps to address these deficiencies but has no plans for further compliance reviews until the new certification process is completed. SBA also has not fully addressed deficiencies related to eligibility examinations, including the lack of formalized guidance and high rates of potentially ineligible businesses being identified. SBA has taken some steps to address these deficiencies but does not collect reliable information on examination results and does not conduct eligibility examinations of firms before they receive a WOSB award. These deficiencies limit SBA's ability to identify potential fraud risks and reduce ineligibility among businesses in the WOSB program. SBA has also not fully addressed deficiencies in the HUBZone program, including the lack of a documented risk assessment for recertification and the lack of documentation showing the implementation of a technology-based solution for the recertification process. SBA has not fully documented compliance with policies and procedures for certification reviews and has not completed planned updates to its internal policy manuals. SBA has also not fully addressed deficiencies in the Small Business Procurement Scorecard, including errors in the published scorecards and the lack of a process to ensure accuracy. SBA has proposed a two-phase program evaluation of the scorecard and has developed a procedure for reviewing scorecards prior to publication.", "The Defense Department (DOD) conducted a business case analysis to determine if consolidating the defense resale organizations would result in efficiencies. The analysis recommended consolidating the four organizations into a single entity with a single CEO and board of directors. It estimated that consolidation would result in net savings ranging from about $690 million to $1.3 billion in the first 5 years, followed by annual savings of approximately $390 million to $670 million. The estimated savings would come from reducing the cost of goods sold, reducing the cost of operating stores, and eliminating redundant personnel. However, the analysis may have overestimated the savings from reducing the cost of goods sold and underestimated the costs of IT consolidation and headquarters relocation. The analysis did not fully identify the amount of product and vendor overlap between the organizations, and the savings estimate may be overstated. Additionally, the estimate for IT consolidation may be understated due to the use of minor upgrades and partial replacements in the cost estimate. Overall, decision makers in DOD and Congress may lack confidence in the reliability of the savings estimates and may not have complete information as they consider defense resale consolidation.", "The Department of Transportation (DOT) consists of nine modal administrations and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST). Each modal administration has its own mission focused on enhancing mobility and safety, while OST oversees national transportation policy and intermodal transportation. In 2015, DOT created the Build America Transportation Investment Center within OST to serve as a single point of contact for project sponsors seeking finance programs and exploring innovative financing. In 2015, DOT was also required by law to establish a finance bureau to align and consolidate certain surface transportation funding and financing programs. The Bureau, located within OST, is responsible for managing and overseeing these programs, which include the TIFIA program, the RRIF program, the PAB program, and the INFRA grant program. The Bureau's responsibilities include administering the application evaluation process, streamlining approval processes, providing assistance to project sponsors, promoting innovative financing practices, improving environmental reviews and permitting, and sharing information on procurement costs and risks. Since its establishment in 2016, the Bureau has made progress in some areas but lacks a comprehensive plan and performance indicators to guide its efforts. DOT has established an organizational structure and a consolidated process for the Bureau to work with project sponsors, aligning with its responsibilities outlined in the FAST Act.", "The use of required and optional fields on comment forms on Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites allows agencies to collect identity information from commenters. However, anonymous comments are still accepted by these agencies. The APA does not require authentication of identity information, so there are no mechanisms in place to verify the validity of the information submitted. Some agencies have internal guidance for the different phases of the public comment process, but the focus and substance of this guidance varies. The treatment of identity information during the comment intake, analysis, and response phases of the process also varies among agencies. The posting practices of the selected agencies on Regulations.gov and agency-specific websites are inconsistent and not clearly communicated to the public. This lack of transparency limits users' ability to explore and use the comment data and can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the comments and how they were considered by the agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have standardized posting processes, but the SEC has not effectively communicated those practices to the public. It is important for agencies to clearly communicate their policies for posting comments, particularly regarding identity information and duplicate comments, in order to facilitate meaningful participation in the rulemaking process.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been purchasing health care services from community providers since 1945. Veterans may be eligible for community care when they face long wait times or travel long distances for appointments at VA medical facilities, or when certain specialty care services are not available at VA facilities. Currently, there are several community care programs, including the Choice Program, through which VA purchases care for veterans. Under the VA MISSION Act, VA plans to consolidate four of its community care programs into the Veterans Community Care Program by June 2019. VA also provides health care services to veterans and other eligible beneficiaries through additional benefit programs. The amount of funding VA receives for health care services is determined through the annual appropriations process. VA develops a health care budget estimate for two fiscal years based on the resources needed to provide care. The estimate includes the total cost of care, including direct patient costs and facility costs. VA uses the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to estimate the majority of resources needed, projecting 3-4 years into the future. Other methods are used for the remaining services. From fiscal year 2014 to 2018, VA's obligations for community care increased by 82%, from $8.2 billion to $14.9 billion. This increase was largely due to expanded use of community care through the Choice Program. VA projects that obligations for community care will reach $17.8 billion by fiscal year 2021. The number of veterans authorized to use community care increased by 41% from fiscal years 2014 to 2018, with approximately 1.8 million veterans authorized in 2018. VA estimates that at least 1.8 million veterans will continue to use community care by fiscal year 2021. Utilization of certain community care services has also increased, with outpatient services experiencing large increases. VA developed a separate budget estimate for community care starting from fiscal year 2017. The estimate is developed using the EHCPM for the majority of services, with other methods used for the remainder. VA plans to continue using the EHCPM to estimate resources needed for community care services.", "The United States prioritizes promoting respect for human rights as part of its foreign policy. When providing security assistance to foreign countries, the U.S. considers the advancement of human rights. Human rights training is incorporated into broader security cooperation and assistance efforts, with the responsibility shared between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State. Various statutes and authorities guide the provision of human rights training, including the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which requires Section 333 programs to include elements that promote human rights and respect for the rule of law. The DOD and State operate several training facilities that provide human rights training to foreign security forces, including the Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS), the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC), and the Center for Civil-Military Relations (CCMR). DOD does not systematically track all human rights training, but DIILS uses a case management system to track training provided under Section 333. However, limitations in the implementation of the system have led to questions about the completeness of the data.", "FEMA is the federal agency responsible for assisting with natural disaster preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery, particularly in relation to floods. The National Flood Insurance Act created the NFIP in 1968 to address flood damage and lack of insurance for property owners. The NFIP aims to minimize flood-related property losses by providing flood insurance and enforcing floodplain management requirements. FEMA oversees community compliance with NFIP requirements through visits and contacts, and communities can be placed on probation or suspended from the program for non-compliance. After a flood, NFIP communities must determine if repairs to damaged buildings meet the threshold for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage. Buildings that meet this threshold must be brought into compliance with NFIP requirements. The CRS program provides premium discounts for communities that exceed minimum NFIP requirements. Participating communities are classified and can move up in ratings by earning credits for flood mitigation activities. The administration of the CRS program is contracted out to a private company. Challenges in NFIP include difficulties in enforcing requirements, retaining floodplain management staff, and adopting new flood maps. FEMA uses community assistance visits to verify community compliance with NFIP requirements and provides technical assistance. The goal was previously to visit high-risk communities every five years, but this has changed with the development of a new selection tool that focuses on flood risk, community resilience, and interest in improving floodplain management. FEMA resources can be diverted to assist with disaster recovery efforts, leading to limited visits in some high-risk communities.", "ESG factors are becoming increasingly important for investors in assessing the potential risks and opportunities that may impact a company's financial performance. ESG standard-setting organizations have been created to improve transparency and consistency in companies' disclosure of ESG information. SEC rules and regulations require public companies to disclose material ESG topics. Institutional investors use ESG disclosures to monitor companies' management of ESG risks, inform shareholder votes, create ESG-focused funds or portfolios, and make divestment decisions. However, investors face challenges with the quantity and quality of ESG disclosures, including inconsistencies in quantitative disclosures and gaps in narrative disclosures. Investors engage with companies to request additional ESG disclosures and may submit shareholder proposals to influence companies' ESG disclosures. Companies consider legal and regulatory requirements, stakeholder engagement, assessments, and ESG disclosure frameworks when determining which ESG factors to disclose and where to disclose them.", "The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) was created in 1961 to counter hijackers and was transferred to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in 2001. FAMS's mission expanded after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and it is now responsible for deploying air marshals on U.S. air carrier flights. FAMS has thousands of employees and 20 field offices across the United States.\n\nFAMS prioritizes flights it considers high risk, such as those with known or suspected terrorists. Air marshals are expected to be available 24/7 and may be reassigned from regular missions to cover high-risk flights. The scheduling of air marshals is guided by certain guidelines to balance mission needs and their quality of life.\n\nConcerns about air marshals' health are a major issue. Air marshals often experience extreme fatigue, mental health issues, difficulties in maintaining a healthy diet, and increased frequency of illness. In a recent survey, less than half of FAMS employees felt protected from health and safety hazards. The number of workers' compensation claims filed by FAMS employees has also increased significantly.\n\nFAMS has initiatives in place to assess air marshals' health, including regular medical examinations and a Health, Fitness, and Wellness Program. However, FAMS lacks a comprehensive data system to maintain medical information and analyze trends among its workforce. FAMS is working on reviewing and evaluating software platforms to address this issue.\n\nOverall, FAMS faces challenges in ensuring the well-being and health of its air marshals, as well as effectively managing and analyzing health-related data.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing benefits to veterans, including health care, disability compensation, and financial assistance. In fiscal year 2019, the VA received a budget of $201.1 billion, with $86.6 billion allocated to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation, but has faced growing demand from veterans. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made numerous recommendations to improve the VA's management and oversight, with many of these recommendations still open. The VA has been designated as a high-risk area for health care, with concerns related to policies, oversight, IT challenges, training, and resource allocation. While the VA has taken steps to address these concerns, ratings for leadership commitment and action plan criteria remain partially met. The monitoring, demonstrated progress, and capacity criteria remain unmet. The GAO has made recommendations to address issues such as ambiguous policies, inadequate oversight, unreliable wait time data, and information technology challenges. The VA has made some progress in implementing these recommendations, but many remain open. The VA's capacity to address these concerns is also a challenge, with resources not yet allocated for some initiatives. Overall, the GAO's monitoring and demonstrated progress criteria for the VA's high-risk designation have not been met.", "Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets use wireless networks to enable voice and data communications. These networks consist of various components, such as cell sites equipped with antennas that transmit and receive radio signals to mobile devices. 5G networks also use smaller wireless infrastructure called \"small cells\" that can be installed on existing structures like towers, buildings, and utility poles. Base station controllers manage communications between the cell sites and the mobile switching center, which then directs the communication to landline phones, other cell phones, or the internet. Backhaul facilities transport the communications.\n\nSpectrum, a finite natural resource, is used to provide various wireless services to businesses, consumers, and government entities. Businesses and consumers use spectrum for mobile voice and data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, broadcast television, radio, and satellite services. Governments use spectrum for national defense, law enforcement communication, air traffic control, weather services, military radar, and first responder communications. Different bands of spectrum have different data capacities and propagation characteristics, making them more or less suitable for specific purposes. Low-band spectrum provides better propagation but lower data capacity, while high-band spectrum allows for higher data capacity but limited propagation.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are responsible for managing spectrum. The FCC allocates spectrum for consumer and commercial use, assigns licenses to entities, and makes spectrum available for unlicensed devices. The NTIA establishes policy on regulating federal spectrum use, assigns frequencies to government agencies, and oversees the potential release of federal spectrum bands for commercial use.\n\nWireless carriers have been deploying new generations of technology, and each development changes how people and businesses use mobile communication. The deployment of 5G networks will bring enhanced mobile broadband with greater speed and higher data capacity than previous generations. Carriers in the United States are currently deploying \"hybrid\" 5G networks that combine 5G and existing 4G technologies. In the future, carriers will need to replace their 4G infrastructure with new 5G equipment to deploy \"standalone\" 5G networks with additional capabilities.\n\nHowever, the deployment of 5G networks faces challenges related to spectrum availability. Mid-band spectrum is crucial for 5G deployment due to its network characteristics and interoperability with other 5G networks globally. Experts believe that the current allocation of mid-band spectrum in the United States is insufficient, leading to congestion within the band. Federal government users, or incumbents, face challenges transitioning to new spectrum bands, making it difficult to repurpose mid-band spectrum for commercial use.\n\nTo address these challenges, the FCC has taken actions to make additional spectrum available for 5G deployment. This includes auctions for low-band and high-band spectrum licenses and making the 2.5 GHz band accessible to nonfederal users. The FCC is also working to make more mid-band spectrum available, such as the auction of 280 MHz of spectrum currently used by satellite operators.\n\nThe FCC and NTIA have developed a spectrum-sharing framework in the 3.5 GHz band to increase the availability of mid-band spectrum for 5G. This framework separates users into tiers, with incumbents having first priority, followed by auctioned licensees, and then unlicensed users. The technology supporting this framework has been authorized for full commercial deployment.\n\nWhile progress has been made in making high-band spectrum available, the focus on mid-band spectrum has been limited due to the presence of incumbent users. The FCC has additional proceedings in progress that could make more mid-band spectrum available in the future.\n\nOverall, the FCC's efforts and the 5G FAST Plan aim to push more spectrum into the marketplace, update infrastructure policy, and modernize regulations to support 5G deployment. The FCC and NTIA are working together to identify potential spectrum for future use and address the challenges of spectrum availability for 5G networks.", "The Hanford site, which produced plutonium from 1944 to 1988, generated a large amount of radioactive and hazardous waste. This waste was dumped into the soil, buried in containers, or stored in underground tanks. The Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) is being constructed to treat this waste and separate it into high-level and low-activity waste streams. The WTP consists of several facilities, including a Pretreatment Facility, a LAW Vitrification Facility, an HLW Vitrification Facility, an Effluent Management Facility, an Analytical Laboratory, and Balance of Facilities. The construction of the WTP has faced many technical challenges, and work on the Pretreatment Facility and HLW Facility has been halted due to these challenges. The project has cost approximately $752 million to date, with the majority of the funds going towards overhead costs and resolving technical challenges. The pretreatment facility is currently on hold, and there is no cost estimate for its completion. Other alternatives for pretreatment are being considered. The cleanup of the Hanford site is governed by the Tri-Party Agreement and the Consent Decree, which set milestones for completing major activities. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for managing the cleanup projects in accordance with DOE Order 413.3B, which requires the use of an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) process. DOE has spent about $752 million on the pretreatment facility from 2013 to 2018, with overhead costs accounting for more than half of the total. The facility maintenance, award fees, and contract modification fees also contributed to the costs. EM has implemented some recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), but others have not yet been fully implemented.", "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) provides leadership and guidance to federal agencies on all aspects of the federal government's EEO program. They ensure compliance with EEOC regulations, provide technical assistance, monitor and evaluate affirmative employment programs, develop educational materials, conduct training, provide guidance to judges, and adjudicate appeals. EEOC's MD-715 requires agencies to establish a model EEO program and ensure discrimination-free employment decisions. Agencies must submit annual EEO program status reports to EEOC. These reports include self-assessments, plans to address deficiencies, and barrier analyses. EEOC evaluates agency progress and may take compliance actions. In 2013, EEOC evaluated TSA's complaint process and made recommendations. In 2018, EEOC conducted an evaluation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and made recommendations to improve hiring efforts. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) processes discrimination complaints, maintains EEO programs, and prepares DHS's annual MD-715 report. DHS analyzes workforce data and survey results to identify potential EEO barriers and takes steps to address them. DHS has identified barriers such as problems with supervision/management, geographic location of jobs, and medical/physical requirements. They establish interim milestones and planned activities to address these barriers. The selected DHS components have conducted barrier analyses, but only TSA identified any barriers.", "The Hanford Site in Washington State is a highly contaminated nuclear waste site that covers 586 square miles. The primary goal of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to clean up the site and protect the Columbia River from contamination. Progress has been made in remediating waste sites, demolishing facilities, and treating contaminated soil and groundwater. The latest projected completion date for cleanup is 2078. The DOE has requirements and a structure in place for managing and overseeing cleanup and maintenance activities at the site. Various offices and contractors are responsible for different aspects of the cleanup and maintenance, including inspections and structural integrity evaluations. However, there have been concerns about the collapse of a tunnel at the site and the lack of a thorough investigation into the causes. The DOE has not yet determined the programmatic causes that led to the collapse and has not fully implemented recommendations to improve maintenance and information on the condition of facilities. A root cause analysis would help identify any programmatic weaknesses and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.", "The Marine Corps' Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) currently uses a fleet of 23 helicopters to support the President in different regions. In 2009, the Navy terminated the VH-71 program, a replacement helicopter project for HMX-1, due to schedule delays, performance issues, and increased costs. However, the need for a replacement helicopter remained, leading to the initiation of the VH-92A program in 2010. In 2014, a contract was awarded to Sikorsky to develop the VH-92A. The program has made progress in addressing technical challenges and reducing costs. An operational assessment in 2019 identified performance limitations, particularly with the mission communications system (MCS) and landing zone suitability. The program is working on fixes for these issues and plans to conduct initial operational testing in June 2020. The program has experienced delays, but remains within the timeline established in 2014.", "Puerto Rico's electricity provider, PREPA, was heavily in debt and had underinvested in its infrastructure prior to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The hurricanes left the entire electricity grid inoperable and caused a decline in population and electricity demand in Puerto Rico. It took about 11 months for power to be restored to all customers in Puerto Rico, although some structures were deemed unsafe for power restoration. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the electricity provider, VIWAPA, also faced financial challenges and had a significant non-payment rate. The hurricanes damaged a majority of VIWAPA's power lines and generation capacity. Power was restored to eligible customers in about 5 months. FEMA provided billions of dollars in grants and direct federal assistance to support electricity restoration in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOE provided technical assistance and coordination, while USACE provided temporary emergency power. In Puerto Rico, FEMA and USACE played unprecedented roles in coordinating and directly supporting the restoration of the electricity grid.", "The National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans have brought together federal biodefense capabilities to address a broad range of threats. However, there are challenges with planning, capability analysis, and decision-making processes that could limit the success of the implementation. The Strategy defines biothreats broadly and outlines high-level goals and objectives. NSPM-14 provides a process for assessing capabilities and guiding resource allocation. However, there are concerns about the first-year data collection process and the potential for incomplete information and challenges to be carried forward. Change management practices and guidance for analyzing data are lacking, as well as clarity on decision-making processes and roles. The Biodefense Coordination Team needs a plan to address these issues and ensure sufficient resources. The governing bodies overseeing the implementation also need to document key components of the assessment process and roles for decision-making. The Strategy's implementation is crucial for responding to biological threats like the current COVID-19 outbreak, but it requires addressing the identified challenges to be effective.", "The cost of conducting the U.S. Census has been increasing with each decade, reaching $12.3 billion in 2010 and estimated to be $15.6 billion in 2020. The rising costs are due to factors such as the growing population, declining mail response rates, and the need for more resources to conduct the enumeration. The Census Bureau also faces internal management challenges and budgetary uncertainties. There have been various legal challenges and changes to the census process, including the addition of a citizenship question that was later removed by the Supreme Court. The Bureau is implementing new methods and technology for the 2020 Census, such as allowing households to respond online and using mobile devices for data collection. The Bureau has made progress in addressing risks and challenges but still needs to fully meet criteria for removal from the Government Accountability Office's high-risk list. The 2020 Census is considered high-risk due to untested innovations, IT implementation challenges, cybersecurity risks, and an unreliable cost estimate. Despite these challenges, the Bureau has estimated potential savings of over $5 billion by implementing these innovations.", "Congress and federal agencies have enacted laws and issued guidance to promote workforce planning activities for IT acquisition. These laws and guidance emphasize setting the strategic direction, analyzing workforce skills, developing strategies to address gaps, and monitoring progress. Examples include the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the E-Government Act of 2002, and the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) of 2014. OMB and OPM have issued additional guidance and plans to improve workforce capabilities, particularly in the areas of IT program management and cybersecurity. GAO has evaluated agencies' implementation of workforce planning activities and has made recommendations for improvement. Overall, there is a need for agencies to fully implement workforce planning activities to address gaps in IT knowledge and skills.", "Space systems involve four types of interrelated segments: space components, ground components, user equipment, and launch vehicles and facilities. Space systems are acquired under the same acquisition policies as other weapons systems, but they have unique challenges and requirements. It is difficult to make changes to hardware once a satellite is launched, and cutting-edge technologies must be developed specifically for space systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) has approximately 170,000 military and civilian personnel responsible for acquiring space systems, but it lacks comprehensive data on the size, mix, and location of its space acquisition workforce. DOD does not have a complete list of space acquisition programs, and its data systems do not identify space acquisition personnel. As a result, DOD struggles to assess gaps in its space acquisition workforce and make informed decisions about the establishment of new space organizations, such as the United States Space Command and the Space Development Agency.", "The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 to provide additional funds for the FDA to review New Drug Applications (NDAs). PDUFA has been reauthorized every 5 years since then, with the most recent authorization (PDUFA VI) extending the program from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2022. The FDA sets goals for the review process as part of each reauthorization, including time frames for reviewing different types of applications. These goals vary depending on the features of the NDA, such as whether it qualifies for an expedited program or involves a new molecular entity.\n\nThe FDA has identified four key features of NDAs that are linked to the review process: priority review designation, involvement of a new molecular entity, major amendment, and qualification for an expedited program. These features are responsible for variations in the time it takes for the FDA to complete the initial reviews of NDAs. Certain divisions of the FDA have different proportions of NDAs with these key features, reflecting the types of products they regulate. For example, divisions that regulate products for serious or life-threatening conditions are more likely to have NDAs with priority review designation and qualification for expedited programs.\n\nIn addition to traditional clinical trials, the FDA is also evaluating the use of evidence from nontraditional sources to support NDAs. The 2016 Cures Act includes provisions for the FDA to consider evidence from sources such as electronic health records and disease registries. The FDA has initiated several initiatives to evaluate and facilitate the use of this real-world evidence in regulatory decision-making. These initiatives include public workshops, guidance issuance, pilot programs, and staff training.\n\nThe FDA has taken steps to implement these initiatives and expects them to lead to increased use of evidence from nontraditional sources. However, implementation is still in progress, and some pilot programs may extend beyond 2021. The FDA has seen some outcomes from these initiatives, such as an increase in biomarker submissions and the use of complex innovative trial designs. Fully implementing these initiatives is expected to further increase the use of evidence from nontraditional sources in NDAs.\n\nOverall, there are differences between FDA divisions in the proportion of NDAs with key features linked to review time goals and expedited programs. These differences reflect the types of products regulated by each division. The divisions also differ in the time taken to complete initial reviews, but these differences are largely explained by the key features of the NDAs. The FDA is working to ensure consistency in the evaluation of evidence from nontraditional sources and expects to meet the deliverables outlined in the Cures Act and the PDUFA VI commitment letter.", "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for public health in the country. Two key agencies within HHS, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), focus on preparing for and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. ASPR leads and coordinates national efforts to respond to outbreaks, while CDC monitors and responds to outbreaks, studies the link between infection and health, and provides guidance to the public and healthcare providers. Infectious disease modeling is an important tool used by both ASPR and CDC to inform decision-making and prepare for outbreaks. Different agencies within HHS, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), also play roles in monitoring and protecting against infectious diseases. Infectious disease modeling can be categorized into statistical models, which use past data to predict future events, and mechanistic models, which rely on scientific evidence and theory to simulate disease dynamics. CDC and ASPR use these models to answer various questions related to outbreak preparedness and response. Modeling is a valuable tool in national plans for disease response and biodefense, and CDC and ASPR officials use models in conjunction with other sources of information to inform decision-making processes.", "The United States has several international trade agreements that cover government procurement, including the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and bilateral and regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The GPA, which has 20 parties including the EU, aims to open government procurement markets for goods, services, and construction services among its parties. The United States also has 14 FTAs with 20 countries, four of which are also parties to the GPA. These agreements generally include provisions covering government procurement. \n\nThe United States reported $837 billion in GPA covered procurement in 2010, which is significantly larger than the combined amount reported by other GPA parties. The USG also awarded contracts valued at about $12 billion to foreign-located firms in fiscal year 2015. The EU received the majority of USG foreign source procurement, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Canada. However, most foreign-sourced USG procurement went to firms located in countries that are not parties to the GPA or NAFTA. \n\nThe USG's Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) provides more data fields that can be used to measure foreign source procurement compared to other countries' databases. The FPDS-NG contains data on firm location, firm ownership, product and service origin, and place of performance. \n\nThe USG's direct cross-border procurement, where the successful bidder is foreign-owned and foreign-located, was about three times greater than indirect cross-border procurement, where the successful bidder is a U.S.-based domestic subsidiary of a foreign-owned firm. Direct cross-border procurement received contracts valued at about $11.8 billion, while indirect cross-border procurement received contracts valued at about $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015.", "The Air Force operates several types of RPAs, including the MQ-9 Reaper, RQ-4 Global Hawk, and RQ-170 Sentinel. The MQ-9 Reaper has a larger community of pilots and sensor operators compared to the Global Hawk. The MQ-9 Reaper is used for persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance as well as strike capabilities. RPA operations are conducted through remote split operations, where control of the RPA is divided between geographically separated units. The number of combat lines and flying hours for RPAs has increased over the years. The Air Force has made efforts to increase the number of RPA pilots, including training traditional manned-aircraft pilots to fly RPAs and creating a dedicated RPA pilot career field. However, the Air Force has had difficulties meeting its staffing targets for RPA pilots and sensor operators. Financial incentives have been offered to retain RPA pilots and sensor operators, but retention concerns still exist. The Air Force does not consistently track its progress in accessing and retaining RPA personnel. The number of assigned RPA pilots and sensor operators has been less than their respective requirements and authorizations. Financial incentives have been provided to RPA pilots and sensor operators, but the overall population of RPA pilots has not been enough to meet the increased requirements. The Air Force is currently unable to reliably calculate retention metrics for RPA pilots due to the newness of the career field. The Air Force aims to retain about 60-65% of RPA pilots who have completed their initial service commitment, but this target may not be appropriate given the growing requirements.", "Effective communication is crucial for first responders in emergency situations. They rely on various communication systems such as LMR systems, commercial wireless services, and the FirstNet network. LMR systems are used for secure voice communication and coordination during daily operations and emergencies. Commercial wireless services are used to transmit data like location information and images. The FirstNet network is a dedicated broadband network for public safety use, providing greater interoperability and supporting voice and data transmissions. Interoperability between communication systems is essential to ensure effective communication across agencies and jurisdictions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for allocating spectrum and licenses for communication systems. The T-Band spectrum is currently used by public safety and business-industrial users in 11 metropolitan areas. However, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires the FCC to reallocate the T-Band spectrum and hold an auction by February 2021. This poses challenges for public safety users as there is limited alternative spectrum available for relocation. Public safety officials in Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City have been unable to identify alternative spectrum, raising concerns about the feasibility of the auction and relocation. The cost of relocating public safety operations from the T-Band is estimated to be between $5 and $6 billion, according to FCC officials. The cost includes new equipment, infrastructure, and real estate. There are challenges in estimating relocation costs without knowing the alternative spectrum options. Equipment costs can be significant, especially for purchasing new radios that can operate on different frequency bands. Infrastructure costs include new towers, antennas, and fiber-optic cables. Overall, the T-Band auction and relocation pose significant challenges for public safety users, including limited alternative spectrum options and high costs.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sets forth requirements that must be met before agencies can award contracts to prospective contractors. Beginning in February 2016, contracting officers are required to include a provision in all contract solicitations that require contractors to report information about unpaid federal taxes. If a prospective contractor reports having unpaid federal taxes, the contracting officer must request additional information, notify the officials responsible for suspension and debarment actions, and not award the contract unless suspension or debarment is determined to be unnecessary. Additionally, the FAR requires contracting officers to include a provision for reporting delinquent taxes in certain contract solicitations. Prospective contractors must report whether they or any of their principals have been notified of delinquent federal taxes exceeding $3,500 in the preceding 3-year period. If a prospective contractor reports delinquent tax debt, the contracting officer must request additional information and notify the officials responsible for suspension and debarment actions. However, unpaid federal tax debts and delinquent federal taxes do not automatically disqualify prospective contractors from receiving a contract. Contracting officers rely on the contractors' representations and certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) to determine their tax-debt status. The IRS can collect unpaid taxes from federal contractors by levying their federal payments. The five selected agencies examined in the report have established control activities to help contracting officers comply with federal laws and regulations regarding tax debt. These activities include issuing class deviations, providing policies and procedures, using contract-file compliance tools, conducting periodic compliance reviews, and providing training. However, these control activities were not effectively implemented in some cases, resulting in the awarding of contracts without required follow-up actions. The report identified 1,849 contracts awarded by the five selected agencies in 2015 and 2016 to contractors that reported qualifying federal tax debt, potentially resulting in violations of federal regulations. In a sample of seven contracts, two were awarded without required follow-up actions for contractors that reported tax debt, resulting in more than $510,000 in contract obligations. The report also identified 143 contracts awarded to contractors who reported qualifying federal tax debt from February 2016 to December 2016, in which the required follow-up actions were not taken by the agencies.", "The federal government has been facing challenges in managing its workforce effectively for many years. In 2001, federal strategic human capital management was added to the list of high-risk government programs and operations. The issue has been identified as a focus area since 2011 because skills gaps within individual agencies and across the federal workforce can lead to costly and less efficient government.\n\nTop-level attention and action from the administration and agency leaders is necessary to make progress in high-risk areas. The key criteria for removal from the High-Risk List are leadership commitment, agency capacity, existence of a corrective action plan, program monitoring, and demonstrated progress. While improvements have been made since 2001, federal human capital management remains a high-risk area due to mission-critical skills gaps that pose a risk to the nation.\n\nSpecifically, skills gaps have been identified in numerous government-wide occupations, such as healthcare providers and human resource staff at Veterans Health Administration's medical centers. This has led to staffing shortages in areas like physicians, registered nurses, and human resource specialists.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also faced challenges in identifying and categorizing its cybersecurity positions. Without accurate reporting and guidance, the department cannot effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning.\n\nSkills gaps caused by staff shortages, inadequate workforce planning, and a lack of training in critical skills are contributing factors to the high-risk status of strategic human capital management. These skills gaps affect individual agencies as well as the entire federal workforce.\n\nTo better manage the current and future workforce, agencies should focus on certain talent management strategies. These include actively recruiting from diverse talent pools, starting the hiring process early in the school year, writing user-friendly vacancy announcements, leveraging available hiring and pay flexibilities, using relevant assessment methods, highlighting agency mission and linking it to employees' work, increasing awareness of benefits and incentives, promoting an inclusive work environment, and encouraging details, rotations, and other mobility opportunities.\n\nOverall, addressing skills gaps and effectively managing the federal workforce will require the commitment and action of both agency leaders and Congress.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken steps to reduce health care disparities for minority veterans and promote health equity, but lacks mechanisms to ensure accountability in these efforts. The VA established a program office and a steering committee to draft an action plan for achieving health equity, but the plan lacked performance measures and clear lines of accountability. The VA's Office of Health Equity (OHE) is responsible for several efforts to advance health equity, but has experienced changes in budget and staff levels. The VA's action plan included five focus areas and implementation activities, but did not have measurable performance criteria or specific offices designated for coordination. The VA's funding for research on health disparities is separate from its core budget, and there have been difficulties in translating research findings into practice. The completeness and accuracy of data on race and ethnicity in veteran's electronic health records (EHRs) is a concern, as it affects the VA's ability to assess and address health care disparities at the medical center level. Overall, there is a need for improved accountability and resources to advance health equity in the VA.", "The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for maintaining and operating the buildings within the U.S. Capitol complex. The AOC is organized into 10 jurisdictions, each funded separately. The AOC's Planning and Project Management (PPM) provides services to all jurisdictions, including facility planning and design. The AOC's Division, established in the 1970s, supports the jurisdictions by providing construction and facility management. The Division employs both permanent and temporary staff, with temporary employees eligible for benefits. The Division's expenses are covered by project funding from the jurisdictions, and it charges an indirect rate for its services. The jurisdictions have varied in their use of the Division for projects, with the Library, House, and Senate jurisdictions being the primary users. Jurisdiction officials cited the Division's scheduling flexibility, ability to handle scope changes, and lack of internal capacity as reasons for using the Division. The cost of using the Division compared to contractors varied depending on the project.", "Private companies are prohibited by federal law from discriminating in employment based on various factors such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability status. Federal contractors and subcontractors are also required to take affirmative action to ensure equal treatment during hiring and employment processes. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal antidiscrimination laws, while the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements for federal contractors. The EEOC investigates charges of employment discrimination, litigates cases, and conducts outreach to prevent discrimination. The OFCCP ensures compliance with nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements through enforcement activities and compliance assistance. It conducts compliance evaluations and provides guidance to contractors. Both agencies face challenges in conducting oversight efforts to ensure compliance, including weaknesses in the contractor selection process and issues related to monitoring affirmative action programs.", "The size and complexity of states\u2019 Medicaid programs have implications for program administration and oversight, including provider screening and enrollment. States have flexibility in how they design, administer, and oversee their Medicaid programs, including the option to use fee-for-service payments or contract with managed care organizations. In fiscal year 2018, about half of Medicaid spending was estimated to be for services delivered under managed care. CMS and states have roles in protecting the integrity of the Medicaid program and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. States are responsible for implementing federal requirements for screening and enrolling Medicaid providers, while CMS oversees states' compliance. State auditors can partner with CMS in oversight of Medicaid. Federal regulations require states to screen and enroll all providers, including individuals and organizations, and to revalidate enrollment every five years. States can rely on federal databases for checks on eligibility, conduct site visits and background checks, and collect necessary information from providers. CMS measures improper payments in the Medicaid program through the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) process, which includes measuring compliance with provider screening and enrollment requirements. States face challenges in implementing these requirements, including building capacity, using federal databases, and collecting information from providers. States have taken various approaches to address these challenges, such as developing new IT systems, contracting with vendors, and modifying existing procedures. CMS has partnered with the Treasury Department to improve states' ability to search databases. States also face challenges in collecting required information from providers, but have taken steps to address these challenges. Capacity and efficiency issues arise when states need to screen and enroll an increased volume of providers or certain provider types, such as managed care providers. Some states have continued making payments to providers not enrolled in Medicaid in order to maintain beneficiary access to services.", "The text provides an overview of virtual currency and its regulation by the IRS. Virtual currency is defined as a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value. Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that uses encryption technology and operates on distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. The IRS treats virtual currency as property for tax purposes, meaning that income and gains from virtual currency transactions are subject to taxation. The IRS has limited data on virtual currency compliance, but has used third-party reports, voluntary disclosures, and searches of tax returns to identify noncompliance. The IRS has launched a virtual currency compliance campaign to address noncompliance related to individual taxpayers' use of virtual currency and to develop a comprehensive virtual currency strategy.", "The Defense Health Agency (DHA) implemented the T-2017 transition, which involved merging TRICARE regions and awarding contracts to new contractors. The transition was initially planned to start in August 2016, but due to bid protests, it was delayed until January 2017. The transition included a shift from Health Net Federal Services to Humana Government Business in the East region and from UnitedHealth Military & Veterans to Health Net Federal Services in the West region. To manage the transition, DHA assigned transition leads and established an organizational structure. The transition guidance focused on the contractors' readiness in critical areas such as provider network, referral management, enrollment, claims processing, and customer service. DHA introduced two oversight methods, PRV and PRAV, to test the contractors' functionality in these areas. The T-2017 contracts included financial penalties if transition requirements were not met. The implementation of TRICARE Select, a new preferred provider benefit option, delayed the timeframes for the transition. DHA had to delay the start of health care delivery, postpone the enrollment freeze, and shorten the dual operations period for contractors. DHA also experienced delays in communicating changes to TRICARE beneficiaries, which led to customer service problems after the start of health care delivery. Data transfer issues between outgoing and incoming contractors also created challenges during the transition.", "The Aviation and Transportation Security Act designates the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as the primary agency responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including passenger rail. While the TSA primarily partners with public and private transportation operators to address security needs in passenger rail, they also engage with the industry through associations and liaise with foreign governments. Recent attacks and online terrorist messaging have highlighted the vulnerability of passenger rail systems, both physically and in terms of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity threats to passenger rail systems include ransomware, malware, phishing, and website attacks, which can compromise sensitive information and disrupt operations. The TSA conducts risk assessments, such as the Transportation Systems Sector Risk Assessment, to assess threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. However, currently, the agency does not include cybersecurity attack scenarios in these assessments. The TSA also conducts voluntary security assessments and shares threat assessments with rail agencies. Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides voluntary cybersecurity assessments and services to transportation agencies, including rail.", "The federal government has faced challenges in acquiring, developing, and managing IT investments, which has led to issues with planning and budgeting for legacy system modernization, infrastructure upgrades, and service delivery technology. This has resulted in security risks, unmet mission needs, staffing problems, and increased costs. Legacy systems often have security vulnerabilities and may not be able to meet mission requirements. Additionally, agencies struggle to find personnel with expertise in older programming languages. The cost of maintaining legacy systems also increases over time, which hinders modernization efforts. Agencies consider factors like risks, criticality, costs, and performance when deciding whether to modernize legacy systems. However, as of May 2019, several recommendations to better manage legacy systems and investments have not been implemented. Congress and the executive branch have initiated efforts to modernize federal IT through the identification of high-value assets, assessment of federal IT modernization, enactment of the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, and issuance of the President's Management Agenda. In a review of critical federal legacy systems, it was found that the 10 most critical systems in need of modernization are maintained by different agencies and cost around $337 million annually to operate and maintain. Some of these systems use outdated languages and have known security vulnerabilities and unsupported hardware and software.", "The federal government lacks a strategic approach for investing in high-priority climate resilience projects, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). While some federal agencies have made efforts to manage climate change risk, overall federal investment in projects specifically designed to enhance climate resilience has been limited. The GAO suggests that additional strategic investments may be needed to manage the nation's most significant climate risks, as climate change affects multiple agency missions and presents fiscal exposures that exceed the capacity of any one agency. The report outlines six key steps that could be taken to strategically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for investment. These steps include defining strategic goals, identifying high-risk areas, prioritizing projects, and monitoring climate risks. The report also discusses two options for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience projects: coordinating existing funding programs and creating a new federal funding source. The GAO recommends that Congress consider establishing a federal organizational arrangement to periodically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for investment.", "The Secretary of Defense has the authority to enter into bilateral agreements, called Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSAs), with authorized countries and international organizations. These agreements allow for the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, and services between the United States and its partners. ACSAs are primarily used during wartime, exercises, training, deployments, and other military operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has signed 125 ACSAs, including five that have expired, with countries and organizations around the world. These agreements provide DOD with flexibility, enhanced readiness, and increased military effectiveness. DOD uses a system called AGATRS to manage ACSA transactions, and it has authorized more than 22,000 ACSA sales orders totaling approximately $5 billion in logistic support. DOD is required to notify Congress of its intent to designate non-NATO countries for an ACSA, but it has not maintained adequate records of these notifications. Similarly, the Department of State is required to notify Congress when ACSAs enter into force, but it has been late in notifying Congress for 41 percent of the agreements. The late notifications were often due to untimely information provided by DOD. DOD and State should improve their recordkeeping and information sharing to ensure accurate and timely notifications to Congress.", "The roles of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the federal judiciary in the federal criminal process for immigration-related prosecutions differ. DHS refers cases for prosecution, DOJ prioritizes immigration-related prosecutions, and the federal judiciary oversees the court proceedings. Each United States Attorney's Office (USAO) prosecutes cases in one or more courts and works with DHS and DOJ to determine the types and number of cases to prosecute. Border Patrol officials receive training from USAOs on the criminal prosecution process and use their priorities to decide whether to refer a case for criminal prosecution. In some federal judicial districts on the southwest border, defendants are prosecuted for improper entry in criminal proceedings that typically last one day. The volume of prosecutions varies depending on apprehensions and capacity limitations. Since 2017, there have been several federal directives related to prioritizing immigration-related prosecutions. The five USAOs along the southwest border have prioritized improper entry referrals for prosecution and made changes to their practices in response to these directives. They have increased the number of improper entry prosecutions, implemented new processes, and coordinated with DHS and other stakeholders. The federal courts have made accommodations by adding dockets, adjusting facility use, and increasing the use of private defense attorneys and interpretation services. However, the ability to increase improper entry prosecutions varies by district due to different practices in the federal criminal process and factors such as physical space limitations and availability of resources. In some districts, there is sufficient capacity to process all improper entry cases referred for prosecution, while in others, the number of prosecutions is limited by various considerations. Border Patrol referrals for prosecution have increased from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018, but the number of apprehended single adults has decreased.", "Table 1 provides an overview of tax-time financial products and the four main groups of participants in the industry: banks, tax preparation service providers, settlement service providers, and software developers. These groups offer various tax-time products to taxpayers, such as refund anticipation loans and refund transfers, and may partner with each other to provide these services. The federal banking supervision aims to ensure that banks operate safely and comply with banking laws, with different regulators overseeing different types of banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has rulemaking and enforcement authority over consumer financial protection laws, including those related to tax-time financial products. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not involved in offering tax-time financial products but retains information on their use and provides guidance to tax preparers on reporting this data. Refundable tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), are popular among taxpayers and can affect the use of tax-time financial products. Use of refund anticipation loans has declined over the years, while refund transfers have become the most used product. IRS data on tax-time financial products have limitations, and researchers and federal entities rely on this data for information. Concerns have been raised by consumer advocates and regulators about refund anticipation loans, including high interest rates and borrower default. Banks stopped offering these loans in 2012 due to regulatory scrutiny. The elimination of a tool used by banks for underwriting these loans also contributed to their discontinuation. Use of refund transfers has increased since 2012 and far exceeds the use of other tax-time financial products. However, IRS data on refund transfers have limitations, as they do not differentiate between refund advances and refund transfers. In recent years, some banks have started offering refund advances to taxpayers.", "Caller ID services, which allow recipients of incoming calls to see the phone number and sometimes the name of the caller, have become less accurate and reliable as voice service providers moved to Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This shift has made it easier and cheaper for scammers and telemarketers to spoof caller IDs, deceiving recipients about the source of the call. Caller ID spoofing is commonly used in scams to obtain money or personal information, generate telemarketing leads, and harass individuals. Complaints about unwanted calls and spoofing have significantly increased in recent years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforce rules and regulations related to caller ID spoofing, but they prioritize investigations based on the level of harm and likelihood of enforcement success. The telecommunications industry has also taken steps to combat illegal spoofing, including developing applications to block unwanted calls and analyzing call traffic for patterns. However, there is currently no comprehensive data on the extent of unwanted calls and spoofing. FCC has sought input on how to better measure the problem and plans to prepare reports on the effectiveness of efforts to combat illegal robocalls. Limited agency resources make it necessary to prioritize investigations and enforcement actions.", "Medicare beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions have a range of conditions and require different types of care. Beneficiaries with mild conditions may require less complex care than those with serious conditions. Dual-eligible beneficiaries are more likely to have major psychiatric disorders. Medicare covers services for the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health conditions, but some providers have opted out of Medicare. Low health literacy and the stigma surrounding behavioral health conditions can impact individuals' ability to seek help. Medicare Advantage plans may employ care management and utilization management strategies for behavioral health services. Medicare paid providers $3.3 billion for approximately 39.3 million behavioral health services in 2018. Most behavioral health services were delivered by specialists such as psychiatrists and psychologists. Access to behavioral health services may be limited for certain populations, such as those with SUDs. CMS provides information to beneficiaries through various channels, but Medicare & You does not explicitly provide information on coverage for SUDs, despite its importance and priority.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) nuclear enterprise includes both strategic and nonstrategic nuclear forces, as well as the infrastructure and personnel to support them. The strategic forces include Air Force ICBMs, nuclear-capable bomber aircraft, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles carried by Navy SSBNs. Nonstrategic forces include forward-deployed fighters capable of delivering nuclear munitions. The DOD also has capabilities called Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) which are used to support planning, monitoring, and communication between the President and nuclear forces. The New START treaty limits the number of deployed delivery systems for each branch of the strategic nuclear triad. The DOD has established the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group (NDERG) to address issues within the nuclear enterprise and ensure its long-term health. The NDERG is supported by several working groups and is responsible for coordinating and integrating issues related to the nuclear enterprise. The Council on Oversight of the National Leadership Command, Control, and Communications System (NLC3S Council) provides oversight of the command, control, and communications system for the national leadership of the US. The Commander of U.S. Strategic Command is the lead for NC3 capabilities, while the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment is responsible for resources and acquisition. The DOD uses various tracking tools to monitor the implementation of recommendations from nuclear enterprise reviews and the NC3 report. However, these tools do not always provide current and complete information. The DOD has made progress in implementing the recommendations from the reviews and the NC3 report, but there is still work to be done. As of August 2019, the NDERG has closed 156 of the 247 sub-recommendations from the nuclear enterprise reviews, and the NLC3S Council has closed seven of the 13 recommendations from the NC3 report. The DOD continues to improve its tracking and evaluation of progress in implementing the recommendations.", "Drugs sold in the United States are manufactured both domestically and overseas. As of August 2019, over 50% of the establishments manufacturing finished drugs for the U.S. market were located outside of the country, with India and China being the most common locations. The FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of all drugs marketed in the U.S., regardless of where they are manufactured. The FDA conducts inspections of both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure compliance with regulations. These inspections can be preapproval, surveillance, or for-cause inspections. The FDA uses databases to select establishments for inspections, but inaccurate information in these databases has made it difficult to accurately identify establishments subject to inspection. The FDA conducts the largest number of foreign inspections in India and China. However, due to COVID-19, the FDA has postponed most inspections of foreign manufacturing establishments and is exploring alternative methods to ensure the safety of the U.S. drug supply. Foreign inspections are mainly surveillance inspections, which have increased in recent years. The FDA has identified deficiencies in approximately 64% of foreign drug manufacturing establishment inspections from fiscal years 2012-2018. These deficiencies include violations of current good manufacturing practices (CGMP).", "There are more than 80 federal programs that provide aid to people with low incomes, administered by federal, state, and local providers. These programs offer a range of assistance, including cash aid, food, shelter, and healthcare. Some programs aim to help low-income individuals move towards self-sufficiency through education, training, and employment services. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a strategic objective to encourage self-sufficiency and eliminate barriers to economic opportunity. HHS is currently updating its strategic plan to include a two-generation approach that proactively connects families to services before they reach crisis. Two-generation approaches address multiple areas, like child and family economic supports, education, employment, health, well-being, and social capital. Research shows that these approaches lead to improvements in parents' economic security, children's home environment, parental engagement in schooling, and child outcomes. Past efforts to improve service coordination for low-income families prioritized one generation over the other and did not provide sufficient services. Newer two-generation approaches are being tested and are meant to be more intensive and of higher quality. Ten federal programs, administered by USDA, HHS, and DOL, were most commonly used by state and local entities to serve whole families. These programs target low-income families and provide a range of benefits and services for children and parents. However, eligibility requirements for some programs vary, resulting in some families not being eligible for the programs used in two-generation approaches. State and local entities leverage the federal programs in different ways and also use other resources, including state, local, and philanthropic funds. They involve leadership, change policies, expand services, modify service delivery practices, and serve specific populations to create their unique two-generation approaches. Sharing data across low-income programs is a challenge due to issues with linking data and concerns about participant privacy. Federal agencies provide resources and guidance to assist state and local entities in data sharing. Lack of information on two-generation approaches is another challenge reported by state and local entities. HHS has developed information and hosted webinars and communities of learning on two-generation approaches.", "The State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) was established by Congress in 2010 to assist small businesses in developing their export capacity. The program aims to increase the number of small businesses that are exporting, explore new trade opportunities, and increase the value of exports for small businesses engaged in international trade. The Small Business Administration (SBA) implements STEP and provides training, counseling, and export financing for small businesses. The program is managed by the Office of International Trade (OIT) within the SBA.\n\nSTEP grants are awarded annually to state governments through a competitive application process. The grants are intended to support export promotion activities conducted by state trade offices. These offices can be housed in various state entities, including governors' offices, state departments of commerce, universities, world trade centers, and state departments of economic development. Each state that receives a STEP grant is required to submit quarterly reports to OIT on the amount of the grant expended and progress made toward performance targets. OIT program managers review these reports and provide feedback to each state.\n\nSince its inception in fiscal year 2011, STEP has been allocated a total of $139.4 million, and $139.1 million has been awarded to date. The grants are distributed to states based on a proportional distribution requirement that caps the amount of funding for states with the largest numbers of eligible small businesses at 40 percent of the total amount awarded. States receiving STEP grants are also required to provide a non-federal total match of 25 percent or 35 percent, with at least half of the match provided in cash. OIT has processes in place to ensure compliance with the proportional distribution requirement, but there are deficiencies in the processes for verifying compliance with the total and cash match requirements.\n\nOIT's processes for monitoring the total match requirement do not effectively document whether states have met the requirement. OIT program managers review quarterly reports from states to determine if they have met the total match requirement based on the amount of federal dollars expended. However, there have been instances where states reported an insufficient total match, but the grants were still closed by SBA. OIT officials cited staff errors and the submission of additional information by states as reasons for these inconsistencies. OIT has stated that it plans to implement a new quarterly process to focus on match information and ensure documentation of compliance before grant closure.\n\nThe processes for monitoring compliance with the cash match requirement are also deficient. While states submit detailed expenditure worksheets that provide information on the types of expended matching funds, OIT does not regularly analyze this information to determine what proportion of the total match constitutes cash. As a result, SBA cannot consistently determine if states are meeting the cash match requirement and may close grants for which the requirement has not been met. Additionally, OIT does not have a process for ensuring that states are not using grant funds to pay for portions of state staff salaries that are also being reported as the required cash match.\n\nIn conclusion, while the STEP program has been successful in providing funding for export promotion activities, there are deficiencies in the SBA's processes for ensuring compliance with TFTEA requirements. These deficiencies increase the risk of overpayment of federal funds and misuse of funds for the cash match requirement. SBA should improve its monitoring processes to ensure that states are meeting all requirements before closing out grants.", "The decennial census is crucial for the United States as it affects the distribution of Congressional seats, the allocation of federal funding, and informs policy decisions. However, conducting the census carries inherent risks, and it is important for the Census Bureau to manage these risks effectively. The Bureau has developed an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework to assist in this process, which includes identifying essential elements and good practices. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires federal agencies to implement ERM to ensure effective risk management. Risk mitigation and contingency plans are fundamental to ERM, as they outline how to reduce the likelihood and impact of risks and provide a roadmap for response and monitoring. \n\nFor the 2020 Census, the Bureau has identified 360 active risks, with the highest number of program risks in the Systems Engineering and Integration operation. These risks are classified by priority level to allocate resources effectively. The Bureau plans to mitigate 67% of these risks and has developed mitigation and contingency plans accordingly. However, as of December 2018, the Bureau is missing required plans for some risks, including a major disaster risk. Some risks added to the register did not have plans developed within a month, and the Bureau's decennial risk management plan lacks a clear time frame for plan development. Additionally, some contingency plans are still in draft form and awaiting approval, and the status of mitigation plans is not indicated in the risk registers. \n\nTo conclude, while the Bureau has made progress in managing risks for the 2020 Census, there are areas where improvements can be made, such as timely plan development and clear indications of plan status in the risk registers. These measures would enhance risk management efforts and ensure a successful and accurate census.", "According to a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the potential economic effects of climate change in the United States could be significant and unevenly distributed across sectors and regions. The report highlights the need for federal decision makers to have comprehensive information on the economic effects of climate change in order to make informed choices and prioritize climate risks. The report also identifies several areas where the federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change, including disaster aid, federal insurance for property and crops, and the operation and management of federal property and lands. The GAO recommends that the federal government develop a national strategic plan, use economic information to identify and respond to climate risks, and provide decision makers with the best available climate information.", "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ensures that consumers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas have access to telecommunications rates and services that are reasonably comparable to those in urban areas. The act requires telecommunications carriers and other entities to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (USF) to support this access. The high-cost program, the largest USF program, provides support to carriers in rural or remote areas with high infrastructure costs. In 2009, Congress required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop a broadband plan, which led to the USF Transformation Order in 2011, providing support for broadband-capable networks. FCC has implemented audit and oversight procedures to ensure proper use of funds, but instances of improper payments from the high-cost program have occurred. FCC has adopted funding and reform measures to control program expenditures, incentivize efficient broadband deployment, and improve accountability and transparency. The development of a model-based support mechanism shows promise in reducing fraud risk compared to the traditional cost-accounting support mechanism. However, a substantial number of carriers still receive traditional support, which is difficult to audit and prone to fraud risks. Assessing the accuracy and reliability of the model-based mechanism would help mitigate fraud risks and improve program management.", "Around 60 percent of drug manufacturing establishments that produce drugs for the U.S. market are located overseas, with India and China being the top countries. These establishments are subject to the same regulations as domestic establishments. The FDA conducts three types of inspections: preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause. The number of foreign inspections has decreased in recent years due to data inaccuracies and staffing vacancies. The FDA has identified deficiencies in about 64 percent of foreign inspections, including serious violations in 8 percent of inspections. The FDA's foreign inspection workforce has staff vacancies, which has contributed to the decline in inspections.", "As of November 2018, 43 states operated Medicaid programs under demonstrations, which are comprehensive and can affect multiple aspects of a state's Medicaid program. Demonstrations typically last for 5 years but can be extended for longer periods. From January 2017 to May 2018, CMS approved new demonstrations, extensions, amendments, or a combination of these in 23 states. Each demonstration is governed by special terms and conditions (STCs) that outline the parameters of the state's authority. States must submit periodic monitoring reports and evaluations to assess the outcomes of their demonstrations. However, there are weaknesses in CMS's policies and procedures for ensuring transparency, such as inconsistent approaches to public input and lack of transparency in major changes made to applications and spending limits. Furthermore, the transparency requirements for amendments are more limited than those for new demonstrations and extensions. CMS has made efforts to improve transparency, but there is still room for improvement.", "Water scarcity occurs when the demand for water in a given area exceeds the available water supplies. In the United States, water scarcity is becoming a serious issue, particularly in the Southwest where droughts and persistent water scarcity are occurring. Changes in precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are expected to further impact water availability in the future. This can lead to competing demands for water, such as irrigation, power production, municipal water supplies, and supporting aquatic life. The military also relies on water for its operations and missions, but there is limited assurance that accurate and reliable information is being used to identify which installations are at risk for water scarcity. There have been several assessments conducted by OSD and the military departments, but they have varied greatly in their results. While OSD assessments do not align with leading practices for identifying and analyzing water scarcity, the military department assessments do. This raises questions about the quality of the assessments and which source of information DOD is using for water resource management. Overall, there is a need for more accurate and reliable information to effectively manage water resources in the military and ensure installations are adequately prepared for water scarcity.", "The text discusses funding for university STEM research, sexual harassment in educational institutions, and Title IX enforcement responsibilities. The five federal agencies analyzed provide significant funding for STEM research in universities, with HHS-NIH providing the most funding. Sexual harassment can constitute sex discrimination under Title IX, and it can include behaviors such as sexual coercion, unwanted sexual attention, and gender harassment. Female medical and engineering students are more likely to experience sexual harassment from faculty or staff. Title IX enforcement responsibilities include issuing regulations, obtaining assurance of compliance from grantees, conducting compliance reviews, and investigating complaints of sex discrimination. Different offices within the federal agencies handle Title IX and grant management responsibilities. The agencies conduct periodic compliance reviews and may recommend actions to improve compliance efforts. NASA and NSF publicize promising practices to assist grantees with Title IX compliance, but other agencies have not clearly publicized such practices. Most grantees receive little information on Title IX compliance from the agencies.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has made rebuilding military readiness a top priority after more than a decade of conflict and budget uncertainty. The 2018 National Defense Strategy identifies strategic competition with China and Russia as the central challenge, emphasizing the need to restore and retain readiness for large-scale combat. Despite these efforts, DOD reports that readiness remains low and has been since 2013. The Army has made progress in rebuilding readiness, but clear goals and timelines are needed, especially for the reserve component. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has developed a Readiness Recovery Framework to guide the services' efforts and regularly assess progress. The Army aims to reach readiness goals by 2022, at which point focus will shift to modernization. The Army is implementing a sustainable readiness concept and investing in warfighting equipment in Europe to enhance readiness against potential Russian aggression. The Army is also updating its doctrine, equipment, and formations to operate in a more complex warfighting environment, known as multi-domain operations. However, the Army faces challenges in filling and maintaining key skills, managing personnel tempo, and meeting authorized end strength. The Army is adjusting its force structure and is considering revisions to expansion plans. The Army is also facing challenges in filling cyber and electronic warfare units and maintaining critical skills in Army depots. The Army's modernization strategy aims to build the next generation of weapon systems to remain agile and effective on the future battlefield. The Army is focused on countering threats from Russia and China and is updating warfighting concepts to conduct multi-domain operations. Multiple weapon systems are being upgraded to support readiness for future missions.", "The General Services Administration (GSA) manages various telecommunications programs for federal agencies, including Networx, Washington Interagency Telecommunications System 3, and Regional Local Service Agreements. These programs provide telecommunications services such as voice and data services, wireless services, and video conferencing. The Networx contracts were set to expire in 2017 but have been extended twice, with the latest extension set to expire in 2023. The GSA has also awarded contracts for the Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) program, which will replace the existing telecommunications contracts. The transition to EIS is expected to be completed by May 2023, and agencies have various plans for transitioning to the new program. However, many agencies have not met the transition milestones set by GSA, and delays have been attributed to factors such as complex requirements and insufficient staff availability.", "In a report from March 2019, it was identified that HUD needs to improve its physical inspection process and oversight of inspectors to ensure the safety of households in HUD-assisted properties. The report outlined several areas where improvements were needed, including a comprehensive review of the inspection process, consideration of sampling error in inspection frequency and enforcement actions, tracking of inspection dates, selecting and evaluating inspectors, and implementing new quality control policies. The report also noted concerns about property owners prioritizing site repairs over unit repairs and attempting to cover up deficiencies. Additionally, it was found that REAC had not conducted a comprehensive review of the inspection process since 2001. Recommendations were made for REAC to conduct a comprehensive review, resume calculating sampling errors in inspection scores, assess the effectiveness of its training program, and track progress in meeting inspection scheduling requirements. HUD agreed with these recommendations and has taken steps to address them, such as completing a comprehensive review of the inspection process and planning to include standard error calculations in its scoring software. However, there are still areas where further action is needed. The report also identified weaknesses in REAC's training program and evaluation of inspectors, and made recommendations for improvement. HUD agreed with these recommendations and has taken steps to revise training programs, develop continuing education requirements, and review performance standards. There were also concerns about REAC's ability to meet inspection scheduling requirements and track progress. Recommendations were made for REAC to track inspections according to federal guidelines and coordinate with the Office of Multifamily Housing. HUD partially agreed with this recommendation and has taken steps to better track inspections and provide guidance on rescheduling. The report also found that REAC had not implemented policies and procedures for its Quality Control group, which was formed in 2017. Recommendations were made for REAC to implement these policies and procedures. HUD agreed with this recommendation and has begun to implement it. The report made additional recommendations regarding documentation of the inspection process, evaluation of a pilot program, internal recommendations, meeting management targets, and reporting to Congress. HUD generally agreed with these recommendations but has not fully addressed them. The report concluded that HUD has been making significant changes to the REAC physical inspection program and has solicited comments on a new inspection process and taken steps to replace the reverse auction program. The report emphasized the importance of implementing the recommendations to ensure that properties are safe and in good repair. Another report from June 2018 identified shortcomings in HUD's efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards in low-income housing. Limitations in HUD's monitoring efforts were noted, such as relying on self-certification by PHAs and conducting a limited number of on-site compliance reviews. Recommendations were made for HUD to improve compliance monitoring and enforcement, inspection standards, and performance assessment and reporting.", "The E-2 adjudication process involves multiple State and DHS components, and foreign nationals must meet specific eligibility requirements. There are two pathways for individuals seeking E-2 status: applying for an E-2 visa through State or filing with USCIS to extend or change to E-2 status. State and USCIS adjudicated over 50,000 E-2 visa applications or petitions from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, with State accounting for over 80% of these adjudications. The volume of State's E-2 visa adjudications increased from fiscal years 2014 through 2017 but slightly decreased in fiscal year 2018. The average E-2 visa refusal rate for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 was about 8%. The top countries of nationality for E-2 visa adjudications were Japan, Germany, Canada, and France. Manufacturing, food services, retail, and professional services were the main business sectors associated with E-2 visa principal applicants. USCIS adjudicated an average of about 9,400 E-2 petitions per year, with a denial rate of about 17%. The top countries of birth for individuals seeking to extend or change to E-2 status were South Korea, Mexico, and Japan. The main reasons for denial were that the enterprise was not real and operating, and the investment was not substantial.", "The Defense Health Agency (DHA) consolidated its TRICARE regions from three regions to two regions for the T-2017 contracts. Humana Government Business is the managed care support contractor for the East Region, and Health Net Federal Services is the managed care support contractor for the West Region. The costs of the contracts are expected to total approximately $58 billion over a 5-year period. The primary responsibilities of the contractors include developing provider networks, processing referrals and authorizations, processing health care claims, and providing customer services. DHA has also started planning for the fifth generation of TRICARE contracts, known as the T-5 contracts. The acquisition process for the T-2017 contracts consisted of planning, issuing the Request for Proposals (RFP), awarding the contracts, and post-award activities. The contracts include changes such as the consolidation of contract regions, combined administrative costs, and the introduction of new contract incentives. These changes are aimed at improving efficiency, reducing costs, and promoting competition. DHA has also implemented value-based incentive programs and pilot projects to improve the quality of care and lower costs. However, not all elements required by the NDAA 2017 have been fully implemented yet.", "Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), also known as drones or remotely piloted vehicles, are becoming increasingly prevalent in a variety of industries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for integrating UAS into the national airspace system and ensuring safety. UAS operators can be categorized into recreational users, commercial users, and public safety/government users, each with its own requirements for registration and certification. The FAA is approaching UAS integration by leveraging existing regulations and standards for manned aircraft and gradually allowing for more complex UAS operations. Ongoing and potential future operational capabilities include operations over people, remote identification of UAS, beyond visual-line-of-sight operations, small-cargo delivery operations, urban air-mobility passenger operations, and large cargo and inspection operations. To support these capabilities, research and development is being conducted to assess risks and develop technology and systems for safe UAS integration. The FAA also works with NASA and implements programs such as the Test Sites program and Integration Pilot Program to facilitate research and development activities.", "Executive Order 12898 and the 2011 MOU guide agencies' environmental justice efforts, emphasizing areas such as enforcement of health and environmental laws in minority and low-income communities. Existing laws, like the Clean Air Act and NEPA, are used to address environmental and health problems in these communities. Several agencies have taken actions to identify and address environmental justice issues, including developing tools like the EPA's mapping tool and incorporating environmental justice in NEPA analyses. However, agencies have not effectively assessed their progress or consistently reported on their efforts. The interagency working group has coordinated to some extent but lacks a strategic focus and full participation from all agencies. Clarifying goals and ensuring agency participation is crucial to advancing environmental justice efforts.", "The United States and other nations have endorsed IAEA's Code of Conduct, which promotes the safe use of radioactive material. The Code applies to potentially dangerous quantities of radioactive material. The risk of a radiological dispersion device (RDD) is determined by the threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The consequences of an RDD depend on the quantity and type of radioactive material used. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) assesses risk based on prompt fatalities and deterministic health effects, rather than socioeconomic consequences. Experts suggest that NRC should consider socioeconomic effects and fatalities from evacuations when assessing the consequences of an RDD. Recent studies show that prompt fatalities and deterministic health effects are unlikely to result from an RDD. The federal government estimates the socioeconomic costs of an RDD to be in the billions of dollars. Experts note that the estimates may be understated and recommend considering local cleanup standards and fatalities resulting from evacuations.", "FEMA programs encourage disaster resilience during recovery efforts, but there are opportunities to improve resilience nationwide. In 2015, the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group created a National Mitigation Investment Strategy to help plan and prioritize resilience efforts. FEMA's Public Assistance program promotes hazard mitigation, but there is a need for more consistent planning and performance measures. The federal government has not undertaken strategic planning on the potential economic effects of climate change, and recommendations have been made to identify risks and craft appropriate responses. FEMA and HUD provide disaster recovery assistance, with billions of dollars being allocated. Challenges have been identified in the implementation of the Public Assistance program, including eligibility criteria, the redesign of the delivery model, and challenges in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. FEMA is considering alternative methodologies for assessing a jurisdiction's capacity to respond to and recover from disasters. FEMA's redesigned delivery model and the web-based case management system have faced challenges but have now implemented necessary controls. Fixed-cost estimating processes and alternative procedures have posed challenges in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, but progress is being made. Further assessment is ongoing, and deadlines for fixed-cost estimates are being extended.", "The state and local government sector is projected to face a fiscal imbalance in the next 50 years, with expenditures growing at a faster rate than revenues. The operating balance, a measure of the sector's ability to cover current expenses with current revenues, is expected to decline. To maintain a balanced budget, the sector would need to take actions to either increase revenues or reduce expenditures. The fiscal gap, which estimates the changes in revenues and expenditures needed to maintain a zero operating balance, is projected to be about 3.6 percent of GDP over the next 50 years. The sector would need to increase total revenues by 4.2 percent each year or reduce noninterest expenditures by 3.2 percent each year to achieve fiscal balance. The growth in overall expenditures is largely driven by health care expenditures, particularly Medicaid. Medicaid spending is projected to increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2018 to 4.6 percent of GDP in the simulations. Health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees are also expected to rise. In order to meet long-term pension obligations, state and local governments would need to contribute about 12.9 percent of wages and salaries to employee pension plans. Federal grants, particularly for Medicaid, are expected to increase as a share of GDP. Total tax revenues for the sector are projected to increase slightly. The long-term fiscal outlook is sensitive to changes in GDP growth, health care excess cost growth, and the rate of return on pension assets. Alternative assumptions for these variables can shift the sector's fiscal outcomes. Overall, the state and local government sector will need to address these fiscal challenges through a combination of revenue increases and expenditure reductions.", "Private student loans are not guaranteed by the federal government and are underwritten by private lenders based on the borrower's credit history and ability to repay. These loans generally have higher interest rates than federal student loans. As of September 2018, five banks held almost half of all private student loan balances, while credit unions and nonbanks also offered private student loans. Private student loans make up about 8 percent of total outstanding student loans. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs the compilation and use of consumer credit information by credit reporting agencies (CRAs) and data furnishers. Private student loan lenders report information to CRAs, including consumer identification, account status, and defaults. A rehabilitation program allows borrowers to request removal of a student loan default from their credit report. Credit scores, developed by FICO and VantageScore, are used by credit providers to predict financial behaviors and assess credit risk. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) supervises private student loan lenders for compliance with consumer financial laws. The prudential regulators oversee banks and credit unions offering private student loans and conduct safety and soundness examinations. Currently, no banks or credit unions with the largest private student loan portfolios offer rehabilitation programs. Reasons cited include low delinquency and default rates, the availability of predefault payment programs, operational uncertainties, and reduced borrower incentives. However, some advantages of offering rehabilitation programs include recovering nonperforming debt and improving a bank's reputation. Credit unions have not expressed interest in offering rehabilitation programs. Issues of uncertainty exist regarding the authority of nonbank private student loan lenders to offer rehabilitation programs and what constitutes a \"default\" for the purposes of removing information from credit reports. Nonbank state lenders have varying interpretations of their authority to offer rehabilitation programs. Some representatives believe they have the authority, while others are unsure. Trade associations are seeking clarification on this matter. The CFPB has not made a determination on whether nonbank lenders have the authority to remove defaults from credit reports for borrowers who have completed rehabilitation programs.", "Federal agencies rely on information systems and electronic data to carry out their missions and account for their resources. They exchange sensitive information with state agencies, making the security of systems and data crucial. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) establishes requirements for protecting federal systems and managing cybersecurity risks. However, a review found that the four selected federal agencies had significant variances in their cybersecurity requirements for state agencies. These variances caused challenges and increased time, costs, and complexity for state agencies. The federal agencies did not fully coordinate with each other to ensure consistency in requirements. The agencies cited the need for agency-specific responsibilities and deviations from NIST guidelines as reasons for the variances. While some variances may be necessary, agencies need to document decisions and provide a rationale based on agency mission and business needs.", "In fiscal year 2019, the federal government plans to invest over $90 billion in IT projects. However, there have been many failed IT projects in the past that wasted funds and did not contribute to mission-related outcomes. These failures were often due to a lack of effective management, oversight, and governance. In addition, federal agencies have faced cybersecurity deficiencies, such as minimal oversight of data protection and weaknesses in information security programs. To address these issues, Congress and the President enacted the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) to improve IT management. FITARA includes requirements related to CIO authority, data center consolidation, transparency, risk management, portfolio review, IT acquisition training, software purchasing, and strategic sourcing. OMB has issued guidance to agencies for implementing FITARA and data center optimization. Congress and the President have also extended certain provisions of FITARA and enacted the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, which authorizes funding mechanisms for IT modernization. FISMA was enacted to improve federal cybersecurity and assign responsibilities to entities such as OMB, DHS, and federal agencies. The administration has also established the Office of American Innovation and the American Technology Council to improve federal IT and cybersecurity. Executive orders and reports have been issued to further guide efforts in IT modernization and management. The President's Management Agenda outlines a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government, with IT modernization as a top priority.", "The Coast Guard did not have a sound business case when it established the acquisition baselines for its polar icebreaker program due to risks in design, technology, cost, and schedule. A sound business case is necessary to avoid breaching cost, schedule, and performance baselines. The Coast Guard set the program baselines before conducting a preliminary design review, which is not consistent with best practices. The Coast Guard also did not conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies. The Navy's cost estimate for the program partially adheres to best practices and is not fully reliable. The Coast Guard's planned delivery dates for the ships were driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities rather than a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities. To address these risks, recommendations were made to conduct a technology readiness assessment, update the cost estimate, develop a realistic program schedule, and update the acquisition program baselines. DHS concurred with the recommendations and identified actions it planned to take. The program has received $360 million in funding so far and plans to use $300 million in Navy appropriations in fiscal year 2019. The program's acquisition strategy includes options for subsequent ships but it is unclear how much funding will be provided.", "The Coast Guard has made several organizational changes since 9/11 in order to realign its functions. These include the implementation of \"Sectorization\" from 2004 to 2006, modernization efforts in 2006, and the establishment of new headquarters organizations. The Coast Guard uses three analytical tools to determine workforce requirements: manpower requirements determinations, the Sector Staffing Model, and the Activity-Based Staffing Model. The modernization effort aimed to address challenges in aligning operations, delivering mission support, and improving maintenance of assets. The Coast Guard consolidated functions under three new headquarters organizations: Deputy Commandant for Operations, Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, and Force Readiness Command. Modernization efforts are ongoing, with continued improvements to risk management, organizational structure, and mission support functions. The Coast Guard's reorganization of its reserve component also took place under modernization efforts. However, the Coast Guard did not consistently apply selected key reform practices in its modernization effort, including holding leadership accountable for its success. Despite challenges, the Coast Guard remains committed to the modernization effort and continues to make incremental adjustments.", "The federal government owns a large number of buildings in the United States, including courthouses, offices, hospitals, and laboratories. The General Services Administration (GSA) acts as the government's landlord and is responsible for managing these buildings. Each year, GSA spends millions of dollars on construction projects, both new construction and repairs to existing buildings. The projects go through a sequential process, starting with identification and ending with close-out. GSA uses different delivery methods for its projects, such as Construction Manager as Constructor and Design-Build. GSA's construction projects can be more expensive than similar private sector projects due to design and procurement requirements specific to federal projects. GSA uses project management plans, peer reviews, and earned value management to monitor its construction projects. Changes to projects' costs and schedules are common, and GSA often rebaselines the project to account for these changes.", "The IRS released its most recent tax gap estimate, revealing that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. However, the IRS estimated that taxpayers voluntarily and timely paid about 81.7 percent, or $2.04 trillion, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year. Underreporting of tax liabilities accounted for the majority of the tax gap estimate, making up 84 percent of the total. Individual income taxes made up the largest portion of underreporting. The IRS uses various methods to estimate the tax gap, including the National Research Program (NRP) study of individual tax returns. However, the IRS has not provided plans for updating the employment tax gap estimate based on the results of the NRP study. Reducing the tax gap would have significant financial benefits and improve the government's fiscal position. The tax gap undermines the integrity of the tax system and puts an unfair burden on compliant taxpayers. The complexity of the tax code and the lack of transparency contribute to the tax gap. The IRS's budget has declined, resulting in a reduction in staffing and enforcement efforts. Improving enforcement and reducing the tax gap will require a multi-faceted approach, including improving data analysis, setting a voluntary compliance goal, analyzing study results, leveraging existing programs, and implementing targeted legislative actions.", "The Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for immigration enforcement and removal operations, including identifying, arresting, and detaining foreign nationals. ICE manages the immigration detention system and has discretion to release individuals under certain conditions. The ICE memo, Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant Detainees, sets policies and procedures for pregnant detainees. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for border control and temporarily holds individuals for processing and determining the appropriate course of action. CBP has recently implemented enhanced medical services for individuals in custody. From 2016 to 2018, ICE detained over 4,600 pregnant women, with the majority of detentions occurring for non-criminal pregnant women. The length of detention varied, with most detentions being 7 days or less. Miscarriages were the most common outcome of pregnancy in ICE custody. IHSC-staffed facilities initially detain the majority of pregnant women, but transfers may occur based on individual circumstances. CBP does not routinely collect data on pregnant women in its custody, but ICE data indicate that CBP arrests resulted in nearly 4,400 detentions of pregnant women. CBP significant incident reports show that pregnant women in CBP custody experienced births, miscarriages, and stillbirths. ICE has policies and detention standards for the care of pregnant women, although not all facilities have addressed all pregnancy-related topics in their policies. Overall, ICE's policies and detention standards largely align with recommended guidance from professional associations and federal agencies.", "Over the past 10 years, as cigarette sales have decreased, the sales of roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, small cigars, and large cigars have increased as a percentage of the total market for smoking tobacco products. Cigarette sales have declined from 350.3 billion cigarettes in 2008 to 236.9 billion cigarettes in 2018, while the combined sales of other tobacco products have increased from 24.5 billion sticks in 2008 to 34.6 billion sticks in 2018. This shift in the market is due in part to the increase in federal excise tax rates on cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, and small cigars in 2009, which equalized the tax rates for these products. However, the tax rate for pipe tobacco did not increase to the same level as the other products, creating a tax disparity that led to an increase in the sales of pipe tobacco. Additionally, the tax rate on large cigars increased significantly, leading to a decrease in sales of small cigars and an increase in sales of large cigars. These market shifts have resulted in federal revenue losses of approximately $2.5 to $3.9 billion from 2009 to 2018.", "Border Patrol agents and OFO officers apprehend noncitizen family units and interview each individual, collecting personal and biometric information. They run records checks to determine immigration or criminal history. If individuals are ineligible for admission, they may be placed in full or expedited immigration removal proceedings. In full proceedings, individuals can challenge their removal and apply for relief or protection, while expedited proceedings may result in immediate removal unless individuals express fear of persecution or torture. Family units are usually placed in expedited proceedings and their information is recorded in agency data systems. Separated children are transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). CBP traditionally separated children in specific circumstances but saw an increase in separations in 2017. The zero-tolerance policy implemented in 2018 led to more separations as parents were prosecuted and children transferred to ORR custody. After a court order, efforts were made to reunite separated parents and children. CBP apprehensions of family unit members increased from fiscal year 2016 to 2019, with the majority being Central American nationals and children under the age of 12. Most family units consisted of a single parent and child, with single males leading an increasing number of households. The percentage of family unit members placed in full removal proceedings increased while those placed in expedited proceedings decreased due to limited space in ICE's family residential centers. The Migrant Protection Protocols were introduced to initiate full removal proceedings and return eligible individuals to Mexico while they await court proceedings. Family units placed into full removal proceedings were typically released into the United States due to limited detention space and the Flores Agreement limiting the detention of children. At least 2,700 children were separated by CBP during a certain period, and it's possible that more separations occurred.", "The Department of the Interior is responsible for overseeing the development of federal oil and gas resources located in onshore and offshore areas. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has leasing authority in offshore waters, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. BOEM schedules lease sales on a 5-year planning basis and determines minimum bid levels, rental fees, and royalty rates. Lease terms can be changed, and certain leases may be subject to royalty relief. BOEM evaluates the economic viability of tracts receiving bids and conducts a detailed economic analysis to determine if high bids represent fair market value. The price of oil and changes in royalty rates are key factors that drive industry bids for offshore oil and gas leases. Higher oil prices and lower royalty rates tend to result in higher bonus bids, while lower oil prices and higher royalty rates have the opposite effect. However, decreases in royalty rates may lead to lower overall federal offshore oil and gas revenues. BOEM regularly assesses potential changes to fiscal terms and has been developing a progressive, priced-based royalty system.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has various policies and procedures in place for processing and making decisions about family members encountered during immigration proceedings. The definitions of key terms such as \"family,\" \"unaccompanied alien child (UAC),\" \"family unit,\" and \"dependent\" are outlined. The document explains how different DHS components, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), collect and use information about family members. However, the report finds that DHS has not effectively communicated and coordinated the information needs of its components, resulting in fragmented information collection. As a result, the information that CBP collects about family members may not align with the needs of other components or agencies, creating inefficiencies and gaps in information sharing.", "Intergenerational economic mobility is the comparison of people's incomes in adulthood to their parents' incomes in the past. Measures of economic mobility include absolute economic mobility, relative economic mobility, and intergenerational income elasticity. Economic mobility in the US has remained flat or declined over the past 40 years, with studies showing that parental income, race, and geography are key factors in determining economic mobility. Millennials, who are more diverse and educated than previous generations, may not experience the same level of economic mobility as their parents. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows that incomes for Millennials have remained relatively flat, with lower net worth and homeownership rates compared to previous generations. Millennial households also have higher levels of student debt. Overall, economic mobility varies based on race, neighborhood characteristics, and geographic location.", "In fiscal year 2018, VHA data showed that 518,570 veterans received treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) from VHA's healthcare systems, which was a 9.5 percent increase from fiscal year 2016. Most veterans received treatment for alcohol use disorder. The rate of veterans receiving SUD treatment from VHA was higher than the general population. VHA provides specialty SUD services in outpatient, residential, and inpatient settings. Medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder is also offered. There has been an increase in veterans receiving medication-assisted treatment, and VHA has implemented programs to prevent opioid-related overdose deaths. Veterans may also receive services from community providers through local contracts or community care programs. The number of veterans receiving specialty SUD services has remained relatively stable, but expenditures have increased slightly. Most veterans received outpatient specialty SUD services, while a smaller percentage received intensive outpatient or residential treatment. The average length of stay in residential rehabilitation treatment programs decreased, and wait times varied across programs. VHA has also seen an increase in the number of providers with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Naloxone kit distribution has increased significantly.", "The Navy bases most of its surface ships in the United States, but it also has 38 surface ships assigned to overseas homeports. Basing ships overseas provides strategic advantages, but it has also resulted in a worsening trend in ship readiness. The Navy assigns newly commissioned ships to a U.S. homeport, but may change their homeport throughout their service life. The Navy has a 10-year cap on the length of time certain ships can be based at overseas homeports. There are several organizations within the Navy responsible for ship maintenance, including type commanders and Naval Sea Systems Command. The Navy has different maintenance approaches for ships based in Japan, Spain, and Bahrain. The Navy operates its own maintenance facilities in Japan, but relies on contractors in Spain and Bahrain. However, the Navy has struggled to complete maintenance periods on time due to various factors.", "The Direct Loan program provides financial assistance to students and their parents for postsecondary education. The program offers various types of student loans, such as Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. After receiving a loan, it is disbursed through the borrower's school and assigned to a loan servicer. Borrowers are responsible for making payments directly to the loan servicer once they leave school. There are different repayment plans available, including Standard, Graduated, Extended, and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans. IDR plans calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's income and family size and can offer loan forgiveness after a certain period. However, there is a risk of fraud and error in IDR plans, as some borrowers may misrepresent their income or family size to lower their monthly payments. This can result in a loss of revenue for Education and potentially increase the cost for loan forgiveness. Education does not have procedures in place to verify borrower reports of zero income or family size, which increases the risk of fraud and error in IDR plans.", "Lebanon is a small country with religious diversity and a history of conflicts. Its political system is based on power-sharing among different religious groups. The Lebanese Civil War, the presence of militant group Hizballah, and the Syrian civil war have all contributed to instability in the country. The United States has provided security assistance to Lebanon since 2013 to strengthen its state institutions and enhance security. The assistance has included training, equipment, and funding. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) have made improvements in border security and counterterrorism capabilities, but challenges still remain. The LAF and ISF rely on U.S. assistance and consider it critical to their mission. However, Hizballah's presence in Lebanon continues to be a challenge. The U.S. conducts end-use monitoring to ensure that the provided equipment is used appropriately. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut has an Interagency Coordination System (ICS) to guide the implementation of security-related activities, but there are areas for improvement, such as establishing targets for performance indicators.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an organization composed of five Commissioners who oversee its operations and provide final approval over staff interpretation of federal securities laws, proposals for new rules, and enforcement activities. The Commission is supported by various offices and divisions, including mission-critical offices responsible for implementing the SEC's mission. These offices, such as the Office of Human Resources and the Office of Financial Management, play key roles in personnel management and financial administration. The SEC employs approximately 4,369 staff members, with the majority designated as mission-critical employees, including attorneys and employees working in the regional offices responsible for investigating and litigating violations of securities laws. Employees generally have positive views towards their supervisors and colleagues, but have concerns related to the performance management system, a risk-averse culture, and favoritism in hiring and promotions. Despite positive views on SEC as a place to work, the recent hiring freeze had a negative impact on morale. Communication within divisions and offices is generally encouraged, but some employees express concerns about the flow of information and knowledge sharing. Training opportunities are generally viewed as positive, but there are concerns about the availability of external training with industry-specific knowledge. Senior officers have similar views to non-executive employees, with concerns about the performance management system. It is noted that SEC has not validated its performance management system through employee feedback and missed an opportunity to do so. SEC plans to implement a new performance management system in 2020 and has agreed with the employee union to include an incentive bonus program.", "Federal agency IT systems are critical to the nation but often rely on outdated legacy systems that are costly to maintain. In response, Congress enacted the MGT Act in 2017, which established the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) to help agencies improve or replace their systems. The TMF is administered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Technology Modernization Board. Agencies must submit project proposals to the board, which evaluates and prioritizes them. So far, the board has awarded $89.36 million to seven projects. Agencies that receive funding must repay the amount and pay an administrative fee. The TMF Program Management Office within GSA oversees the fund's administration and collects fees. Agencies must use competitive procedures to award contracts for IT products and services, but exceptions are allowed. As of August 2019, the TMF Program Management Office had obligated $1.2 million in operating costs, but the amount collected in administrative fees had been lower than planned. Cost savings from the projects are expected to start in fiscal year 2020 or later.", "NMB is led by a three-member board appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of 3 years. They oversee the overall strategic direction of NMB and have key responsibilities such as releasing parties from mediation in major disputes. In 2018, NMB reorganized its components to improve management and created new offices for fiscal services and information services. A CFO and CIO were also hired to oversee budget and financial functions and information technology, respectively. NMB's mission is to provide independence to carriers and employees, prevent interruption to commerce, administer adjustment boards, and resolve disputes. They have three program areas: representation, mediation and alternative dispute resolution, and arbitration. OMB and OPM provide oversight, and NMB has a MOU with NLRB's IG for independent audit and investigation. NMB is subject to FedRAMP requirements for cloud services. GAO has made recommendations to NMB in previous reports, and as of the current review, six have been implemented and seven remain open. Recommendations include developing and implementing policies for outside employment, addressing the rail arbitration case backlog, and taking action on the results of the organizational climate assessment. NMB has made progress in some areas, such as implementing policies for outside employment and reducing the arbitration backlog, but additional actions are needed to fully address all recommendations.", "The federal debt held by the public in the United States has reached 79 percent of GDP by the end of fiscal year 2019, compared to an average of 46 percent since 1946. If current trends continue, the debt as a share of GDP will exceed the historic high level of 106 percent in 11 to 14 years and will nearly double by 2050. This growth is driven by a combination of an aging population, increased healthcare costs, and rising interest rates. Spending on major health and retirement programs is projected to surpass spending on net interest, which includes interest costs on the federal government's debt. Over the next few decades, interest rates and the debt are expected to grow, leading to an increase in spending on net interest. If interest rates rise, refinancing maturing debt at higher rates will add to the interest costs of the growing federal debt. The rising debt poses financial challenges and fiscal risks, which could have long-term consequences for the economy, including the potential for a fiscal crisis. To address these challenges, policymakers will need to consider changes to revenue and spending policies as well as other approaches for managing the level of debt. The current debt limit, which is a legal restriction on the total amount of federal debt, does not restrict Congress's ability to pass spending and revenue legislation. However, uncertainty surrounding the debt limit can have negative impacts on Treasury borrowing costs and demand for Treasury securities. It is recommended that Congress consider other approaches to the debt limit to avoid disruption in the Treasury market. Fiscal rules, which impose numerical limits or targets on the budget, can support efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability. Establishing a fiscal target for controlling the size of the federal debt relative to the economy, along with well-designed rules, could form part of a long-term fiscal plan. Delaying action will burden future generations, so it is important to address the issue sooner rather than later. While legislative actions are required to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, executive agencies can also contribute by reducing improper payments, addressing the tax gap, managing fragmentation and overlap in the federal government, and improving information on federal programs and fiscal operations.", "State officials have failed to submit Section 653(a) reports to Congress within the mandated 30-day time frame for the past four fiscal years, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Section 653(a) reports are required under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971 and are meant to provide Congress with information on how foreign assistance funds are allocated by country and account. State officials have cited a complex process for addressing appropriation requirements and directives, as well as data collection weaknesses, as reasons for the delays. The GAO report highlights the need for State to review and improve this process in order to meet the 30-day mandate.", "The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) was passed by Congress in 2002 to address issues faced by the insurance industry and businesses after the September 11 terrorist attacks. TRIA is designed to protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of commercial property/casualty insurance for terrorism risk. It also allows for a transitional period for private markets to stabilize and build capacity to absorb future losses. Insurers must offer coverage for terrorism losses that is comparable to coverage for other events, and they can charge a separate premium for terrorism risk. TRIA requires insurers to make terrorism coverage available for certain lines of insurance, but policyholders are not required to purchase it. The federal government does not charge insurers up-front for coverage under TRIA, but it must recoup part of its losses following a certified act of terrorism. Certification of an act of terrorism requires the Secretary of the Treasury to evaluate the event based on specific criteria and consult with relevant officials. Insurers must submit claims for payment of federal coverage within 7 days of certification. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program provides shared compensation for insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. Insurers are responsible for a deductible before receiving federal coverage, and the government reimburses 80% of additional losses. Coverage for losses is capped at $100 billion. After an act of terrorism, Treasury is required to recoup part of the federal share of losses through policyholder premium surcharges. Previous TRIA reauthorizations have decreased federal responsibility for losses, but the 2019 reauthorization made few changes to the program. Terrorism risk insurance coverage is generally available and affordable in the market, and the majority of policyholders purchase it. The market for terrorism risk insurance has remained stable in recent years, with coverage offered by most insurers. Premiums for terrorism risk insurance are relatively small compared to overall premiums, and coverage is available in both embedded and stand-alone policies. Take-up rates for coverage vary by line of insurance, industry sector, and geographic location. Premiums have remained consistent, and workers' compensation has the highest premium collection.", "The federal government planned to invest over $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018, but previous reports have shown that many IT investments result in failed projects, cost overruns, and little progress toward mission-related outcomes. Examples include the disbanding of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System after 16 years and $5 billion, the termination of the Secure Border Initiative Network program after over $1 billion, and the termination of the Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program after $609 million. Failed IT projects often lack effective management, oversight, and governance. Additionally, security deficiencies in IT systems pose a threat, despite the $4 billion spent on IT security-related activities by CFO Act agencies in fiscal year 2016. Legislation such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) have been enacted to address IT management issues and improve cybersecurity. The administration has also initiated efforts to improve federal IT, including the establishment of the Office of American Innovation and the American Technology Council. The President's Management Agenda and the Cross-Agency Priority goal on IT modernization outline long-term visions and priorities for modernizing federal IT. Executive orders have been signed to enhance the effectiveness of agency CIOs and reduce cybersecurity risks. However, there is still significant work to be done to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations.", "Marine debris is a growing problem that originates from multiple sources, including plastics and fishing gear. Plastics do not biodegrade but instead break down into microplastics, which can be harmful to marine organisms. Fishing gear that is lost or discarded also contributes to marine debris and can cause harm to marine life and habitats. The international community has recognized the issue of marine debris and has set goals to prevent and reduce it. The Marine Debris Act governs the activities of the interagency committee, which is responsible for coordinating efforts to address marine debris. However, the committee has not established a process to determine membership or collaboration among federal agencies. NOAA has taken a lead role in addressing marine debris through its Marine Debris Program, which conducts education, outreach, research, and other activities. Other agencies on the committee have conducted activities related to their authority or agency mission, but have not received specific appropriations for marine debris. The committee shares information through quarterly meetings and has identified opportunities for collaboration, but its main focus has been information sharing. NOAA has recognized the need to establish a process for determining membership on the committee and is working to develop a documented process.", "Black lung benefits provide cash assistance and medical benefits to coal miners. Cash assistance ranges from $660 to $1,320 per month, depending on the number of dependents. Miners also receive medical benefits that cover the treatment of black lung-related conditions. In 2018, the average annual cost for medical treatment per miner was $9,667. The number of black lung beneficiaries has been decreasing due to declining coal mining employment and an aging population. However, the occurrence of black lung disease is increasing, particularly among Appalachian coal miners. Black lung claims are processed by the Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation in the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. In fiscal year 2018, black lung claims had an approval rate of about 34 percent. The Trust Fund, which funds black lung benefits, has consistently borrowed from the Treasury's general fund since 1979. Future projections suggest that Trust Fund revenue will continue to decrease, while benefit payments and administrative costs will increase, resulting in annual deficits. This will lead to an increase in the Trust Fund's outstanding debt. Self-insured coal operators may also affect the Trust Fund if they become bankrupt, as their benefit liabilities may be passed on to the Fund. The Department of Labor (DOL) has not regularly monitored self-insured operators and has not updated estimates of their benefit liabilities. DOL is working on new procedures for self-insurance, which will ensure adequate collateral for the Trust Fund.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses various information sources recommended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to identify potential barriers to equal employment opportunities (EEO). They analyze workforce data, conduct surveys, solicit employee input, and address barriers. DHS has reported improvements in employee engagement and representation of minorities and women. However, the department faces challenges in collecting complete applicant flow data and lacks performance metrics for tracking progress in eliminating EEO barriers. DHS and its components also have compliance issues with EEOC requirements, and staffing for EEO programs is inadequate. It is recommended that DHS develop policies, procedures, and staffing models, and take actions to address areas of noncompliance. Leadership commitment is crucial in addressing these challenges.\n", "The Air Force has been working to modernize and consolidate its space command and control systems and improve its space situational awareness since the 1980s. However, the last three space command and control programs ended over budget and schedule, with key capabilities undelivered. The programs faced challenges in integrating numerous assets and deferring requirements to address cost increases. The Air Force's most recent effort, the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS), encountered significant challenges and was unable to deliver planned capabilities. As a result, the Air Force is now planning for the Space C2 program to provide a consolidated space command and control system using a new system design and Agile development. The program aims to anticipate and respond to emerging threats in space and ensure the uninterrupted availability of capabilities to the warfighter.", "The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA are primarily responsible for coordinating disaster response in the US. When the response exceeds the capabilities of state and local governments, federal assistance can be requested. In the case of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the federal government played a significant role due to the destruction caused by the storms. ASPR is the lead agency for coordinating public health and medical services in disaster response. They coordinate with other agencies, NGOs, and the private sector to ensure preparedness and response activities are carried out effectively. ASPR also has the authority to request assistance from other support agencies and coordinate resources during a disaster. The US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have a large population of people over the age of 65 and have a limited number of hospitals and beds to provide care. Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused extensive damage to infrastructure and resulted in widespread power outages in both territories. ASPR responded to the hurricanes by evacuating critical care and dialysis patients, deploying medical staff and temporary medical facilities, and coordinating with other agencies such as DOD and VA. However, there were several deficiencies in ASPR's leadership of the response, including limited presence in the US Virgin Islands and inadequate coordination with support agencies and operations centers. These deficiencies need to be addressed to improve future responses to large-scale disasters.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides air traffic services for domestic airspace and parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans. The oceanic airspace under U.S. control is divided into flight information regions (FIRs) and consists of fixed and flexible air traffic service (ATS) routes.\n\nThe organized track system is a series of ATS routes that function as \"freeways in the sky.\" These routes are published by the FAA and allow air traffic controllers to handle high volumes of traffic efficiently. The FAA also manages radar and ground-based ADS-B technology to monitor aircraft positions in domestic airspace.\n\nIn U.S. oceanic airspace, aircraft operators file flight plans that include their planned route. Air traffic control may make changes to the route during the flight. The FAA uses the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) system to assist in maintaining aircraft separation and coordinating with other flight regions.\n\nSeparation standards, which dictate the minimum distances required between aircraft, ensure safety in oceanic airspace. The FAA sets these standards based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines. Currently, the minimum lateral and longitudinal distance required between aircraft in U.S. oceanic airspace is 30 nautical miles.\n\nThe FAA has evaluated enhanced surveillance technologies, including enhanced ADS-C and space-based ADS-B, to increase the efficiency and capacity of operations in oceanic airspace. The agency has decided to implement new minimum separation standards supported by enhanced ADS-C, starting in 2021. The use of space-based ADS-B in oceanic airspace is still being studied.\n\nThe costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance technologies drove the FAA's decision. The benefits of using enhanced ADS-C to enable new minimum separation standards outweighed the costs. The new standards will provide improved access to fuel-efficient altitudes for airspace users.\n\nHowever, the current minimum separation standards support safe operations for the current levels of air traffic in U.S. oceanic airspace. The success of implementing the new standards depends on planned ATOP upgrades.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified several challenges that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) faces in its acquisition and workforce planning efforts for disaster contracting. These challenges include a lack of timeframes and guidance for the pre-solicitation phase of the acquisition planning process, leading to delays in contract awards and the use of non-competitive bridge contracts. The GAO also found that FEMA's advance contract strategy and guidance did not clearly identify the objectives of advance contracts or prioritize their use over new post-disaster contracts. Additionally, FEMA's coordination and communication with state, local, and federal partners over the use of advance contracts has been inconsistent. The GAO recommends that FEMA update its guidance on acquisition planning timeframes, clearly define the objectives of advance contracts, and improve coordination and communication with partners. Furthermore, the GAO found that limited transparency into disaster contracting obligations makes it difficult to track and evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA's contracting efforts. They recommend that the General Services Administration (GSA), in coordination with the Department of Defense (DOD) and DHS, assess the criteria for establishing and closing a national interest action (NIA) code to improve the tracking of contract obligations.", "Medicaid expenditures are financed by both the federal government and the states. States must adhere to federal requirements and administer their Medicaid programs according to approved state plans. Changes to the Medicaid program require a state plan amendment, which is reviewed and approved by CMS. The federal government matches each state's Medicaid expenditures based on a formula called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. States use Medicaid Management Information Systems to process claims and may contract with Managed Care Organizations to provide services. Medicaid beneficiaries may have other sources of coverage, and states are required to ensure that Medicaid is the payer of last resort. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 made changes to Medicaid third-party liability, including applying cost avoidance procedures to claims for prenatal care services and allowing states to implement wait-and-see periods for pediatric preventive services and services provided to Child Support Enforcement beneficiaries. Some states have implemented the changes for prenatal care services, but planning for the other changes is still in the early stages. Implementing the changes may require system modifications and pose administrative burdens.", "The internet is a network of networks that uses IP addresses to route information between devices. IPv6 was developed to address the limited address space of IPv4, and although IPv6 deployment is increasing, IPv4 is still more widely used. The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on IPv4 for its mission to provide military forces. DOD has the largest number of IPv4 addresses, but expects to exhaust its reserve by 2030. IPv6 offers benefits such as increased address space, enhanced mobility, improved security, and support for IoT. However, transitioning to IPv6 presents challenges, such as the complexity of dual IPv4/IPv6 operations and the immaturity of IPv6 security processes. DOD has been planning for the transition to IPv6 since 2003, but has faced setbacks in implementation due to security concerns. There are specific planning requirements set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for federal agencies, including DOD. These requirements include assigning a lead official, completing an inventory of IP-compliant devices, developing a cost estimate, and conducting a risk analysis. DOD began its most recent transition effort in 2017.", "The cost of conducting the U.S. Census has been increasing with each decade, with the 2010 Census being the most expensive in history at about $12.3 billion. The estimated cost of the 2020 Census has grown to $15.6 billion, although the Bureau is managing the census to a lower cost of $14.1 billion by including contingency funds. The cost of counting a housing unit has also increased over the years, from $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010. The declining mail response rates have led to higher costs as the Bureau needs to send temporary workers to collect data from non-responding households. Additionally, the Bureau faces challenges in achieving a complete and accurate count due to a growing and diverse population, as well as reluctance to participate. The Bureau has made changes to its management practices, technology, and operations in order to conduct a cost-effective enumeration for the 2020 Census. However, there are still significant risks and uncertainties, such as the addition of a citizenship question and budgetary uncertainties. The Bureau has partially met the criteria for removal from the high-risk list, but further progress is needed. The planned innovations for the 2020 Census could result in savings, but they also introduce new risks. The Bureau has conducted operational tests, but funding uncertainties led to the scaling back of some tests. It is crucial for the Bureau to stay on schedule to meet reporting requirements, and it has begun opening area census offices and hiring temporary field staff. The Bureau is also relying on IT systems and contractors to support the 2020 Census, and there is ongoing IT development and testing work.", "AFSOC (Air Force Special Operations Command) is responsible for providing Air Force capabilities and forces to support special operations activities. Demand for AFSOC capabilities is identified as part of the Department of Defense's Global Force Management process. AFSOC considers both active duty and reserve component units to provide the necessary capabilities. If the best solution is to use capabilities from the Air Reserve Component (ARC), AFSOC can use volunteerism or involuntary mobilization to activate the needed forces. Involuntary mobilization is authorized under various statutory authorities. AFSOC is required to follow Air Force guidance for accessing ARC units and personnel. However, AFSOC faces challenges in providing timely notifications to ARC units, coordinating with ANG and AFR commands, and sharing reliable information about requirements and resources. The frequent changes in requirements also create unpredictability and impede ARC units' ability to train and provide the necessary capabilities.", "The U.S. airline industry is largely deregulated, but there are still federal consumer protections in place. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has the authority to regulate certain areas affecting passengers, such as unfair practices and consumer protection regulations. DOT has issued rules to enhance passenger protections in areas such as tarmac delays and compensation for denied boarding. Overall, the operational performance of airlines has improved over the years, with declines in denied boardings and mishandled baggage, but on-time performance has remained about the same. However, the number of passenger complaints has generally increased, with flight problems, baggage issues, and denied boardings being the most common complaints. Airlines have taken actions to address these operational issues, such as reducing denied boardings, improving baggage handling, and minimizing flight disruptions. Passengers with disabilities also face challenges when flying, and the Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. There has been an increase in disability-related complaints, and DOT requires airlines to report these complaints annually. Passengers with accessibility or mobility issues may choose not to fly or may face inconvenience and additional costs. Complaints about discrimination have also increased in recent years, with racial discrimination being the most common complaint. DOT and airlines have taken actions to prevent discrimination, such as training staff and contractors and implementing wheelchair tracking systems.", "Multiple federal departments and components are responsible for combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. The Department of Defense (DOD) created joint task forces in 1989 to bridge military and civilian law enforcement efforts, which have evolved into JIATF-South and JIATF-West. These task forces consist of representatives from DOD, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other agencies. The Coast Guard admirals serve as the directors of both JIATFs. The task forces coordinate their efforts and leverage various experiences and authorities across components. In 2014, DHS created three new joint task forces to address drug smuggling over the southern border and strengthen unity of effort within DHS. The task forces primarily consist of representatives from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Coast Guard. They have broader missions, including coordinating migrant interdiction and counter-terrorism activities. The task forces use various mechanisms to coordinate, including working groups and liaison officers. They coordinate most frequently through meetings, working groups, and liaison officers. They also share intelligence information and sometimes conduct joint operations, especially in joint operating areas where their responsibilities overlap.", "The summary of the text is as follows: \n\nThe 8(a) program provides assistance to small, disadvantaged businesses through business development support from the Small Business Administration (SBA). ANC-owned firms have a unique status in the program and can enter into complex business arrangements. However, there have been persistent weaknesses in the oversight and monitoring of ANC-owned firms, including incomplete information and documentation on compliance with regulations, limitations in tracking and sharing program data, insufficient staffing in SBA's Alaska District Office, and inadequate program guidance. SBA has implemented some recommendations to address these weaknesses, but there are still six recommendations that have not been implemented. These recommendations include tracking revenue data and other information on ANC-owned firms to prevent violations of regulatory requirements.", "Entities seeking to do business with the Department of Defense (DOD) may have opaque ownership structures that conceal ownership or control by other entities or individuals. This makes it difficult for DOD to determine the true owners or controllers of its contractors. While the Securities and Exchange Commission collects ownership information on publicly traded companies, there is no centralized information source or national registry that maintains company ownership information in the United States. In order to increase transparency and traceability in procurement, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended to require entities doing business with the federal government to provide ownership information through the annual registration process in the System for Award Management (SAM). However, the FAR does not require offerors to report their beneficial owners. When making contract-award decisions, contracting officers must determine the responsibility of prospective contractors, including their ability to perform the terms of a contract. The responsibility determination includes evaluating financial resources, delivery schedules, performance records, and compliance with laws and regulations. The contracting officer must also review the prospective contractor's performance and integrity information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). Contractors with opaque ownership structures can pose financial and nonfinancial fraud risks to DOD by manipulating ownership information to commit fraud against the government. Contractors can use opaque ownership structures to inflate prices, bill for work not performed, disguise conflicts of interest, and create the appearance of competition to inflate prices. DOD has not systematically assessed the risks posed by contractor ownership, so the magnitude and prevalence of these risks are not known.", "The naval shipyards, which are responsible for maintaining and repairing nuclear-powered ships and submarines, are facing challenges due to their age and poor condition. The Navy has developed the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan to address these deficiencies and improve shipyard performance. The plan includes investments in dry docks, facilities, and capital equipment. The Navy estimates that the plan could save 328,000 labor-days each year. However, the plan's effectiveness remains to be seen as facility planning has not been completed and the proposed actions are years away from implementation. The plan also does not account for changes in the shipbuilding schedule, which could impact its ability to address facility deficiencies. The implementation of the plan will be a complex, multiyear effort that involves redesigning workflows and optimizing facility layouts. The Navy expects it to take at least 20 years to complete the facility optimization process and increase spending on facility construction and modernization. Modeling and simulation of shipyard production facilities are currently underway and are expected to be completed by 2020. However, shipyard officials have expressed doubts about the timeline and complexity of the effort.", "When children are removed from their homes, state or local child welfare agencies are responsible for finding them new placements and providing services. These agencies may contract with private child welfare agencies for assistance. Children are often placed in foster homes or group care settings based on their needs. Foster caregivers are usually provided with a monthly payment to cover the costs of caring for the child. Children remain in foster care until a suitable living arrangement can be made, either through reunification with their family or through adoption, guardianship, or another permanent arrangement. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal funding to help cover the costs of operating foster care programs. This funding can be accessed through reimbursements for daily care and supervision of eligible youth or through the Chafee Program, which provides support services for transition to adulthood. The Fostering Connections Act allows states to use title IV-E funds for extended foster care for youth ages 18 to 21. States have the option to implement different eligibility criteria and can use supervised independent living settings for older youth in extended foster care. These settings are primarily intended for youth in extended care and offer increased independence and responsibility. States may also use other federal funds and a combination of state, local, and federal funds to support their child welfare programs. Overall, the goal is to provide children and youth with safe and supportive environments as they navigate their journey through the child welfare system.", "Campus climate surveys on sexual violence are used to collect data on the incidence and characteristics of sexual violence on college campuses, as well as student attitudes and behaviors related to the issue. These surveys can cover a variety of topics and can be administered through either a census or sample approach. The surveys are seen as a useful tool for colleges to address sexual assault on campus, and some states have even enacted laws requiring them. However, there is currently no federal requirement for colleges to conduct these surveys. The surveys face challenges such as limited access to survey expertise, low response rates, and the need for careful wording of questions to accurately collect data. Despite these challenges, campus climate surveys provide valuable information that can help colleges identify areas for improvement and assess their performance in addressing sexual violence.", "The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the eight regional fishery management councils are responsible for managing roughly 460 fish stocks in federal waters. NMFS collects data on fish stocks and ocean conditions and uses this information to generate scientific data for the conservation and management of marine resources. The councils are responsible for developing fishery management plans and making allocation decisions based on the best scientific information available. Stakeholder engagement is an important part of the fisheries management process, with input from the commercial and recreational fishing sectors and other related industries. NMFS reviews and approves the plans and regulations for implementation. Allocation decisions are made based on factors such as conservation, economic and social consequences, and ecological impacts. NMFS has issued guidelines and policies to address allocation issues and promote stakeholder engagement in the decision-making process. The South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico councils have established and revised allocations for their mixed-use fish stocks based on historical data and changing conditions of the fishery. However, there is a need for better documentation and periodic review of allocations to ensure fairness and effectiveness in managing the fisheries.", "Federal law establishes the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit under Medicaid, which covers a range of screening, vision, dental, and hearing services for beneficiaries. The EPSDT benefit is more comprehensive than the benefits provided to adult beneficiaries and is implemented through joint efforts between the federal government and states. CMS oversees the EPSDT benefit and collects data on its provision through the CMS-416 and the Child Core Set. However, there are limitations in the data collected and the performance measures used, which hinder effective oversight. CMS could take action to improve the quality of information and set performance measure targets that are more closely linked to desired program outcomes. While CMS has made some efforts to improve the provision of EPSDT services, more consistent communication, evaluation, and assistance to states are needed.", "Veterans with at least a 20 percent service-connected disability rating from the VA and a need for rehabilitation due to an employment handicap may be entitled to VR&E services. These services include vocational rehabilitation and employment services like counseling, placement, and post-placement assistance. Veterans can receive up to 48 months of vocational rehabilitation services and an additional 18 months of employment services. VR&E counselors work with veterans to develop an employment plan that aligns with their abilities, aptitudes, and interests, while also considering their service-connected disabilities. Common VR&E services include funding for higher education, career counseling, and job search assistance. The VR&E program is overseen by the VR&E central office, and services are provided by field staff at 56 regional offices and 300 satellite locations. From fiscal year 2013 to 2019, the number of participants in the VR&E program peaked in 2016, and the number of counselors remained relatively stable until 2019 when additional staff were hired. VR&E counselors consider factors like the veteran's disabilities, abilities, and interests when developing employment plans. During a review of 34 case files, counselors commonly documented these factors as well as estimated costs for employment plans. However, some veterans may be dissuaded from pursuing education at top-tier universities due to cost considerations. VR&E counselors strive to develop plans that best meet the needs of each veteran, taking into account factors like geographical location and local labor market conditions. However, inherent subjectivity and professional judgment can introduce potential bias and lead to inconsistent plans. Counselor experience and regional office policies can also contribute to variations in plan development. VA provides training for counselors and evaluates its training efforts to ensure counselors have the necessary skills and knowledge. Quality reviews of VR&E services occur nationally and locally to monitor the completeness and quality of entitlement decisions, employment plans, and service delivery. Overall, while there may be some inconsistencies in plan development, counselors aim to develop individualized plans that best meet the unique needs of veterans.", "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) includes provisions to ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. These provisions require state educational agencies (SEAs) and school districts to collaborate with child welfare agencies to enroll foster children in their school of origin, unless it is determined that it is not in the child's best interest. If it is determined that remaining in the school of origin is not in the child's best interest, the child must be immediately enrolled in a new school. SEAs must designate an employee to serve as a point of contact for child welfare agencies and oversee implementation of the provisions. School districts must work with child welfare agencies to designate a point of contact and develop procedures for providing transportation to maintain foster children in their school of origin. SEAs and school districts are also required to publicly report on the academic achievement and graduation rates of foster youth. States and localities have flexibility in implementing these provisions, with some variation in how best interest determinations are made and transportation procedures are carried out. Challenges to implementation include turnover among agency staff, lack of collaboration between child welfare agencies and schools for best interest determinations, difficulties in providing and funding transportation, accurate identification of foster youth, and monitoring implementation by school districts. Turnover of staff was reported as a significant challenge, as it affects the implementation of the provisions. Ensuring school district participation in best interest determinations was also reported as a challenge, with some child welfare agencies not including school districts due to time constraints or prioritizing of other issues. Providing and funding transportation was another challenge, with limited options in rural areas and difficulties with younger youth and those with behavioral issues. Funding the additional transportation costs was also a concern for school districts. Overall, the implementation of the ESSA educational stability provisions requires collaboration between SEAs, school districts, and child welfare agencies to ensure the educational stability of foster youth.", "Corrosion is the deterioration of a material due to a reaction with its chemical environment. The Department of Defense (DOD) has established the Corrosion Office and Corrosion Executives to provide leadership on corrosion matters. The Corrosion Office is responsible for oversight and coordination of corrosion control efforts, while the Corrosion Executives operate within their respective military departments. The Corrosion Office was relocated within DOD in 2018 and now reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness. The Corrosion Office is currently being led by an acting director, but a permanent director is expected to be in place by Spring 2019. The Corrosion Office's duties include developing and recommending corrosion policy guidance, implementing a long-term strategy to reduce corrosion, reviewing corrosion programs and funding levels, monitoring and ensuring the incorporation of corrosion prevention and mitigation in acquisition and maintenance programs, and providing training and networking opportunities in the field of corrosion prevention. The Corrosion Office is currently working on updating policy guidance and developing a new manual on corrosion. It is also reviewing proposed corrosion programs and funding levels and monitoring the incorporation of corrosion prevention in acquisition and maintenance programs. The Corrosion Office is supported by the military departments' Corrosion Executives, who find the office helpful in establishing corrosion prevention standards and promoting networking and information sharing. The Corrosion Office continues to perform its duties as outlined in section 2228 of Title 10, U.S. Code, and has taken action or has plans to take action on most of the recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The DOD has concurred with GAO's recommendations and has either taken action or plans to take action to address them.", "Federal and state agencies have different definitions of abandoned hardrock mines and mine sites, but generally agree on what constitutes an individual feature. These features can pose physical safety hazards, such as collapsing tunnels and unmarked mine shafts, as well as environmental hazards, such as contaminated water and soil. To address physical safety hazards, agencies focus on identifying and mitigating individual features, while environmental hazards may require more extensive actions such as removing waste rock or establishing water treatment systems. Land ownership at abandoned mine sites is often complicated, as mines may pass from federal to private ownership. The Forest Service, BLM, the Park Service, EPA, and OSMRE all play a role in addressing abandoned hardrock mines, with each agency having its own programs and funding sources. States also have their own abandoned mine programs and maintain their own inventories of abandoned hardrock mines. Currently, databases maintained by federal and state agencies identify over 140,000 abandoned hardrock mine features, with the potential for hundreds of thousands more.", "The U.S. Treasury borrows money by issuing Treasury securities to finance the federal deficit and manage its debt. The primary objective of the Treasury's debt management strategy is to finance the government's borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time. To achieve this, the Treasury issues marketable debt with a regular and predictable framework, providing clear and transparent information to the market. The Treasury manages its debt portfolio to mitigate rollover risk, promote a healthy and liquid secondary market, and attract a broad and diverse investor base. Treasury securities are issued in a wide range of maturities to appeal to different investors and ensure liquid markets. The interest rates associated with these securities create a yield curve, representing the relationship between maturity and yield. Treasury takes steps to adjust auction sizes, frequencies, and introduce new types of securities to meet changing borrowing needs. Treasury securities are held by a wide range of investors, including the Federal Reserve, international investors, and domestic investors. The liquidity, depth, and safety of Treasury securities are considered the most important characteristics, serving as a benchmark for pricing other financial products and providing a safe haven for investors during times of economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's purchases of Treasury securities during the financial crisis substantially increased its holdings, but it has since adopted a new framework to manage short-term interest rates and reduce its balance sheet. Changes in financial regulations have also influenced holdings of Treasury securities, with money market funds increasing their holdings after reforms in 2016. Treasury securities are highly valued despite their lower yields because they offer liquidity, depth, and safety that other assets do not provide. A broad and diverse investor base helps stabilize the Treasury market, and the ability to purchase securities across the yield curve is an important characteristic for investors.", "The GDPs, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Paducah, Kentucky; and Portsmouth, Ohio, were used for uranium enrichment for the U.S. military and domestic nuclear power industry. They became obsolete due to newer technologies and the globalization of the uranium enrichment market. Paducah was the last to stop enrichment in 2013. The sites consist of large buildings and facilities for uranium enrichment processing, as well as infrastructure such as electrical switchyards and cooling towers. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created the USEC Fund to support the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). The balance of the USEC Fund has grown to $1.695 billion as of fiscal year 2020. In 2015, it was suggested that the balance be permanently rescinded, but that has not yet happened. The GDP cleanup process involves surveillance and maintenance, deactivation, decontamination, decommissioning, demolition, and site remediation. Characterization and measurement of contaminants, removal of uranium deposits, disassembly and decontamination of equipment, demolition of structures, and waste management are all part of the cleanup process. Remediation of contaminated soils, surface water, and groundwater is also necessary. Cleanup activities are governed by federal laws and agreements with state regulatory agencies. The Oak Ridge and Paducah GDPs are on EPA's National Priorities List, while the Portsmouth GDP is not. The D&D Fund was established to reimburse licensees of uranium and thorium processing sites for their portion of cleanup costs. Ten sites are continuing remedial activities and receiving reimbursements from the fund. The fund was established in 1992 with annual contributions, and additional sums have continued to be appropriated. The fund covers a range of cleanup activities at the GDPs, including D&D, waste management, surveillance and maintenance, reimbursements to licensees, and training.", "The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing various systems, called elements, to defend against ballistic and hypersonic missile attacks. These elements are combined to create the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to achieve integrated capabilities that individual elements cannot accomplish alone. MDA was established in 2002 and has flexibilities in managing BMDS acquisitions, allowing for expedited fielding of assets and capabilities. However, MDA faces challenges due to tight timeframes, complex technology, and schedule pressures. Despite these challenges, MDA has taken steps to increase transparency, improve stakeholder outreach, reduce concurrency, and enhance BMDS testing. MDA has delivered important capabilities for homeland defense and regional ballistic missile defense. However, there are still areas of improvement, such as engaging with stakeholders, reducing concurrency, addressing contracting issues, improving transparency in test cost estimates, and stabilizing the test schedule.", "The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program was established in 1991 to provide nuclear security assistance to Russia and other former Soviet states. The program aimed to address concerns about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear weapons and materials. In 2014, Russia ended most nuclear security cooperation with the United States in response to US sanctions. Before cooperation ended, the US made significant progress in upgrading security systems at Russian nuclear material sites and improving national-level infrastructure. However, not all planned work was completed, and there were concerns about the sustainability of security efforts and the state of Russia's nuclear material security infrastructure. Since cooperation ended, limited information is available about the current state of security at Russian sites. Insiders are considered the greatest threat to Russia's nuclear materials, and transparency into site-level security has been greatly reduced.", "The CFO Act was enacted in 1990 to address financial management problems within the government. It established a Controller position at the government-wide level and a CFO position at each agency, aimed to strengthen internal controls and financial reporting practices, and required the preparation and independent auditing of federal agency financial statements. Since the enactment of the CFO Act, there has been progress in improving financial management, including the establishment of centralized leadership structures, preparation of annual financial management plans, and improvements in the quality and timeliness of financial reporting. However, challenges still remain, including the persistence of internal control problems, improper payments, and information security weaknesses. Efforts to modernize financial management systems have also faced challenges. Additional enhancements are needed to fully achieve the goals of the CFO Act, including ensuring uniform responsibility for CFOs and addressing inconsistencies across government agencies.", "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a large public engineering and construction agency that is responsible for both military and civilian projects. The Corps is organized into headquarters, regional divisions, and local district offices. When a community needs assistance with a water resources problem, they contact the Corps to initiate a feasibility study. Feasibility studies investigate the problem and make recommendations on whether a project is in the federal interest and how it should be addressed. The Corps uses a risk-informed approach called SMART Planning to conduct feasibility studies efficiently. The process includes multiple phases and milestones that must be completed within a target timeframe of less than 3 years. The feasibility study process also includes environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other statutes. Feasibility studies that require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) tend to take longer and cost more than those that do not. The Corps has taken steps to address the acceleration provisions of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014), including issuing coordination guides and guidance on how to implement the acceleration provisions. The Corps has also reduced the number of active feasibility studies to focus funding on a smaller number of projects. However, the Corps has not fully addressed all of the provisions of WRRDA 2014 related to public transparency and environmental review. Resource constraints have been identified as a primary reason for this, but the Corps has not provided specific estimates on the resources needed to address these provisions or a plan for implementation. The Corps monitors feasibility studies and has conducted some reviews of the impacts of the acceleration reforms, but a comprehensive evaluation has not been conducted. Overall, the Corps has made progress in addressing the acceleration provisions of WRRDA 2014, but there is still work to be done to fully implement all of the provisions and evaluate their impacts.", "The Marine Corps currently uses a fleet of 23 helicopters to support the President. In 2002, the Navy began development of a replacement helicopter known as the VH-71 program, but it was terminated in 2009 due to schedule delays and cost increases. In 2012, the Office of the Secretary of Defense approved a new acquisition approach, which involved modifying an existing aircraft, the Sikorsky S-92A, to meet the requirements of the VH-92A presidential helicopter. In 2014, the Navy awarded a contract to Sikorsky for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the VH-92A program. The VH-92A is expected to provide improved performance, survivability, and communications capabilities compared to the current helicopters. The program has experienced delays and challenges, including issues related to the aircraft's start procedures, landing zone suitability, and mission communications system interoperability. However, the program is making progress and is on track to meet its key performance parameters. The total program acquisition cost estimate has decreased since the program started in 2014 due to stable requirements, limited design changes, and cost-saving measures implemented by the Navy and Sikorsky. The Navy plans to enter low-rate initial production in 2021, pending the results of the initial operational test and evaluation in 2020.", "CBP (Customs and Border Protection) is responsible for inspecting and processing individuals and cargo at the United States' 167 land border crossings. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) manages the operations at these crossings, while the Office of Facilities and Asset Management (OFAM) manages the real property. GSA (General Services Administration) owns or leases most of the land border crossings and works closely with OFAM for capital planning and construction. Land border crossings vary in size, design, and infrastructure depending on the type of traffic they process. CBP follows a standard sequence of preprimary inspection, primary inspection, and secondary inspection for each mode of traffic. Land border crossings play a crucial role in facilitating trade and travel, as well as enforcing immigration and customs laws. CBP officers encounter numerous challenges with infrastructure, including limited space, non-functioning screening technology, and inadequate facilities. Despite these challenges, CBP processed over 252 million entries and inspected nearly $721 billion worth of traded goods at land border crossings in 2017.", "Federal agencies administer various programs that provide services and benefits to tribes and their members. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), as well as the Indian Health Service (IHS), play key roles in managing these programs. However, there are numerous challenges facing these agencies, including high staff vacancies, insufficient staff skills or knowledge, inadequate funding, and effects of budget uncertainty. These challenges hinder the effective delivery of federal programs for tribes and their members. Management weaknesses related to oversight, management, and planning further contribute to these issues. While progress has been made in addressing some of these challenges, continued efforts are needed to improve the delivery of programs and meet the needs of Native Americans. Sustained congressional attention is crucial in addressing these issues and the disparities identified in the U.S. Civil Rights Commission's report.", "The President issued an executive order in March 2017 that required comprehensive reorganization plans for executive branch agencies. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance to federal agencies in April 2017 on developing reform plans. OMB's guidance stated that the progress of the reforms would be tracked using the federal performance planning and reporting framework. In March 2018, OMB released the President's Management Agenda (PMA), which included goals for reform efforts. The administration is planning to transfer the functions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to other government entities by the end of fiscal year 2020. However, as of May 2019, OMB, OPM, and the General Services Administration (GSA) had not fully established goals and performance measures, assessed the costs and benefits, or developed an implementation plan for the reorganization. OMB, OPM, and GSA have also not fully addressed key practices for successful organizational transformations, such as involving stakeholders and addressing management challenges. The proposed reorganization of OPM should consider these practices and ensure transparency and accountability. The legal authority for the reorganization and the specific functions to be transferred have not been fully identified by OMB, OPM, and GSA. It is important to retain the capacity for strategic human capital functions regardless of the organizational structure of OPM. Strategic human capital management remains a high-risk area and central coordination is important for consistency and efficiency.", "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the federal agency responsible for aviation security in the United States. They create and enforce security regulations, conduct inspections, and oversee security operations at airports. Airport operators, air carriers, and other regulated entities are responsible for implementing security measures in accordance with TSA-approved security programs. These programs cover day-to-day operations and help mitigate insider threats. Security measures include employee vetting, access control systems, and training in security procedures. Airport operators and air carriers have some flexibility in implementing additional security measures beyond TSA requirements, but if these measures are incorporated into their security programs, they become accountable for implementing them. TSA's Insider Threat Program aims to deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats to the transportation sector. They have offices and teams that review and analyze potential threats, along with an Insider Threat Unit that receives referrals and conducts investigations. TSA conducts various activities to mitigate insider threats, such as random searches of aviation workers and enhanced vetting processes. They also collaborate with airport operators, air carriers, and other stakeholders to promote awareness and share information on insider threats. TSA has ongoing programs and initiatives to regulate and facilitate security at commercial airports, including awareness and training, intelligence analysis and dissemination, vetting of aviation workers, inspections and assessments, and information sharing. Since 2017, TSA has implemented additional efforts to enhance insider threat mitigation, including social media analysis, advanced threat screening procedures, covert testing, joint vulnerability assessments, and guidance and information sharing on fraudulent identification and security directives.", "NASA's human spaceflight plans have undergone multiple changes in the past 15 years, shifting between human lunar landings and missions to an asteroid boulder. NASA has faced challenges in developing systems for human spaceflight, with previous programs being canceled due to acquisition problems and funding issues. Current programs, such as Orion, SLS, and Exploration Ground Systems, have also experienced cost growth and schedule delays. NASA has made efforts to address these issues and has implemented some recommendations, but further action is needed. NASA has initiated multiple programs to achieve its lunar exploration goals, including the Gateway program, Human Landing System, Space Suits, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover. NASA has made changes to its lunar plans to meet the goal of a human lunar landing in 2024, including reducing the scope of the Gateway program and changing acquisition strategies. However, NASA has not fully defined a system architecture or established requirements for its lunar mission. The agency plans to finalize these documents by the end of 2019.", "The total number of NIV (nonimmigrant visa) applications that were adjudicated annually reached a peak of 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, representing a 30% increase since fiscal year 2012. However, in fiscal year 2017, there was a decrease of about 880,000 adjudications, or 7%. The refusal rate for NIVs increased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, reaching about 22% in fiscal year 2016, and remained the same in fiscal year 2017. The total number of NIVs issued peaked in fiscal year 2015 at 10.89 million, but fell in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to 10.38 million and 9.68 million, respectively. The majority of NIV refusals were a result of applicants being found ineligible, while a small number were due to terrorism and security concerns. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, only 0.05% of applicants were refused for terrorism and security-related reasons. The Department of State implemented visa entry restrictions in accordance with executive actions, resulting in the refusal of 1,338 NIV applications in fiscal year 2017. CBP electronically vets all travelers before they board U.S.-bound flights using their Automated Targeting System (ATS) to identify high-risk individuals. CBP operates air predeparture programs like Preclearance, the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program (JSP), and the regional carrier liaison groups (RCLG) to interdict high-risk individuals before they enter the United States. CBP officers at these programs have the authority to determine admissibility and make no-board recommendations to air carriers. However, CBP has not evaluated the effectiveness of these programs as a whole.", "The text discusses the process that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) follows to determine veterans' eligibility for disability compensation. It explains that veterans can file a claim with VA, which gathers additional evidence to evaluate the claim. VA then decides whether the veteran is entitled to compensation and how much. If the veteran is dissatisfied with VA's decision, they can appeal within one year. The current appeals process, referred to as the legacy process, involves filing a Notice of Disagreement, having the case reviewed by VBA, and then appealing to the Board. However, VA plans to implement a new appeals process in February 2019, which will offer veterans five options for appealing VA's decision. These options include requesting higher-level review, filing a supplemental claim, or appealing directly to the Board with or without a hearing. VA has initiated a test of the new VBA options and is working to address the elements required by the Act. However, there are still some elements, such as monitoring implementation and delineating total resources, that need to be fully addressed. VA also needs to develop a complete set of balanced goals and measures, compare the performance of the new and legacy processes, and improve its master schedule for appeals reform. The text concludes by stating that VA's appeals plan should more fully assess key risks and ensure that a comprehensive set of goals and measures is in place.", "IT systems supporting federal agencies are at risk due to their complexity, diversity, and interconnectivity. Without proper safeguards, these systems can be vulnerable to cyberattacks and security breaches. Federal agencies have reported an increasing number of information security incidents in recent years, although there was a decrease in reported incidents in fiscal year 2016. Major threat vectors include web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment. Two incidents reported in fiscal year 2018 illustrate the seriousness of these threats. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) was enacted to ensure the effectiveness of information security controls in federal agencies. FISMA requires agencies to develop information security programs and comply with security standards and guidelines. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing these standards and guidelines. Inspectors general are tasked with assessing the effectiveness of information security programs, and OMB oversees agencies' information security policies and practices. An Executive Order signed in 2017 sets policy for managing cybersecurity risk in the executive branch and requires agencies to use the NIST cybersecurity framework. Reports indicate that information security policies and practices of federal agencies are ineffective. Most agencies did not consistently implement the core security functions of the cybersecurity framework or the elements of an information security program. Inspectors general reported that most CFO Act agencies did not have effective information security programs or controls over financial systems. Agency CIOs also reported that most agencies had not met targets for implementing cybersecurity capabilities. In fiscal year 2018, civilian agencies spent between $9 million and $1.9 billion on information security, accounting for about 14% of their IT spending. Reports from GAO, inspectors general, and CIOs indicate deficiencies in implementing information security policies and practices across agencies. The Identify core security function, which includes risk management, was particularly problematic, with 15 of the 16 selected agencies having deficiencies in this area. Many agencies also did not maintain comprehensive or up-to-date inventories of their information systems and IT assets. These deficiencies can hinder agencies' ability to effectively manage risk and protect their assets.", "Medication synchronization is a process where a pharmacist aligns the refill dates of a patient's medications to a single day each month. This process improves convenience for patients, increases medication adherence, and may lead to improved medical outcomes. The use of medication synchronization has increased in recent years, although comprehensive data on its use by pharmacies and patients is lacking. Benefits for patients include improved medication adherence, improved medical outcomes, increased convenience, and increased interaction with pharmacists. For pharmacies, benefits include operational efficiencies, increased marketability to health plans, and increased revenue. Health plans may benefit from higher Medicare quality performance scores and reduced medical costs. However, medication synchronization may not be beneficial for all patients, and it involves time and labor-intensive work for pharmacies. Health plans do not require pharmacies to use medication synchronization and do not compensate them for providing this service.", "From January to August 2017, the Navy experienced four mishaps at sea causing deaths and damage. More recently, two incidents occurred in which Navy ships collided. The Navy acknowledges the need for increased focus on safe ship driving. The Navy has around 8,400 surface warfare officers (SWOs) responsible for operating ships. These officers progress through different levels of responsibility, from driving ships to overseeing operations. In 2010, the Navy reduced and altered initial SWO ship-driving training, but lacked performance measures to evaluate the impact of these changes. After the 2017 collisions, the Navy enhanced ship-driving training for SWOs, including tripling the number of training hours and investing in simulator-based training facilities. The new training courses and facilities will cost over $467 million and are expected to be completed by 2023. The Navy has also implemented skill checks at various career points to ensure SWOs have necessary ship-driving skills. However, the Navy has not developed key processes to assess the overall effectiveness of its training programs.", "The FSM (Federated States of Micronesia) and RMI (Republic of the Marshall Islands) are two independent countries located southwest of Hawaii. The FSM is made up of four states - Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap - with varying population and income levels. The RMI's population is concentrated in the capital, Majuro, and the island of Ebeye. The United States has a history of relations with the FSM and RMI, dating back to World War II. After a period of negotiations, the United States entered into a compact of free association with both countries in 1986, providing economic assistance, defense rights, and migration opportunities. Amended compacts were approved in 2003, with financial assistance provided until 2023. The compact sector grants, which support the countries in education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector development, and public sector capacity building, are a major source of funding for both the FSM and RMI. The trust fund agreements established by the compacts are managed by committees with U.S. majority voting rights. Contributions from other donors, such as Taiwan, are permitted. The programs and services agreements with the United States, which provide services such as postal services, weather services, civil aviation, disaster preparedness, response, and telecommunications, will end in 2024. Other U.S. grants, programs, and services are also available to the FSM and RMI, but their eligibility will vary. The compact trust funds, consisting of three interrelated accounts - A, B, and C - provide funding for future needs. The A account contains the initial and additional contributions, while the B account holds income earned in a given year for possible disbursement in the following year. The C account acts as a buffer to protect disbursements from the B account in years with low or negative returns. After 2023, the maximum disbursement from each trust fund will be based on the 2023 grant assistance amount, adjusted for inflation. If there are no funds in the C account and no prior-year investment income in the B account, no disbursements will be available. The FSM and RMI will bear additional costs after 2023, as they assume responsibility for providing services currently provided by the United States. The compact trust funds are projected to have decreased maximum disbursements or no disbursements at all in some years. Strategies to mitigate this risk would require the countries to exchange near-term reduction in resources for more sustainable disbursements in the long term. Overall, the FSM and RMI heavily rely on U.S. assistance for their government expenditures, and the expiration of the compacts' programs and services agreements in 2024 will further impact their budgets.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a policy in place to provide eligible personnel and their families with affordable and quality housing facilities. To achieve this, the DOD has utilized private-sector financing and management through the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI). The military departments, such as the Army, Navy, and Air Force, have implemented various housing projects through partnerships with developers and investments from the military departments. Each housing project operates as a separate entity governed by business agreements. These agreements outline the allocation of funds, including revenue from rent payments, for operating expenses, taxes and insurance, debt payments, maintenance, management fees, renovations, and payments to the developer. Some projects also include performance incentive fees for private partners based on established metrics.\n\nThe Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management oversees the MHPI program and provides guidance and reports to Congress. However, the military departments are responsible for executing and managing the privatized housing projects, including financial management and oversight. In the past, there have been recommendations for enhanced government protections and improvements in oversight. DOD has implemented changes in response to these recommendations, but oversight efforts remain limited.\n\nOversight activities include daily monitoring of management and operations by military housing offices and periodic reviews of compliance with business agreements. However, these oversight efforts have been limited in scope. Daily oversight activities include reviewing work orders, following up with residents, and inspecting homes during the change-of-occupancy process, but the implementation and scope of these activities vary. Periodic reviews involve assessing project amenities and exterior housing conditions, but they may only focus on a few homes and lack a thorough assessment of the housing units' physical condition. The oversight guidance provided by the military departments has been unclear and insufficient, leading to inconsistent action and performance across housing projects.\n\nThe military departments are taking steps to improve oversight, including revising guidance, standardizing oversight activities, increasing staffing and training, and ensuring access to work order data. However, further improvements are needed to ensure consistent and comprehensive oversight of the physical condition of privatized housing.", "The US Department of Defense (DOD) relies on contracts to obtain supplies and services, such as ships and planes, as part of its mission. The federal acquisition process includes three phases: pre-award, award, and contract performance. During these phases, contracting officials follow certain activities and regulations to ensure successful procurement. Before awarding a contract over a certain threshold, contracting officials must review a contractor's past performance and safety records. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces safety and health standards for the private sector, including federal contractors. OSHA conducts inspections, both planned and unplanned, to ensure compliance with these standards. If violations are found, OSHA can issue citations and penalties. However, data limitations make it difficult to determine the extent of safety violations among DOD contractors.", "In 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) developed plans to establish 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams focused on offensive operations, defensive operations, and DOD network protection. These teams were provided with budget resources beginning in 2014 and were set goals for reaching initial operational capability and full operational capability. However, some of the methods used to facilitate these teams' achievement of full operational capability subsequently affected readiness. Each CMF team is required to certify to its mission at least every 2 years, but in order to achieve the best readiness rating, they must certify every 12 months. The first wave of CMF teams included nearly 6,200 military, civilian, and contractor support personnel and was scheduled to achieve full operational capability by September 30, 2024. The second wave of teams, consisting of 21 Army Reserve component teams, is set to include more than 800 personnel. DOD has assigned components and senior officials with CMF training roles and responsibilities. CYBERCOM has established consistent training standards, developed standard operating procedures for readiness reporting, and maintained a series of phase two foundational training courses. However, many of the teams that have been built are not yet fully trained and have low readiness levels. DOD has used existing training capabilities, including courses, instructors, and facilities, throughout all phases of CMF training. While DOD has taken steps to shift its focus from building a trained CMF to maintaining this force, it has not taken key actions to ensure that the department is poised to maintain CMF training following this transition. The military services have not developed plans for validating all phase two foundational training courses or comprehensively assessing their training requirements. Additionally, as of June 2018, CYBERCOM had not provided a plan for establishing independent assessors to evaluate and certify the completion of phase three collective training for CMF teams.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relies heavily on IT systems to provide healthcare, benefits, and support to veterans. Protecting sensitive data and information is crucial to ensure the security and availability of these services. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires agencies to develop and implement information security programs. In fiscal year 2018, VA reported 1,776 information security incidents, with various threat vectors. The VA's information security program and controls were rated at Level 2 for the Detect function and Level 4 for the Respond function. However, deficiencies were identified in security management controls, access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties controls, and contingency planning controls. These deficiencies led to information security being designated as a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. VA has also faced challenges in implementing security controls, mitigating known security deficiencies, establishing a cybersecurity risk management program, and identifying critical cybersecurity staffing needs. The agency has not fully implemented recommended actions and has not adequately mitigated security control deficiencies. Additionally, VA has not established a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program and has inaccurately identified the work roles of its cybersecurity staff. It is crucial for VA to address these challenges and manage IT supply chain risks to secure its information systems effectively.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies in place to protect installations, property, and personnel. The authority of a DOD commander includes the ability to remove or deny access to individuals who threaten the orderly administration of an installation. Individuals seeking unescorted access to DOD installations must establish their identity, be determined fit for access, and establish a purpose for their presence on the installation. The DOD uses the Identity Matching Engine for Security and Analysis (IMESA) to verify the information of individuals seeking access and continuously vet them for fitness-for-access determinations. DOD components have implemented several types of physical access control systems (PACS), including DBIDS, AIE, and RAPIDGate, to control access to their installations. DBIDS and AIE are both capable of electronically connecting to IMESA, while RAPIDGate does not have this capability. IMESA is constantly being enhanced to provide more comprehensive vetting and expand the types of credentials that can be scanned. However, DOD component installation commanders do not currently have a system in place to monitor the use of PACS at their installations, which limits their ability to evaluate the effectiveness of PACS and make informed access control decisions.", "The F-35 Lightning II program is a multinational effort to develop and field next-generation strike fighter aircraft for the US Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as international partners and foreign military sales customers. The program has produced three variants of the F-35 aircraft, each with unique operating requirements. The program participants plan to acquire over 3,300 F-35 aircraft, with the US services purchasing the majority. The program is supported by the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which is designed to manage tasks such as aircraft health and diagnostics, supply-chain management, and maintenance events. ALIS has faced developmental issues and schedule delays, but users have reported some improvements in recent years. However, significant challenges still exist, including data integrity issues and the need for manual tracking of critical aircraft information outside of ALIS. Continued attention and improvement are needed to address these challenges and ensure the success of the F-35 program.", "Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Post-Katrina Act required FEMA to develop a national preparedness system. In September 2011, DHS issued the National Preparedness Goal, which defined the \"whole community\" as individuals and communities, the private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based organizations, and all levels of government. The goal also identified 32 core capabilities across five mission areas: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. FEMA uses these capabilities to assess overall national preparedness and identify gaps. FEMA's National Preparedness Directorate is responsible for assisting communities in developing these capabilities. Jurisdictions are required to conduct the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) and Stakeholders Preparedness Review (SPR) to assess their preparedness. FEMA issued new guidance in 2018 for the THIRA and SPR, moving to a more quantitative data-based methodology. FEMA's 10 regions provide technical assistance and training to jurisdictions, and FEMA also sponsors exercises to assess capabilities. In 2019, FEMA initiated an effort to assess the federal government's emergency management capacity. FEMA provides preparedness grants to jurisdictions to strengthen their capabilities, with the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Emergency Management Performance Grant being the primary grants. National Preparedness Reports have shown that prevention and response capabilities rate the highest, while recovery and protection capabilities rate lower. FEMA encourages jurisdictions to invest future grants in lower-rated capabilities and emerging threats like cybersecurity. However, FEMA officials believe that existing grants will not be enough to address the identified capability gaps. Real-life disasters have sometimes highlighted lower levels of preparedness than indicated by the capability assessments. From 2013 to 2018, jurisdictions received $8.3 billion in preparedness grants, with the majority directed at crosscutting, prevention, and response capabilities. Only a small portion of funds were directed at mitigation, protection, and recovery capabilities, with the lowest amount going to the recovery mission area.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued several PILT (Payment-in-Lieu of Taxes) orders and policies over time to guide the implementation of the PILT provision of the Atomic Energy Act. These changes have modified eligibility requirements and payment calculations. The first PILT order was issued in 1958, allowing exceptions to payment calculations. In 1987, a new order introduced more stringent requirements and reduced payments based on tax benefits received. In 1993, the policy was revised to eliminate the gross benefits test and reduce payments based on tax benefits. In 2003, a new order updated responsibilities and eliminated details from the 1993 policy. To be eligible for PILT payments, communities must submit an initial application that is evaluated by various DOE offices. Once approved, an intergovernmental assistance agreement is created, and communities submit annual PILT invoices. DOE site offices review these invoices and determine funding availability. DOE headquarters, program offices, and site offices are involved in the PILT processes. PILT payments vary across DOE sites, with the majority going to communities at the Hanford and Savannah River sites. Some communities are ineligible for PILT, and others have not applied or do not receive payments. Property taxes in the US are levied by various authorities, and PILT payments are based on property values and tax rates. Payments to communities vary considerably and have increased from $9.5 million in 1994 to $23 million in 2017. The growth in payments is primarily due to increases at the Hanford and Savannah River sites and the addition of new PILT recipient communities.", "The State Department has seen an increase in the number of full-time, permanent, career employees over the years. Efforts have been made to increase diversity in the workforce through recruitment and retention initiatives, such as fellowship programs and participation in career fairs. The proportion of racial or ethnic minorities and women at State has also increased to some extent, although there are still disparities in representation at higher ranks. Analysis of promotion outcomes found that racial or ethnic minorities in the Civil Service were less likely to be promoted than their white counterparts, while differences in promotion odds for racial or ethnic minorities and whites in the Foreign Service were generally not statistically significant. Promotion rates for women in the Civil Service were generally lower than for men, but there were no statistically significant differences in the odds of promotion. In the Foreign Service, women had higher odds of promotion than men in early to mid career. State has identified some diversity issues in its reports, but additional steps are needed to explore potential barriers to equality.", "The Office of Entrepreneurial Development, Office of Field Operations, and Office of Strategic Alliances are important offices within the Small Business Administration (SBA) that focus on fostering entrepreneurship. The Office of Entrepreneurial Development oversees programs that provide small business counseling and technical assistance through a network of resource partners such as SBDCs, Women's Business Centers, and SCORE chapters. The SBDC program is the primary recipient of funding and offers services to small businesses and entrepreneurs to access capital, develop new technologies, and improve business planning and financial management. The Office of Field Operations consists of regional and district offices that serve as points of delivery for SBA programs and services. These offices can initiate outreach activities and work with third parties to foster entrepreneurship. The Office of Strategic Alliances reviews co-sponsorship agreements and strategic alliance memorandums to formalize relationships with nonprofit and government entities. HBCUs have played a critical role in supporting underserved communities and the SBA has collaborated with them through SBDCs, strategic alliance memorandums, and co-sponsored activities. The experiences of stakeholders collaborating with SBA varied. Some HBCUs have hosted lead SBDCs and service centers, engaging with students, alumni, and faculty. SBA has signed strategic alliance memorandums with HBCUs, although their usefulness varied among different institutions. SBA has also signed co-sponsorship agreements with HBCUs for joint activities or events. The agency has developed plans to increase the capacity of HBCUs to participate in federally funded programs and promote collaboration between HBCUs, SBA resource partners, and district offices. However, there is a lack of documentation regarding the responsibilities and reporting lines among the offices involved in addressing the White House Initiative on HBCUs within the SBA.", "Depots are government-owned, government-operated industrial installations that maintain and repair military weapons systems and equipment for the Department of Defense (DOD). There are 21 depots operated by the military services, including Naval Shipyards, Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, Marine Corps Production Plants, Air Force Air Logistics Complexes, and Army Depots and Arsenals. These depots are essential for maintaining readiness and sustaining weapon systems and equipment. However, delays in depot maintenance have negatively impacted the services' ability to train and operate using these systems. Additionally, depot maintenance delays have led to significant costs for the Navy and have affected unit training in the Army. Factors that affect depot performance include the size and skill of the workforce, the condition of weapon systems upon arrival, the availability of spare parts, and the condition of facilities and equipment. Despite the importance of maintaining functioning facilities and equipment, depot facilities are generally rated as \"poor\" and the age of equipment at depots exceeds its expected useful life. The performance of service depots has also generally declined over the past decade in terms of completing maintenance on time. These issues are a result of inadequate facilities, aging equipment, and funding constraints.", "According to HRSA, there is a projected shortage of 23,640 primary care physicians in the United States by 2025. To address this shortage, experts have suggested increasing the number of non-physician providers, such as nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs), who can provide a greater proportion of healthcare services. In 2018, there were over 189,100 NPs and 118,800 PAs practicing in the US. NPs and PAs receive their education and training through graduate programs, with NPs typically obtaining a master's or doctoral degree in nursing and PAs earning a master's degree in physician assistant studies. Both professions are required to complete clinical work as part of their training. Currently, the majority of federal funding for physician training is distributed through CMS's Medicare GME program, while funding for NP and PA training is primarily provided through HRSA grants. Expanding the Medicare GME program to include NP and PA training could provide more stability and funding for these professions, as well as potentially incentivize preceptors who supervise students. However, there are challenges and differences in training requirements that would need to be considered. Concerns have also been raised about the potential impact on funding for physician training if resources are redistributed to include NPs and PAs. Estimates of the cost of NP and PA training range from about $47,000 to $45,300 per student, but these estimates may not capture the full costs. Overall, there is a need to address physician shortages and explore options for increasing the training and utilization of NPs and PAs in the healthcare workforce.", "The sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries is regulated by various statutes, laws, regulations, and policies. The primary laws governing these sales are the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA). The FAA establishes guidelines for the transfer of defense articles and services from the United States to foreign entities, while the AECA governs the sales of defense articles and services. The two main programs for sales and exports of defense articles are Foreign Military Sales (FMS), where the U.S. government acts as a broker for sales to certain countries and organizations, and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), where the U.S. government does not act as a broker but still requires licensing. The President designates what items are subject to DCS licensing through the U.S. Munitions List. The State Department is responsible for registering all persons involved in the manufacturing, exporting, and importing of defense articles and services. Congress is notified prior to planned FMS and DCS cases, and it has the power to hold or restrict such sales. The sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries is also subject to various international agreements, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime. In FY2018, the value of authorized U.S. arms sales to foreign governments and export licenses issued totaled about $184.3 billion.", "The United States and Liberia have had diplomatic relations for over 150 years. The relationship was strained during Liberia's civil wars but improved under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and continues to be close under President George Weah. The U.S. has provided significant assistance to Liberia for stabilization, recovery, and development, including aid to combat the Ebola outbreak. Members of Congress have also sought to adjust the immigration status of Liberian nationals in the U.S. Liberia's wars devastated the country, and there have been calls for the establishment of a war crimes court. Sirleaf's administration oversaw postwar stability and economic growth but faced challenges such as poverty and corruption scandals. Weah, a former soccer star, won the presidency in 2017 but has faced criticism for corruption scandals and mismanagement of donor assistance. Inflation and a weakened Liberian dollar have also affected the economy.", "Border security discussions often revolve around the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, particularly along the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican transnational criminal organizations dominate the illicit drug market in the U.S., producing and transporting drugs into the country. Data and intelligence suggest that more foreign-produced drugs flow through official ports of entry (POEs) than between them. Marijuana has historically been believed to flow between POEs, but recent data shows that more marijuana was actually seized at POEs in FY2019. The smuggling of illicit drugs between POEs involves various methods such as underground tunnels, ultralight aircraft, maritime vessels, and backpackers. Physical barriers along the border have been implemented to deter smuggling, but smugglers often find ways to defeat them. The construction of border barriers may lead smugglers to change their methods and routes or move their contraband through POEs. Policymakers question the effectiveness of border barriers in deterring drug smuggling and whether they contribute to gathering intelligence. However, accurately assessing the impact of border barriers on drug smuggling is challenging due to unknown quantities of drugs being smuggled and various external factors that influence smuggling. Policymakers also consider the potential displacement of drug smuggling to other areas without border barriers and how border security efforts should be evaluated and compared to other enhancements.", "Leveraged lending, a type of credit that has been growing rapidly, is raising concerns among policymakers due to similarities with mortgage lending and mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. This report explains how leveraged lending works, the participants in the market, and the characteristics of leveraged loans. It also discusses collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and their investors, as more than 60% of investment in leveraged lending occurs through CLOs. The report delves into the regulation and potential risks of leveraged lending and CLOs, as well as the actions taken by policymakers. Leveraged loans are given to highly indebted companies with high interest rates, often used for buyouts or refinancing. Different institutions provide funds for leveraged lending, including banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds. These loans are typically divided among multiple lenders through syndication or participation. There has been a shift from banks to nonbank institutions in leveraged lending. Leveraged loan agreements include covenants to set conditions for borrowers to avoid default. Covenant-lite loans, with fewer or less strict covenants, have been increasing, raising concerns about declining credit standards. Leveraged lending has grown rapidly, accounting for $1.15 trillion of outstanding loans at the end of 2018. Investors can hold leveraged loans directly or invest in CLOs, which are securities backed by portfolios of loans. CLOs redistribute credit risk through different tranches with varying payment priorities. The growth of leveraged lending has raised concerns about the availability of credit and the impact on nonfinancial firms during a downturn. Leveraged loans and CLOs pose various risks to investors, including credit risk. The report concludes by discussing potential risks to financial stability and the overall economy.", "The term \"contaminants of emerging concern\" (CECs) refers to unregulated substances detected in the environment that may pose a risk to human health, aquatic life, or the environment. CECs can include various manmade chemicals, as well as naturally occurring substances. They often enter the environment via wastewater discharges and storm runoff. Currently, there is no federal statutory or regulatory definition of CECs. The availability of data on CECs may be limited, and different statutes provide authorities to address specific CECs. In recent years, there has been increased attention on CECs such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and microplastics. The EPA and states have authorities under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to address CECs through technology-based effluent limitations and water quality standards. However, there are challenges in effectively addressing CECs, including the need for extensive information gathering and the lack of specific regulations for certain pollutants.", "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports nature-based infrastructure as part of its mandates to support and conserve natural resources. Nature-based infrastructure includes natural features and engineered systems that combine natural and structural approaches. NOAA uses the terms nature-based infrastructure, natural infrastructure, and green infrastructure interchangeably. Nature-based infrastructure projects can provide multiple benefits, such as flood and erosion management, improved water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities. NOAA's activities supporting nature-based infrastructure fall under its line offices, including the National Marine Fisheries Service, National Ocean Service, and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. NOAA also coordinates with other federal agencies and provides funding to nonfederal organizations for nature-based infrastructure activities. Currently, Congress has not defined nature-based infrastructure in statute for NOAA. However, some members of Congress have proposed legislation to expand NOAA's authority for nature-based infrastructure. NOAA's nature-based infrastructure activities are primarily funded through the annual appropriations process, but specific expenditures for nature-based infrastructure are not tracked. Congress may consider requiring NOAA to track and report its spending on nature-based infrastructure activities, as well as other federal agencies.", "Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which changes the obligations of broker-dealers in their relationships with retail customers. The regulation requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of the customer without placing their own interests ahead. The Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill initially included an amendment to prevent the SEC from implementing Reg BI, but that language was not included in the final appropriations act. This report provides background information on the roles and regulation of broker-dealers and investment advisers, as well as the Obama Administration's 2016 fiduciary rule for broker-dealers. It also examines the obligations required by Reg BI, state-based fiduciary regulations for broker-dealers, congressional concerns, and perspectives on Reg BI. The report concludes by examining research on the potential costs and benefits of Reg BI.", "The process of resolving legislative differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate is complex and critical. The two houses must agree on the text and identity of a bill before it can become law. They may choose to act on each other's bills or have their own bills on the same subject. The chambers can resolve differences by sending the bill back and forth, proposing amendments to each other's amendments. They can also form a conference committee or rely on amendments between the houses to reach an agreement. The processes and variations involved make this stage of the legislative process difficult to predict. Ultimately, either house can refuse to act at any stage, leading to the death of the bill.", "This report provides an overview of the judiciary's FY2020 budget request and the process of Congress's consideration of the request. It includes information about the specific appropriations requested, the actions taken by the House and Senate committees, and the final enactment of the judiciary's budget in the FY2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The report also discusses the issue of video access to Supreme Court proceedings and other ongoing policy issues affecting the judiciary. Overall, Congress enacted $7.49 billion, or 98.2%, of the judiciary's FY2020 budget request of $7.62 billion.", "Multiple bills and resolutions have been introduced in Congress regarding China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report provides a timeline of key developments in the early weeks of the pandemic, including China's initial response, the involvement of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United States' actions. The report also examines issues related to China's communication with the WHO and the sharing of information. It highlights the naming of the virus and the disease, as well as the political and geographic context of the outbreak in Wuhan. Overall, the report raises questions about China's interactions with the WHO and their compliance with international health regulations.", "The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has decreased significantly over the past five decades, but certain groups such as widows, divorced women, and never-married men and women still face vulnerability to poverty. Government programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income have contributed to increased incomes for older Americans. The official poverty measure has limitations and does not fully capture the needs and resources of families. The poverty rate among individuals aged 80 and older is higher than younger older Americans. Women aged 80 and older have a higher poverty rate than men in the same age group. Married older Americans generally have a lower poverty rate than nonmarried individuals. Poverty rates also vary among different racial and ethnic groups, with the lowest rates among non-Hispanic white individuals and the highest rates among black individuals. Social Security is a major source of income for the aged poor, while SSI provides cash benefits to those with limited income and assets.", "This report examines past instances of federal government assistance to troubled industries in order to inform congressional debate on calls for assistance due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report discusses the different forms of assistance that have been provided in the past, such as loan guarantees, asset purchases, capital injections, direct loans, and regulatory changes. It also provides data on the costs and income to the government associated with these assistance programs. The report highlights that the final outcome of these programs can take years to determine, and there are broader policy concerns that are difficult to quantify. The examples discussed in the report focus on cases where federal assistance was widely available to firms within an industry, extraordinary in nature, and motivated by a desire to prevent industry-wide failures. Specific examples include the assistance provided to the railroad industry in the 1970s, where federal financial assistance, deregulation, and the creation of new companies were used to avert industry collapse. The report also acknowledges that the cost estimates presented may involve uncertainty due to variations in reporting over the years. Overall, the report aims to provide information to help Congress make decisions regarding federal assistance to industries affected by the pandemic.", "Relations between Iran and the United States have been confrontational since 1979, with the US viewing Iran's policies as a threat to its interests. The tensions escalated in 2018 when the US withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran. Since May 2019, the situation has worsened, with Iran attacking commercial ships, posing threats to US forces, and reducing compliance with the nuclear agreement. The recent developments include the killing of IRGC-QF Commander Qasem Soleimani by the US military and Iran launching ballistic missiles at US bases in Iraq. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani's killing, and further retaliatory measures could include attacks on US forces, strikes on oil facilities or tankers, cyber attacks, or breaches of the nuclear agreement. The US has responded with new sanctions on Iran's construction, mining, manufacturing, and textile sectors. The confrontation has increased the likelihood of Iran taking further steps to breach the nuclear agreement and undermine international efforts to preserve it.", "This report outlines health care-related provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2020. The provisions discussed pertain to Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs and activities. The report also includes provisions enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) or extended under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The report provides a legislative history and summary of each provision. Additionally, the report lists demonstration projects and pilot programs related to health care that are set to expire or have expired. The report is organized by expiration date and applicable health care-related program.", "The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a government-owned financial institution that supports U.S. agriculture by financing various programs. It operates under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Originally established in 1933 to provide commodity support, CCC's mandate has expanded over time to include programs related to export, conservation, disaster assistance, research, and bioenergy development. CCC has a broad range of powers and significant borrowing authority to meet its objectives. It operates through statutory authorities and is administered by various USDA agencies. CCC's funding comes from its own funds, appropriations from Congress, and borrowings. Most of its programs are classified as mandatory spending and do not require annual appropriations. CCC's borrowing authority is currently set at $30 billion. CCC also has net realized losses, which are expenditures that will never be recovered. CCC's activities have expanded to include conservation, specialty crop support, and bioenergy development. There is ongoing debate about further expanding CCC's activities, with some concerns about exceeding its original purpose. The use of CCC's authority has faced restrictions in the past, but in FY2018, USDA was allowed to use its full authority, including surplus removal and price support activities, due to changes in the appropriation bill. CCC has significant administrative discretion to carry out operations that support U.S. agriculture, but this discretion has traditionally been targeted to specific needs or events. In 2018, USDA used administrative discretion to provide up to $12 billion in assistance to farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs.", "The Trump Administration has proposed a budget for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts, totaling $44.12 billion. This is about 3% higher than the FY2020 budget request but nearly 23% below the FY2020 funding level enacted by Congress. The request would be the lowest in over a decade. The budget proposes cuts in funding for the State Department and Related Agency appropriations accounts, while prioritizing the Indo-Pacific Strategy, countering Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence, and protecting U.S. government personnel and facilities. The budget request also includes a realignment of personnel and funding to establish a new Bureau for Cyber Security and Emerging Technologies. Funding for diplomatic programs, diplomatic security, and contributions to international organizations remains the majority of the requested funds. The budget also proposes cuts in funding for international organizations, while maintaining near-recent-year levels of funding for others. The request includes a reduction in funding for foreign operations accounts, which compose the majority of U.S. foreign assistance, and proposes cuts in nearly all assistance types.", "Fully autonomous vehicles have the potential to bring significant social and economic changes and improve transportation safety. The majority of motor vehicle crashes are caused by human errors, and autonomous vehicles could help reduce these accidents. However, legislation regarding autonomous vehicles has faced controversy in Congress, with concerns raised about preemption of state laws and the exemption of vehicles from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles have also highlighted challenges in creating fully autonomous vehicles that can safely operate on public roads. Despite these challenges, the development and testing of autonomous vehicles continue in many states and cities. While fully autonomous vehicles may still be some way off, a range of new technologies is already improving vehicle performance and safety. These technologies automate various functions, such as lighting and braking, and connect vehicles to GPS and smartphones. Nonetheless, issues such as security and data protection remain important considerations in the development of autonomous vehicles, as large amounts of data will be generated and potential security vulnerabilities need to be addressed. The advancement of autonomous vehicles is influenced by factors such as innovation, vehicle infrastructure, workforce training, government laws and regulations, and consumer acceptance. Several countries, including the Netherlands and Singapore, are leading in autonomous vehicle development and deployment. In the United States, autonomous vehicles are subject to regulation by both the federal government and individual states. The Department of Transportation has issued guidelines outlining best practices for autonomous vehicle design, testing, and deployment, as well as a model state policy to provide guidance to states. The federal regulatory role in overseeing autonomous vehicle deployment has become more limited under the Trump Administration, with a focus on integrating automation across all transportation modes.", "The Baltic states, consisting of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, are considered valued U.S. allies and among the most pro-U.S. countries in Europe. The United States has strong historical ties with the Baltic states, supporting their independence and advocating for their accession to NATO and the EU. The U.S.-Baltic partnership involves diplomatic cooperation, security and defense cooperation, and economic cooperation. The United States provides security assistance to the Baltic states to strengthen their military capabilities. In recent years, U.S. focus on the Baltic region has increased due to concerns about potential threats from Russia. Congress supports close relations and security cooperation with the Baltic states. Each of the Baltic states has its own unique domestic political dynamics, but they all have broadly pro-market, pro-U.S./NATO, and pro-EU orientations. Estonia has a coalition government led by the center-left Center Party. Latvia has a coalition government led by the center-right New Unity Party. Lithuania has a coalition government led by the center-right Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union. The Baltic economies have rebounded since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis and have achieved economic growth. They have fulfilled the goal of adopting the euro as their currency. Foreign direct investment in the region remains below pre-crisis levels, and there have been concerns about money-laundering challenges in the Baltic banking sector.", "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to create a new Part E called \"Flexibility for Equitable Per-Pupil Spending.\" This allows the Secretary of Education to give local educational agencies (LEAs) the ability to combine federal, state, and local funds to create a weighted per-pupil funding system for low-income and disadvantaged students. The funding system assigns weights to different student characteristics, such as being from a low-income family or having a disability, and allocates funds based on these weighted counts. The Secretary can waive certain ESEA requirements for LEAs participating in this program. As of now, only Puerto Rico has been approved to implement a weighted student funding system under this authority. The report also provides an overview of how public elementary and secondary education is financed and discusses the use of weighted student funding at the state and LEA levels. It concludes with a detailed analysis of the Title I-E authority and its implementation.", "The federal individual income tax is designed to ensure that low-income individuals owe little or no income tax. Tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the additional child tax credit (ACTC), increase the disposable income of many low-income taxpayers and have been shown to reduce poverty. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provided larger benefits to higher-income individuals and families. Recent tax legislation, including the Economic Mobility Act of 2019 (H.R. 3300), aims to target additional tax benefits to lower-income families. This report examines the impact of the federal income tax on poverty, both before and after the TCJA, and provides insights into how tax policies can affect poverty levels.", "The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. These cases were later linked to a new strain of coronavirus called COVID-19. The CDC in the United States developed a diagnostic test for COVID-19, but manufacturing and quality issues led to delays and limited testing capacity. As a result, the FDA issued new guidance on February 29, 2020, allowing certain laboratories to use their own COVID-19 tests before receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This new policy aimed to expand testing capacity and was necessary due to the increasing community spread of COVID-19. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 can be commercially developed as kits or developed and used by a single laboratory. The regulation of these tests is carried out by multiple federal agencies including the FDA and CMS. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of the tests, while CMS regulates the quality of the laboratories performing the tests. LDTs, or laboratory-developed tests, are often used for rapidly changing conditions or diseases. The FDA has traditionally exercised enforcement discretion for LDTs, meaning they have not enforced regulatory requirements. However, in recent years, the FDA has started asserting authority over higher-risk LDTs. CLIA, on the other hand, regulates clinical laboratories, including those that perform diagnostic testing using IVD devices. CLIA certification is based on the complexity of testing, and all LDTs, including COVID-19 diagnostics, are considered high complexity tests. In emergency situations, the HHS Secretary can authorize the use of unapproved medical products, including diagnostic tests, through an EUA. Both commercial test kits and LDTs require an EUA for use during emergencies. The CDC developed a diagnostic test for COVID-19 that uses a technique called PCR to amplify the viral genetic material for detection. The test experienced manufacturing and quality issues, resulting in delays and limited testing capacity. The FDA's new guidance aimed to address these challenges and expand testing capacity.", "The U.S. population is counted every 10 years through the national census, and districts for the U.S. House of Representatives are readjusted based on population levels and distribution. The U.S. Constitution requires proportional representation in the House. The process of dividing House seats among states is called apportionment, and it is based on the population size of each state. The 2010 census showed an overall increase in the U.S. population, resulting in changes in the number of House seats allocated to each state. Redistricting, or drawing new district boundaries, is done by states after apportionment to ensure that each district has approximately equal population size under the \"one person, one vote\" principle. The process of apportionment and redistricting is subject to federal law and court decisions, and states may face legal challenges to their redistricting plans. The Census Bureau provides population data to assist states in drawing districts, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 also affects how congressional districts are drawn.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides various benefits and services to eligible veterans, including health care, disability compensation, education assistance, and more. The VA is responsible for three administrations and the Board of Veterans' Appeals, which oversee different aspects of veterans' care and support. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for health care services, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) handles disability compensation and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains veterans cemeteries and provides burial benefits. The VHA also has a role in responding to national emergencies and public health emergencies. The report provides an overview of the VA's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including information on VHA's response activities, emergency preparedness efforts, and congressional activity related to veterans programs and services. The report highlights the VA's efforts to provide medical care to veterans with COVID-19, increase health system capacity, and protect employees. It also discusses the VA's screening procedures, community care guidance, and other mitigation efforts. The report notes that the COVID-19 situation is rapidly evolving, and information is subject to change.", "This report provides a brief history of the major legislative changes to the charitable deduction for individuals, from its enactment in 1917 through the recent changes enacted at the end of 2017. It discusses how the deduction has evolved over time and the policy objectives it has served. The report highlights key legislative changes that increased the maximum amount that taxpayers could deduct for their charitable donations, such as changes to the limitation based on adjusted gross income. It also mentions the creation of a standard deduction and the concerns about its impact on charitable giving. The report concludes by noting that the charitable deduction continues to be a topic of discussion among policymakers, particularly regarding its effectiveness in increasing charitable giving and potential reform proposals.", "The current trajectory of democracy around the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, is of interest for Congress. U.S. policy has long favored the spread of democracy, and this report provides a regional snapshot of the political climate in the region based on data from the U.S. Department of State and four nongovernmental organization (NGO) indices: Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI), The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) Democracy Index, Freedom House Freedom in the World, and Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-DEM) Democracy Report. \n\nAccording to the BTI, the quality of democracy in Latin America has declined since 2008. The EIU's Democracy Index classifies Uruguay and Costa Rica as full democracies, while Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba are identified as authoritarian regimes. Freedom House reports that Nicaragua experienced the greatest decline in political rights and civil liberties in 2018, with Venezuela, Brazil, El Salvador, and Guatemala also showing significant declines. V-DEM's Democracy Report states that Latin America's democracy score in 2018 is comparable to levels in 1996.\n\nThe tables and figures in the report provide a breakdown of rankings and classifications by country according to each index. Finally, the report provides additional resources for further information on democracy indicators in the region.", "Net metering is a policy that encourages the use of distributed generation (DG), such as solar panels, by compensating electricity customers for the excess energy they produce and deliver to the grid. As of 2019, 45 states in the United States have net metering policies in place. Net metering policies vary by state, but commonly compensate customers at the retail rate for their excess energy. However, some states are considering changes to these policies, including adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills or changing the compensation rate. These changes are aimed at addressing potential cross-subsidies and ensuring fairness in cost-sharing among electricity customers. The impact of net metering on electricity rates and potential cross-subsidies has been a subject of debate, with studies providing varying estimates. Overall, net metering has been successful in promoting the growth of distributed solar energy sources, with solar photovoltaic (PV) accounting for the majority of net metering capacity. The future of net metering policies may depend on congressional priorities and the interaction of federal and state policies.", "The U.S. government has multiple international food assistance programs that provide emergency and nonemergency assistance to combat hunger and improve food security in other countries. These programs originated in 1954 with the Food for Peace Act and are primarily funded through two annual appropriations bills: the Agriculture appropriations bill and the SFOPS appropriations bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds in-kind aid programs, where U.S. commodities are shipped to countries in need, while the SFOPS appropriations bill funds market-based assistance programs, such as cash transfers, vouchers, or local procurement. In FY2020, approximately $4.091 billion was provided for international food assistance programs, with $1.945 billion allocated through the Agriculture appropriations bill and $2.146 billion through the SFOPS appropriations bill. The programs funded include Food for Peace Title II, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, the Emergency Food Security Program, and the Community Development Fund. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request proposed eliminating some of these programs and creating new consolidated accounts, but Congress did not adopt these proposals.", "The current September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) provides cash benefits to individuals affected by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The VCF is scheduled to sunset on December 18, 2020 and may be unable to pay full benefits to eligible persons. The VCF was initially established in 2001 under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSSA) and was reopened in 2011 to provide compensation to responders and others affected by the attacks. The VCF was reauthorized in 2015, and all current claims are subject to the rules and funding caps established under the reauthorization legislation. To be eligible for VCF benefits, individuals must have suffered physical harm as a direct result of the attacks or have a World Trade Center (WTC)-related physical health condition. The VCF is administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, and decisions on eligibility and benefits are made by the VCF Special Master. Claimants dissatisfied with a decision may file an appeal and request a hearing before a VCF hearing officer. All claims for VCF benefits must be filed by December 18, 2020.", "This report examines technological innovation in payment systems, particularly in relation to retail payment methods. It discusses the different components of payment systems, including end-user services, payment systems, and settlement systems. The report also highlights the increasing use of electronic payments and the decline of cash and check payments. It discusses various new payment technologies, such as payment apps and mobile wallets, and the potential benefits and risks associated with them. The report also addresses regulatory issues, including the debate over whether current regulations adequately address cybersecurity and data privacy concerns. It explores the idea of allowing nonbank payment companies to enter the bank regulatory regime and discusses the controversy surrounding special purpose national bank charters and industrial loan company charters. The report also examines the risks and policy concerns related to payment data, privacy, and consumer protection. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring consumer protection in the development of new payment systems and suggests potential updates to existing regulations.", "The term \"edge provider\" refers to creators of websites and apps that provide content, applications, services, and devices over the internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not regulate edge provider activities but they may be examined by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for potential violations. Regulatory agencies are currently investigating whether certain edge providers have violated antitrust laws. Edge providers can operate in multiple industries through acquisitions or growth, which may affect competition among them. Vertical integration, where a company operates as both an edge provider and an internet service provider (ISP), as well as horizontal integration, where one edge provider acquires another, can impact the relationships between edge providers and ISPs and competition. Some companies that started in the telecommunications and media industries are now popular edge providers. The FCC's net neutrality rules, which aimed to treat all internet traffic equally, have been repealed, allowing ISPs to potentially discriminate among content. Paid prioritization and vertical integration could give certain edge providers a competitive advantage.", "This report gives an overview of the FY2019 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS). The LHHS bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to three federal departments: the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. The bill also provides annual appropriations for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations and provides information on major congressional actions, enacted and proposed appropriations for FY2019, and an overview of the major titles of the bill. It also includes summaries of budget enforcement activities and LHHS-related floor amendments. The LHHS bill includes both discretionary and mandatory budget authority, but the report primarily focuses on discretionary funding. The report also mentions that mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare receive funding directly and are not reflected in the LHHS appropriations. The report provides a timeline of major legislative actions for FY2019 LHHS appropriations, including a supplemental appropriations act focused on humanitarian assistance and security needs at the southern border, and a supplemental appropriations act for expenses related to natural disasters and emergencies. The report concludes by mentioning that the LHHS bill provides appropriations for various federal departments and agencies, but funding totals do not include amounts provided outside of the annual appropriations process.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the federal research and development (R&D) enterprise in the US. Many R&D organizations, including federal facilities and academic and industrial laboratories, have closed or scaled back operations due to the need for physical access to facilities and equipment. The decisions to close or curtail operations are made independently by individual agencies and institutions based on local conditions and state and local government orders. Some R&D activities have been allowed to continue if they are deemed essential or critical. The cancellation of scientific and technical conferences and meetings has also affected the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers. The pandemic has led to unplanned expenses and disruptions to the supply of materials and equipment for R&D. Some agencies and researchers have shifted their research focus to COVID-19 related topics. Federal agencies and institutions are taking steps to address the effects of the pandemic on the R&D enterprise, but the situation continues to evolve.", "Dams in the United States have various purposes including flood control, hydroelectric power, recreation, navigation, and water supply. They also come with financial costs for construction, operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation. Most dams in the U.S. are owned by private entities, state or local governments, or public utilities. However, federal government agencies own a small percentage, including some of the country's largest dams. Dams pose potential safety threats to populations living downstream and surrounding reservoirs, especially as they age and deteriorate. Recent dam safety incidents have highlighted the risks of dam failure, including flooding and the evacuation of thousands of people. Congress has expressed interest in dam safety and the federal government's role in addressing it. The primary federal agencies involved in dam safety are FEMA, USACE, and the Bureau of Reclamation. Dam safety focuses on preventing failures through inspections, maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair. Risk assessment, emergency action plans, and tools and resources provided by federal agencies support informed decision-making and preparedness. The federal government has taken various actions to address dam safety, including establishing the National Dam Safety Program. Funding for dam safety programs, rehabilitation, and repair is a key issue for Congress. This report provides an overview of dam safety in the U.S. and discusses potential issues for Congress to consider.", "Heads of state and government from NATO's 30 member states met in London, United Kingdom to discuss key deliverables and address ongoing tensions within the alliance. Some of the key outcomes of the meeting include the completion of a new Readiness Initiative, the declaration of space as a new operational domain for NATO, advances in combatting cyber and hybrid threats, increased defense spending by European allies and Canada, a renewed commitment to NATO's mission in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts, and an agreement to assess China's impact on NATO and transatlantic security. While NATO leaders highlighted achievements and the importance of strong U.S.-European relations, tensions remain over issues such as defense spending and the U.S. drawdown of forces from Syria.", "Credit unions are nonprofit financial institutions owned and operated by their members. They engage in financial intermediation, accepting deposits from savers and providing loans to borrowers. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the primary federal regulator and deposit insurer for credit unions. Credit unions originated as cooperatives to provide small-dollar loans to members lacking collateral or wealth. They have evolved to offer a range of financial services, primarily consumer and residential lending. However, their lending and investment powers are still more restrictive than those of commercial banks. Efforts have been made to expand credit unions' lending capacities, and recent regulations have revised field of membership rules to broaden access to federal credit unions. Credit unions are subject to various restrictions, including caps on member business loans. However, the NCUA has implemented a principles-based approach to underwriting commercial loans to provide credit unions with more flexibility.", "The 116th Congress is currently considering changes to U.S. mineral policy, which could impact revenue streams, industries, and states. The value-added contribution of minerals mined on federal lands is estimated to be $13.9 billion in value added, $24.2 billion in economic output, and 81,700 jobs in FY2018. The statutory framework for mining on federal lands is complex and includes laws related to mineral categories, land laws, and laws applicable to mining on federal and non-federal lands. Minerals on federal lands are categorized as locatable, leasable, or salable, each with different regulations and requirements. The federal land management agencies responsible for mining on federal lands are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS). The laws and regulations applicable to mining on federal lands vary depending on the ownership of the land and whether it is part of the public domain. Various other federal laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Water Act, may also apply to mining on federal lands. The process to mine on federal lands involves identifying the surface and subsurface management agencies, determining if the area has been previously claimed or leased, and following specific processes for each type of mineral category. Exploration can begin without a permit for locatable minerals, but a permit may be required if surface disturbance is expected. Claiming a mineral deposit involves staking a claim and recording it with the appropriate agency. If the mineral of interest is leasable, a permit or license is required for exploration. The General Mining Law allows for mining claims to be patented, but a moratorium has been in place since 1994.", "The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) requires annual financial audits of federal agencies' financial statements to ensure reliable financial information and prevent fraud and abuse. The Department of Defense (DOD) completed its first agency-wide financial audit in FY2018 and received a disclaimer of opinion. DOD components with disclaimers of opinion represent a significant portion of DOD's assets and budgetary resources. DOD is expected to receive disclaimers of opinion for FY2019 as well. The federal government as a whole is unable to receive a clean audit opinion because agencies like DOD have received disclaimers of opinion. DOD spent $413 million to conduct the FY2018 audit. Auditors identified numerous material weaknesses in DOD's internal controls, including issues with financial management systems and information technology, financial reporting, and property management. These weaknesses contributed to a higher risk of material misstatements in DOD's financial statements. Auditors issued 2,377 notices of findings and recommendations that resulted in 20 agency-wide material weaknesses and 129 DOD component-level material weaknesses. DOD is working on corrective action plans to address these weaknesses. Auditors are continuing their work for the FY2019 audit, and comprehensive data are not currently available. The annual audit process helps DOD reform its business practices and align with the National Defense Strategy. Continued congressional oversight and support can help DOD achieve a clean audit opinion and improve its financial management practices. Annual audit costs are relatively small compared to DOD's budget, and the audits can lead to increased transparency and efficiencies.", "The diversity immigrant visa program was added to U.S. immigration policy in 1990 to promote new and varied migration from around the world. It allocates visas to natives of countries that have had low levels of immigration to the U.S. over the previous five years. The program aims to diversify the immigrant population by providing opportunities for individuals from countries with low immigration rates. The program has an annual allocation of 50,000 visas, and applicants are selected through a lottery system. The program has been criticized for not prioritizing high-skilled immigrants, although data suggests that diversity visa recipients have relatively high levels of education and English proficiency. Despite its name, the program has expanded beyond its original focus on Irish and Italian immigrants and now includes individuals from a wider range of countries and regions. However, due to its small size compared to total immigrant admissions, the program has limited impact on the overall composition of the immigrant population.", "The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Act of 1999 requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, swine, and boxed beef to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The act was amended to include lamb and pork in subsequent years. Congress reauthorized LMR until September 30, 2020, in 2015. The goal of LMR is to provide accurate and objective market information to buyers and sellers. The act has been amended multiple times to address issues raised by livestock industry stakeholders. LMR requires reporting for various transactions, including negotiated purchases, formula marketing arrangements, and forward contracts. The percentage of negotiated purchases has declined over the years, while formula-based purchases have increased. LMR also requires reporting for boxed beef, boxed lamb, carcass lamb, and wholesale pork.", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act includes $3.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). The CCDBG Act is the main federal law supporting child care programs for low-income working families and is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The CARES Act funds are to be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The provisions in the CARES Act clarify allowable uses of the funds, including providing continued payments and assistance to child care providers in cases of decreased enrollment or closures related to coronavirus. The act also authorizes the use of funds for cleaning and sanitation and encourages the use of funds to pay staff salaries and wages. Essential workers in the health care, emergency response, and sanitation sectors may receive CCDBG assistance without regard to income eligibility requirements. The CARES Act waives or adjusts certain requirements related to the obligation and expenditure of the funds, offers flexibility in how funds may be spent, and prohibits the use of funds to supplant existing state, territory, and tribal funding for child care assistance. States do not need to amend their CCDBG plans prior to using the funds provided by the CARES Act. The act allows for the restoration of amounts incurred prior to enactment and gives lead agencies until FY2022 to obligate the funds. The CCDBG funds are allocated to states, territories, and tribes based on a formula that takes into account their share of children under age five, children receiving free or reduced-price lunches, and state per capita income.", "This report provides statistical information on indigenous peoples in Latin America, including populations and languages, socioeconomic data, land and natural resources, human rights, and international legal conventions. It discusses the various definitions of indigenous peoples and the challenges in collecting data on this population. The report examines the poverty rates and access to services and opportunities for indigenous peoples compared to the general population. It also discusses the significance of indigenous peoples' lands and natural resources, as well as the human rights mechanisms in place to protect indigenous peoples' rights. The report includes tables and graphs that present data from different sources, and provides additional resources for further information.", "The U.S. Coast Guard has struggled for decades with hiring and training a qualified marine safety workforce. Recent incidents, such as the sinking of the cargo ship El Faro in 2015, have raised concerns about the Coast Guard's ability to maintain adequate staff. Congress has requested briefings and reports on the Coast Guard's efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff. The Coast Guard has two main responsibilities: vessel inspection and accident investigation. The agency currently has 671 marine inspectors and 158 accident investigators. However, the Coast Guard faces staffing challenges as the number of vessels requiring inspection continues to increase. The agency is also responsible for overseeing the safety of LNG export terminals and the use of LNG as ship fuel. The training of the inspection staff has been identified as a significant concern. The Coast Guard has focused on improving the quality of its safety inspection workforce by increasing training opportunities and hiring more civilian marine inspectors. However, challenges remain with building proficiency among uniformed officers who rotate assignments frequently. The perception that marine safety is an area that hinders promotion within the Coast Guard could also hinder efforts to boost the inspection workforce. The Coast Guard's role in marine inspection has been a point of contention since it was transferred to the agency after World War II. Concerns have been raised about replacing experienced inspectors as they retire. In the past, audits have raised questions about the training and expertise of marine inspectors. The Coast Guard is working on developing a comprehensive training architecture to ensure that marine inspectors are consistently trained at all levels.", "The rules and practices of the House of Representatives regarding quorums and voting are derived from two provisions of the Constitution. The House has the authority to determine the quorum and can compel the attendance of absent members. The House conducts most of its business in the Committee of the Whole, which does not require the same quorum as the House itself. A quorum is always presumed to be present, and the Speaker or chair can only respond to a member's assertion that a quorum is not present. The House uses voice votes and division votes for most questions, but a recorded vote can be requested if supported by one-fifth of a quorum. The House's electronic voting system is used for most record votes, but a roll call can be done if the system is not working. An electronic vote can be ordered by one-fifth of the members present, even if they do not constitute a quorum. Members can object to a lack of quorum and request an electronic vote at any time.", "The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is a federal agency that works to improve the nation's health safety net and provides access to healthcare services for uninsured and vulnerable populations. HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau is responsible for promoting health and reducing severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality. SMM refers to medical conditions that adversely affect the outcome of labor and delivery, while maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. The rates of SMM and maternal mortality in the US have been increasing. To address this issue, HRSA administers several maternal health programs, including the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program, the AIM-Community Care Initiative, the State Maternal Health Innovation (MHI) program, the Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS) program, and the Supporting Maternal Health Innovation (MHI) program. These programs aim to improve maternal health outcomes, promote the adoption of best practices, and reduce preventable SMMs and maternal deaths. In 2019, HRSA received funding of $109.6 million for these programs, and the funding increased to $119.1 million in 2020. HRSA is requesting $80 million for these programs in 2021. The AIM program focuses on improving maternal safety in hospitals, while the AIM-Community Care Initiative expands the implementation of maternal safety bundles to non-hospital settings. The State MHI program aims to address maternal health disparities by supporting state-level initiatives. The RMOMS program focuses on improving access to maternity care in rural areas, and the Supporting MHI program aims to promote evidence-based practices and innovation in maternal health. These programs are funded through cooperative agreements and involve collaboration with various stakeholders.", "This report provides information and analysis on the nearly two-decade U.S. project in Afghanistan. It covers topics such as U.S. military engagement, security dynamics, regional context, reconciliation efforts, Afghan politics and governance, foreign assistance, and social and economic development. The report also includes a historical timeline and background on the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The purpose of this information is to provide background and context for lawmakers as they consider administration budget requests and examine the U.S. role in South Asia and the world. Currently, the U.S. and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, are engaged in combat against a Taliban-led insurgency. The conflict also involves other armed groups, such as Al Qaeda and ISIS. The U.S. has been involved in a diplomatic effort to end the war through direct talks with Taliban representatives. The negotiations do not involve representatives of the Afghan government, leading some to worry that a military withdrawal will take precedent over a political settlement. The Afghan government has made progress in reducing corruption and implementing its budgetary commitments, but faces criticism for failing to guarantee security. The United States has provided significant reconstruction aid to Afghanistan, but stability still remains uncertain. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan has gone through various phases, including a troop surge in 2009 and subsequent drawdowns. The U.S. and Afghanistan signed an Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement in 2012 and a Bilateral Security Agreement in 2014 to govern the U.S.'s post-2014 presence in Afghanistan. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ended in 2014 and was replaced by the Resolute Support Mission (RSM).", "This report discusses twenty criminal law cases decided by the United States Supreme Court during its 2018 term. The cases covered a range of sentencing issues, pretrial questions, and cases involving firearms and sex offenders. The Court relied on existing case law to handle the capital punishment cases on its docket. The report summarizes five of the cases: Flowers v. Mississippi, Madison v. Alabama, Moore v. Texas, Shoop v. Hill, and Bucklew v. Precythe. In Flowers v. Mississippi, the Court found that the prosecutor's peremptory challenges of African-American jurors were motivated by discriminatory intent. In Madison v. Alabama, the Court held that a death-row inmate's deteriorating mental condition did not necessarily bar his execution, but his lack of understanding of why he was being punished would. In Moore v. Texas, the Court found that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had erred in denying a death-row inmate's claim of intellectual disability. In Shoop v. Hill, the Court determined that federal courts cannot grant habeas relief based on precedent established after state proceedings concluded. In Bucklew v. Precythe, the Court held that a death-row inmate challenging the state's method of execution must show both a risk of severe pain and a feasible alternative method that significantly reduces the risk of pain.", "The United States has been involved in global vaccination campaigns since the 1960s, starting with the eradication of smallpox. The success of this campaign led to the establishment of the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization. The U.S. government has been a leading donor to global vaccination campaigns and contributes funding to organizations like GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. Vaccinations are cost-effective in preventing infectious diseases and saving lives. However, global coverage of childhood vaccines varies, with certain low- and middle-income countries having limited success in achieving universal coverage. Vaccine hesitancy has also become a challenge, leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases in some high-income countries. Several international organizations, including WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, lead efforts to decrease vaccine-preventable deaths in children. Factors affecting global immunization coverage include vaccine hesitancy, geographic location, poverty, and conflicts. Congress has supported global child vaccination programs through appropriations for various agencies involved in immunization campaigns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are the primary U.S. federal agencies involved in international vaccination provision and immunization campaigns. They work with country governments and international partners to strengthen immunization programs.", "The report summarizes the content of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its subsidiary agreements, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement. It explains that the UNFCCC is the primary international cooperation vehicle to address greenhouse gas-induced climate change and that 197 countries, including the United States, are Parties to the convention. The report also discusses the goals and provisions of the Paris Agreement, including the temperature goal, GHG mitigation framework, accountability framework, adaptation requirements, and financial obligations. It mentions the 2018 Katowice Climate Package, which provides guidelines for implementing the Paris Agreement, and notes that the United States has given notice of withdrawal from the agreement but may still participate until November 2020. The report concludes by mentioning that negotiations on unresolved issues will continue at the 2020 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland.", "U.S.-Iran relations have been strained since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. The U.S. has identified Iran's support for militant armed groups as a threat to its interests and allies. The U.S. has been focused on limiting Iran's nuclear program and its acquisition of conventional weapons. In 2018, the Trump Administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement and implemented a policy of \"maximum pressure\" on Iran's economy. Bilateral tensions have escalated since then, with key developments including the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, the end of waivers allowing countries to purchase Iranian oil, and military deployments in the Persian Gulf. Iran has responded by attacking oil tankers and conducting other hostile actions. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on Iran and increased pressure on its financial operations. The two countries have not been able to reach a new agreement or renegotiate the JCPOA.", "On December 20, 2019, Congress passed a full-year FY2020 appropriation called the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act that included Agriculture appropriations. The Act funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in even-numbered fiscal years. The discretionary total of the FY2020 Agriculture appropriations act is $23.5 billion, which is slightly higher than the FY2019 amount. The main mandatory spending items in the act are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), other food and nutrition act programs, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs. The Trump Administration had requested a $4.1 billion reduction in funding for accounts in the jurisdiction of the Agriculture appropriations bill. The House passed its version of the bill as part of a larger minibus appropriation, while the Senate passed a separate bill. The discretionary amount in the House-passed bill would have been slightly higher than the FY2019 amount, and it did not include most of the reductions proposed by the Administration. The Senate bill also had a slightly higher discretionary amount than FY2019. Both bills included mandatory spending as well.", "The Trump administration has implemented a series of reforms at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), known as Transformation at USAID. These reforms aim to improve the agency's efficiency and effectiveness and include restructuring U.S. humanitarian assistance programs, establishing a new Development Finance Institution, and changing USAID's bureau structure. The reforms do not require congressional approval, but Congress has the power to shape them through oversight activities and funding requirements. The key objective of Transformation is to support partner countries' journey toward self-reliant development. USAID has developed a matrix of indicators to measure countries' progress toward self-reliance, focusing on their commitment and capacity. The agency is also prioritizing financing self-reliance and private sector engagement as tools for ending the need for foreign assistance. These reforms build on past USAID initiatives and reflect a broader shift in development finance toward leveraging private sector investment and creating enabling environments for economic growth.", "The United States and China are currently engaged in a trade war and face increasing competition in various areas, such as technology, finance, and education. The Trump Administration has been particularly critical of China's economic practices, accusing it of unfair trade practices. China's top leaders have refrained from direct criticism of the United States but have called for a relationship based on coordination, cooperation, and stability. Tensions between the two countries have been building for years, with long-standing frictions over issues like Taiwan, trade, and human rights. The Trump Administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports and has restricted the activities of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Many analysts attribute the rising tension to both the Trump Administration's confrontational approach and China's more assertive behavior under President Xi Jinping. The two countries are trying to draw other nations into their respective camps, creating a divide between those who cooperate with China and those who do not. Despite the tensions, the United States and China still cooperate on certain issues, such as North Korea, Afghanistan, public health, and drug trafficking. Critics of the Trump Administration argue that it has given up leverage against China by withdrawing from international agreements and institutions and by alienating allies. In contrast, supporters of the Administration argue that confronting China is necessary and that engagement has failed to bring about meaningful change in China's behavior. China is the world's most populous nation, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the second-largest economy. President Xi Jinping, who holds several top leadership positions, has consolidated power and expanded the Communist Party's control over all political institutions in China.", "The Navy is seeking to develop and procure three types of large unmanned vehicles (UVs): Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs), Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs), and Extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs). These UVs are part of the Navy's effort to shift to a more distributed fleet architecture, and the Navy is requesting $579.9 million in FY2021 for their development and procurement. However, Congress must decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests. UVs can be equipped with sensors, weapons, or other payloads, and can be operated remotely, semi-autonomously, or autonomously. They are particularly suitable for long-duration missions or missions that are dull, dirty, or dangerous. The Navy has been experimenting with UVs for many years, but some observers have criticized the slow pace of transitioning UV development efforts into procurement programs. The Navy's proposed acquisition of large UVs poses oversight issues for Congress and will have significant impacts on Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the industrial bases. The Navy's shift to a more distributed architecture aims to address the increasing vulnerability of the current fleet architecture to potential adversaries, particularly China. The future fleet architecture, known as the Future Surface Combatant Force (FSCF), would include fewer large surface combatants and more small surface combatants, as well as significant numbers of UVs. The Navy plans to employ accelerated acquisition strategies to quickly field large UVs, reflecting the urgency of meeting future military challenges. The Navy's USV and UUV programs are built on the development work done by the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The Navy envisions LUSVs to be low-cost, high-endurance, reconfigurable ships based on commercial ship designs, with the ability to carry various modular payloads and operate with human operators or autonomously.", "The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes funding for Department of Defense (DOD) activities and incorporates provisions of law governing military compensation, DOD acquisition process, and DOD policy towards other countries. The Trump Administration requested $761.8 billion for FY2020, of which $750 billion is discretionary spending. The enacted NDAA authorizes a total of $729.9 billion for national defense-related activities, $12 billion less than the Administration requested. The bill focuses on great power competition, primarily with China and Russia, and includes provisions for military personnel, military pay, survivor benefits, and medical malpractice claims.", "Farm Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are important factors in determining which farmers receive federal farm program payments and how much they receive. These requirements and limits have been a topic of controversy and debate among policymakers, as they influence the size of farms that are supported. The eligibility criteria and limits have evolved over time and have expanded to more programs and included more limitations. Factors such as farm management structure, crop choices, and farm size can be affected by these requirements and limits. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is responsible for collecting and maintaining data used to determine eligibility and payment limits for USDA farm programs. The eligibility requirements differ based on the type of legal entity, such as individuals, partnerships, or corporations. Participants must meet certain criteria to be deemed \"actively engaged in farming,\" including making significant contributions to the farming operation, sharing in profits or losses, and bearing the risk of loss. Family farms receive special treatment, and spouses and other family members may also be considered eligible. Foreign persons or entities can be eligible for most farm program benefits if they meet the necessary requirements. Specific restrictions apply to some disaster assistance programs and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). There are no specific citizenship requirements for crop and livestock insurance premium subsidies or the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program. The eligibility requirements and payment limits have significant implications for U.S. agriculture, and it is important for Congress to consider these policies and related issues.", "The current law regarding the legalization of unlawfully present aliens in the United States is restrictive and limited. Unlawfully present aliens can be subject to removal from the country at any time, regardless of their criminal history or other factors. There are few opportunities for these individuals to legalize their presence and extinguish the basis for their removal. Current estimates suggest that there are between ten and twelve million unlawfully present aliens in the country, with about 80% of them having been in the US for over ten years. The issue of whether to provide relief or a pathway to lawful permanent residence for unlawfully present aliens is a topic of debate in Congress. Many proposals for comprehensive immigration reform include provisions for legalization, following a similar model to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Other proposals focus on specific segments of the unlawfully present population, such as childhood arrivals. The current law allows for limited opportunities for unlawfully present aliens to obtain legal status. For example, an alien who overstays a visa and later marries a US citizen can attempt to legalize their status through the adjustment of status process. However, most other forms of relief, such as asylum or cancellation of removal, only apply in specific circumstances. The law also imposes significant barriers to legalization, such as requiring aliens to leave the country and apply for an immigrant visa abroad, which often results in a bar on re-entry for three or ten years. Overall, the current law takes a restrictive approach to legalization and offers limited opportunities for unlawfully present aliens to obtain legal status.", "Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is currently authorized until September 30, 2020. The NFIP provides flood insurance coverage to residential properties in the United States and aims to reduce flood risk and federal expenditure on disaster assistance. The program has more than 5 million policies providing over $1.3 trillion in coverage and collects about $4.6 billion in annual revenue. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States, and recent years have seen significant losses. If the NFIP is not reauthorized or amended, the authority to provide new flood insurance contracts will expire, the borrowing authority will be reduced, and other NFIP activities will be affected. Several bills have been introduced for the reauthorization of the NFIP, including H.R. 3167 and S. 2187, which would extend the program until September 30, 2024. These bills include provisions to address issues such as outstanding debt, premium rates, affordability, and private sector involvement. The NFIP faces challenges in balancing the goals of providing affordable flood insurance and ensuring fiscal solvency. Premium rates do not fully reflect the risk of loss, and subsidies and discounts have not been fully funded. The proposed bills aim to address these issues and improve the program.", "The federal government has been funding efforts to explore carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from sources like coal-fired power plants and storing it underground to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment emphasizes the importance of reducing GHG emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. This report focuses on federal policy regarding underground carbon storage, which is achieved through geologic sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Geologic sequestration involves permanently storing CO2 underground, while EOR involves using CO2 to extract additional oil and gas from underground reservoirs. Both processes are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to protect underground sources of drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), delegated states, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) all play a role in regulating and supporting underground carbon storage. Congress has supported carbon storage through legislation that directs DOE to expand R&D and increase tax credits for carbon storage. The report provides background information on underground injection and geologic sequestration processes, analyzes the federal regulatory framework, and discusses policy issues and recent legislation related to underground carbon storage. It does not cover other aspects of CCS, such as carbon capture or transportation infrastructure. Various federal projects and partnerships have conducted large-scale carbon storage R&D and demonstration projects, including both geologic sequestration and EOR. The U.S. has sufficient storage capacity in underground formations to store all CO2 emissions from large stationary sources for centuries. Injection wells, which have been used for decades to dispose of various fluids, including oil field brines and industrial waste, are also used for underground carbon storage. The technology for CO2 injection and storage builds on experience from the oil and gas industry, particularly from EOR projects. The DOE leads federal R&D efforts in underground carbon storage and has established partnerships across the U.S. to test CO2 injection and storage methods. Congress has supported DOE's work through appropriations and legislation that directs R&D in carbon capture and sequestration. Several large-scale projects have injected CO2 into underground formations for CCS and EOR purposes, but none are operating in a commercial capacity solely for geologic sequestration. Worldwide, there are several CO2 geologic sequestration projects conducted by public-private partnerships. The federal framework for regulating underground injection of CO2 is primarily governed by the SDWA. The EPA issues regulations and guidance to support state underground injection control (UIC) programs. The UIC regulations include minimum requirements for well construction, operation, monitoring, reporting, and site closure. State UIC programs are responsible for implementing and enforcing the regulations. The report also outlines the differences between wells used for geologic sequestration and those used for EOR, as well as the regulatory requirements for transitioning from EOR wells to geologic sequestration wells.", "This report provides an overview of seven federally-chartered regional commissions and authorities: the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), the Denali Commission, the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority (NGPRA), the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC), and the Southwest Border Regional Commission (SBRC). These commissions were created by acts of Congress to address economic distress in specific regions. They receive funding through congressional appropriations and engage in economic development efforts through various program areas such as infrastructure development, workforce development, and business development. The ARC, established in 1965, covers 420 counties in 13 states and focuses on addressing economic disparities in the Appalachian region. The DRA, established in 2000, covers 252 counties and parishes in eight states and aims to improve regional economic opportunity. Both commissions operate as federal-state partnerships, with administrative costs shared equally between the federal government and member states. The ARC is the highest-funded of the commissions and has experienced significant funding growth in recent years, primarily due to the POWER Initiative, which supports coal communities affected by industry decline. The DRA operates under a similar structure and funding model as the ARC.", "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education, with the Title I-A program providing aid for disadvantaged students. The ESEA was enacted in 1965 and most recently amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. The ESSA authorized $25.9 billion for ESEA programs in FY2020. Under the ESSA, states that accept Title I-A funds must focus on educational accountability, including monitoring and improving achievement outcomes for students and closing achievement gaps. States are required to have content standards, academic achievement standards, and aligned assessments in certain subjects, as well as an accountability system that incorporates performance goals and measures. State plans must be developed in consultation with various education stakeholders and approved by the U.S. Department of Education. The state plans remain in effect for the duration of the state's participation in Title I-A and must be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary. States are also required to provide information on their standards, assessments, and accountability systems. Assessment requirements include the use of high-quality academic assessments that are aligned with state standards and provide information about student attainment and grade-level performance. States must administer assessments in mathematics and reading/language arts (RLA) in grades 3-8 and once in high school, as well as in science at least once in each of three grade spans. The assessments must allow for the participation of all students, including those with disabilities and English learners. Assessment results are used for accountability and reporting purposes, with disaggregated results for various student subgroups. English learners (ELs) participate in English language proficiency assessments and may take assessments in languages other than English under certain circumstances. Students with disabilities may participate in alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards, with a cap on the number of students assessed in this way. States may request a waiver to exceed the 1% cap.", "The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by Congress in 1972 to provide unbiased information on the effects of technological applications for legislative decision-making. The agency operated for over two decades before being defunded in 1995. Since then, there have been efforts to reestablish OTA or similar functions. The report provides an overview of OTA's mission, structure, funding, and operations, as well as a discussion of the need for reestablishment. It also includes appendices on the definition of technology assessment, trends and factors contributing to the need for assessment, legislative efforts for reestablishment, and a list of technology assessment products produced by the Government Accountability Office. The report highlights the importance of science and technology in shaping public policy and the need for independent analysis in decision-making.", "Personal property management is a complex process for federal agencies, which involves tracking, evaluating, disposing of, and replacing various items. It includes everything that an agency owns, except for certain naval vessels. The size and distribution of the federal workforce require sustained investment in the acquisition and maintenance of personal property. Effective management is necessary to prevent waste, fraud, and loss. The Office of Management and Budget provides guidance on internal controls for personal property management. The Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 establishes new inventory tracking and assessment requirements. The disposal process involves transferring excess property to other agencies, donating it to state or local entities, selling it, or destroying it. Agencies may also replace personal property that is not excess or surplus by exchanging or selling it. However, there are weaknesses in agency policies and procedures, such as inadequate surveys, lack of oversight, and inconsistent practices. Agencies often do not report excess property in a timely manner. Overall, better management of personal property is needed to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs.", "The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is a law that regulates prescription and nonprescription drugs in the United States. It aims to balance the need for access to pharmaceutical drugs for medical purposes with the risks of abuse and dependence. The CSA establishes rules for the handling of controlled substances and imposes penalties for illicit production, distribution, and possession of these substances. The Act is divided into registration requirements for entities that handle controlled substances and criminal trafficking provisions for activities involving controlled substances outside the scope of the Act. The CSA classifies controlled substances into five schedules based on their medical utility and potential for abuse. Each schedule has different levels of restrictions and penalties. The Act also regulates controlled substance analogues and listed chemicals used for producing controlled substances. Scheduling decisions can be made by Congress or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through a complex process involving scientific and medical evaluation. The CSA overlaps with other federal and state laws, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and state drug laws, which may impose additional regulations on controlled substances. Overall, the CSA seeks to protect public health while ensuring access to pharmaceutical drugs for legitimate medical purposes.", "Cigarette use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with an estimated 480,000 lives lost each year. Despite a decline in cigarette smoking, there are still 34.2 million American adults who smoke regularly, along with 1.2 million middle and high school students. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes, have become popular, especially among youth. The debate over ENDS centers around their potential as a safer alternative for adult smokers but concerns about their impact on youth and the recent outbreak of lung injuries associated with vaping have raised alarm. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating tobacco products and has certain requirements for manufacturers, including user fees, registration, premarket review, and compliance and enforcement measures. This report provides an overview of FDA's authority, requirements, and enforcement related to tobacco regulation.", "This report provides analysis of ongoing efforts by the Department of Defense (DOD) to obtain cloud computing services through the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud acquisition program. The DOD's adoption process involves acquiring a cloud services solution accessible to the entirety of the Department, as well as transitioning existing data and applications to the cloud. Cloud computing refers to the practice of remotely storing and accessing information and software programs through the internet. The DOD currently maintains more than 500 cloud infrastructures that support various requirements. The JEDI Cloud program aims to create a foundational enterprise-wide cloud suitable for the majority of DOD systems and applications, as well as task-specific \"Fit For Purpose\" clouds. The acquisition of cloud services must comply with various acquisition policies and security requirements, including the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). The cloud computing capabilities to be acquired through the JEDI Cloud program are seen as foundational technologies for DOD's investments in cyber defense, resilience, and the integration of artificial intelligence. The JEDI Cloud contract is expected to be awarded to either Amazon Web Services or Microsoft, with a potential value of up to $10 billion over a 10-year period. The contract will provide worldwide cloud computing services that are comparable to commercial cloud services. The contract evaluation process involves multiple performance-based and technical criteria.", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) administers the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to determine if an individual is eligible to possess a firearm. Federally licensed gun dealers are required to conduct a background check through NICS before transferring a firearm to a customer. There are different requirements for licensed dealers and unlicensed individuals who occasionally buy and sell firearms. Several bills have been passed by the House of Representatives to expand background check requirements and prohibitions on firearms possession related to domestic violence. The report provides an overview of federal firearms statutes, background check procedures, recent legislative action, and possible issues for Congress. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act regulate firearms commerce and possession in the United States. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) administers and enforces these statutes. Prohibited persons, such as convicted felons and fugitives, are not allowed to possess firearms. Federally licensed gun dealers are required to be licensed to engage in interstate firearms commerce, while unlicensed individuals can only engage in intrastate transactions. Private-party, intrastate firearms transactions between unlicensed individuals are not regulated by federal law, although state laws may vary.", "The United States has been a strong supporter of North Macedonia's aspirations for EU and NATO membership. The country has faced challenges to its identity and statehood from neighboring countries, particularly Greece, due to its name and ethnic tensions. However, North Macedonia has made progress in resolving these disputes and stabilizing interethnic relations. The country has implemented reforms to meet the requirements for EU and NATO membership and has received support from the US, EU, and NATO in this process. Despite political challenges and the need for further reforms, North Macedonia is on track to become NATO's 30th member and may also launch accession negotiations with the EU in the coming years.", "Congress has expressed interest in the Department of Defense's (DOD) electronic warfare (EW) portfolio and has required an independent assessment of EW plans and programs. An analysis of the DOD's budget request for fiscal years 2019 through 2021 shows that it seeks to invest approximately $9.7 billion in EW programs for fiscal year 2021. This investment is aimed at improving platform and network survivability, providing advanced jamming techniques, and defending the space domain. China and Russia have heavily invested in EW-related systems as a way to compete with U.S. military capabilities. The National Defense Strategy Commission has identified EW as a critical capability to achieve the goals of the National Defense Strategy. The DOD has prioritized EW funding in recent years, and there have been increases in funding for EW research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) programs. The Navy has requested the most funding for EW programs, followed by the Air Force and the Army. The FY2021 budget request includes funding for the newly established Space Force. Overall, the DOD has increased planned EW RDT&E funding from $4.9 billion in FY2019 to $5.5 billion in FY2021. In terms of EW procurement, the DOD requested $4.56 billion for FY2020. The Navy requested the most procurement funding, followed by the Air Force and the Army. The FY2021 procurement request is slightly higher than the funding levels projected from the FY2019 request. The Navy saw the largest decreases in procurement funding, while the Army and the Air Force saw increases.", "The text discusses the history and current state of patent-eligible subject matter in the United States. The statutory language governing patent-eligible subject matter has remained consistent over the years, allowing for the patenting of various types of inventions. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the law to categorically prohibit patents on laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. This has led to a two-step test for patentable subject matter, known as the Alice/Mayo framework. Critics argue that this framework is vague and reduces incentives to innovate, while others defend it as a necessary tool to combat unmeritorious patents. There have been recent administrative and legislative developments aimed at clarifying this area of law, including revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Guidance and proposed Section 101 reform. The text also discusses the requirements for patentability, the scope and effect of patent claims, and the legal rights granted to patent holders.", "This report reviews the process and procedures for congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the President. The executive branch is generally free to proceed with an arms sales proposal unless Congress passes legislation prohibiting or modifying the sale. The Department of State submits an informal notification to the relevant committees 20 to 40 days before formal notification is given, allowing Congress to raise concerns. If significant concerns are raised, the review period can be extended. Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar days before a sale is finalized, or 15 calendar days for certain countries. Congress can block or modify an arms sale by introducing a joint resolution of disapproval, which is given expedited consideration. If passed by both houses of Congress, the joint resolution would be sent to the President, who can veto it. Congress can also block or modify a sale through regular legislation, as long as a presidential veto is overridden. It is advantageous for Congress to act before the formal contract with the foreign government is signed to avoid damaging bilateral relations or financial liabilities. The legislative vehicle used to restrict a sale can take various forms, including a rider to an appropriation or authorization bill or a freestanding bill.", "This report discusses the extent of federal involvement in memorials located outside of Washington, DC. The report categorizes memorials based on the level of federal involvement, which can be high, medium, low, or none. Memorials with high federal involvement are typically located on federal land, receive federal funding, and are managed by federal agencies. Memorials with medium federal involvement are located on federal land but do not receive federal funding or are located on nonfederal land but receive assistance from a federal agency. Memorials with low federal involvement are recognized by Congress but are not located on federal land or receive federal funds. Memorials with no federal involvement receive no federal recognition and are located on nonfederal land. The report also provides examples of different types of memorials and outlines various ways in which federal agencies are involved in the establishment and maintenance of memorials. It concludes by suggesting potential options for a more systematized approach to the establishment and funding of national memorials outside of Washington, DC.", "The TEACH Grant program provides grants to students who are studying to become teachers. Recipients must commit to teaching for at least four years in a high-need field at a qualifying school. If they do not fulfill this commitment, the grants are converted into loans. Over 300,000 TEACH Grants have been disbursed since 2008. The program has faced challenges, such as grant-to-loan conversions when recipients fail to submit paperwork on time. Two-thirds of recipients are expected to see their grants converted to loans, raising questions about the program's effectiveness. Congress may consider changes to address these issues. The program was authorized in 2007 to address the shortage of qualified teachers in low-income schools and to attract high-achieving individuals to the teaching profession. Other service payback programs exist, such as the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships and the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program. TEACH Grant recipients must meet certain eligibility criteria and can receive up to $4,000 per year for a bachelor's or post-baccalaureate program, or up to $8,000 for a graduate program. They must also complete TEACH Grant counseling and sign an Agreement to Serve. After completing their program, recipients must teach full-time for at least four academic years within an eight-year period and meet the requirements of a highly qualified teacher.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the U.S. agricultural sector, leading to disruptions in the food supply chain and economic harm to farmers. In response, Congress has passed four supplemental appropriations acts providing funding for the agricultural sector, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has implemented the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to provide financial relief. The report outlines the actions taken by USDA, including the funding sources for CFAP and how the funds will be used. It also discusses the economic damage to U.S. farm income and individual commodity sectors due to COVID-19. The report addresses the positions of agricultural stakeholders and explores potential issues for Congress to consider in a post-COVID economy. The disruptions in the food supply chain have been caused by the shutdown of food service and institutional buying, leading to a mismatch between supply and demand. While there is no food shortage in the U.S., there have been temporary shortages of certain products due to panic buying and the re-engineering of the food supply chain. The report highlights the surplus supply situation in the U.S. and globally for major agricultural commodities, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade dispute with China. It also discusses the labor shortages and plant closures in the food processing industry, which have led to surpluses of perishable products and concerns about the reliability of the food supply. The report emphasizes the importance of the food supply chain and the potential for temporary food shortages if labor shortages become severe. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural sector and the response measures taken by USDA.", "The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology poses both challenges and opportunities for the energy sector. The energy demand for cryptocurrency mining has increased as cryptocurrencies gain popularity. Washington state hosted a significant portion of global Bitcoin mining operations in 2018, which can lead to increased electricity rates. However, not all cryptocurrencies require energy-intensive operations, and blockchain technology can facilitate energy and financial transactions on a smart grid. Congress should consider policy options for energy conservation, efficiency standards, and the use of blockchain in the energy sector. Cryptocurrency mining requires energy to operate and thermally regulate devices, and there are four main factors that contribute to energy consumption: hardware computing power, network hashrate, difficulty, and thermal regulation. Estimates of Bitcoin's energy consumption vary, but it has increased in recent years. Some argue that sustainability concerns are misplaced and that only miners with competitive hardware and low electricity costs will persist over time. Others believe that energy demands will diminish as the reward incentive shifts. Shifting to alternative protocols for validating transfers, such as Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Authority, could reduce energy consumption. Ideal mining locations depend on energy costs, regulations, and technology. China and the United States are major players in cryptocurrency mining, but regulations and policies may affect their dominance.", "Congressional oversight of the executive branch is facilitated through statutory reporting requirements that require the executive branch to provide Congress with information about the implementation of public policy. These reporting requirements serve various purposes such as ensuring compliance with legislative intent, gathering data and statistics, monitoring policy implementation, evaluating program effectiveness, studying issues, and obtaining recommendations for legislative action. There are different types of reporting requirements, including notifications of actions or decisions, descriptive reports on agency activities, plans to achieve goals, and studies or evaluations. Congress relies on these reports to conduct oversight and make informed decisions. The volume of reporting requirements has varied over time, and efforts have been made to assess and reduce their number. However, Congress continues to enact new reporting requirements and thousands of reports are submitted each year. Challenges include the burden and cost of reporting, ongoing relevance of existing requirements, and compliance by agencies. Designing reporting requirements involves choices that affect the content and frequency of the information received by Congress. A search of public laws enacted during the 115th Congress identified over 3,000 reporting requirements.", "The COVID-19 pandemic may have profound and long-lasting implications for the international security environment and the role of the U.S. in the world. Some potential areas of change include a decline in the U.S.-led liberal international order, the emergence of a new world order, changes in U.S.-China relations, challenges to democratic systems, changes in the world economy, and reductions in defense spending by U.S. allies. The pandemic could also provide a new lens for measuring the value of foreign assistance, impact the ability of Congress to conduct oversight, and lead to a revised definition of U.S. national security. Congress will need to consider how the pandemic could change the international security environment, respond appropriately, and assess the actions of the Trump Administration. The pandemic may also have implications for the role of Congress in setting and overseeing foreign policy and could lead to changes in congressional organization and operations. Further reading on these issues can be found in the provided bibliography of CRS reports and additional writings.", "This report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2020 legislative branch appropriations. It covers various actions that have taken place, including the initial submission of the request, hearings held by the House and Senate subcommittees, subcommittee and full committee markups, and the enactment of continuing resolutions and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. It also includes information on prior year actions and funding, as well as the FY2020 budget requests of individual legislative branch agencies and entities. The report provides tables listing enacted funding levels for FY2019 and the requested, reported, and enacted levels for FY2020, and includes an appendix with information on previous bills and reports. The report also discusses the percentage of total discretionary budget authority provided to the legislative branch, and provides historical funding levels for previous fiscal years.", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides over $2 trillion in relief to individuals, businesses, and various government agencies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration of the CARES Act is expected to be complex due to the scope of the relief provided and the number of recipients. Congress included several oversight mechanisms in the act to ensure accountability. These include the creation of a Congressional Oversight Commission, a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), and the Pandemic Recovery Accountability Committee (PRAC), among others. These entities are responsible for overseeing different aspects of the CARES Act. Additionally, the act allocates additional resources to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs) to support their audit and investigative activities related to the CARES Act. Congress also has the authority to conduct oversight beyond the explicit requirements of the act. The report provides detailed information on the oversight provisions and the agencies and entities involved in overseeing the implementation of the CARES Act.", "The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) are two provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for workers and their family members if the worker receives a pension based on earnings not covered by Social Security. The WEP affects retired or disabled workers, while the GPO affects spouses and survivors. Some beneficiaries may be affected by both provisions. As of December 2018, over 260,000 beneficiaries had their benefits reduced by both provisions. The WEP reduces benefits based on a new formula, while the GPO reduces spousal and survivors benefits. Dually entitled beneficiaries are subject to both reductions. There have been issues with overpayments to affected beneficiaries, and proposals have been made to improve the reporting of pension information. The WEP and GPO have a significant impact on household wealth, reducing the present value of lifetime Social Security benefits. Social Security coverage can be extended to state and local government employees through Section 218 agreements.", "This report provides an overview of nominations and appointments to 34 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions during the 115th Congress. It includes profiles of each board's leadership structure and membership, as well as tables tracking appointment activity. The report also discusses the process for appointments and the political balance requirements for some of the boards and commissions. It highlights that during the 115th Congress, President Trump submitted 112 nominations for these positions, of which 75 were confirmed, 12 were withdrawn, and 53 were returned to the President. There were also 43 vacancies at the end of the Congress. The report provides additional details on the nomination and confirmation process for each board or commission.", "Members of Congress are interested in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa and their mandates, effectiveness, and funding. The United States, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, plays a key role in establishing and funding these operations. Currently, there are seven U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa, with the United States being the largest financial contributor. These operations have evolved to include tasks such as protecting civilians, extending state authority, and monitoring human rights. The U.S. Congress authorizes and appropriates funding for U.N. peacekeeping, and there have been debates about the level of funding and its effectiveness. The Trump Administration has called for a review of U.N. peacekeeping activities and proposed a reduction in funding for FY2020. Concerns have also been raised about funding shortages and their impact on the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. Several overarching policy issues and debates exist regarding U.N. peacekeeping in Africa, including civilian protection, mass atrocities, role of host governments, counterterrorism, sexual exploitation and abuse, and the contributions of African troop-contributing countries.", "Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution grants the President the power to grant reprieves and pardons for federal offenses. This power has its roots in English law and has been broadly interpreted by the Supreme Court. The President has the authority to grant pardons, amnesty, commutations, remission of fines, and reprieves. Pardons release an offender from punishment and restore their civil rights, while amnesty is extended to whole classes or communities. Commutation reduces the severity of a punishment, and remission of fines and reprieve delay the execution of a sentence. The President's power to grant clemency is relatively unconstrained, with limits only on federal criminal offenses and impeachment convictions. There is a process through the Department of Justice for submitting pardon requests, but the President ultimately has the final authority. The legal effect of pardons and other forms of clemency is broad, but there may be limits based on other constitutional protections.", "This report serves as an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on aid administered by the State Department and USAID. The report discusses funding trends, major focus areas of assistance, legislative measures, and the Trump Administration's FY2021 aid budget request for Africa. Over the past two decades, Africa has received an increasing share of U.S. foreign assistance funding, with the majority of aid supporting health programs, economic growth, agriculture, peace and security, democracy and governance, education, and the environment. The report also acknowledges the ongoing debates and criticisms surrounding foreign aid effectiveness and provides an overview of emergency assistance programs.", "The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program offers federal student loans to assist individuals in financing their postsecondary education expenses. It is the largest source of federal financial aid for students. In FY2020, it is estimated that $100.2 billion in new loans will be made to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as parents of undergraduate students, and $46.4 billion in consolidation loans will be made to existing borrowers. As of FY2019, there is $1.2 trillion in outstanding principal and interest on Direct Loan program loans. \n\nThis report provides an overview of the terms and conditions of federal student loans made through the Direct Loan program. It includes background information on the program's history, describes the different types of loans offered, and details the terms and conditions for borrowing. The report also discusses borrower eligibility, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment procedures, loan discharge and forgiveness benefits, and the consequences of defaulting. Lastly, it summarizes the methods used to inform borrowers about loan terms and conditions. \n\nThis report is intended for Members of Congress and congressional staff as a resource for their legislative and oversight roles related to federal student loan policy. It does not serve as a resource for individual borrower eligibility. Appendices are included with additional resources, a glossary of terms, and historical information on borrowing limits, interest rates, and fees. The Direct Loan program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid.", "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is a federal program that provides aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program within ESEA, providing supplementary services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education determines grant amounts for Title I-A based on four funding formulas. In FY2019, grants were allocated through Basic Grants (41%), Concentration Grants (9%), Targeted Grants (25%), and Education Finance Incentive Grants (25%). Each formula calculates a maximum grant based on a child count and expenditure factor, which is then reduced to account for available appropriations and state minimum grant provisions. California received the largest total grant amount ($2.0 billion) and the largest percentage share (12.52%) of Title I-A grants, while Vermont received the smallest total grant amount ($36.9 million) and the smallest percentage share (0.24%). Grant amounts and percentage shares vary among states due to different allocation amounts and state characteristics. Certain formulas may be more favorable to certain states.", "Poverty is an ongoing concern for Congress, as it affects the allocation of funding for programs and eligibility for assistance. The poverty rate in the US fell to 11.8% in 2018 from 12.3% in 2017, although it remains higher than its low point in 1973. Poverty is not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse collection of families and individuals. Work and living arrangements play a significant role in poverty, and different demographic groups have varying poverty rates. Children are disproportionately affected by poverty, with 16.2% living in poverty in 2018. Working-age adults make up the largest share of the poverty population, but they are underrepresented in poverty compared to the overall population. Women are overrepresented in poverty, likely due to single-parent households. This report uses the official poverty measure, which has limitations and does not consider assets or modern resource-sharing arrangements. Overall, 38.1 million people had pre-tax money income below the poverty threshold in 2018.", "For over 65 years, the U.S. Congress has funded international food assistance through the Food for Peace program (FFP) to address hunger and improve global food security. The program provides food assistance in the form of in-kind food commodities purchased in the U.S. and shipped overseas, as well as through market-based approaches. The majority of U.S. international food assistance is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), specifically the Office of Food for Peace. Nonemergency programming has become less prominent over the years as emergency needs have increased. Nonemergency programs aim to address the root causes of hunger, build resilience in vulnerable communities, and reduce the need for future emergency assistance. These programs are typically implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and include activities such as in-kind food distribution, cash or voucher distributions, and educational programs to promote dietary diversity and agricultural training. FFP nonemergency programs often run for five years and focus on reducing chronic malnutrition, increasing household income, and supporting agricultural programs. They are implemented in partnership with local organizations in countries such as Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malawi. FFP nonemergency programs bridge the gap between short-term emergency food assistance and longer-term agricultural development and nutrition assistance programs. They work in coordination with FFP emergency programs and the Bureau for Food Security-led Feed the Future development programs. Funding for nonemergency programs comes from the Food for Peace Title II Grants account within the Foreign Agricultural Service and the Development Assistance account within the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriations. These programs have historically received bipartisan support due to their connections to U.S. farmers and shippers. The U.S. maritime industry is also involved in FFP programming due to longstanding cargo preference requirements. Despite tensions around these requirements, the maritime industry remains engaged in FFP programs. Overall, FFP nonemergency programs aim to address food insecurity in vulnerable populations by building resilience and reducing the need for future emergency assistance.", "The Trump Administration and Congress are trying to address the issue of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras arriving at the US Southwest border. There has been criticism of the \"catch and release\" system, where asylum seekers without proper documentation are released into the US interior while they await their immigration hearings. This is due to long wait times for hearings and a lack of detention space for families. Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs are gaining attention as a way to monitor and supervise released foreign nationals. Proponents argue that ATD programs are more cost-effective and have high compliance rates. Critics say that these programs allow participants to evade removal proceedings and create incentives for migration. The number of apprehensions at the Southwest border has increased, and more apprehensions are now from the Northern Triangle countries rather than Mexico. Family units and unaccompanied children make up the majority of apprehensions. Due to legal restrictions and a lack of facilities, most family units and unaccompanied children are released into US communities to await their hearings. ICE's Intensive Supervision Appearance Program III (ISAP III) is the main ATD program, with participants supervised by BI, Inc. through case management and technology services. There are concerns about the effectiveness of ATD programs and whether they are a replacement for detention.", "President Trump declared an emergency under the Stafford Act in response to COVID-19, authorizing assistance for all U.S. states, territories, tribes, and the District of Columbia. The declaration activated FEMA's Public Assistance program, which provides financial assistance for emergency protective measures. The President also approved major disaster declaration requests for all 50 states and other territories. The declarations provide various forms of assistance, such as debris removal and emergency protective measures, to help states and localities respond to the pandemic. The assistance is meant to supplement local efforts and cannot cover activities already funded by insurance or other sources. Nonprofit organizations, including religious organizations, may be eligible for reimbursement for eligible costs incurred during emergency protective measures. For-profit entities are not eligible for reimbursement but may be eligible for assistance through the Small Business Administration.", "Brexit, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, continues to dominate UK politics. After a national referendum in 2016, the UK officially notified the EU of its intention to leave. However, the UK Parliament was unable to agree on a way forward, leading to delays and extensions. Negotiations between the UK and the EU resulted in a new withdrawal agreement, but it faced challenges in Parliament. Finally, in December 2019, a general election gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a mandate to proceed with Brexit. The UK officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, but negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship are ongoing. The US has expressed interest in a trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit, but the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland remains a concern for some Members of Congress.", "The Coast Guard is requesting $657 million in procurement funding for the National Security Cutters (NSCs), Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs), and Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) in the FY2020 budget. Congress must decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the funding requests and acquisition strategies. The 91 planned NSCs, OPCs, and FRCs are intended to replace older Coast Guard ships that are manpower-intensive and expensive to maintain. The NSCs are the largest and most capable cutters, the OPCs are smaller and less capable than NSCs, and the FRCs are smaller and less expensive. Some key issues for Congress include whether to provide funding for a 12th NSC, how many FRCs to procure in FY2020, and whether to use annual or multiyear contracting for the OPCs.", "The United States has seen a rise in high-profile violent crimes motivated by bias or animosity towards specific races, ethnicities, or religions. These incidents include shootings at synagogues, attacks on protestors at rallies, and hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers rely on data collected by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to understand if there has been an increase in hate crimes and to create effective policy responses. The DOJ collects hate crime data through the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics Program and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). However, there are differences between the number of hate crimes reported by the FBI and the number of hate crime victimizations reported by the NCVS. The FBI data only includes hate crimes reported to law enforcement and where bias motivation is confirmed, while the NCVS aims to estimate the total number of hate crime victimizations, including unreported incidents. Another issue is the underreporting of hate crimes by law enforcement agencies to the FBI. Research shows that some agencies misclassify hate crimes or fail to report them altogether. There is a need to improve hate crime data collection and reporting to better understand the prevalence of hate crimes in the United States.", "This report provides information on private health insurance coverage of health benefits related to COVID-19. It discusses the requirements under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) for coverage of COVID-19 testing, treatment, and a potential vaccine. The report explains that FFCRA requires most private health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing and related services without consumer cost sharing. The CARES Act further expands coverage of COVID-19 testing and requires coverage of a potential vaccine and other preventive services without cost sharing. However, there are no federal requirements specifically mandating coverage of COVID-19 treatment services. The report also notes that some states and insurers have implemented their own requirements and coverage policies. Overall, the report provides an overview of private health insurance coverage of COVID-19-related benefits and highlights the key requirements and variations that exist.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021, known as \"spending caps.\" Separate limits are set for defense discretionary and nondefense discretionary spending. However, there are adjustments and exemptions that complicate the calculation of overall discretionary spending. Adjustments refer to spending for certain activities that is exempt from the spending limits and are made after the spending legislation has been enacted. The 21st Century Cures Act also provides exemptions from the limits for specific purposes. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and emergency spending are the two largest adjustments, accounting for the majority of spending. OCO has no statutory limit, while emergency spending has no limit set. Other adjustments are capped and can be used for specific programs or purposes. Adjustments are made to accommodate spending designated as OCO, emergency requirements, and disaster relief. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for evaluating compliance with the spending limits and provides reports to Congress. Since the limits were instituted, approximately $891 billion of spending has been provided under adjustments, with OCO accounting for 73% of the total.", "Medicaid is a government program that provides healthcare services to low-income individuals and families. It is funded by both the federal government and the states. Medicaid eligibility traditionally includes certain populations like children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. However, since 2014, states have had the option to expand Medicaid to cover nonelderly adults with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level.\n\nDuring recessions, Medicaid enrollment tends to increase as more people experience job loss or reduced incomes. The federal government has provided temporary increases in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate to help states fund their Medicaid programs during economic downturns. These temporary FMAP increases were implemented during the 2001 recession, the Great Recession, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe FMAP rate determines the federal share of Medicaid expenditures, with higher rates provided to states with lower per capita incomes. The FMAP rate can vary annually depending on changes in state and national per capita incomes.\n\nRecessions have a significant impact on Medicaid enrollment, expenditures, and state tax revenues. As more people become eligible for Medicaid during economic downturns, state budgets can be strained. States may need to reduce Medicaid expenditures or increase taxes to accommodate the increased demand for Medicaid services.\n\nThe ACA Medicaid expansion, which allows states to cover more adults with higher incomes, is expected to amplify the effects of recessions on Medicaid enrollment. However, the higher federal matching rate for the Medicaid expansion population helps alleviate some of the financial burdens on states.\n\nIn response to past recessions, states have implemented cost-saving measures in their Medicaid programs, such as reducing provider payments and limiting coverage for optional services. The impacts of recessions on Medicaid enrollment and expenditures can extend beyond the recession period itself.\n\nTemporary FMAP increases have been provided to states during recessions to assist with Medicaid funding. These increases help states maintain their Medicaid programs and reduce their share of Medicaid expenditures. The FMAP increases have varied in terms of the percentage increase and the duration of the increase.\n\nOverall, recessions have a profound impact on Medicaid enrollment, expenditures, and state budgets. Temporary FMAP increases have been implemented to help states during economic downturns, but the long-term effects of recessions on Medicaid and state finances can persist even after the recession has officially ended.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest energy consumer within the federal government, consuming 707.9 trillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy in FY2017. This accounts for roughly 76% of the entire federal government's energy expenditures. Energy efficiency is important for DOD, as it can lead to cost savings and reduce risks in combat zones. DOD is subject to federal energy management rules and requirements, including reductions in fossil fuel consumption, increases in renewable energy use, and energy efficiency targets. DOD issues directives and guidance to comply with these requirements and has its own internal energy strategies. Operational energy, used for military operations, is not subject to these requirements. DOD has made progress in reducing energy use and increasing energy efficiency, but has not met all targets. DOD manages a large number of buildings, most of which are subject to federal energy management. It has reduced building energy intensity by 21.8% compared to FY2003 levels. DOD also invests in energy savings projects, such as energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs), to increase efficiency and save costs. DOD has not reported on the requirement to reduce fossil fuel consumption in new or renovated buildings, and it has reached 5% renewable electricity consumption by FY2013, falling short of the 7.5% goal set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.", "When Congress considers legislation, it takes into account the potential budgetary effects of the proposal. The House and Senate Budget Committees, along with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), determine whether legislation complies with budgetary rules. CBO and JCT provide cost estimates for legislation, which include projections of the budgetary effects and anticipated individual behavioral responses. However, these estimates do not typically include the macroeconomic effects of those individual behavioral responses. Congress has sometimes required CBO and JCT to provide estimates that do incorporate macroeconomic effects, known as dynamic estimates. Currently, no congressional rules explicitly require dynamic estimates, but Congress may examine whether changes are needed in this area. Cost estimates provided by CBO and JCT are guided by certain requirements, including the Congressional Budget Act. CBO uses baseline levels to measure the budgetary effect of a legislative proposal, which are assumed to occur under current law. The creation and content of cost estimates can also be shaped by House and Senate rules, budget resolutions, and congressional committees. Proponents of dynamic scoring argue that it provides a more accurate assessment of budgetary impact and improves Congress's ability to compare policy proposals. They also state that CBO and JCT are capable of producing dynamic estimates. Opponents of dynamic scoring argue that projected macroeconomic feedback effects are too uncertain and yield controversial results. They also point to potential problems with cost estimating in general. Some suggest that dynamic estimates should only be provided for major proposals or when CBO and JCT have the necessary resources. Additionally, they argue that dynamic estimates should be conducted for both spending and revenue proposals. While committees and Members can still request dynamic estimates, there are currently no explicit congressional rules or requirements for their preparation or use.", "This report provides a summary of the procedures followed by the House and Senate to reach agreement on legislation. It explains how both chambers must pass the same bill or joint resolution and reach full agreement on its text before it is submitted to the President. The report discusses various scenarios that can occur when one chamber passes its own bill and sends it to the other chamber for consideration, or when both chambers develop their own bills on the same subject. It also explains the process of resolving differences between the House and Senate when they pass different versions of a bill, and how conference committees are created to reach a compromise. The report also covers the rules and procedures that govern the exchange of amendments between the two chambers and the appointment of conferees. It concludes by discussing the guidelines for conference committee meetings and the decision-making authority of conferees.", "The Social Security program, also known as OASDI, is facing financial pressure due to demographic changes, specifically decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. The aging population, particularly the increase in the number of people aged 65 and older, is causing costs to rise faster than revenues. The program's ability to pay full benefits is projected to be compromised after 2034 when the trust funds' assets are exhausted. This report highlights the impact of demographic changes on the program's finances and discusses potential solutions for addressing the financial shortfall.", "In 2019, the Indian government announced the end of the \"special status\" of its Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) state, which had granted the state autonomy. This move sparked controversy internationally, as neighboring Pakistan and China, as well as the United Nations, consider the territory disputed. The Indian government's actions have been criticized for alleged reliance on repressive force and questionable legal arguments. There are concerns about increased civil unrest and violence in the region, as well as the impact on democracy and human rights in India. The United States has called for peace, stability, and respect for human rights. Restrictions on communication and detentions of political leaders continue in J&K, and there have been reports of human rights abuses. The situation in J&K has been a long-standing issue between India and Pakistan, and efforts to resolve the conflict have been made through U.N. Security Council actions.", "The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) programs were reorganized in FY2016. The DNN appropriation consists of two main mission areas: the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program and the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR). The DNN Program is divided into six functional areas, including Materials Management and Minimization, Global Material Security, Nonproliferation and Arms Control, National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development (NTNF R&D), Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (DNN R&D), and Nonproliferation Construction. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations decreased by 6.2% from FY2020, mainly due to the completion of funding for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project and an increase in FY2020 funds for the Cesium Irradiator Replace Program. Funding for the Material Management Minimization program increased by 10% to establish non-HEU based molybdenum-99 production technologies. The NTNF R&D program is a new program in FY2021 and the budget requests funds for the U.S. plutonium disposition program. The U.S. facility for plutonium disposition was originally the MOX facility but was terminated and replaced with the Dilute and Dispose method. The proposed decrease in the Nonproliferation Construction account is related to the termination of the MOX project, and funds will be used for the Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) project.", "This report discusses the economic impact of business-related tax provisions that are scheduled to expire before 2025. There are 13 business-related provisions set to expire at the end of 2020. These provisions provide various types of tax relief to businesses in different industries. Congress has regularly extended expired provisions in the past, with the most recent extension in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. The estimated cost of the temporary provisions extended in this act is provided. There are also four other provisions scheduled to expire in 2021 or 2022. Congress has several options regarding these temporary provisions, including extending them for a short or long term, allowing them to expire, or making them permanent. The provisions discussed in the report include depreciation deductions, expensing provisions for film and television productions, tax treatment for motorsports racing facilities, recovery period for racehorses, tax incentives for Indian reservations, and tax incentives for Empowerment Zones. Overall, the report provides an overview of the business-related tax provisions and their potential economic impact.", "Electric vehicle (EV) technology has gained popularity as an alternative to traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Numerous policies and incentives have been put in place to encourage the production and use of EVs. EVs have been around since the early 1800s, but they became obsolete in the 20th century due to the availability of gasoline-powered cars. However, environmental concerns in recent years have sparked renewed interest in EVs. Different types of EVs include hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (AEVs). EV sales have been increasing, with EVs making up 4.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2018 in the US. Charging infrastructure has also grown to accommodate the rising number of EV owners. One of the main factors driving interest in EVs is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, the extent of these reductions depends on various factors, such as the sources of electricity used to charge EVs.", "Senate Rule XXIII outlines the individuals who are permitted floor privileges in the Senate chamber while the Senate is in session. The rule includes categories such as the President of the United States, judges, ex-Senators, and certain staff members. However, the rule was amended in 2007 to exclude registered lobbyists and individuals acting as agents of foreign principals. The report provides a history of Senate floor privileges and discusses the current categories listed in Rule XXIII. It also explains the procedures for obtaining temporary staff access through the Sergeant at Arms or by unanimous consent. The report will be updated as needed.", "Legislation in the House is referred to committees based on their jurisdictional statements in House Rule X. These statements define the policy subjects on which each standing committee has jurisdiction. However, because the statements are broad, more than one committee can claim jurisdiction over different aspects of a subject. The House Parliamentarian provides additional guidance and context below the jurisdictional statements. Committees can also have jurisdiction over certain aspects of a subject based on their connection to issues involving that subject. The Speaker refers legislation to committees in a way that ensures each committee with jurisdiction can consider and report on the provisions. Multiple referral, or referring a measure to more than one committee, is common in the House. The Speaker can also appoint members from relevant committees to special committees to review specific matters. House rules and procedures for referring legislation have changed over time. Committees can create memoranda to clarify jurisdictional boundaries, but these cannot override Rule X. Referring a measure to a committee establishes jurisdiction for future referrals. Subcommittees are generally determined by the full committee, and their jurisdictions are often established in committee rules. Legislative jurisdiction refers to a committee's authority to receive and report measures, while oversight jurisdiction refers to a committee's ability to review matters within its purview. Some committees interpret their oversight responsibilities more broadly than others, leading to jurisdictional disputes. Since many policy areas are complex, more than one committee may be involved in overseeing specific aspects of a subject.", "The opioid epidemic in the United States has led to a significant gap between the need for substance abuse treatment and the capacity of the healthcare system to provide that treatment. In 2017, over 47,600 people died from opioid-related drug overdoses. However, the majority of individuals in need of treatment do not receive it. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which combines medication with other services, is considered the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Three medications are currently used in MAT: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine are both opioids and can be used to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and maintain abstinence. Methadone is typically given in inpatient settings or federally certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs), while buprenorphine can also be prescribed by qualified practitioners outside of OTPs. Efforts have been made to increase the availability of MAT, but access to treatment is still lacking in many areas. A study found that the number of patients being treated by data-waived providers was substantially lower than the authorized patient limit. Geography plays a role in treatment availability, with many rural areas lacking access to MAT providers. Policy efforts to address the opioid crisis have resulted in increased MAT availability, but more needs to be done to ensure that treatment is accessible to those in need.", "In FY2018, the federal government spent $917.8 billion on benefits and services for people with low income, which was a 2.2% increase compared to FY2017. The largest portion of low-income assistance goes to families with children with working parents and the disabled. The spending on benefits and services for people with low income has increased steadily since FY2012, largely due to increases in spending on health care for low-income people, particularly through Medicaid. Health care represents more than half of the total spending for these programs in FY2018. The other categories of spending include cash aid, food aid, education, housing and development, social services, employment and training, and energy assistance. The largest categories, such as health, cash aid, and food aid, are dominated by mandatory spending, while housing is mostly discretionary spending. Most programs in these categories have their spending classified in a single category, with a few exceptions such as the TANF block grant and SNAP, which have spending in multiple categories. Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit, and SNAP are some of the largest programs providing benefits and services to low-income people. Overall, the majority of spending for these programs comes from mandatory funding.", "Cable television service providers, or cable operators, are regulated at the federal, state, and local levels. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has regulatory authority over various aspects of cable service, while cable operators must obtain franchises from state or local franchising authorities to provide cable services. Franchising authorities can impose requirements and fees as conditions for granting franchises. The FCC has issued several orders to restrict the requirements and costs imposed by franchising authorities. The First Order clarified when franchising authorities unreasonably refuse to award a franchise and provided guidance on what costs count toward the 5% franchise fee cap. The Second Order extended the First Order's rulings to incumbent cable operators. The Third Order seeks to address issues raised by the Sixth Circuit by clarifying the counting of in-kind payments toward the franchise fee cap and asserting the preemption of state and local laws that impose fees on non-cable services. Some municipalities have criticized the Third Order, and legal challenges have been filed. This report provides an overview of the federal legal framework governing cable franchising and discusses key issues and pending challenges.", "Migration across the Southwest border of the United States has been increasing over the past two years, posing challenges for federal agencies. From 2000 to 2017, unauthorized migration had been declining, but it has since started to rise again. The recent increases have been characterized as a border security and humanitarian crisis. The characteristics of apprehended migrants have also changed during the past decade. Mexican migrants now make up a minority of total apprehensions, with the largest group coming from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Migrant flows have been increasingly characterized by families and unaccompanied children. Many migrants are now seeking asylum and protection from violence. The changing character of the migrant flow has resulted in logistical and resource challenges for federal agencies. The Trump Administration has initiated changes to existing policy for apprehended migrants in order to discourage unauthorized migration flows. The number of apprehensions has been used historically as a measure of migration pressure and border enforcement. Apprehensions peaked in 2000 and have generally been declining since, reaching a low point in 2017. However, apprehensions have increased in the past two years. The national origins of apprehended migrants have shifted, with Mexican nationals no longer making up the majority. Family unit apprehensions have increased the most since 2012, surpassing single adult apprehensions in 2019. The recent changes in the character of migrant flows have occurred within the context of historically low numbers of apprehensions since 2000.", "The Latin American and Caribbean region has experienced significant political and economic development over the past four decades. While most countries in the region are now democracies, some, like Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, are ruled by authoritarian governments. Recent elections in several countries have been controversial and contested. Despite improvements in political rights and civil liberties, many countries still face challenges in delivering public services, ensuring accountability and transparency, advancing the rule of law, and ensuring citizen safety and security. Economic factors, including declining growth rates, income inequality, and increased poverty, have contributed to social unrest in the region. U.S. interests in the region include economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns. The Trump Administration has taken a more confrontational approach in its policies towards the region, including cutting foreign aid and implementing restrictive immigration policies.", "The digital divide, which refers to the gap between those who have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do not, is a problem in the United States. Congress has introduced legislation and held hearings to address this issue, but the gap still persists. Access to broadband internet is not the only barrier to closing the digital divide, as other challenges include the cost of internet service and devices, as well as a lack of digital literacy. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) have programs to provide federal funding for broadband, but there are few initiatives to address other aspects of the digital divide. States have also taken action to expand broadband access, and their initiatives can serve as models for potential federal programs. Broadband infrastructure deployment is a common focus of state initiatives, but some states have also entered into public-private partnerships to expand broadband. Overall, the goal is to provide high-speed internet access to all residents, regardless of location or socioeconomic factors.", "The Supreme Court term that began in October 2018 was marked by a transition in the Court's makeup, with the retirement of Justice Kennedy and the arrival of Justice Kavanaugh. However, the term did not produce significant changes to the Court's jurisprudence. The Court declined to hear cases on abortion, the federal ban on bumpstocks, religious objections to same-sex wedding services, tariffs on imported steel, and the detainment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay. The Court also scheduled arguments for the October 2019 Term on cases related to sexual orientation discrimination and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. The term did see some 5-4 splits along ideological lines, but also witnessed unusual alignments among the justices. The Court upheld the Auer doctrine, which defers to agencies' interpretations of their own regulations, but imposed limitations on its application. Overall, the term's rulings provide insight into how the Court may function following Justice Kennedy's retirement.", "China has been increasing its overseas investments since launching its \"Go Global Strategy\" in 1999. Chinese firms have acquired foreign assets and pledged billions of dollars to develop infrastructure abroad. China's push overseas has been particularly visible in the Indo-Pacific region through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, China's global economic activities also extend to Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania. Some analysts view China's activities as purely commercial, while others see them as part of Beijing's efforts to challenge and undermine U.S. global influence. China's economic expansion is driven by domestic economic development and the need for resources and technology. The government also seeks to secure key supply chains and build geo-economic leverage to support its foreign policy objectives. Concerns have been raised about the nature of China's loans and investments, as they often lack transparency and accountability. China's activities have led to questions about its intentions and the implications for U.S. economic and strategic interests. However, accurate data on China's investments and construction projects are limited, making it difficult to assess the full size, scope, and implications of these activities.", "A census is a complete count of the population, while a survey covers a sample and is generalizable to the entire population. The U.S. decennial census is constitutionally mandated and is used for various purposes, including apportionment of House seats, redistricting, and allocation of federal funds. The 2020 census started on January 21 in Toksook Bay, Alaska, and in-person visits to nonrespondents will begin in May. The Census Bureau must provide official numbers for House apportionment by December 31, 2020, and data for states' requests by March 31, 2021. The census is important for estimating current and future population sizes and is used by businesses, researchers, and all levels of government. A lack of understanding about the purpose and process of the census is the biggest barrier to participation, according to a survey and focus groups conducted by the Census Bureau. Low levels of education, being young, and belonging to racial or ethnic minority groups were associated with low intent to respond to the census. However, the survey also revealed common motivators for answering the census, such as the need for funding for public services. The Census Bureau has developed a $500 million communications strategy, including a multicultural advertising campaign in 13 languages, to encourage census participation. The bureau is also working with community partners, schools, and student outreach programs to ensure a complete count. The census form asks for basic information about the number of people in a household, their relationships, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The form does not ask for detailed personal information, including citizenship status. A proposed citizenship question was challenged and ultimately not included on the census form. Instead, the Department of Commerce issued an executive order directing agencies to provide access to administrative records for determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country. The census will be conducted primarily online, with mailed invitations and paper questionnaires for nonrespondents. The Census Bureau has developed tools, such as the Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM), to identify hard-to-reach areas and tailor outreach efforts. The bureau aims to reach 99% of households through its communications strategy, partnerships, and targeted advertising.", "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administers federal aid to highways through various programs. These programs are authorized as part of multiyear surface transportation reauthorization acts, such as the FAST Act. Approximately 25% of public roads in the U.S. are eligible for federal aid, which includes all major roads. State departments of transportation determine which projects are funded and oversee project development and construction. The FAST Act authorized $225 billion for highways from FY2016 to FY2020, with annual increases in federal highway spending. The condition of existing highway infrastructure is an important factor in determining funding needs. Historically, the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has provided revenue for federal-aid highway programs through dedicated taxes. However, the HTF is facing a funding shortfall, and without additional funds, payments to state departments of transportation may be delayed. Congress may need to address this issue during reauthorization. Various options for funding the HTF include transfers from the general fund, reducing spending on the Federal-Aid Highway Program, eliminating the mass transit account, devolving responsibility for highways to the states, or implementing new revenue sources such as raising fuel taxes, implementing a vehicle miles traveled charge, imposing a carbon tax, or tolling. Tolling, in particular, may be an effective way to finance specific facilities but may not be cost-effective in areas with low population densities. Congress could consider allowing states to toll existing Interstate Highway lanes under certain circumstances or expanding tolling to reduce the need for federal expenditures.", "The International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. The FY2020 budget for these agencies was $678.7 million, which was $31.7 million more than the previous year and $58.5 million more than the administration's request. The ITA received $510.3 million for FY2020, which was $26.3 million more than the previous year. Within the ITA, the Global Markets unit received $335.3 million, the Enforcement and Compliance unit received $94.8 million, and the Industry and Analysis unit received $62.6 million. These funding levels were approved in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.", "This report examines the impact of historic wet weather during the 2019 growing season on major U.S. field crops, primarily corn and soybeans. It highlights the record number of prevent plant acres, delays in planting and harvesting, crop insurance indemnity payments, and additional assistance for producers affected by trade damage and prevent plant losses. Corn and soybeans are critical crops for various sectors, and any reduction in output can have significant implications for prices and the farm economy. The federal crop insurance program has been the largest component of the farm safety net since 2010, providing an average of $7.8 billion annually in premium subsidies. The wet conditions in 2019 led to late planting, reduced insurance coverage, and the decision to plant despite the risks. The report analyzes data from both the Farm Service Agency and the Risk Management Agency, which provided similar but slightly different estimates of prevent plant acres. The report also discusses the federal assistance available to farmers, including crop insurance, supplemental disaster assistance payments, and market facilitation program payments. Overall, the report highlights the challenges faced by farmers due to weather conditions and trade disputes, as well as the importance of federal support programs in mitigating the impact on the farm economy.", "The 116th Congress began with a record high number of 57 African American Members. However, the current number has decreased to 56 due to the death of a House Member. African American Members make up 10.1% of voting Members in the Congress and 10.4% of total Members. In the House, they represent 11.7% of voting Members and 12.0% of total Members, while in the Senate, they comprise 3.0% of total Members. There have been a total of 162 African American Members in both the House and Senate. The representation of African Americans in Congress has been the subject of numerous studies, examining issues such as descriptive and substantive representation, the impact of majority-minority districts, and the relationship between minority Members and their constituents. The first African American to serve in the Senate was Hiram Revels in 1870, while the first African American in the House was Joseph Rainey in the same year. African American membership in the House first reached 10 Members in the 91st Congress and exceeded 5% in the 100th Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus was established in 1971 and is currently one of over 270 registered congressional member organizations in the House. African American women have made significant strides in Congress, with a record 25 serving in the 116th Congress. Several African Americans have held positions in party leadership, and some have chaired committees in both the House and Senate.", "Digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, are assets issued and transferred using blockchain technology. They can be securities, currencies, or commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the main regulator overseeing digital assets that are securities. The SEC has been using various approaches, including enforcement actions and no-action letters, to address regulatory challenges in the digital asset space. Policy issues in this area include regulatory oversight and investor protection. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) and digital asset trading platforms are two key examples of digital asset developments that raise policy concerns. ICOs are a fundraising mechanism where companies sell digital tokens in exchange for traditional or digital currencies. Digital asset trading platforms, often called exchanges, face issues related to fraud, manipulation, and investor protection. It is important to strike a balance between regulatory oversight and fostering financial innovation in the digital asset space. Transparency, fairness, and efficiency are key principles that need to be addressed in the regulation of digital asset exchanges. Market manipulation and fake trading volumes are significant concerns in the industry.", "A report outlines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial services industry in the United States and the relief options available to consumers. The report discusses loan forbearance and other forms of assistance that financial institutions can provide to consumers who may struggle to repay their loans due to the pandemic. It highlights the provisions of the CARES Act, including forbearance for federally backed mortgages and suspension of payments and interest accrual for federal student loans. The report also addresses the impact of the pandemic on financial institutions and the regulatory responses to help them cope with increased loan losses. It concludes by discussing the potential impact of missed loan payments on consumers' credit scores and the relief measures in the CARES Act to mitigate disincentives for banks to grant forbearance.", "The United States is currently the largest producer and consumer of natural gas in the world. Production from shale formations has transformed the United States from an importer to an exporter of natural gas. The United States has the largest and most expansive pipeline network and is the 4th largest exporter of natural gas. The transformation of the natural gas sector in the United States is attributed to market competition, technological innovation, and other factors. The interest in natural gas among congressional members has increased over the years with the number of bills introduced related to natural gas topics. In 1998, the United States was the 2nd largest producer and consumer of natural gas, and Canada supplied the majority of U.S. imports. However, between 2008 and 2018, U.S. production and consumption of natural gas increased significantly while prices dropped. As a result, the United States started to export natural gas, both by pipeline and LNG. The United States is currently the 6th largest LNG exporter and has plans to expand its export capacity in the coming years. Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Japan, China, and India, are the biggest consumers of U.S. LNG. However, China's imports of U.S. LNG have declined due to the trade dispute between the two countries. Despite the increase in exports, there has been no corresponding rise in U.S. natural gas prices. Russia remains the largest overall exporter of natural gas, while Qatar was the largest exporter of LNG in 2018. The United States has seen its imports of LNG diminish significantly since 2008. The interest in natural gas among Congress is evident with the introduction of numerous bills covering various natural gas-related topics in the current Congress.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy, causing widespread unemployment, disruptions to trade, and shortages of food and medical supplies. The World Food Program warns that the number of people suffering from acute hunger could double by the end of the year without swift international action. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable, as they have limited financial resources and weak health systems. Many of these countries are turning to international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank for financial support. The IMF has pledged to use its $1 trillion lending capacity, while the World Bank plans to mobilize $240 billion over the next 15 months. The IMF has already approved several COVID-related programs for countries such as Bolivia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The IMF and World Bank have also called for a debt standstill for low-income countries to help them address the crisis. The IMF is seeking to increase its funding to provide additional debt service relief. The World Bank has approved or is in the process of approving $9 billion in COVID-19 projects in 78 countries and plans to deploy up to $160 billion over the next 15 months. Other multilateral development banks, including the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank, have committed roughly $80 billion to respond to the crisis. The G-20 finance ministers have also announced a temporary suspension of debt payments for the world's poorest countries until the end of the year, potentially freeing up more than $20 billion.", "In response to China's increasing influence and the perception of a weakening U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, many nations are developing new strategies to strengthen their geopolitical position independent of the United States. Concerns about China's military modernization, maritime territorial claims, and economic coercion are leading Indo-Pacific nations to increase their strategic mistrust of Beijing. Additionally, other factors such as North Korea's nuclear power, Japan's reacquisition of power projection capabilities, and advancements in military technologies are impacting the geostrategic balance. Amidst these developments, several trends are emerging in the region, including the formation of new security partnerships, a shift towards an \"Indo-Pacific\" conception of the region, increased defense spending, and efforts to maintain independence from Chinese influence. The Trump Administration's posture in Asia has been conflicting, leading to concerns from U.S. allies and partners about the U.S. commitment to the region. To address these challenges and promote U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific, Congress has introduced legislation emphasizing U.S. commitment to alliances and partnerships in the region. Japan, in particular, has been proactive in promoting the concept of the Indo-Pacific as a strategic space and has been deepening defense cooperation with the United States to counter China's influence. However, there have been some differences between Japan and the United States in their approach to the Indo-Pacific, including how the region is defined geographically and the emphasis on military and security elements. Japan's insecurity about China's power is also heightened by concerns about the United States' waning power in the region. Despite these differences, Japan continues to view its alliance with the United States as central to its security strategy but is also seeking to strengthen cooperation with Australia and India. Japan's defense efforts include enhancing capabilities in traditional and new security domains and increasing security cooperation with other countries. Economic factors, such as trade relationships and the Trump Administration's trade policies, have further complicated the strategic picture in the Indo-Pacific. Japan's efforts to salvage the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its concerns about potential U.S. tariffs on its auto industry highlight the importance of multilateral trade agreements for its Indo-Pacific strategy. Japan has also expressed concerns about the Trump Administration's approach to dealing with North Korea and its decisions to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord and the TPP. In light of these challenges and developments, Japan has released documents outlining its defense efforts, emphasizing its own defense capabilities while also strengthening security cooperation with the United States and other countries. The documents also reflect Japan's concerns about China and North Korea and its desire to keep the United States engaged in the region. As part of its defense efforts, Japan plans to procure new weapons technology, upgrade its missile defense systems, and increase defense spending. These actions demonstrate Japan's commitment to its security strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.", "The United States is experiencing changes in the sources of electricity generation due to economic factors, new technologies, environmental concerns, and regulatory policies. One notable change is the increased generation from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources such as wind and solar. While the generation from wind and solar sources has been increasing, it is important to consider the weather-dependent availability of these sources.\n\nPower system operators have adjusted reliability standards and planning practices to accommodate the variability of wind and solar sources. However, as the generation from these sources continues to grow, further adjustments may be necessary. Currently, wind and solar generation does not appear to be causing significant reliability issues at the national level.\n\nReliability standards for the bulk power system are set by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These standards do not apply to small-scale generators or local distribution systems, which are under the jurisdiction of state public utility regulatory commissions.\n\nWhile wind and solar generation has been increasing, data indicates that reliability performance is stable in regions where the share of generation from these sources is above the national average. This suggests that higher levels of generation from wind and solar sources may not negatively impact electric reliability.\n\nThe electric power sector is divided into three systems: generation, transmission, and distribution. In regions with competitive markets, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) manage the generation and transmission components. However, in non-RTO regions, vertically integrated utilities are responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution.\n\nElectric reliability is determined by specific and highly technical definitions provided by NERC reliability standards. These standards ensure an adequate level of reliability for the bulk power system, but localized outages may still occur.\n\nWind and solar sources are considered variable renewable energy sources, and their availability is subject to weather conditions. In contrast, conventional sources have long-lasting fuel supplies and greater availability certainty.\n\nBalancing is essential for maintaining reliability in the power system. Balancing authorities issue orders to generators to change their output as needed. Wind and solar sources typically generate at maximum capacity, while other sources are adjusted to balance the system.\n\nDifferent sources have varying ramping capabilities, and system operators use a combination of sources to balance generation from wind and solar sources. Reciprocating internal combustion engines, steam turbines, interregional balancing, energy storage, and demand response are some of the options used for balancing.\n\nThe electric power sector is working to improve the use of weather and power forecasting in system balancing. This includes programs like demand response and changes to wholesale electricity market rules to facilitate the integration of wind sources.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing generation from wind and solar sources in the United States does not appear to be causing significant electric reliability issues at the national level. Power system operators have adjusted reliability standards and planning practices to accommodate the variability of these sources. Different balancing options are used to ensure reliability, and the sector is working towards improvements in forecasting and system balancing.", "This report examines the practice of voluntary cooperation between Congress and the executive branch, particularly in terms of testimony before congressional committees. While there are occasional disputes between the two branches, most interactions are voluntary and based on cooperation. The report highlights some of the incentives for voluntary participation, including the control that Congress has over the budget and the organization of executive branch agencies. It also discusses how the courts have recognized Congress's authority to investigate the executive branch. In some cases, cooperation with Congress can benefit an Administration politically. The report also touches on the process of submitting budget requests and legislation to Congress and the use of confirmation hearings to establish expectations for future cooperation. However, there are certain circumstances, such as national security and intelligence matters, law enforcement investigations, and executive branch deliberations, in which the executive branch may be less inclined to provide public testimony. In such cases, committees may choose to accommodate these concerns or seek to compel testimony.", "accurate data on broadband availability, it becomes difficult for policymakers to make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively to areas that need it the most. Congress has a keen interest in accurate broadband mapping data to ensure that federal broadband programs are targeting the areas in need of assistance. The FCC relies on broadband mapping data to determine whether broadband is being deployed to all Americans on a timely basis and to direct funding for broadband deployment. However, accurately mapping broadband availability is challenging due to factors such as the adequacy of census block data and the lack of independent data validation. In early 2019, the FCC discovered inaccuracies in its Fixed Broadband Deployment Map, which could lead to overbuilding in some areas while leaving others underserved. As a result, efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping, including the establishment of the Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC) and the development of the National Broadband Availability Map. The DODC aims to collect coverage polygons from broadband providers, incorporate public feedback, and revise the current data collection process. The FCC is also seeking comment on incorporating mobile broadband data into the DODC. In addition to the FCC, other federal agencies such as the NTIA and USDA are involved in broadband mapping to determine broadband availability and assist in funding decisions. Accurate broadband data and mapping are essential in addressing the urban/rural digital divide and ensuring that resources are directed to areas that lack broadband access.", "President Trump has faced legal challenges regarding his initiatives to fund and construct border barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. These challenges focus on whether the administration's funding initiatives exceed existing statutory authorization and conflict with Congress's power over federal funds. The administration has cited various authorities to obtain funding, including the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which authorizes the construction of barriers along the border. Other authorities include the Secretary of Defense's authority to undertake military construction projects and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The administration has taken steps to make these funds available, including declaring a national emergency and transferring funds from other sources. Multiple lawsuits have been filed, with some courts ruling in favor of the administration and others blocking the use of certain funds. The litigation is ongoing.", "This report focuses on precision-guided munitions (PGMs) fielded by the U.S. military and their increasing importance in modern military operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has requested significant funding for PGMs in recent years, with plans for further procurement in the coming years. Congress plays a critical role in approving and overseeing these programs. PGMs offer advantages such as increased accuracy and reduced collateral damage, but cost is a major disadvantage. The report discusses various types of PGMs, including the Paveway guidance kits, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), and Hellfire missiles. It also highlights the growing operational utility of PGMs in combating anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems used by peer competitors. The report provides details on the development, production, and export of these PGMs, as well as their operational use in recent conflicts.", "Local governments have historically played a role in regulating cable television systems, granting franchises to cable operators and negotiating agreements. In 1984, Congress required local governments to allow competition, and in the mid-2000s, state governments became involved in the franchising process. The FCC has taken steps to limit local regulatory authority over cable and telco video service providers, which has caused controversy. The Communications Act of 1934 created the FCC, which regulates cable systems and franchising authorities. PEG access requirements and franchise fees are common in local agreements. The 1984 Cable Act established local franchising as the primary means of regulation and set limits on franchise fees. The act also prohibited regulation of rates in areas with effective competition. The 1992 Cable Act further restrained local authorities' licensing powers and made it easier for them to regulate cable rates. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed LECs to offer video services and cable operators to offer voice services, leading to increased competition and consolidation in the industry.", "Fintech, which refers to the use of technology in financial industries, is enabled by various technological advancements such as internet and mobile access, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These technologies have the potential to make financial services more efficient and accessible, reducing costs for providers and allowing new customers to enter the market. However, fintech also comes with risks, such as the potential for unexpected losses, the elimination of necessary middlemen, and the unequal impact on certain groups. Additionally, the use of sensitive data in fintech raises concerns over privacy and cybersecurity. Policymakers need to consider whether existing regulations are adequate to foster the development of fintech while mitigating its risks. Fintech also raises questions about industry concentration, consumer disclosures, geographic-based regulations, and the use of alternative data in credit reporting.", "The report provides a legislative history of the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-20), which was enacted in June 2019. It discusses the lack of a formal request for supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance from the Trump Administration and how congressional leadership initiated consideration of disaster-related supplemental appropriations. It also explores the various attempts and negotiations made during the bill's development and eventual passage. The report emphasizes the issues that often arise in the consideration of supplemental disaster assistance appropriations, such as timeliness, scope, budget limits, offsets, and oversight of funding. It concludes by discussing the complexities of measuring the average time it takes for supplemental appropriations to be enacted after a specific disaster and the factors that affect the timing of supplemental appropriations legislation.", "The global carbon cycle is the process by which carbon moves between the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, ocean, and Earth's crust. Carbon exists in different forms, both organic and inorganic, and moves between these pools in a process called flux. The flux of carbon into the atmosphere, particularly as carbon dioxide, contributes to global warming. Forests play a significant role in the carbon cycle, as they sequester carbon through photosynthesis and store it as biomass. Forests also release carbon into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition. Congressional debates often focus on optimizing carbon sequestration in forests as a strategy for mitigating climate change. This report provides an overview of the carbon cycle in forests, data on carbon in U.S. forests, and discusses challenges associated with managing forests for carbon optimization.", "A report discusses the stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution and its impact on income inequality. It reviews changes in wage distribution and overall income, as well as the factors contributing to the lack of wage growth, including technology, trade, the minimum wage, unions, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The report also explores the decline in the labor share of income and its effect on inequality. It concludes that technological advancement is a major factor affecting labor markets, and while trade has some impact, it is not as significant as technology. The report suggests that the trend of wage stagnation among lower-skilled workers relative to the overall population is a result of these factors.", "Traditional macroeconomic theory focuses on two main questions: stabilizing the economy in the short-term and maximizing long-term economic growth while managing debt. Monetary policy and stable prices play a role in both issues. However, in recent years, the US has experienced persistently low interest rates despite full employment and high deficits, leading to debate on the optimal trajectory of federal debt. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), a theory outside of mainstream economics, has gained attention for its view that deficit financing can be used without harmful effects in certain economic conditions. This report compares MMT to mainstream macroeconomic theory, discusses its use in justifying deficit financing, and addresses potential barriers in implementing MMT. The IS-LM model is used as a simplified framework to explain these concepts, but there are more complex models used in forecasting and government agencies. The report concludes that while fiscal and monetary policy can stimulate the economy, excessive deficits or monetary stimulus can have negative long-term effects on growth and inflation.", "House committee investigations in the United States serve different purposes, including gathering information for legislation, conducting oversight of the government, and potentially impeaching federal officials. The distinction between legislative investigations and impeachment investigations can be blurry, especially in cases involving alleged misconduct by an official subject to impeachment. Currently, the ongoing House committee investigations into President Trump are labeled as an \"official impeachment inquiry.\" These investigations have faced challenges with non-compliance with subpoenas for documents and testimony. The legal basis and procedures for impeachment investigations are not clearly defined, and the House has various options for initiating such investigations. Authorization from the House may not be constitutionally necessary, but it can provide clarity and direction for the investigating committee. Overall, the House has significant authority and tools to obtain the information it seeks, regardless of whether it is conducting a legislative or impeachment investigation.", "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to control the federal budget through various provisions. This power includes the ability to collect taxes, borrow money, and appropriate funds from the Treasury. While the Constitution does not specify a role for the President in budget matters, over time, Congress has established rules and practices to create a complex budget process. This process involves multiple decisions and actions that can vary from year to year. Congress has the authority to determine its own rules and procedures for budgetary matters. In the early years of the Republic, standing committees were established in the House and Senate to handle revenue, spending, and debt issues. The distinction between appropriations and general policy legislation was established, with appropriations bills being primarily focused on providing funds for government operations already defined in law. The inclusion of significant new legislative language in appropriations bills was generally considered inappropriate. In 1837, the House adopted a rule stating that appropriations should only be for previously authorized expenditures. The House also developed a practice of removing general legislation from appropriations bills. In 1921, the Budget and Accounting Act created a role for the President in the budget process by requiring agencies to submit budget requests to the President, who would then submit a consolidated request to Congress. The act also established the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office). Direct spending laws, which establish entitlement programs that are not subject to annual appropriations decisions, began with Social Security in the 1930s and have grown to comprise the majority of federal outlays. Prior to the 1970s, there was no formal coordination of the various budgetary measures considered by Congress in a given year. Congress would consider these measures separately, sometimes comparing them to the President's budget proposals. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established a concurrent resolution on the budget, allowing Congress to make decisions about overall fiscal policy and coordinate various budget-related measures. The budget resolution sets guidelines for budget-related legislation but does not have statutory effect. Since the 1980s, various budget control statutes have been enacted to restrict congressional budgetary actions and reduce the deficit. These laws have included provisions for deficit targets, spending caps, and pay-as-you-go procedures. The federal budget includes numbers reflecting receipts, spending, borrowing, and debt. Receipts primarily come from taxes but can also come from other sources. Spending involves budget authority, obligations, outlays, and offsetting collections. Budget authority is the statutory authority to incur financial obligations, while outlays occur when obligations are liquidated. Congress generally does not have direct control over outlays related to executive or judicial branch spending. The relation between budget authority and outlays can vary depending on program characteristics and other factors.", "Beneficial ownership refers to the person or persons who invest in, control, or benefit from an asset such as a bank account or company. In the US, there has been criticism for the lack of systematic disclosure of beneficial ownership, especially in the case of shell companies. Shell companies can be used to anonymously purchase assets and facilitate money laundering. In recent years, the US has taken steps to address beneficial ownership transparency, but there are still vulnerabilities in the system. The lack of AML requirements for real estate professionals is a significant gap in the US AML system. Various legislative proposals have been introduced to address the issue, but more action is needed to tighten beneficial ownership disclosure requirements.", "Federal agencies have struggled with how to address climate change effects when implementing the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA aims to protect threatened and endangered species from extinction. While the ESA does not explicitly require agencies to consider climate change effects, it does direct them to consider \"natural or manmade factors affecting [a species'] continued existence\" and analyze cumulative effects on a species' survival. Various lawsuits have challenged agencies' interpretation of climate change data in their ESA decisions. These lawsuits typically focus on when to list a species as threatened or endangered and whether activities that contribute to climate change should be regulated to protect species. Judicial review has ensured that agencies consider climate change effects, but has not required them to curtail activities that contribute to climate change. This report analyzes court decisions and regulatory developments related to how agencies factor climate change effects into ESA decisions. It discusses the challenges agencies face in predicting whether a species is likely to be endangered in the foreseeable future due to climate change effects. The report also examines how scientific uncertainty and undefined terms in the ESA have led to litigation challenging agencies' interpretation of terms and assessment of climate science. The report concludes by discussing recent regulatory changes that seek to clarify how agencies consider and address climate change in their ESA decisions.", "The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) imposed an oil and gas leasing moratorium in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico until June 30, 2022. It also established a revenue-sharing framework for qualified oil and gas leases with Gulf producing states and the Land and Water Conservation Fund's state assistance program. As the expiration date for the leasing moratorium approaches, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is planning for offshore leasing in the Eastern Gulf. Some members of Congress want to extend the moratorium, while others support letting it expire. The revenue-sharing provisions of GOMESA have also generated debate, with some members seeking to raise the revenue cap and expand the qualified leases. There is a disagreement over whether the revenue should be shared with coastal states or used for broader federal purposes. The Gulf of Mexico has the most oil and gas development infrastructure on the U.S. outer continental shelf. BOEM estimated federal revenues from Gulf leases at $5.51 billion for FY2019. The Gulf of Mexico has the highest levels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources. The moratorium in the Eastern Gulf was imposed due to concerns of coastal states, fishing groups, and environmentalists. Before GOMESA, federal revenues from Gulf leases were not shared with coastal states. GOMESA was enacted to provide a share of revenues to the Gulf producing states. The moratorium on leasing in certain parts of the Gulf is set to expire in 2022. The Trump Administration has expressed interest in pursuing leasing in the expired moratorium area. BOEM's draft proposed five-year oil and gas leasing program for 2019-2024 includes lease sales in the moratorium area starting in 2023. The 116th Congress is debating whether to allow the moratorium to expire or to potentially further restrict oil and gas activity in the area. Legislative proposals have been introduced to extend the moratorium or permanently prohibit leasing in the area. Some bills also seek to amend the revenue-sharing provisions of GOMESA.", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a law aimed at providing relief to consumers, small businesses, and certain industries affected by the economic fallout of COVID-19. The law contains provisions that allocate funds for various entities, including rebate checks for taxpayers, loans for small businesses, protections for consumers with outstanding payments, and funds for federal, state, local, and tribal government programs. Title IV of the CARES Act focuses on stabilizing the economy and helping affected households and businesses. It includes provisions for financial assistance to the aviation sector and businesses critical to national security, as well as tax holidays and payroll grants for air carrier workers. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in providing liquidity to the financial system through programs and facilities established with funding from the CARES Act. The Treasury Secretary and the Fed have broad discretion in determining the terms and conditions associated with the assistance. The CARES Act also includes provisions for enhanced oversight of the funding programs.", "Following Richard Nixon's resignation as President, the Presidential Records Act (PRA) was enacted in 1978 to establish public ownership of records created by Presidents and their staff. The PRA ensures preservation and public availability of these records at the conclusion of a presidency. The PRA defines presidential records as documentary materials created or received by the President, his immediate staff, or units in the Executive Office of the President that relate to the President's duties. These records are considered permanent and must be preserved by the federal government. Personal records of the President, however, are excluded from preservation requirements. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for preserving and providing access to presidential records. During a presidency, the incumbent President has control over custody and access to the records, with NARA providing advice and assistance. After a presidency, the responsibility shifts to the Archivist, who must make the records publicly available as rapidly and completely as possible. Former Presidents must seek permission from the Archivist to display their records in a different facility, such as a presidential library. Access to presidential records is governed by the PRA and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), with restrictions on access gradually lifted over time. Former Presidents can restrict access to certain records for a maximum of 12 years.", "The child nutrition programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, provide meals and snacks to children in schools, child care, summer programs, and other institutional settings. The programs, which include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), and others, support both children's nutrition and U.S. agriculture. Funding for these programs is primarily through mandatory spending, with additional discretionary funding. Schools and institutions receive per-meal cash reimbursements and commodity assistance for meals served. Federal subsidies do not cover the full cost of meals, and schools may receive additional funds from participants, states, and local entities. NSLP and SBP provide meals in schools, with the largest subsidies for free and reduced-price meals. Schools have the option of providing afterschool snacks and summer meals through the programs. The school meals programs are administered by school food authorities and state departments of education, with guidance and oversight from the Food and Nutrition Service. Children must meet eligibility rules to receive free or reduced-price meals, and schools have the option to provide free meals to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision.", "The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) authorizes programs and activities to provide support to individuals pursuing postsecondary education and institutions of higher education (IHEs). The last comprehensive reauthorization of the HEA was in 2008, but many programs have continued with funding from various appropriations measures. The College Affordability Act (CAA) is a bill introduced during the 116th Congress that aims to comprehensively reauthorize most HEA programs and create new postsecondary education programs. It focuses on expanding financial aid availability, implementing borrower-focused student loan reforms, modifying institutional accountability requirements, revising public accountability and transparency requirements, expanding student services, providing support to IHEs, and creating new grant programs to reduce students' costs. Specifically, the bill aims to increase the maximum Pell Grant amount, expand eligibility to incarcerated students and graduate students, create a new category of \"Job Training Federal Pell Grants\" for shorter programs, and establish a new Direct Perkins Loan program. Additionally, the bill proposes changes to the formulas used for distributing funds under campus-based grant programs and increases the authorized appropriations level for each program. Overall, the bill encompasses various changes to enhance support for postsecondary education and improve affordability for students.", "The US farm sector is a diverse industry that includes various agricultural activities such as crop production, livestock and poultry products, fruits, vegetables, and other farm-related activities. The economic conditions and income in the farm sector can vary significantly across the country. The net farm income is an important indicator of the industry's well-being, and it is projected to rise by 10.2% in 2019 to $92.5 billion. This increase is mainly driven by government support, with direct government payments expected to represent 24.2% of net farm income. However, farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels, which may pose challenges for the sector. The US agricultural exports are also projected to decline in 2019, largely due to a decrease in sales to China as a result of the ongoing trade war. The corn and soybean markets have been affected by large domestic supplies and adverse weather conditions, while the livestock sector is experiencing growth in production and prices. Overall, the outlook for the farm sector is uncertain due to factors such as trade disputes, weather conditions, and market conditions.", "The American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 (H.R. 6) was passed by the House on June 4, 2019. Title I of the bill, also known as the Dream Act of 2019, aims to provide a pathway to lawful permanent immigration status for unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. This was the only successful vote on legislation to grant immigration relief to unauthorized childhood arrivals. The term \"unauthorized childhood arrivals\" refers to individuals who entered the US unlawfully as well as those who entered legally but lost legal status. Different bills have different criteria for determining eligibility for authorized childhood arrivals. This report provides a chronological overview of legislative proposals on unauthorized childhood arrivals, focusing on the 115th and 116th Congresses. It also discusses the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative and related data. The report highlights the relationship between legislative action on unauthorized childhood arrivals and developments related to the DACA initiative. The first legislation on unauthorized childhood arrivals dates back to 2001 with the introduction of the DREAM Act (S. 1291) in the 107th Congress. Although subsequent bills varied in their provisions, they came to be known as the \"Dream Act\" and the beneficiaries as \"Dreamers.\" The most common way for unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain lawful permanent resident (LPR) status is through family or employment ties, but entry into the US must have been lawful. Previous bills on unauthorized childhood arrivals have proposed a two-stage process for obtaining LPR status, with criteria such as continuous presence in the US, arrival before a certain age, and fulfillment of educational requirements. However, none of these bills have been enacted. In subsequent congresses, bills on unauthorized childhood arrivals were incorporated into larger immigration reform measures. In the 109th to 111th Congresses, several measures were considered, including the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611) in the 109th Congress. The DREAM Act provisions in this bill were similar to those in the stand-alone DREAM Act bill (S. 1545) in the 108th Congress. In the 110th Congress, there was a failed vote on comprehensive immigration reform (S. 1639) that included a DREAM Act subtitle. This bill required unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain temporary legal status before taking steps towards LPR status. The 111th Congress saw the House approving a DREAM Act amendment to an unrelated bill, but the Senate rejected it. The House-passed version of the DREAM Act would have established a three-stage process for obtaining LPR status. However, this amendment did not become law.", "Financial technology, or fintech, refers to the use of new technologies in the financial services sector. The term encompasses a broad range of innovations, including automated teller machines (ATMs) and mobile payments. Regulating fintech is complex due to the fragmented nature of the U.S. financial system. Different regulators have different mandates, resulting in gaps and overlaps in their jurisdictions. Regulators have used various policy tools, such as rulemaking and guidance, to regulate fintech activities. Banking regulators, in particular, have focused on overseeing the partnerships between banks and fintech companies, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. They have also explored the possibility of granting banking licenses to fintech companies, allowing them to operate under existing regulatory frameworks. Additionally, there have been discussions about implementing sandbox programs to facilitate innovation and experimentation in the fintech sector. The report also discusses efforts by the OCC and FDIC to consider charters for nonbank companies, as well as the FDIC's evaluation of granting deposit insurance to fintech firms. Overall, the report provides an overview of the regulatory landscape for fintech, highlighting the actions taken by various regulators to address the challenges and opportunities presented by fintech innovations.", "The United States and Russia signed the New START treaty in 2010, replacing the previous START treaty that expired in 2009. The treaty aimed to reduce strategic arms over a period of 7 years, and it will remain in force for a total of 10 years unless extended. Both countries completed their required reductions by 2018. The question of whether to extend the treaty has been a topic of discussion, with the Obama administration considering an extension before leaving office and President Trump reportedly rejecting a proposal to extend the treaty from Russian President Putin. The Trump administration is currently reviewing the treaty and its impact on US national security interests. There are concerns about emerging threats, such as Russia's development of new strategic offensive arms and its expansion of nonstrategic nuclear weapons that are not covered by the treaty. China's nuclear arsenal, which is not part of the treaty, is also a factor in discussions. Some experts suggest extending the treaty and using the time to negotiate the inclusion of new systems, while others believe an extension should only happen if Russia agrees to include these systems before the extension takes effect. Russia has raised concerns about US implementation of the treaty's conversion and elimination procedures and has indicated that it would insist on addressing US systems of concern as well. The New START treaty includes three central limits on US and Russian strategic offensive nuclear forces, including deployed launchers, deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, and deployed warheads. It also allows for the monitoring and verification of these forces. The treaty is seen as serving US national security interests, but there are concerns about new weapons that may be developed in the coming years. Discussions are ongoing about how to address these weapons and whether to extend the treaty beyond its expiration in 2021.", "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants the public the right to access federal agency information. FOIA was enacted in 1966 to address the limitations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which had broad exceptions to disclosure. FOIA establishes a three-part system of disclosure, requiring agencies to publish important information in the Federal Register, proactively disclose certain agency materials electronically, and disclose covered records upon request. FOIA contains nine exemptions that allow agencies to withhold information, as well as three exclusions for sensitive law enforcement records. Requesters can challenge agency decisions to withhold records in federal court. FOIA applies to federal agencies and their records, but not to Congress, federal courts, or territorial governments. Personal records of agency employees are excluded from disclosure. FOIA requires agencies to disclose records to \"any person\" who requests them, regardless of citizenship. FOIA's proactive disclosure provisions require agencies to publish important information in the Federal Register and provide electronic access to certain materials.", "In October 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative announced plans to enter into formal trade negotiations with the European Union (EU). The EU has expressed intent to exclude agriculture from the talks due to differences in regulations and protections. The U.S. has a growing trade deficit in agricultural products with the EU, and trade tensions between the two have escalated in recent years due to steel and aluminum tariffs and disputes over aircraft subsidies. Key issues in the negotiations involve reducing tariffs and addressing non-tariff barriers related to food safety, public health, and product naming schemes. The U.S. aims to address the trade deficit and harmonize regulatory processes and standards. The U.S. Congress has opposed excluding agriculture from the negotiations. While both sides have indicated a willingness to discuss sanitary and phytosanitary measures and regulatory barriers, there are disagreements on the scope of the talks. Further discussions are expected in spring 2020 to ease tensions and potentially include agricultural trade issues.", "This report provides an overview of federal funding provided to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between FY1995 and FY2021. It explains the funding sources for NIH, including discretionary spending funding from the annual appropriations process and mandatory funding for special programs. The report also describes the structure and mission of NIH, which is the primary federal agency for medical, health, and behavioral research. It highlights that the majority of NIH's budget supports extramural research through grants and contracts, while a smaller portion supports intramural research conducted by NIH scientists. The report also discusses the different funding mechanisms and transfer authorities that support NIH's budget. It provides details on the enacted FY2020 NIH program level and the emergency supplemental appropriations received due to the coronavirus pandemic. It discusses President Trump's FY2021 budget request and the proposed program level for NIH. The report concludes by outlining the program-specific funding provided for certain purposes within NIH accounts and provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations.", "This report summarizes the supplemental discretionary appropriations provided to programs and activities traditionally funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. LHHS has received roughly $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from four separate supplemental appropriations measures. The majority of funds have been appropriated to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) and are intended to support various activities including medical countermeasures, surge capacity, COVID-19 testing for the uninsured, and assistance to healthcare providers and facilities affected by the pandemic. The report provides a detailed breakdown of the funding allocated to each department or agency and the programs or activities within them.", "The United States has a significant backlog of employment-based immigrants, with Indian nationals making up the majority of those affected. The backlog exists because the annual number of foreign workers hired by U.S. employers exceeds the annual allocation of green cards. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets a worldwide limit of 140,000 employment-based green cards, split among five categories. Each country is subject to a 7% per-country ceiling. This has resulted in long wait times for Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationals. The backlog causes hardships for these individuals, such as limited job flexibility, travel restrictions, and the risk of aging out of legal status for their children. It also poses a disadvantage for U.S. employers competing for highly skilled workers. Proposed solutions include removing the per-country ceiling, as outlined in the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. Supporters argue that this change would create a more equitable system, while opponents contend that it would disadvantage immigrants from other countries. The report analyzes the potential impact of removing the per-country ceiling and presents legislative options for addressing the backlog.", "The World Trade Organization (WTO) requires member countries, including the United States, to apply tariffs and duties equally to all other members. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including remedies for unfair trade practices and sudden surges in imports. The most common remedy used by the US is antidumping (AD) laws, which provide relief to domestic industries that have been harmed by imports sold in the US at prices lower than fair value. Dumping occurs when manufacturers sell goods abroad for less than they sell them domestically. The practice of dumping has been around for centuries but gained more attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as industrialized countries used it as a strategy to maintain domestic prices while expanding into foreign markets. To prevent dumping, countries began enacting antidumping laws in the early 20th century. The US adopted its modern antidumping law in 1921, which became the basis for the WTO's Antidumping Agreement. Under US law, an antidumping duty is imposed if the Department of Commerce determines that imports are being sold at less than fair value and the US International Trade Commission determines that the domestic industry is being injured. The ITA initiates antidumping investigations and makes preliminary and final determinations, while the USITC investigates whether there is injury to the domestic industry. If both agencies make affirmative determinations, an antidumping duty is imposed and imports are suspended. The US also has a provision for \"critical circumstances,\" where additional retroactive duties can be imposed if imports surge. Additionally, the ITA can enter into suspension agreements with foreign exporters to eliminate the practice of selling at less than fair value.", "The first Morrill Act, passed in 1862, marked the beginning of federal support for post-secondary education in the United States, specifically for agriculture and the mechanical arts. The national system of land-grant colleges and universities has since developed, providing education, research, and extension services in every state. The scope and reach of the land-grant system have been expanded through later legislation, including the addition of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). Federal funding is provided through capacity and competitive grants administered by the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The land-grant system has focused on teaching, research, and extension, with multiple pieces of legislation adding to its original mission and funding structure. Notable legislation includes the Morrill Act of 1862, the Morrill Act of 1890, and the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994. Land-grant institutions conduct agricultural research through the Hatch Act of 1887 and the Evans-Allen Act of 1977, which provide capacity grants for research. The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act of 1962 supports forestry science research. The land-grant university system plays a significant role in advancing agricultural knowledge and serving the needs of farmers and the broader public.", "Under the Endangered Species Act, the US Fish and Wildlife Service determines which species to list as endangered or threatened. Once listed, these species are protected and the Services develop a recovery plan for them. The gray wolf is an example of a species that has been listed and delisted multiple times. The report discusses the legal issues that have arisen in relation to the gray wolf and how the Fish and Wildlife Service has addressed those issues. The report also provides an overview of the legal principles governing agency rulemaking under the Endangered Species Act and the process for listing, reclassifying, and delisting species.", "The 2018 farm bill, known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, continues to support agriculture-based renewable energy production in the United States. This support includes incentives, grants, loans, and tax credits for the production and use of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, as well as other forms of renewable energy such as wind and biomass. The bill aims to promote energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase domestic demand for farm products. The energy provisions in the farm bill build on previous legislation, including the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, and extend programs through FY2023. However, the 2018 farm bill provides less mandatory funding than previous versions, with an emphasis on discretionary funding. Overall, the bill aims to encourage the research, development, and use of renewable energy from agricultural sources, particularly second-generation biofuels.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) frequently operates under continuing resolutions (CRs) due to the frequent delays in the annual appropriations process. From 2010 to 2019, DOD spent over 39 months under a CR, compared to less than 9 months in the 8 years preceding 2010. CRs can have adverse effects on DOD's funding needs, as they restrict planned personnel actions, maintenance and training activities, and contracted support actions. As a result, DOD program managers and senior leaders plan in advance to minimize the impact of CRs. CRs typically contain limitations intended to allow for continuation of projects and activities with few departures from the previous year's funding allocations, but DOD's funding needs often change. CRs may also include anomalies, which provide additional authority or flexibility for specific activities, but their inclusion can reduce the incentive for Congress to reach a budget agreement. OMB issues directions to agencies on fund availability and budget execution after a CR is enacted. Agencies must deal with the disruptions and inefficiencies caused by CRs, including additional paperwork and complications in implementing funding restrictions. DOD faces unique challenges in providing the military forces needed to defend the country while operating under a CR.", "\"Big Four\" or \"Big Tech\" companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple - have made significant impacts in the internet economy and people's lives worldwide. They have collectively generated over $690 billion in revenue in 2018. However, these companies have faced scrutiny for privacy practices, dissemination of harmful content, alleged political bias, and potential anticompetitive conduct. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have divided responsibility for investigating these companies, with the DOJ focusing on Google and Apple, and the FTC on Facebook and Amazon. Congress has also shown interest in the antitrust issues surrounding these companies. Antitrust law aims to promote economic competition and prevent firms from having significant market power. Monopolization and mergers are key aspects of antitrust doctrine. To establish monopolization, plaintiffs must show that a firm possesses monopoly power and engages in exclusionary conduct to achieve or maintain that power. Market definition is a crucial element in antitrust cases, and the \"hypothetical monopolist\" test is commonly used to define markets. However, applying this test to zero-price markets, such as those in the technology industry, presents challenges. Some argue that zero-price markets should be exempt from antitrust scrutiny, while others maintain that antitrust law plays a role in these markets. There are debates about how to define the scope of zero-price markets, with suggestions to modify the SSNIP test or engage in qualitative assessments. Market share is another important factor in antitrust cases, but there is no fixed percentage that establishes monopoly power. Lower court decisions have indicated that a market share of less than 75% does not conclusively establish monopoly power.", "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of fluorinated compounds that have been used in many applications, including fire-fighting foams and the manufacturing of various commercial products. PFAS are persistent in the environment and studies have shown that exposure to high levels may have adverse health effects. There has been an increase in the detection of PFAS contamination in drinking water and the environment in recent years. The federal government has taken actions to address the risks of PFAS exposure under the Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. However, there have been calls for more federal action, including the establishment of enforceable drinking water standards and the designation of all PFAS as hazardous substances. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to address PFAS, some of which are included in the National Defense Authorization Act. The report highlights the chemical properties, uses, and risks of PFAS, as well as federal actions, relevant legislation, and ongoing challenges and uncertainties in regulating and evaluating the risks of PFAS.", "In January 2019, the House adopted a resolution adopting the rules of the House of Representatives for the 116th Congress. This report summarizes the amendments to the House rules that were made for the 116th Congress. The amendments affected various aspects of floor proceedings, voting, and procedures related to Delegates and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. Additionally, the amendments clarified that religious headdress may be worn in the House chamber at any time, and established a Consensus Calendar to provide an opportunity to vote on unreported, broadly supported legislation. The amendments also changed the rules regarding motions to discharge, private legislation, and the review period for legislative text. The Speaker was given more discretion to postpone votes, and the voting period was reduced to five minutes in certain cases. The amendments also expanded the categories of individuals allowed entrance to the Chamber when the House is in session, and reinstated the voting rights of Delegates and the Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole.", "The government's purchase card program was established in 1982 as a way to simplify procurement procedures and reduce administrative costs for small purchases. Under the program, nonprocurement staff can use purchase cards to make small-dollar transactions directly with local suppliers, bypassing procurement officers. The use of purchase cards grew slowly at first, but legislative and regulatory reforms in the 1990s, including the establishment of simplified acquisition thresholds, increased their use. Purchase card use has grown significantly over the years, with the dollar value of purchases increasing from $527 million in 1993 to $19.5 billion in 2011. The use of purchase cards now saves the government $1.7 billion annually in administrative costs. Each agency is responsible for establishing and maintaining its own purchase card program, with oversight from the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Weaknesses in the program include inadequate review and approval of cardholder transactions, lack of proper documentation, and failure to monitor and evaluate program effectiveness. These weaknesses have led to instances of fraudulent and abusive transactions. Efforts have been made to address these issues, including the establishment of internal controls and increased oversight.", "A summary of the text is as follows: The Senate considers hundreds of nominations each year and the confirmation process can be lengthy. A standing order of the Senate created a designation of certain nominations as \"privileged\" which are subject to special procedures. These privileged nominations are typically part-time appointments to oversight boards and advisory commissions. The process for privileged nominations involves committees obtaining background information from nominees before they can be considered by the full Senate. After this process, a privileged nomination can be moved to the Nominations section of the Executive Calendar where it is eligible to be considered by the full Senate. Senators can request that a privileged nomination be referred to its committee of jurisdiction if they have concerns over the nominee's qualifications or desire more time for meetings or a public hearing. The creation of privileged nominations and the special procedures applied to them were part of a larger effort to reform the confirmation process in the Senate.", "This report discusses selected ground electronic warfare (EW) systems and their role in modern warfare. It highlights the three main battlefield effects of ground EW systems, which include defeating improvised explosive devices (IED), countering unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and jamming enemy communications and radars. The report also addresses potential oversight issues for Congress, such as balancing EW programs and funding requirements, standardizing EW funding across different services, and integrating new technologies into EW operations. It also examines how major military powers like Russia and China are developing their own EW capabilities and the implications for the United States. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of EW in countering technological adversaries and the need for enhanced capabilities in the face of emerging threats.", "Legislative proposals have been introduced to create a national electricity portfolio standard, requiring utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electricity from specified sources. Currently, many states and territories have implemented mandatory portfolio standards, and some have voluntary versions. The terms \"renewable portfolio standard\" (RPS) and \"clean energy standard\" (CES) are commonly used, but they can have different meanings. Lawmakers have multiple goals for portfolio standards, including greenhouse gas reduction and job creation. The design of these standards can influence their effectiveness in achieving these goals. Other policies, such as tax incentives or funding for technology research, could also achieve similar goals. This report provides background on portfolio standards, explores policy design elements, and analyzes potential effects of these standards. It also discusses the changing landscape of the U.S. electricity generation profile and market trends. The report introduces key concepts, such as carve outs, multipliers, and credits, and examines their role in portfolio standard policymaking. It also discusses the interaction between portfolio standards and other state energy policies. While the report does not compare portfolio standards to other policy options or fully examine the costs and benefits of a national portfolio standard, it provides valuable information for policymakers in the 116th Congress.", "The Constitution gives Congress the power to control spending, and this is done through legislation that grants federal agencies the authority to spend money. This authority is known as \"budget authority\" and includes both newly enacted funds and unspent funds from previous years. There are two types of spending: discretionary spending, which is determined each fiscal year through appropriations bills, and mandatory spending, which is determined by multiyear laws. Sequestration is a budget mechanism that automatically cancels budgetary resources through across-the-board cuts to programs. It was created in 1985 and has been used to enforce various fiscal goals. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established caps on discretionary spending and created a Joint Committee to find additional savings. If the committee failed to find enough savings, automatic spending cuts would be triggered. These automatic cuts have been implemented and extended multiple times. The Office of Management and Budget calculates the reductions in both discretionary and mandatory spending based on statutory requirements. The reductions are split evenly between defense and nondefense spending and are applied through lowered spending caps for discretionary spending and across-the-board cuts for mandatory spending. The calculations for the reductions are complex and involve different steps depending on the category of spending. The Joint Committee sequester has been extended several times to offset increases in spending. Sequestration affects numerous programs, but many are exempt from the cuts. Medicare is the largest program subject to sequestration, but it has a special rule that limits the cuts to 2% of benefit payments.", "President Donald Trump declared in an Executive Order (E.O. 13767) that his administration's policy is to secure the southern border of the United States through the construction of a physical wall or barrier. The Trump Administration has consistently prioritized the deployment of fencing, walls, and other barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. In April 2018, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to coordinate action on securing the border and mobilize the National Guard. The Administration requested $5.7 billion for border wall construction, leading to a partial government shutdown. Unsatisfied with the agreement, President Trump declared a national state of emergency and redirected $6.1 billion in DOD funds for border barrier construction. DOD anticipated using 10 U.S.C. \u00a7284 to fund border barrier projects in early 2018 and created a new office to manage border-related issues. DHS formally requested DOD's support for barrier construction, and DOD approved funding for seven projects in 2019. In February 2020, DOD approved funding for 31 additional projects using emergency authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a72808. The deliberations for using this authority spanned eight months. DHS requested additional assistance, and DOD approved the construction of 38 new projects using military procurement funds. The construction projects have faced legal challenges, but work has resumed after a Supreme Court ruling. The funding for the projects has come from reprogrammed defense program savings and congressional special interest items.", "The growing technological needs of a mobile society have led to advancements in energy storage technologies. These advancements have expanded the applications of energy storage on the electric grid and in electric vehicles. Energy storage is being explored for its potential to provide benefits to the transmission grid, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congress has shown interest in energy storage through hearings and the introduction of multiple bills addressing various aspects of energy storage technologies and research. Electricity is currently produced as needed to meet demand, but energy storage can add flexibility and support peak loads on the grid. There are various means of reducing the need for large power plants, including end-use efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, and energy storage. While the capacity for energy storage on the grid is limited, improvements in technology and regulatory regimes are increasing applications and opportunities. Energy storage can take different forms, such as pumped storage, compressed air storage, cryogenic storage, flywheels, flow batteries, lead-acid batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. Battery storage technologies can help maintain balance and reliability on the grid, and provide ancillary services. The value of grid energy storage likely comes from supplying energy to the grid and providing ancillary services when available. The ability to recharge quickly and provide multiple services may impact the economics of an energy storage system. Energy storage can also support transmission and distribution systems by deferring upgrades, alleviating congestion, and enabling load shifting. Overall, energy storage technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we produce and use electricity.", "The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has projected a decline in coal production in the United States through 2050, with the steepest reduction expected in the mid-2020s. This decline has led to economic distress in coal-dependent communities, including higher unemployment and poverty rates. To address this issue, the Obama Administration launched the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Plus Plan, which aimed to provide funding for economic stabilization, social welfare efforts, and environmental initiatives in the coal sector. The POWER Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative, was created to implement the economic development elements of the plan, and is currently administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The ARC's POWER Initiative program is the largest of its kind and continues to receive consistent annual appropriations from Congress. Although certain elements of the POWER Plus Plan were not enacted by Congress, the ARC's program and other related initiatives have received funding and are actively working to address the economic dislocation caused by energy transition in coal communities. With the ongoing decline of the coal industry and the need to address greenhouse gas emissions, Congress is likely to show increased interest in programs like the POWER Initiative that assist affected communities.", "The current structure of congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) was established in the 1970s following investigations by the Church and Pike committees. Today, there are two congressional intelligence committees, the SSCI and the HPSCI, but oversight of intelligence is also conducted by ten other committees. The oversight by the Church and Pike committees focused on investigating past abuses and organizational reform within the IC. While congressional oversight has been beneficial in ensuring legal and ethical intelligence activities, it has also sometimes resulted in micromanagement and strained relationships with the IC. This report suggests a framework for congressional oversight using the existing committee structure and notification standards for covert action and clandestine intelligence collection. The framework would assess the premises justifying these activities, their impact on national security, operational viability, funding requirements, and potential consequences. Congressional oversight is crucial in checking the President's execution of intelligence policy and ensuring alignment with national security and foreign policy goals. However, Congress has faced challenges in improving oversight, such as the integration of military operations and intelligence activities, which has led to confusion over jurisdiction. Despite these challenges, congressional oversight remains important in ensuring ethical and legal intelligence programs. Oversight of covert action can be organized around five issue areas: statutory parameters, national security interests, foreign policy objectives, funding and implementation, and risk assessment. The same framework can be applied to oversight of clandestine intelligence activities. Oversight ensures that covert actions do not violate domestic or international law and are justified by their impact on national security. Congress can influence covert actions through its constitutional authorities to authorize war, legislate, and appropriate funds. Oversight also assesses the premises of a covert action, its consistency with American values, and its support of foreign policy objectives. Congress's oversight extends to reviewing the operational elements and funding of covert actions and assessing the risks involved. Additionally, Congress must be notified of any significant changes in a covert action. Overall, congressional oversight is important in providing checks and balances and ensuring the effectiveness, legality, and ethical conduct of intelligence activities.", "Congress is responsible for funding and overseeing the Army's activities, including its budget, posture, and modernization efforts. The Army's 2019 Modernization Strategy aims to transform the force to operate in multiple domains by 2035. Congress may consider an oversight architecture to evaluate the Army's modernization plan, ensuring its appropriateness, achievability, and affordability. The strategy should align with national security and military strategies, as well as counter the military capabilities and strategies of peer competitors. It should also address potential military challenges beyond great power competition. The Army's modernization strategy should complement those of the other services, and a joint warfighting concept is necessary for coordination. Congress may want to examine the relationship between the services' modernization strategies. The Army has identified 31 modernization initiatives to support its priorities, but the interdependencies among these initiatives should be considered to ensure the overall success of the modernization effort.", "The opioid epidemic in the United States has led to an increasing number of drug overdose deaths, with most involving opioids. Congress and the Administration have taken measures to address the issue through legislation, oversight, and funding. An opioid is a drug that binds to opioid receptors in the body and can be abused by being used in a way other than prescribed or without a prescription. In 2017, an estimated 11.4 million people misused opioids, including prescription pain relievers and heroin. Opioid abuse can lead to serious physical harm, including fatal and nonfatal overdoses. Synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl, are the main driver of overdose deaths. Addiction is also a significant harm associated with opioids. The availability and abuse of prescription opioids increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to a rise in heroin use as a cheaper alternative. The federal government has implemented various strategies to address prescription drug abuse and the subsequent rise in heroin use. Heroin supply shifted in the late 1990s, with white powder heroin dominating the market east of the Mississippi River and black tar and brown powder heroin dominating the market west of the Mississippi. Mexican-sourced heroin now dominates the U.S. market, and its availability has increased. Illicit nonpharmaceutical fentanyl, which is much more potent than heroin, has also become a significant concern. Illicit opioids come from both plant-based and synthetic sources. The majority of illicit opium poppy is grown in Afghanistan, while most heroin consumed in the United States is derived from illicit opium poppy crops cultivated in Mexico. Synthetic opioids are mostly foreign-sourced, with China being a major producer and exporter. Prescription opioids, both legitimate and counterfeit, can be sourced from various countries. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are the major suppliers of illegal drugs, including heroin and fentanyl, that are smuggled into the United States.", "The increasing complexity and automation of flight control systems pose challenges to aircraft certification and pilot training policies. Pilot confusion in the face of cockpit automation has been implicated in accidents and safety incidents. Inquiries into the design and certification of commercial airplanes have focused on standards and regulations for cockpit interfaces and pilot training, safety design of aircraft systems and sensors, and the certification process for new aircraft technologies. The grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft prompted discussions on aircraft certification and pilot training standards. While commercial airline safety has improved, challenges remain in systems design, human-interface design, pilot training, and certification processes. Aircraft flight systems incorporate advanced autopilot systems and flight controls that interface with computers. These systems enhance safety but can also lead to pilot confusion and errors. The most common causes of jet accidents are loss of control in flight, controlled flight into terrain, and runway excursions, which are often due to pilot performance and understanding of aircraft systems. Fly-by-wire technology offers advantages such as reduced weight, additional redundancies, and simplified pilot training. Flight control laws in fly-by-wire systems protect aircraft from operating outside safe parameters. Challenges in aviation safety remain in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region due to lax regulatory oversight and poor flight crew performance. The grounding of the worldwide fleet of Boeing 737 Max aircraft has raised questions about aircraft certification practices and highlighted the need for improvements in aircraft systems technology and flight deck automation.", "The Pendleton Act of 1883 was passed to ensure that government jobs were awarded based on merit rather than political connections. This ended the spoils system and allowed qualified individuals to be hired into federal service. The movement of employees between the public and private sectors, known as the revolving door, has advantages and disadvantages. It can provide valuable knowledge and relationships, but also presents potential conflicts of interest. Congress has passed laws regulating the revolving door in the executive branch, but there has been little data on the phenomenon. This report provides data on the movement of personnel in the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, with a focus on registered lobbyists. The report discusses existing revolving door laws and regulations, the advantages and disadvantages of the revolving door, and presents empirical data on its use. It also examines select issues for potential congressional consideration. Revolving door provisions include laws, regulations, and executive orders that govern the interaction between government and non-governmental individuals. Postemployment restrictions on former federal employees are the focus of current laws, which aim to prevent improper use of influence or government information. The regulations vary depending on the type of employment and the nature of the activities involved. Executive orders have been issued to further regulate the interactions between the public and the executive branch. The revolving door is a topic of debate, with some arguing that it improves the quality of candidates for government jobs and increases the knowledge base of both sectors. Critics, however, argue for longer cooling-off periods and stronger restrictions to prevent conflicts of interest. They believe the revolving door undermines the transparency and efficiency of government. Data on the revolving door have historically been difficult to compile, but recent efforts have been made to collect and analyze data on the movement of executive branch officials. The Plum Book, which lists federal civil service positions, was used as a source for the data collection.", "Tax policy can be used as a tool for disaster relief, with various provisions in place to provide tax relief and support recovery following disasters. These provisions include excluding certain disaster relief payments from taxable income, allowing deductions for casualty losses and deferring gain on involuntary conversions. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can also provide administrative relief in the form of deadline extensions and penalty waivers. Temporary tax relief measures have been enacted for specific disasters, such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Permanent tax relief provisions apply to any property damaged or destroyed by casualty or theft, with enhanced deductions available for federally declared disasters. The specific tax relief measures enacted for different disasters are summarized in tables provided in the report. Overall, tax policy plays a significant role in providing relief and support to individuals, businesses, and charitable organizations affected by disasters.", "Commercial truck driving is a dangerous occupation, with a high rate of fatalities and crashes involving trucks. Driver fatigue is a significant concern in the industry, and studies have estimated that up to 20% of crashes involve fatigued drivers. Congress has implemented regulations, known as the Hours of Service (HOS) rule, to limit the number of hours that commercial drivers can work. However, measuring and managing fatigue is challenging, as there is no convenient marker for fatigue. Lack of sleep, long work hours, and irregular schedules contribute to driver fatigue. Automated driver-assistance safety systems are being developed to help mitigate the risks associated with fatigue. Fatigue among truck drivers is a significant safety and health issue, and further research and measures are needed to address this problem effectively.", "Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides medical services to low-income individuals. It covers a diverse population including children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and those aged 65 and older. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state guidelines, with some variations across states. The program is particularly important for older adults and individuals with disabilities who are more likely to need long-term services and supports (LTSS) not covered by other insurance plans. Medicaid is the largest payer of LTSS in the US and accounts for a significant portion of Medicaid spending. In 2016, Medicaid provided health care services to about 71 million enrollees, with older adults and individuals with disabilities accounting for over half of all benefit spending. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by meeting specific criteria under different eligibility pathways. There are mandatory and optional eligibility groups, and states have some flexibility in determining eligibility criteria within federal guidelines. There are two main coverage groups for older adults and individuals with disabilities: Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-Related Pathways, which follow SSI program rules, and Other ABD Pathways, which have income and resource levels above SSI program rules. Medicaid eligibility is based on both categorical and financial criteria, with income and resource tests varying depending on the eligibility group. Medicaid eligibility for older adults and individuals with disabilities is largely determined by SSI program rules. Understanding SSI rules is important for understanding Medicaid eligibility. SSI is a federal program that provides cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and resources. Overall, Medicaid eligibility is complex and varies across states, but it plays a crucial role in providing health coverage for low-income individuals, especially those in need of long-term care.", "3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process used to create physical objects from digital design files. It has applications in various industries, including aerospace, medicine, defense, and education. 3D printers consist of input material, a print head, a build plate, axes, and a 3D design file. The prices and capabilities of 3D printers vary widely, with consumer printers typically using plastic and industrial printers offering a wider range of materials and applications. The technology has experienced three major periods of development since the 1980s, with the consumer 3D printing movement emerging in the early 2000s. While the industry showed signs of weakening in 2014, it has since rebounded with increased investment and falling prices. Quality control, cybersecurity, and production speed remain challenges for 3D printing, but research and development efforts are being made to address these limitations. The federal government has played a small but important role in the development of the technology through funding and support for research and development.", "India held its national elections in 2019, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning a sweeping victory under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This marked the first time in nearly 50 years that a party won consecutive majorities. The BJP's victory solidified Modi's position and empowered him domestically. The US has been seeking to expand its strategic partnership with India, particularly in defense and security cooperation. However, there have been frictions between the two countries over trade practices, religious freedom, and India's relations with Russia and Iran. India's economy, despite Modi's reputation as a reformer, has not seen major economic reforms, and there are hopes that the \"Modi 2.0\" government will focus on implementing necessary reforms. The election also saw an increase in female members in Parliament, but representation for marginalized groups, such as Muslims, remains low. Regional and caste-based parties continue to play a crucial role in Indian politics, although many of them faced setbacks in the 2019 elections. Overall, the election results are expected to bring continuity in Indian policies, and Modi's internationalist orientation may lead to increased engagement with major powers.", "Young people who have spent time in foster care as teenagers often face challenges during the transition to adulthood. Compared to their counterparts, they fare poorly in education, employment, and other outcomes. In response, federal policy has focused on supporting youth while they are in foster care and in early adulthood. This report provides background information on teens and young adults in and exiting from foster care, and the federal support available to them. It discusses the characteristics of youth who have had contact with the child welfare system, child welfare programs authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, and other federal programs that address older youth in foster care. The report also highlights the challenges faced by youth in foster care and those who age out of care, as well as the positive outcomes achieved by some former foster youth. It concludes by discussing the federal funding and requirements related to youth in foster care and those leaving foster care.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a range of benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, education, and more. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the VA has implemented various measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and provide care to veterans affected by COVID-19. This includes implementing mitigation strategies, testing and treating veterans with COVID-19, and implementing enhanced screening procedures at VA facilities. The VA has also taken steps to protect nursing home residents and spinal cord injury patients, and has provided guidance for grantees who administer programs for homeless veterans. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has closed its regional offices to the public but will continue to ensure the continuity of benefits. The pandemic may affect veterans' educational benefits, as some training and education programs may be disrupted or participants may receive a lower level of benefits. Overall, the VA is working to respond to the evolving pandemic and provide support to veterans during this time.", "This report provides background information on the Department of Defense's (DOD) legacy Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and reviews previous efforts to modernize these systems. It also describes DOD's process to acquire and implement a new EHR system called MHS Genesis. The report highlights potential issues for Congress, including oversight of a program that spans multiple federal departments, governance structure for the program, and monitoring cost and effectiveness. The report briefly mentions EHR modernization efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), as well as DOD's Joint Operational Medical Information System (JOMIS), but does not provide in-depth discussion of these programs. Appendix A provides a list of acronyms used throughout the report.", "The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) was passed to address environmental and public health concerns regarding uranium mill tailing sites. Title I of UMTRCA established a program for the remediation of inactive mill sites, with the federal government responsible for financing the process. Title II authorized federal agencies to regulate operating mill sites, with the operators responsible for site decommissioning. The Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management (DOE-LM) currently manages the long-term federal management of both Title I and Title II sites. The report provides the historical context, implementation status, and selected issues for Congress. UMTRCA does not cover uranium mining or waste disposal from mining. Uranium milling is the process of converting mined ore into uranium concentrate, while tailings are the waste material from milling operations. Public health and environmental concerns arise from exposures to radon gas, radiation, and the release of radioactive and non-radioactive material from tailings. The majority of domestic uranium concentrate production prior to 1971 supported nuclear weapons development, but production decreased significantly after 1978 due to factors such as a decline in nuclear power plant orders. The awareness of technical and regulatory challenges in decommissioning and managing tailings has increased over the years. UMTRCA has three titles, with Title I addressing remediation of inactive mill sites, Title II regulating operating mill sites, and Title III involving specific sites in New Mexico. The law provided definitions and terms related to processing sites, vicinity properties, residual radioactive material, tailings, and disposal sites. DOE's remedial actions aimed to permanently isolate residual radioactive material through the construction of engineered repositories. Cooperative agreements between DOE and states or tribes were established for remedial actions, with access and enforcement authority granted to DOE, NRC, and EPA. In cases where an alternative disposal site was necessary, states could purchase surface and subsurface rights and transport tailings to a different location. The management of the original processing site could then be returned to the state.", "Foreign nations have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products in response to U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese imports. China has been the primary target of these tariffs, leading to a decrease in U.S. agricultural exports to China. Other countries, such as Mexico, Canada, the EU, Turkey, and India, have also implemented retaliatory tariffs on specific U.S. agricultural products. The overall effect has been a decline in U.S. agricultural exports and an increase in imports from other countries. The long-term consequences include potential shifts in agricultural productivity and market access.", "Household debt among older Americans has increased significantly from 1989 to 2016. The proportion of households headed by individuals aged 65 and older with any debt increased from 37.8% to 61.1%, and the real median household debt among these households increased from $7,463 to $31,050. This increase in debt raises concerns about financial security in retirement for several reasons. First, the elderly population is growing, and many older Americans are not retiring debt-free. Second, older Americans rely on fixed incomes, such as Social Security, and increased debt payments may put them at a greater risk of financial insecurity. Third, higher levels of debt can lead to increased psychological stress and decreased physical health, which may be worse for older people. The report also analyzes how debt varies across different age groups and asset distributions, and the main types of debt include residential debt, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. The increase in debt primarily comes from mortgages, and credit card debt is the most common type of debt among older Americans. Measures of debt burden, such as the debt payment-to-income ratio and the debt-to-asset ratio, show that while debt is increasing for older households, they are still able to meet their debt obligations. However, the debt-to-asset ratio has grown faster for older households compared to younger households. Overall, the increase in household debt among older Americans raises concerns about their financial security in retirement.", "The Trump Administration proposed a FY2020 budget for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs that was 21% below the FY2019 enacted funding level. However, Congress enacted significantly more funding than requested, including emergency funds to address COVID-19. The final FY2020 budget included $57.21 billion for SFOPS accounts, with $8 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. The budget also included increases in funding for diplomatic programs, diplomatic security, and contributions to international organizations. The Administration requested a reduction in funding for the Department of State and Related Agency appropriations accounts, but Congress provided an increase. The FY2020 enacted budget also included provisions for personnel levels and emphasized the importance of sustaining the Foreign Service and Civil Service workforces.", "The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent federal agency established in 2002 to improve the administration of federal elections. It was created as part of Congress's response to administrative issues with the 2000 elections. The EAC's duties include administering federal funding for election improvements and collecting and sharing election administration information. The agency has limited power to compel action by states and localities, and its primary role is to provide support. The EAC conducts research, facilitates information exchanges, and oversees the development of voluntary voting system standards. It also provides guidance on meeting national election administration requirements. The EAC consists of a commission, staff, and advisory bodies, and its activities are overseen by congressional committees.", "The integration and utilization of staff within an organization can indicate its goals and priorities. In Congress, staff work in various roles and offices, supporting members in their legislative, administrative, and leadership responsibilities. As one Congress comes to a close and a new one begins, interest in staff issues may arise, particularly regarding committee funding and appropriations. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) offers several reports that provide information about staff roles, data on staff numbers, pay levels, and tenure in Member offices and committee settings in both the House and Senate. These reports can be accessed by congressional clients for additional information.", "President Trump and U.S. lawmakers are concerned about the U.S.'s reliance on critical mineral imports, particularly from China, and the vulnerability of supply chains for defense and electronics applications. The Chinese government's control over rare earth elements (REEs) in 2010 led to high prices and exposed the potential supply risks and vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain. Since then, legislators have introduced bills to address the supply risk and promote domestic rare earth mine development. However, it became clear that simply providing an alternative supply outside of China was not enough to secure the supply chain. The concern has also expanded to include other minor minerals and metals used in various applications. In December 2017, the Department of the Interior published a final list of 35 critical minerals. Various policy options have been proposed, such as streamlining the permitting process for mining projects and adding REEs to the National Defense Stockpile. The U.S. had previously relied heavily on imports for rare earth elements, with the only U.S. mine, owned by Molycorp, closing in 2002 due to competition with China and environmental issues. Molycorp reopened the mine in 2012, but due to falling prices and debt, filed for bankruptcy in 2015. In 2017, the mine was purchased by an American-led consortium with a Chinese-owned minority share. The report explores the process of drafting the critical minerals list, the reasons for classifying these minerals as critical, and the countries with the largest reserves. It also discusses supply chains for REEs and tantalum, and presents the statutory and regulatory framework for domestic mineral production. The report concludes by highlighting the importance of minerals for national security and defense and the history of the National Defense Stockpile.", "Relations between the United States and Russia have always been complex, but experts agree that Russia poses the only existential threat to the US through its nuclear weapons. While Russia's stockpile of nuclear weapons has decreased since the end of the Cold War, it still retains thousands of warheads capable of reaching US territory. The US has maintained a nuclear deterrent and signed arms control treaties to restrain and reduce nuclear weapons. However, the collapse of the INF Treaty and the expiration of New START in 2021 may signal the end of these restraints. The 2018 National Defense Strategy identifies Russia as a central challenge to US security and highlights its expanding and modernizing nuclear arsenal. Congress has expressed concerns about Russia's nuclear doctrine and modernization programs, questioning if they are fueling an arms race. This report provides information on Russia's nuclear doctrine, force structure, and modernization programs, aiming to inform the debate on US-Russia relations. The report also highlights how Soviet and Russian nuclear doctrine has evolved over time, with the Soviet Union valuing nuclear weapons for both political and military reasons, and Russia adjusting its doctrine to meet the changing circumstances.", "The American constitutional system of checks and balances and the separation of powers between the branches of government is designed to prevent any one person or group from gaining too much control. One important tool in this system is the presidential veto power, which allows the President to reject legislation passed by Congress. Presidents have used the veto power throughout history to block legislation and influence the legislative process. They may also use veto threats to deter Congress from passing bills they oppose. Formal Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) are often used to communicate the President's position on bills and may include veto threats. The decision to issue a veto threat may depend on factors such as the President's agenda, the level of support for the bill, and the political context. Presidents have three options when presented with legislation: sign it into law, take no action and allow it to become law after 10 days, or exercise the veto power. The President can veto a bill by returning it to Congress with objections, or use a pocket veto when Congress has adjourned. Congress has the power to override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers. In recent presidencies, veto threats have become more common, particularly in the second term of a President. Presidents may issue verbal veto threats during speeches or press conferences, or use written SAPs to communicate their positions on legislation. SAPs often indicate whether the President intends to veto a bill or if senior advisors recommend a veto. The proportion of SAPs containing veto threats has increased over time, reaching its highest point at the end of both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. The number of actual vetoes preceded by a veto threat has also increased. However, veto threats remain relatively rare, suggesting that they are used strategically by the President to send a message to Congress.", "Approximately 27 million trips are taken on public transportation on an average day, and federal assistance to public transportation is provided primarily through the public transportation program administered by the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The federal public transportation program was authorized from FY2016 through FY2020 as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94). Public transportation includes local buses, subways, commuter rail, paratransit, and ferryboats. Most federal funding for public transportation is authorized in multiyear surface transportation acts, with the FAST Act authorizing $61.1 billion for five fiscal years beginning in FY2016. The six major programs for public transportation authorized by the FAST Act are Urbanized Area Formula, State of Good Repair, Capital Investment Grants (CIG), Rural Area Formula, Bus and Bus Facilities, and Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The federal share of government spending on public transportation has been around 15% to 20% over the past 30 years. The solvency of the Highway Trust Fund is a major issue in reauthorization of funding for the public transportation program, as outlays from the mass transit account have outpaced receipts. Changes to federal loan programs, such as the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program and the Railroad Rehabilitation and Infrastructure Finance (RRIF) program, could be considered in reauthorization. The reauthorization legislation could also address issues related to the Credit Risk Premium and the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program.", "Paid family leave (PFL) refers to compensated time off from work for family caregiving needs. Currently, no federal law requires private-sector employers to provide paid leave, but some states have implemented family leave insurance (FLI) programs. These state programs provide cash benefits to eligible workers for specific caregiving activities. Several federal legislative proposals seek to expand access to paid family leave, including a tax credit for voluntary employer-provided PFL, a national wage insurance program, and the option for parents to receive Social Security benefits. Other proposals aim to provide tax advantages for individuals with caregiving responsibilities. Access to PFL varies among workers, with a higher prevalence among certain occupations, industries, and high-paying jobs. The need for paid family leave is evident, as many workers struggle to balance work and family responsibilities, and unpaid leave is often financially unfeasible. In countries around the world, many provide some form of paid parental leave, with variations in the number of weeks and wage replacement rates. The overarching goal of recent legislative activity in the United States has been to increase access to leave by reducing costs for both employers and workers. Various proposals, such as tax credits, a national insurance program, parental leave savings accounts, and tax-advantaged distributions, aim to achieve this goal.", "The report focuses on widows and Social Security policy, discussing both benefit adequacy and benefit equity in relation to Social Security benefits for widows. It highlights the concerns about the adequacy of benefits for widows, who may face reduced income and increased expenses after their spouse's death. The report also addresses benefit equity concerns, as current rules provide higher benefits to one-earner couples than to two-earner couples with the same earnings and contributions. It explores various policy levers that could be modified to aid widows, as well as legislative proposals and options that would indirectly benefit widows. The report provides information on current Social Security provisions related to widows, characteristics of widow beneficiaries, and the potential impact of proposed reforms on program solvency and distributional effects. It also discusses the challenges faced by widows, such as reduced income, increased expenses, and potential financial insecurity.", "Small businesses rely on loans for various purposes, such as purchasing inventory, covering cash flow shortages, and expanding operations. However, lending to small businesses declined during the Great Recession, and it is unclear whether lending has increased since then. The lack of comprehensive data on small business financing activities makes it difficult to draw conclusions about credit availability and costs. Congress is interested in small business credit access and whether market failures exist that impede access to credit. Market failures can occur when lenders are reluctant to lend to businesses with difficult-to-liquidate collateral or when loans do not generate sufficient returns to justify origination costs. Additionally, start-ups and businesses with niche products may face challenges in obtaining traditional small business loans. To address these market failures, Congress has implemented legislation and introduced bills that support lending to small businesses. However, assessing and quantifying market failures in the small business lending market remains challenging due to the lack of a consensus definition of a small business and limitations in data sources. Various types of lenders, including banks, credit unions, and nonbank fintech lenders, play a role in small business lending. Credit availability is often evaluated in terms of banking trends, but nonbank lenders have also become important sources of credit. Community banks, which historically have been a major source of funding for small businesses, are in decline, while larger banks are increasing their market share. Credit unions have limitations on their commercial lending activities, and nonbank fintech lenders are expanding their presence in the small business lending market. However, the increase in originations by fintech lenders does not necessarily indicate an increase in small business lending, as some fintechs sell their loans to third-party investors. Overall, the assessment of market failures in the small business lending market is complicated by various factors, including the lack of standardized definitions and data limitations.", "Congress plays a significant role in shaping outdoor recreation policies and programs in the United States. It supports legislation and oversight related to outdoor recreation resources and collaborates with agencies responsible for managing federal lands and waters. Congress recognizes the economic importance of outdoor recreation and has directed the Department of Commerce to analyze its impact on the U.S. economy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has developed the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) to measure the size and contributions of the outdoor recreation economy. According to the most recent ORSA statistics, the outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.2% of GDP in 2017, with supporting activities contributing approximately half of the value added. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy. The ORSA estimates that the outdoor recreation economy generated approximately 5.1 million jobs in 2017. These figures differ from estimates provided by other organizations such as the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA), which calculates consumer spending and tax revenue related to outdoor recreation. While the ORSA provides comprehensive and standardized data, it is not directly comparable to other measures due to variations in methodology and statistics reported. Overall, the ORSA and other reports both highlight the significant economic activity generated by outdoor recreation, particularly activities that involve expensive purchases and travel expenses. Participation in outdoor recreation has increased, with certain activities experiencing higher growth rates. Demographic factors, such as location and population size, influence outdoor recreation rates.", "The federal government provides support to the charitable sector through tax benefits, such as tax deductions for charitable contributions and exempting earnings on funds held by charitable organizations from federal income tax. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in some temporary changes that reduced the tax benefit for charitable giving, leading to a potential reduction in charitable donations. There were also other minor changes that either enhanced the charitable deduction or imposed more taxes on charitable organizations. Charitable organizations fall within the broader nonprofit sector, which includes various types of tax-exempt organizations. The majority of tax-exempt organizations fall under 501(c)(3) status, which includes religious, charitable, and similar organizations. These organizations can be classified as either public charities or private foundations. Public charities have broad public support and directly provide charitable services, while private foundations receive significant funding from a small number of donors and make grants to other organizations. In 2015, there were over a million registered 501(c)(3) public charities. These organizations are required to file annual financial reports, and their activities may also subject them to income tax, employment taxes, or other taxes. The primary tax benefit for charities is the charitable deduction, which allows individuals and corporations to deduct qualifying charitable contributions. There are limits and rules regarding the deduction, such as percentage limits based on adjusted gross income and different valuation methods for different types of donations. The 2017 tax revision reduced the number of itemizers, which affected the incentive to give to charity for many taxpayers. The tax expenditure associated with the charitable deduction has decreased in recent years due to fewer itemizers and lower tax rates. Most of the forgone revenue comes from individual giving rather than corporate giving. Charities also benefit from the exemption of investment income from tax. In 2015, charities had significant investment income, and if it had been subject to tax, the revenue would have been $26.7 billion. Charities held trillions of dollars in assets, with a significant portion in university endowments.", "This report provides an overview of financial inclusion in the United States, focusing on access to bank and payment accounts, inclusion in the credit reporting system, and access to affordable short-term credit. While most Americans have access to financial services and credit products, some populations, such as younger adults, low-income individuals, and those with imperfect credit histories, face barriers in gaining access to these services. These barriers can make managing their financial lives difficult and expensive. The report highlights the importance of financial inclusion in helping individuals avoid financial hardship and achieve financial well-being. It discusses the impact of factors such as money management, access to bank accounts, and inclusion in credit bureaus on financial well-being. It also addresses the challenges faced by unbanked and underbanked households, including high fees, bank closures in certain communities, and reliance on nonbank alternative financial products. The report concludes by exploring the potential of nonbank private-sector innovation to provide more affordable financial products to unbanked and underbanked consumers.", "The rapid growth of digital technologies has created both opportunities and challenges in international trade. The digital economy accounted for a significant portion of U.S. GDP and employment in 2017, and has been a focus of interest for Congress. The rules governing digital trade are evolving as governments experiment with different approaches and priorities. Barriers to digital trade, such as intellectual property rights infringement, often span multiple sectors. Concerns over data privacy and cybertheft have raised interest in promoting or restricting cross-border data flows. Trade negotiators are working to address digital issues in agreements such as the proposed US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Digitization has had a significant impact on the global economy, enabling the creation of new goods and services and increasing efficiency in trade. The internet and digital technologies have transformed businesses and allowed for increased international trade. However, the impact of digitization is not yet fully understood, and there are both positive and negative effects. The benefits of digitization are not limited to specific geographic areas, and businesses and communities in every state feel the impact. Digitization has allowed small and medium-sized enterprises to access the same resources as larger firms, enabling them to grow and participate in global markets. However, there are also costs and obstacles associated with digital trade, and government policies can influence these factors. Overall, digitization has the potential for significant economic growth, but it must be carefully managed to ensure widespread benefits and address any negative consequences.", "The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a new outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in August 2018, following the end of a separate outbreak in the west of the country. The current outbreak is the 10th on record in the DRC and the second largest ever. Cases have been concentrated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where ongoing conflicts have complicated efforts to control the spread of the virus. The number of new cases per week has been declining but remains a concern due to various factors including low awareness, community distrust, and security challenges. The outbreak has coincided with a political transition process in the DRC, which has led to tensions and hindered the Ebola response. Concerns have been raised about cases in major cities and neighboring countries. Efforts to control the outbreak are being carried out by the DRC government, international organizations, and foreign governments, but there have been concerns about coordination, funding, and security issues. The World Bank has provided significant funding to support the response efforts. The United States is the top country donor and has provided funding for various activities such as disease surveillance, infection prevention, and humanitarian coordination. The response efforts have been led by Congolese health workers and supported by international experts.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers various programs to support small businesses, including loan programs, training programs, and contracting programs. Congressional interest in the SBA's programs has increased due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act made significant changes to SBA programs, including the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The SBA has approved millions of PPP loans since its inception. The SBA also offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) to small businesses affected by disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA has disbursed billions of dollars in EIDL loans to date. There are ongoing concerns about the SBA's ability to meet the high demand for loans and process applications in a timely manner. Congress may explore options to expedite loan processing and provide additional support to small businesses.", "The federal law known as the flag code provides guidelines for the appearance and display of the U.S. flag, as well as the proper conduct during the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem. However, these guidelines mostly lack enforcement mechanisms and are considered declaratory and advisory. State laws that aim to punish flag disrespect have been struck down under First Amendment free speech principles. While there are penalties for physical mistreatment of the flag, such laws generally violate the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled against flag-misuse laws, including those that criminalize flag desecration, on the basis of free speech. Guidelines in the flag code cover various aspects of flag appearance and display, such as the number of stripes, how to display the flag at half-staff, and when and where the flag should be displayed. The President has the authority to modify the flag display requirements. The Supreme Court has also addressed cases involving flag burning as a form of expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. The Court has consistently held that laws prohibiting flag desecration violate free speech rights. Some states have implemented flag-misuse laws that also ban using the flag for advertising purposes, but it is unclear whether these laws violate the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. Court decisions regarding the use of flags in advertising have not directly addressed whether it qualifies as commercial speech or expressive conduct. It is possible that restrictions on using the flag for advertising would be seen as a violation of free speech rights. There have also been challenges to teacher-led recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance on the grounds of violating the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. These challenges have focused on the inclusion of the phrase \"one Nation under God\" in the Pledge. Some federal courts have considered these challenges, but there is no clear consensus on whether the recitation of the Pledge in public schools is constitutional.", "Under the U.S. Constitution, the House has the responsibility of impeaching a federal officer, while the Senate has the responsibility of conducting a trial and potentially convicting the officer. The Senate does not initiate impeachment proceedings, but acts after the House has charged an officer with wrongdoing. The Constitution sets requirements for an impeachment trial in the Senate, including needing the support of two-thirds of Senators present to convict and punishments that can only extend to removal from office and disqualification from future office. The Chief Justice presides over a presidential impeachment trial. The Senate has the power to determine its own trial procedures, and has established unique procedures for each trial. In the past, trial committees were established for federal judge impeachments, but not for presidential impeachments. The Senate has adopted impeachment rules in 1868 and made minor changes in 1935 and 1986. The impeachment rules lay out the steps for organizing a trial, including the presentation of the articles of impeachment, the swearing in of the presiding officer and Senators, and the administration of the oath. The rules also provide guidelines for the receipt and presentation of evidence, as well as the process for debates, voting, and final conviction.", "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its conservation programs. The bill for FY2020 includes an increase in funding for discretionary conservation programs, despite the administration's request for decreased funding. The bill also provides funding for technical assistance, watershed programs, and conservation operations. The FY2020 appropriation does not reduce mandatory farm bill conservation programs and does not eliminate the Conservation Stewardship Program. The bill also directs funding to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and includes policy provisions related to conservation.", "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states to help them provide benefits and services to families in need. It was created in 1996 and has been funded through a series of extensions. TANF funds can be used in various ways to assist families, such as providing cash assistance or vouchers for basic needs. The amount of assistance and eligibility criteria vary by state. The funding for TANF has not been adjusted for inflation or changes in the poverty population, resulting in a decline in its value over time. The main issues facing TANF in Congress revolve around whether states are addressing the original concerns of the program and how funds are being used. Various legislation has been introduced to address TANF funding levels and distribution. Overall, TANF is a broad-purpose block grant that gives states flexibility in how they use the funds to assist families in need.", "The federal intergovernmental system of governance in the US has become more centralized and coercive over the years, with the federal government using grants, mandates, and preemption of state authority to expand its influence in various policy areas. In FY2019, the federal government is expected to provide state and local governments about $750 billion in grants, accounting for about one-third of total state government funding. Congress plays a central role in determining the scope and nature of federal grant programs, considering both internal factors (such as party leadership, congressional procedures, and individual preferences) and external factors (voter constituencies, interest groups, the President, executive branch officials, and Supreme Court rulings). The evolving cultural norms and expectations concerning government's role in society also influence decisions on federal grants. The report also discusses different types of federal grants such as categorical grants, block grants, and general revenue sharing, and provides data on outlays for federal grants to state and local governments. However, there is no recent authoritative count of funded federal grants to state and local governments.", "Mozambique, a country in southeastern Africa, is facing political, economic, and security challenges. The dominant political party, FRELIMO, has held power since independence in 1975 and recent political tensions between FRELIMO and the opposition party, RENAMO, have led to violence. Mozambique has experienced economic growth in recent years, fueled by foreign investment and the discovery of natural gas reserves, but there are concerns about corruption and inequality. The country is also facing security challenges, including an insurgency by armed extremists in the north. Mozambique has a positive relationship with the United States and receives significant U.S. aid, but recent developments in the country may draw increased attention from Congress, including issues related to corruption, energy sector investment, counterterrorism, and recovery from recent cyclones.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers loan programs to support small businesses. One of these programs is the 504 Certified Development Company (CDC) loan guaranty program, which provides long-term fixed rate financing for major assets. The program is administered through nonprofit CDCs, and requires a third-party lender to provide at least 50% of the financing, the CDC to provide up to 40% of the financing with a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture, and the borrower to provide at least 10% of the financing. The borrower makes loan payments to both the third-party lender and the CDC. The SBA's debenture is sold to underwriters, and investors purchase interests in the debenture pools. In FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans totaling nearly $4.8 billion. The program has been expanded and modified through various congressional actions. The report also discusses eligibility standards for borrowers and lenders, program requirements, and issues concerning the SBA's administration of the program.", "The United States has been actively pursuing the development of hypersonic weapons since the early 2000s, with a focus on hypersonic glide vehicles and cruise missiles. Both the Pentagon and Congress have shown a growing interest in hypersonic systems due to the increased focus on the strategic threat posed by hypersonic flight from Russia and China. Open-source reporting indicates that both China and Russia have conducted successful tests of hypersonic glide vehicles, with operational capability expected as early as 2020. The United States is unlikely to field an operational system before 2023. The United States is not currently developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead, unlike China and Russia. This means that U.S. hypersonic weapons will require greater accuracy and be more technically challenging to develop. The Department of Defense is working on several hypersonic weapons programs, including the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike program, the Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon program, and various programs under DARPA. The United States is also investing in counter-hypersonic weapons capabilities, but defensive capability is not expected until the mid-2020s at the earliest.", "Legislators and regulators are concerned about the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs prescribed for \"off-label uses\". Two recent incidents raised concerns about the lack of FDA review and oversight in off-label use. In one incident, safety experts expressed concerns about the off-label use of ketamine to treat depression and migraines, without FDA review of clinical data. In another incident, Astra Zeneca settled a case involving the off-label promotion of Seroquel for use in children, despite FDA approval for adult use only. Off-label use is when a physician prescribes a drug for purposes other than those specified in the FDA approval and labeling. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of prescriptions are written for off-label uses, with some backed by strong scientific support. Off-label use can offer benefits to patients when other treatments have failed or when drugs approved for one condition are used to treat another condition. However, off-label use also comes with risks and uncertainties, as the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the off-label use may not have been evaluated through clinical trials. Congress has given FDA the authority to regulate the approval and labeling of drugs to protect patients and encourage research. FDA-approved labeling is a primary source of prescribing information for clinicians and plays a role in reimbursement decisions by payors. Off-label use may arise from the need to treat rare diseases or the lack of clinical trials for small patient groups. However, there are concerns about the lack of evidence and data for off-label use, as well as the potential for harm. FDA has issued guidances on off-label use and communications, but there are ongoing debates about the balance between providing information and protecting patient safety. Congress has taken various actions to address drug labeling and reduce risks to patients, such as expanding the information provided in a drug's labeling. There have been bills introduced to expand the information manufacturers can provide about off-label uses, but there are differing views on the potential impact on FDA's approval process and enforcement efforts. Off-label use presents both opportunities and risks, and there are ongoing discussions about how to best regulate and oversee off-label prescribing.", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a government program in the United States that provides flood insurance coverage for residential properties. It collects billions of dollars in premiums and provides coverage for trillions of dollars. The NFIP was established in 1968 to offer primary flood insurance and reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards. The program is planning to introduce Risk Rating 2.0, which will change how flood insurance premiums are calculated. Currently, premiums are based on flood zone, occupancy type, elevation, and other factors. Risk Rating 2.0 will use more variables and incorporate a broader range of flood frequencies and sources. It will also use commercial catastrophe models to estimate future loss potential.", "Solar energy can be converted into electricity through the use of solar photovoltaic cells or by concentrating solar energy to produce heat. Silicon is the most commonly used material for PV cells, but research is ongoing to find more efficient and cost-effective materials. PV cells are manufactured into modules, which are then assembled into arrays. PV systems can be categorized based on capacity and ownership model, with utility-scale systems being the largest and often owned by utilities or independent power producers. The cost of solar PV systems varies depending on size, with larger systems generally being cheaper on a per-unit basis. PV system costs have declined in recent years, but can vary across the United States due to local circumstances. Solar energy accounts for a small but growing percentage of total U.S. electricity generation, with most of it coming from PV systems. The lifetime costs of solar energy systems have historically been higher than other sources, but this is changing in many parts of the country. Solar energy can have both positive and negative impacts on electricity bills and rates. It can reduce overall electricity costs by displacing more expensive sources, but it can also result in higher bills if there are additional costs for transmission lines or distribution system upgrades. Solar energy has some reliability concerns due to its variable nature and the mismatch between peak generation and peak demand. However, these concerns can be addressed through the use of other energy sources, load shifting, and the deployment of flexible resources like energy storage.", "The joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides unemployment benefits to eligible individuals who become involuntarily unemployed. Federal laws provide guidelines on UC benefit coverage, eligibility, and benefit determination, but state laws determine the specific parameters, resulting in essentially 53 different UC programs. The main objectives of UC are to offer income maintenance during periods of unemployment, help stabilize the economy, and prevent skill loss and labor standards breakdown. Individuals who receive UC are required to register with the Employment Service and be able, available, and searching for suitable work. Federal law allows states to disqualify individuals for UC benefits if they lost their job due to illegal drug use. In 2012, federal law also allowed states to drug test UC applicants in occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. However, this rule was repealed in 2017. On October 4, 2019, a new final rule was issued that allows states to drug test UC applicants in occupations listed in the rule. The issue of UC drug testing is viewed in the context of larger trends of drug testing individuals receiving public assistance benefits and congressional interest in UC program integrity. UC eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment over a 12-month period prior to unemployment, and claimants must be able, available, and actively searching for work. States may disqualify claimants for various reasons, including illegal drug use. The recent developments in UC drug testing include legislative and regulatory changes that expanded states' authority to drug test UC applicants and beneficiaries. Some stakeholders argue for expanded drug testing, while others raise concerns about its necessity and potential negative effects. The recent final rule allows states to drug test UC applicants in certain occupations.", "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for both military and civil works activities. Congress directs USACE's civil works activities through annual appropriations. The majority of USACE's funding is used for water resource projects, such as maintaining navigable channels and reducing flood and storm damage. From FY2010 to FY2020, Congress provided USACE with appropriations ranging from $4.72 billion to $7.65 billion. Unlike other infrastructure funding, the majority of USACE's funding is not distributed through formulas or grant programs. Instead, it is used for the planning, construction, and operation of water resource projects. USACE also receives emergency supplemental appropriations for flood recovery and repair. Most USACE projects require a nonfederal sponsor to share project costs, and many authorized projects have not been funded. The appropriations process involves the President's budget request, congressional deliberation and enactment of appropriations, and the development of a USACE work plan. Congress often provides more funding than requested by the President, and appropriations reports identify specific projects to receive funds. Congress has provided additional funding for specific categories of work within USACE budget accounts. The work plan specifies how funds will be allocated at the project level. Funding for USACE's navigation projects has increased in recent years, while funding for environmental restoration has decreased. The agency has a construction backlog of $96 billion, including authorized but unfunded projects and rehabilitation and repair work. Congress may need to address the shift to Administration-developed work plans, the construction backlog, and funding priorities for USACE.", "The federal tax treatment of families is influenced by several key elements of the income tax code, including deductions, marginal tax rates, tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax. The 2017 tax revision made significant changes to these provisions, such as increasing the standard deduction and child tax credit, while eliminating personal exemptions. The revision also reduced tax rates and adjusted the alternative minimum tax. These changes have varying effects on the tax burdens for different types of families. Overall, the new tax code is less progressive and is expected to increase the relative tax burden on low-income families over time.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals who are arrested for immigration violations. The purpose is to ensure their presence at removal hearings and to protect the community during the removal process. Detention rules vary based on different factors such as the alien's entry status, criminal offenses, and removal status. In some cases, detention is discretionary and the alien may be released on bond or recognizance. However, for certain crimes, there are limited circumstances for release. The report discusses the legal framework for immigration detention, including constitutional constraints and judicial restrictions. The report also provides an overview of the history of immigration detention laws and the current statutory framework governing detention. The main detention statutes are INA Section 236(a), which allows discretionary detention during removal proceedings; INA Section 236(c), which requires detention for certain criminal offenses; INA Section 235(b), which requires detention of applicants for admission; and INA Section 241(a), which mandates detention for a 90-day period after removal proceedings. The report also includes information on alternative forms of detention and the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administering detention.", "Federal rulemaking is a critical method for establishing and implementing public policy in the United States. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 is the primary control mechanism for agencies to issue regulations, requiring them to issue proposed rules and allow public comment before issuing final rules. The APA also includes a petition mechanism that allows interested parties to request agencies to issue, amend, or repeal rules. Although agencies are not required to grant these petitions, they are required to respond in a reasonable time. The petition mechanism is a potentially efficient means for individuals to call on agencies to take action. The petition mechanism is rooted in the constitutional right to petition the government, which is traced back to the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. The APA's petition mechanism serves as a modern application of this constitutional right. Section 553(e) of the APA grants interested persons the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and agencies are required to establish procedures for receiving, considering, and responding to petitions. The scope of agency actions covered by the petition mechanism is wide-ranging, and agencies have discretion in determining their procedures. Agencies must consider petitions in a timely manner but have flexibility in how they respond. The APA does not specify the content or format of a response to a petition, but agencies are required to provide a reason if a petition is denied. Overall, the petition mechanism allows individuals to directly address grievances to government agencies and potentially influence policy outcomes.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has implemented the Caregiver Support Program to provide support to the caregivers of seriously disabled veterans. This program was established in response to the growing number of veterans returning from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq with complex medical and mental health needs. The program consists of two components, the Program of General Caregiver Support Services and the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. The general caregivers program provides basic support and training to caregivers of veterans from all eras enrolled in VA healthcare, while the family caregivers program offers comprehensive supports such as healthcare benefits and a monthly stipend to caregivers of veterans who were seriously injured in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001. The family caregivers program has recently been expanded under the VA MISSION Act to include caregivers of veterans from all eras, with eligibility being phased in based on the date of the veteran's injury. The caregiver designation is determined based on both the veteran's eligibility and the caregiver's eligibility for either program. The general caregivers program does not require an application or clinical evaluation, while the family caregivers program requires an eligibility determination process. Qualified caregivers must meet certain criteria such as being at least 18 years old, being a family member or living with the veteran, and providing personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months due to the veteran's inability to perform certain activities of daily living or the need for supervision or protection. Once approved, caregivers are provided with various benefits and services.", "This report summarizes selected major trade issues for U.S. agriculture that may be of interest in the second session of the 116th Congress. It provides background information on each trade issue and assesses its current status. The report covers topics such as the importance of U.S. agricultural trade, the Trump Administration's trade policy, ongoing and proposed new trade negotiations, and World Trade Organization agricultural issues. It also discusses trade concerns related to non-tariff measures, trade barriers, and disputes involving specialty crops, livestock, and dairy. Additionally, the report provides information on U.S. agricultural exports and imports, the impact of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, and recent trade agreements with Canada, Japan, and China.", "The Constitution's Supremacy Clause establishes the principle of federal preemption, which means that federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws. This doctrine of federal preemption is widely used in regulating various industries such as drugs, banking, securities, and transportation. There are debates surrounding federal preemption, with proponents arguing for uniform national regulations and opponents emphasizing the importance of state regulation and common law. The Supreme Court has identified different ways in which federal law can preempt state law, including express preemption (when a federal statute explicitly displaces state law) and implied preemption (when federal law's structure and purpose imply preemptive intent). Implied preemption can further be divided into field preemption (when federal regulation precludes state regulation within a field) and conflict preemption (when compliance with both federal and state regulations is impossible or when state law obstructs federal objectives). The Court has also explained that the presence of an express preemption clause in a federal statute does not preclude implied preemption analysis. Congressional intent is crucial in determining preemption, and the Court has used both textualist and purposive approaches in interpreting federal statutes with preemption clauses. The Court has applied the presumption against preemption, but its application has varied, and there are exceptions to the presumption. The Court has also provided interpretations of common phrases used in preemption clauses, such as \"related to,\" \"covered,\" \"in addition to, or different than,\" and \"requirements.\" It has identified two categories of state laws that are preempted by ERISA's \"related to\" preemption clause: state laws with a \"connection with\" regulated employee benefit plans and state laws that contain a \"reference to\" such plans. Similar interpretations have been made regarding the \"related to\" preemption clauses in the Airline Deregulation Act and the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a mission to improve the health and well-being of Americans and advance medical and social sciences. HHS is made up of 11 main agencies, including the U.S. Public Health Service and agencies focused on human services. HHS has a budget of $1.370 trillion for FY2021, with the majority of the funding going towards mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Discretionary spending makes up a smaller portion of the budget and primarily supports program operations and administrative activities. The budget request includes proposed changes to spending levels and programs, but Congress ultimately decides on the final budget. Each operating division of HHS has its own mission and budget request, with agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration playing significant roles in public health and healthcare.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is an annual bill that authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) and defense-related programs. It establishes defense policies and restrictions, and addresses administrative matters related to DOD. The bill also governs military compensation, the DOD's acquisition process, and aspects of policy towards other countries. Although the NDAA does not provide budget authority, it serves as an indicator of congressional sentiment on funding for specific programs. The FY2019 NDAA authorized $708.1 billion for defense programs, which was approximately the same amount as the President's request. The bill included funding for DOD activities such as procurement, research and development, operation and maintenance, military personnel, military construction, atomic energy defense programs, and other defense-related activities. The NDAA reflects a debate about the size of the defense budget and the strategic and budgetary issues facing the United States. The bill was shaped by the efforts of the DOD to align its priorities with the National Defense Strategy and to conform to discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act. The President's FY2019 budget request included $726.8 billion for national defense, with $708.1 billion subject to authorization by the NDAA. The request was consistent with discretionary spending limits and included funding for the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The NDAA also addressed the issue of controlling federal spending amid rising debt, with mandatory spending projected to increase at a faster rate than discretionary spending. The bill aimed to maintain the U.S. competitive advantage against strategic competitors such as China and Russia and emphasized rebuilding military readiness, strengthening alliances, and reforming the DOD's business practices. The NDAA was enacted into law on August 13, 2018, after passing both the House and Senate.", "The detection of certain PFAS in public water supplies has raised concerns and led to increased attention from Congress and the EPA. While the EPA has not issued regulations for PFAS, they have taken actions to address contamination. Some key actions include issuing non-enforceable health advisories for two PFAS, conducting additional monitoring, and establishing a grant program for addressing PFAS contamination. In Congress, several bills have been introduced to address PFAS, including directing the EPA to regulate PFAS in drinking water. PFAS are a diverse group of compounds used in many commercial and industrial applications. The two most frequently detected PFAS in water supplies are PFOA and PFOS. Contamination is typically localized and associated with specific facilities. Exposure to PFAS may pose various health risks, including developmental effects and increased cancer risk. The absence of federal drinking water standards for PFAS has created challenges for states, communities, and water suppliers. The EPA has several authorities under the Safe Drinking Water Act to address emerging contaminants, including issuing health advisories and regulating contaminants. The EPA has been evaluating PFAS for potential regulation for over a decade but has not yet promulgated regulations. The agency has taken various actions, such as research and development of analytical methods and conducting studies on treatment effectiveness and costs. The challenges of regulating PFAS in drinking water include technical issues, scientific questions about health effects, and policy considerations. The EPA's ongoing and proposed actions to address PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act are outlined in this report, as well as PFAS-related legislation introduced in Congress. The report does not discuss scientific research on health effects or federal actions under other environmental statutes.", "The United States is currently experiencing the longest economic expansion in its history. However, some economists are uncertain about how long this expansion will continue, as economic expansions inevitably give way to slowdowns and recessions. Countercyclical fiscal policy, which involves tax and spending adjustments to stimulate consumer and business demand, may help stabilize the economy during a recession. Effective countercyclical fiscal policy is timely, targeted, and temporary. Options that Congress may consider in response to a recession include tax reductions for lower-income households, business tax reductions, direct spending increases, and assistance to state and local governments. These options have different impacts on the economy, with tax reductions for lower-income households and direct spending increases having the largest stimulative effects. However, it is important to note that estimating the exact impact of specific fiscal policies is difficult and subject to uncertainty. Automatic stabilizers, such as the progressive structure of the income tax system and Unemployment Compensation benefits, can also help stabilize the economy during a recession. However, they may not provide enough stimulus in severe or prolonged downturns, in which case discretionary changes or additional fiscal tools may be necessary.", "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes three federal student loan programs: the Direct Loan program, the FFEL program, and the Perkins Loan program. As of December 31, 2019, $1.5 trillion in loans remained outstanding, with most of it being in the Direct Loan program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various actions have been taken to provide relief to student loan borrowers. This includes offering periods of deferment and forbearance, income-driven repayment plans, and recent measures such as canceling loans for students who withdrew due to COVID-19 and temporarily setting interest rates to 0%. The report provides an overview of these repayment options and relief provisions. It also discusses procedures for returning or repaying loans when a student does not begin attendance at an institution or withdraws. Additionally, it outlines waivers and flexibilities granted by the CARES Act regarding the Return of Title IV Aid procedures and the Direct Subsidized Loan maximum eligibility period. Overall, the report highlights the various options available to borrowers facing financial difficulties due to the pandemic.", "In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, Congress and the President enacted the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020. The act provides emergency supplemental appropriations to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the outbreak. The funding is designated as an emergency requirement and is primarily intended to aid in the domestic public health response. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) receives the majority of the funding, with $6.5 billion allocated to health emergency response activities related to COVID-19. The funds support various activities such as development of medical countermeasures, surveillance, laboratory capacity, and infection control. The act also allocates $20 million to the Small Business Administration for administrative expenses to carry out the SBA Disaster Loan Program. The total amount of supplemental appropriations provided in Division A is $7.767 billion.", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced that it will only accept mailed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has adopted a policy of only accepting electronic FOIA requests. This highlights differing policies among government agencies regarding FOIA requests during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FOIA request process is not limited to a specific format, but agencies must respond to requests within a certain timeframe and may exempt certain information from disclosure. COVID-19 may impact FOIA requests in two ways: certain information related to the pandemic may be expedited, and the processes for locating information may change due to remote work arrangements. The ability to process FOIA requests has varied among agencies, with some making changes to their submission methods and anticipating delays. Some agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests based on various criteria.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for providing health and human services to Americans. It consists of 11 main agencies, called operating divisions, which administer various health and human services programs. HHS is divided into two types of divisions, operating divisions and staff divisions, which fulfill management, research, oversight, and emergency preparedness functions. The operating divisions are responsible for public health services, health care quality and research, disease prevention, and regulation of food and drugs. The three remaining divisions focus on human services programs and the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The President's budget request for FY2020 estimates HHS spending to be $1.286 trillion, which is an increase from the previous years. The majority of HHS spending goes towards mandatory programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, while discretionary spending represents a smaller portion. HHS agencies receive funding from various sources, including authorizing laws, annual appropriations acts, user fees, and transfers from other sources. The budget request for each operating division and the Office of the Secretary is listed in the appendix.", "This report discusses the Navy's FFG(X) program, which aims to procure 20 guided-missile frigates (FFGs). It provides background information and raises potential oversight issues for Congress. The report mentions that the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,281.2 million for the procurement of the first FFG(X). Congress's decisions on the program could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The report also provides details about the FFG(X) program and its goals, as well as information about the Navy's force-level goals and the current fleet of small surface combatants. It highlights that the Navy is seeking a multimission small surface combatant capable of conducting anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare, antisubmarine warfare, and electromagnetic warfare operations. The FFG(X) is expected to be larger, more heavily armed, and more expensive than the existing LCS and FFG designs. Furthermore, the report discusses the Navy's desire to procure the first FFG(X) in FY2020 and the Navy's plan to employ the parent-design approach to reduce costs and risks. The Navy's proposed procurement cost for 20 FFG(X)s is around $20.5 billion, with an average unit cost of approximately $1.0235 million. The report also mentions the possibility of splitting the award of shipbuilding contracts between multiple shipyards and the use of fixed-price block buy contracts to lower procurement costs.", "The House of Representatives has rules in place for how bills and resolutions are considered on the floor. However, they can temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration in order to expedite legislation. This can be done through special orders of business or by suspending the rules and passing the measure. Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are considered under suspension of the rules, which waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits amendments. Typically, measures considered under suspension are widely supported and can meet a two-thirds vote threshold. The decision to schedule a measure under suspension is based on its level of support, desired length of debate, and whether floor amendments are desired. Measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas. During the 115th Congress, 64% of measures that received floor action were initially considered under suspension. Majority party members sponsored the majority of suspension measures, but it is also often used to consider minority-sponsored legislation. Most suspension measures are referred to House committees before being considered on the floor, with the Committee on Natural Resources having the most measures considered under suspension. Suspension measures can be considered on designated days or by unanimous consent or special rule. They are debatable for 40 minutes, with time divided between majority and minority floor managers. A motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure is then voted on, requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. If the vote falls short, the measure can be considered again under suspension or a special rule may be reported by the Committee on Rules for consideration.", "Robocalls, or pre-recorded telephone calls, continue to be the top complaint received by the FCC. The TCPA regulates robocalls, with legal ones used for legitimate purposes such as political messages or school closures, while illegal ones are often associated with fraudulent telemarketing campaigns. The number of robocalls in the US has been increasing, with consumers receiving 58.5 billion in 2019, a 22% increase from the previous year. The FCC has implemented measures to combat illegal robocalls, such as fines for violations of its Caller ID rules and allowing voice service providers to block certain illegal calls. The TRACED Act, signed into law in 2019, empowers the FCC to take specific actions against illegal robocalls. The FCC estimates that eliminating illegal scam robocalls would save the public $3 billion annually. The implementation of technologies like STIR/SHAKEN, which verifies Caller ID information, is expected to reduce the effectiveness of illegal spoofing and help identify illegal robocallers. The FCC has also established the USTelecom Industry Traceback Group to trace and identify the source of illegal robocalls. Additionally, the FCC has proposed the creation of a reassigned numbers database and has authorized phone companies to block suspected illegal robocalls by default. The FCC is also considering measures to protect critical calls and mandate Caller ID authentication. The FCC's latest order and FNPRM require the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN by June 2021 and asks for feedback on expanding the mandate, extending deadlines for small providers, and promoting caller ID authentication on non-IP networks. The FCC has taken enforcement actions against illegal robocallers, extended the robocall ban to international callers, and established a hospital robocall protection group.", "Mainland Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, remains heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO) from the Vietnam War and other regional conflicts. It is estimated that more than 20% of the land in these countries is affected by UXO. The US government has provided over $400 million in assistance for UXO clearance and victim support, with the majority of funding coming from the Department of State. Despite ongoing efforts, it could take 100 years or more to clear the region of UXO. In 2016, President Obama pledged $90 million for UXO decontamination programs in Laos. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides $3.85 million for Cambodia, $30.0 million for Laos, and $15.0 million for Vietnam. Moving forward, the 116th Congress will consider additional efforts that the US government should take to address the issue. UXO, including mines and cluster munitions, poses a significant danger to both combatants and civilians. The US has undertaken initiatives to limit the hazards of UXO, but has not signed international conventions to ban their use. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are particularly affected by UXO, with Cambodia being the most heavily contaminated country per capita. The economic costs include hindering agricultural, industrial, and residential development.", "Following a presidential declaration of emergency or major disaster, FEMA provides three primary forms of assistance: Individual Assistance (IA), Public Assistance (PA), and Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA). This report focuses on IA, which provides aid to individuals and households. IA includes various forms of assistance such as housing assistance, crisis counseling, disaster unemployment assistance, and legal services. To receive IA, the governor or tribal chief executive must request a declaration of emergency or major disaster and demonstrate that they are unable to effectively respond without federal assistance. FEMA evaluates the request based on certain factors before providing a recommendation to the President. The types of IA available depend on the type of declaration and the requests made by the governor or tribal chief executive. The report provides descriptions of the different categories of IA and explains the factors considered when evaluating a governor's request. It also outlines the types of housing assistance and other needs assistance that may be provided to disaster survivors.", "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education, specifically its Title I-A program for disadvantaged students. The ESEA was enacted in 1965 and was most recently amended and reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. The ESSA authorized $25.2 billion in appropriations for ESEA programs in FY2019. Under Title I-A, states and public schools must focus on educational accountability, monitoring and improving achievement outcomes for students and closing achievement gaps. States must have content and academic achievement standards and aligned assessments in reading/language arts, mathematics, and science. Other ESEA programs provide grants for various educational initiatives, such as the education of migratory students, teacher recruitment and development, language instruction for English learners, after-school programs, charter school expansion, and services for Native American students. States must submit a state plan to the U.S. Department of Education to receive funds under Title I-A and other formula grant programs. Title I-A grants provide additional services to low-achieving students in schools with high concentrations of low-income families, and grant amounts are determined by federal formulas. Schools can use Title I-A funds through schoolwide programs or targeted assistance programs. State plans must also include information on academic content standards, assessments, and accountability systems. Each state must have challenging academic standards aligned with entrance requirements for higher education and English language proficiency standards. Assessments must be administered in reading, math, science, and English proficiency, and states must participate in national assessments. State accountability systems must include long-term goals for all students and subgroups, as well as indicators of school performance and progress. Schools that consistently underperform or fail to improve may be subject to interventions or actions.", "This report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93), which includes a total of $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $2.86 billion less than the Trump Administration's request. The report outlines the legislative history of the act and summarizes the budgetary and strategic context in which it was debated. It also highlights the treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request, including weapons acquisition programs and other provisions. The report emphasizes the shift in strategic emphasis toward great power competition with China and Russia, as outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. It also discusses the impact of the Budget Control Act of 2011 on defense spending, as well as the increase in military personnel and military pay included in the act. The report also covers funding for DOD's childcare program, nuclear and long-range strike weapons, and the development of hypersonic missiles.", "The Constitution grants Congress the power to engage in budgeting, but does not provide specific guidelines or requirements for the budget process. Congress has developed its own budget process, but there is criticism that it does not adequately address long-term budgeting and has contributed to rising deficits and debt. Different individuals and groups have different ideas of what constitutes long-term budgeting and what should be required. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that deficits and debt will increase significantly over the next 30 years if current policies remain unchanged. There are challenges associated with long-term budgeting, such as uncertainty in projecting spending and revenue and the difficulty of budgeting for unforeseen events. Information and data are available to assist Congress in understanding the long-term budget situation. The Budget Committees in Congress play a significant role in the budget process and could be involved in efforts to alter it. The budget resolution is an agreement between the House and Senate that sets spending and revenue levels for the upcoming fiscal year and at least four additional years. It is enforced through points of order and the budget reconciliation process. Reconciliation allows for expedited consideration of legislation that would change laws related to spending, revenue, or the debt limit to align with the budget resolution. There are additional points of order in both the House and Senate that restrict or prohibit consideration of certain types of budgetary legislation.", "The Constitution contains three provisions that mention the term \"emolument\": the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the Domestic Emoluments Clause, and the Ineligibility Clause. This report focuses on the first two clauses. The Foreign Emoluments Clause prevents federal officers from accepting any present, office, or emolument from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. The Domestic Emoluments Clause ensures the President's independence by stipulating that the President shall receive a fixed salary and not receive any other emolument from the United States or any state government. Recent litigation has led to more comprehensive examination of these clauses, and this report provides an overview of their history, purpose, scope, and enforcement. The report also discusses the disputed issue of whether the Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to the President and the different definitions of \"emolument\" put forth by legal scholars.", "The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) was enacted to establish requirements for certain legislation and regulations that impose enforceable duties on state, local, tribal governments or the private sector. UMRA defines mandates as obligations imposed by such legislation and regulations. It incorporates definitions, exclusions, and exceptions to determine what mandates are subject to its requirements. The primary purpose of UMRA is to describe the legislative and regulatory provisions subject to its requirements and assess its impact on federal mandates. The report also examines debates surrounding the scope of UMRA and its implementation. It outlines the requirements for mandate cost estimates on legislation and regulations and the point of order procedure for unfunded intergovernmental mandates. The concept of unfunded mandates gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s due to changes in federal intergovernmental grant-in-aid programs and regulations. State and local government officials argued that these new programs and regulations imposed financial burdens without providing funding. UMRA was enacted in response to these concerns and aimed to control the imposition of unfunded federal mandates. It also addressed unfunded mandates on the private sector. UMRA established a procedural framework for congressional deliberations and required cost estimates for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates. It also mandated agencies to assess the impact of proposed rules on state, local, and tribal governments and prepare cost and benefit statements for significant mandates. UMRA does not apply to certain conditions of federal assistance or rules issued by independent regulatory agencies without notice. The definition of unfunded mandates has been a subject of debate, with differing perspectives on what costs should be considered as obligatory requirements. Various definitions have been proposed, including those that include direct legal orders, crosscutting requirements, fiscal sanctions, and federal preemption of state and local laws. The report highlights the importance of precise definition to avoid litigation and ensure effective control of mandates.", "Critical infrastructure (CI) refers to the machinery, facilities, and information that enable vital functions of governance, public health, and the economy. This report highlights four key areas of policy concern for Congress: defining and identifying CI, understanding and assessing CI risk, federal organization to address CI, and the role of the private sector. The report explains that the definition and identification of critical infrastructure can be challenging due to the scale and complexity of the U.S. and global economies. The most commonly cited statutory definition of critical infrastructure includes assets that are vital to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. However, the definition has evolved to also include assets that support prosperity, public safety, and civic life. The report discusses the expanding universe of threats to CI, including asymmetric attacks and natural disasters, and the need to consider resilience in addition to protection of specific assets. The report also examines the inventory requirements for critical infrastructure and the challenges associated with defining criticality and identifying critical systems and assets. It explains that critical infrastructure policy has two orientations: critical infrastructure protection (CIP), which focuses on the identification and protection of assets, and critical infrastructure resilience (CIR), which focuses on investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness. The report concludes by discussing the importance of a comprehensive database of critical assets and the need to balance the priorities of asset protection and system resilience in CI policy.", "On October 7, 2019, the United States and Japan signed two agreements to liberalize bilateral trade. The U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement provides for limited tariff reductions and quota expansions, while the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement addresses digital aspects of commerce. These agreements are considered \"stage one\" of a broader trade liberalization negotiation. The agreements do not require approval from Congress. Japan's Diet ratified the pact in December 2019, and it will enter into force on January 1, 2020. The agreements raise various issues for Congress, including their limited coverage compared to past U.S. free trade agreements, compliance with WTO rules, and comparison with the previous TPP agreement. The U.S.-Japan trade relationship is significant, with Japan being the United States' fourth-largest trading partner and the United States being Japan's second-largest trading partner. Major areas of focus in the trade negotiations include market access for agricultural goods and the elimination of nontariff barriers.", "In 2018, the official poverty rate in the United States was 11.8%, with approximately 38.1 million people living below the poverty line. This rate was a decrease from the previous year. The poverty rate is determined by comparing family income against a threshold called the poverty threshold, which varies based on family size and composition. The poverty rate varies among different demographic groups, with female-headed households and children experiencing higher rates of poverty. Additionally, poverty rates differ by race and Hispanic origin. The poverty rate also varies geographically, with higher rates in certain regions of the country. The official poverty measure has been criticized for not taking into account the effects of taxes and in-kind benefits, such as food stamps or housing subsidies, on poverty. To address these limitations, an alternative measure called the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) has been developed, which includes these factors.", "The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) provides cash benefits to individuals affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The VCF was most recently reauthorized in 2019 and all claims must be filed by 2090. There is no cap on total benefits that may be paid. The VCF originally closed in 2003 but was reopened and expanded in 2011 to provide compensation to responders and others affected by the attacks. Eligibility for benefits includes physical injuries or death as a result of the attacks or involvement in rescue and recovery efforts. The VCF is administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and decisions on eligibility and benefits are made by the special master appointed by the Attorney General. There is no right of appeal or judicial review of VCF decisions.", "The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS) was established by Congress in 1968 through the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA). The WSRA aims to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The NWSRS includes three classes of rivers: wild rivers, scenic rivers, and recreational rivers, which have different levels of development allowed. Since its establishment, the NWSRS has expanded to include 226 river units in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Congress plays a role in shaping the NWSRS through legislation and oversight. Rivers can be added to the system by congressional designation or state nomination to the Secretary of the Interior. The management of WSRs depends on the ownership of the land where the river flows. Federal land management agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service administer the rivers based on their jurisdiction. The WSRA prohibits certain activities, such as water resource projects, that would have a direct adverse effect on the values for which the river was designated. Each agency prepares a management plan for the designated rivers, which addresses issues such as development, user capacities, and resource protection. The management of WSRs varies depending on the class of the river and the agency responsible for its administration. WSRs on federal lands are managed for multiple uses, while those on National Park System lands focus on preserving unique resources. The management of WSRs on nonfederal lands depends on whether they were designated by Congress or through an administrative process.", "The text highlights the growing divergence of national internet regimes and its implications for international trade and the global digital economy. It emphasizes the importance of the US digital economy and the need for the US to shape global rules and norms for digital trade. The text also discusses the role of trade barriers, differences in internet governance and data policies, and the lack of multilateral rules in digital trade. It mentions ongoing e-commerce negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as an opportunity to establish global rules. The text explains the significance of the digital economy, including data flows and the convergence of technologies. It discusses the challenges and potential consequences of national internet regimes, such as increased trade and investment barriers and disrupted global supply chains. The text also addresses the issue of first-mover advantage in setting global internet rules and standards. It mentions the involvement of different international forums in discussing internet governance issues. The text concludes by highlighting the importance of maintaining an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure global network and the role of Congress in shaping digital trade policy.", "The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remains in power in China by using a combination of repression and responsiveness to public preferences. The party has achieved economic prosperity and co-opted the middle and educated classes to maintain control. The CCP is wary of any autonomous social organization or political activity that may threaten its power, particularly among religious congregations, ethnic minorities, industrial workers, political dissidents, and human rights activists. Technological advancements have allowed the government to monitor these groups, particularly Tibetan Buddhists and Uyghur Muslims. Despite repressive policies, some reports suggest that many Chinese citizens appreciate the government's focus on stability and are generally satisfied with its performance. CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, which some experts see as a political purge, has gained popular support. Since Xi's rise to power, the government has enacted laws and policies that enhance party and state authority, restrict civil society, and violate rights to privacy and freedom of movement, association, and religion. The CCP is increasingly using surveillance and big data technologies for social and political control. Internationally, China rejects universal human rights and emphasizes economic development over the protection of civil and political rights. The party's Sinicization policy has affected all religions in varying degrees, with Christianity facing particular pressure. The Vatican and China recently reached a provisional agreement on diplomatic relations, which some believe strengthens state control over Catholics in China.", "The United States is the country with the most nuclear power reactors and they provide approximately 20% of the country's electrical generation. Congressional interest in the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle is due to factors such as domestic uranium production, reliance on imports, and the viability of nuclear power reactors. Historically, the US promoted uranium production through federal procurement contracts, primarily for nuclear weapons. However, by the late 1980s, the US relied more on foreign suppliers for uranium. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle consists of uranium mining and milling, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fuel fabrication. The US has relatively low uranium reserves compared to other countries. Uranium milling produces waste material called tailings, and in-situ recovery (ISR) methods are becoming more common. Uranium concentrate is then sent to a conversion facility to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6), which is then enriched to produce fuel for nuclear power reactors. Fuel fabrication involves converting enriched uranium into small ceramic pellets that are loaded into fuel rods and assemblies for use in reactors. Secondary supplies of uranium include excess material from enrichment and commercial inventories. Uranium traders and brokers buy, sell, and store uranium materials based on market conditions. Nuclear utilities and reactor operators maintain inventories of uranium materials for economic reasons and to prevent supply disruptions. The Department of Energy (DOE) also maintains uranium inventories for national security missions. The uranium market operates through separate markets for producers, suppliers, and utilities, with transactions occurring through bilateral contracts.", "Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, was established in 1971 to take over intercity passenger service from private railroad companies. It operates as a private company but is primarily owned by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Amtrak currently serves over 500 stations in 46 states and runs over 300 trains per day. Its services are grouped into three business lines: the Northeast Corridor, short-distance corridors supported by state governments, and long-distance trains. While Amtrak has seen steady ridership growth, it still accounts for a small fraction of intercity passenger travel. Its expenses exceed its revenues each year, and it relies on federal subsidies to cover its losses. Amtrak has faced challenges in funding long-term capital projects and has proposed shifting its focus to shorter state-supported corridors. There have been proposals to create a dedicated funding source for Amtrak, but they have faced objections and practical challenges. Critics have questioned the necessity of operating long-distance trains, which require substantial operating subsidies. Amtrak has defended its accounting practices and proposed changes to its service structure to reduce reliance on federal subsidies.", "This report summarizes two amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA): the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA) and the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA). These amendments impact U.S. aid to the Palestinians and the personal jurisdiction of federal courts over the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for terrorism-related offenses. ATCA was passed in response to a federal lawsuit that was dismissed by an appeals court due to lack of personal jurisdiction. ATCA added provisions stating that a defendant consented to personal jurisdiction if they accepted U.S. foreign aid. As a result, U.S. aid to the Palestinians ended in January 2019. PSJVTA then amended ATCA by eliminating the provision triggering consent through aid acceptance and adding new triggers for personal jurisdiction, such as making payments to individuals involved in terrorist acts against Americans or maintaining PA/PLO offices in the United States. PSJVTA also directs the State Department to create a claims process for U.S. nationals harmed by terrorist attacks attributed to the PA or PLO. The report discusses the implications of these amendments on U.S. aid and personal jurisdiction, as well as the potential for resuming aid and the role of the PA in accepting it.", "This report discusses the issues surrounding employment services for noncustodial parents (NCPs) within the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program aims to promote parental responsibility and ensure children receive financial support from both parents. In 2018, the program served 14.7 million children, with a large portion of families having income below the poverty threshold. While the program has shown improvement in collecting current support, $11.5 billion in support went uncollected. Many NCPs face barriers to employment, such as low wages, limited education, health issues, and criminal records. Employment programs within the CSE program aim to help NCPs secure stable employment and increase their child support payments. However, these programs are limited in scale due to a lack of sustainable funding. This report explores eligibility criteria, recruitment strategies, and services provided by CSE employment programs. It also examines the current federal funding options and presents evidence on the effectiveness of these programs. The report concludes by discussing proposals to dedicate federal funding specifically for CSE employment programs. Rigorous evaluations have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of employment programs for NCPs, with some programs showing limited impacts on employment, earnings, and child support compliance. However, these evaluations highlight the importance of CSE involvement in generating impacts. The report suggests that more research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of employment services compared to other collection strategies within the CSE program.", "Space weather refers to the conditions in Earth's outer space environment, including the Sun, solar wind, and Earth's upper atmosphere. It can cause phenomena such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and high-speed solar wind streams. Hazardous space weather events are rare but can impact communication systems and power infrastructure. Over the past few decades, the federal government has become more interested in space weather and its effects, leading to the establishment of the National Space Weather Program (NSWP) and the development of space weather strategies and plans. The Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for providing space weather predictions and warnings. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides space weather forecasts to support military operations. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for monitoring disruptions to energy infrastructure from space weather and coordinating electricity restoration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees the reliability of the bulk-power system and works with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to develop and enforce reliability standards.", "Ghana is a stable democracy on West Africa's Atlantic coast with a population of 28 million. The country has a positive development trajectory and has made progress in socioeconomic outcomes. Relations between the United States and Ghana have been amicable since Ghana gained independence in 1957. The Trump Administration has signaled support for continued cooperation, but proposed sharp cuts in bilateral aid. Under the Obama Administration, aid to Ghana was provided primarily through various initiatives. Ghana has played an active role in regional affairs and is a leader in regional interventions and peacekeeping efforts. The country faces challenges including corruption, drug trafficking, and the potential for terrorist attacks. Ghana has a free press and generally upholds individual rights and freedoms, although there are serious human rights challenges.", "The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the dependence of the United States and other economies on critical manufacturing and global value chains based in China. Congress is concerned about U.S. shortages of medical supplies, such as personal protective equipment and pharmaceuticals, as the country tries to contain the virus with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient industrial capacity. China's role as a global supplier of these medical supplies has led to shortages in the United States due to reduced exports. As China's manufacturing sector recovers, there may be selective releases of medical supplies for overseas delivery. The outbreak has had an economic impact on U.S. firms operating in China or relying on Chinese goods and services, and global transportation links have been significantly curtailed. Industries such as microelectronics, auto manufacturing, steel production, and retail have been particularly affected. The spread of COVID-19 to other major manufacturing markets could pose additional constraints. Container shipping has faced serious constraints due to shortages of workers and trucking, and U.S. exports to Asia have slowed. Disruptions in Chinese supply chains are likely to lead to shortages of various products in the United States, and some U.S. firms may start diversifying away from China. However, there may be opportunities for increased U.S. exports to China, as recent tariff liberalization could drive increased purchases from the United States.", "Four federal agencies, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the National Park Service (NPS), and the Forest Service (FS), are responsible for land management in the United States. These agencies oversee approximately 610 million acres of federal lands, which account for 95% of all federal lands. Each year, Congress appropriates billions of dollars to support the management of these lands and resources. In FY2018, the four agencies received a total of $16.36 billion in appropriations, with $13.19 billion coming from discretionary appropriations and $3.17 billion coming from mandatory appropriations. Mandatory appropriations allow agencies to spend money without further action from Congress. While many of the mandatory accounts are relatively small, some exceed $100 million. The report discusses the considerations Congress faces when deciding whether to establish mandatory appropriations, compares the FY2018 mandatory appropriations of the four agencies, and provides details on the individual mandatory accounts for each agency. The funding for these mandatory accounts comes from various sources, such as general government collections or specific collections related to land management activities, including timber harvesting and recreation. Some of the funds are also derived from excise taxes, licensing fees, tariffs, import duties, and donations. The report also highlights the different uses of these mandatory appropriations, including agency activities, revenue sharing with state and local governments, and grant programs. Some accounts are used for broad purposes, while others fund specific activities or provide compensation to state and local governments. The report concludes by noting that Congress often chooses to fund programs with both mandatory and discretionary appropriations, allowing for regular oversight and decision-making.", "The retransmission of television signals to cable, telco, and satellite subscribers has been governed by various laws, including the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014. Some provisions of this law were set to expire at the end of 2019, but with the enactment of the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019, Congress permanently extended certain provisions and made amendments to the Copyright and Communications Acts. These provisions include granting rights to direct broadcast satellite service for viewers in rural areas, limiting joint negotiations between broadcast stations and cable/satellite operators, and affirming the role of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in resolving disputes. Congress also amended the Copyright Act to restrict the eligibility of households to receive non-local broadcast television signals via satellite and encouraged satellite operators to retransmit local broadcast signals in all local markets. Additionally, Congress amended the Communications Act to allow small video programming service distributors to negotiate collectively with large broadcast station groups and increase transparency in billing for new customers of video distribution services. This report provides background information on television programming, the television industry, and the laws that determine what programs viewers receive. It also addresses the relationships between viewers, broadcast stations, cable/satellite operators, networks, and content owners.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has led Congress to consider tax cuts as a form of economic stimulus. This report discusses tax cuts that were proposed or enacted during the Great Recession and their effectiveness. It also examines the tax cuts included in recent stimulus measures passed in response to the coronavirus. The report provides evidence and economic reasoning for four propositions: (1) tax cuts directed at lower-income individuals are likely to have a larger effect on spending than cuts directed at higher-income individuals, (2) there is weak evidence that a lump-sum tax cut is less likely to be spent than one received in small increments, (3) certain types of temporary tax cuts can be more effective than permanent ones, and (4) corporate tax cuts that do not make new investments more profitable are unlikely to have much effect on investment or consumer spending. The report concludes that tax cuts alone are not as effective as government spending in stimulating the economy.", "This report provides an overview of economic and fiscal conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The report highlights the fiscal and economic challenges facing the USVI government and discusses potential issues for Congress. It suggests that Congress may choose to maintain oversight of federal policies that could affect the USVI's long-term fiscal stability and may consider further legislation to extend or restructure disaster assistance programs. The report also provides a historical background of the USVI and discusses the major sectors of its economy, including tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture. It highlights the challenges faced by the USVI, such as high levels of public debt and the cost of electricity, and provides data on income levels, GDP per capita, and employment in the USVI.", "The Supreme Court hears cases concerning the rights and status of Indian tribes and their members. In the October 2018 term, the Court heard three significant Indian law cases: Cougar Den v. Washington State Department of Licensing, Herrera v. Wyoming, and Carpenter v. Murphy. In the Cougar Den case, the Court upheld the Washington Supreme Court's decision that a tribe can import fuel without paying state fuel taxes, based on an 1855 treaty. In Herrera v. Wyoming, the Court determined that Wyoming's admission into the Union did not invalidate tribal hunting rights. Finally, in Carpenter v. Murphy, the Court reviewed whether Congress disestablished a reservation, but a decision was not reached and the case will be reargued in 2019. These cases discuss the interpretation of treaties, legislative authority, and potential congressional action. The Cougar Den case could impact state taxation of other activities on- and off-reservation, and may lead to further consideration by Congress regarding state tax enforcement against tribes.", "The U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from 39 countries to enter the United States for tourism or business purposes without a visa. In FY2018, there were 22.8 million VWP visitors to the U.S., the largest number ever in a single year. To be eligible for the VWP, countries must meet strict criteria, including information-sharing agreements and border security standards. Travelers from VWP countries must obtain preclearance through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). There have been discussions about expanding the VWP to include more countries, but there are concerns about national security.", "The U.S. farm sector is diverse and includes various types of agricultural activities such as crop production, livestock and poultry products, fruits and vegetables, greenhouse and nursery products, and more. The economic conditions and income in the farm sector can vary depending on factors such as region, market conditions, and climate. Net farm income is an important indicator of the well-being of the farm sector and is projected to increase by 4.8% in 2019 due to an increase in government support. However, this forecasted income is still slightly above the 10-year average and represents a decline from the record highs in 2013. Total production expenses are projected to increase slightly, driven by higher costs for feed, labor, and property taxes. Global demand for U.S. agricultural exports is expected to decline in 2019 due to trade disputes, particularly with China. The planting of corn and soybean crops in 2019 was delayed due to wet spring conditions, resulting in record large prevented planting acres and increased complexity for farmers in making decisions regarding insurance coverage. The U.S. soybean crop is expected to see a significant decrease in production, and lower soybean prices are projected due to record carry-over stocks from 2018 and the loss of the Chinese market. The export outlook for corn and soybeans is uncertain due to the trade dispute with China. The livestock sectors, particularly cattle and hogs, have been experiencing expansion in recent years and are expected to continue to grow modestly in 2019.", "Recent floods and concerns about changing hydrologic conditions have sparked interest in using natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) to reduce flood risk and improve flood resilience. While traditional options like levees and dams are still used, there is growing support for protecting and enhancing natural features to mitigate flood and storm damages. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the primary federal agency for flood risk reduction projects, has been directed by Congress to evaluate the use of NNBFs in its activities. However, incorporating NNBFs effectively into flood risk management is still a challenge, and there is ongoing debate about how much risk reduction NNBFs can provide compared to traditional measures. Congress has requested reports on NNBFs, which may inform future legislation. USACE considers NNBFs to include wetlands, reefs, maritime forests, and engineered components combined with natural features. While NNBFs may provide benefits in some cases, they may not be able to fully replicate the risk reduction of traditional measures for all communities. The classification of NNBFs as structural or nonstructural varies depending on the context. USACE has been involved in flood risk reduction for over a century, initially focusing on building dams and levees along rivers and later expanding to include coastal storm risk reduction projects. The agency's authorities have evolved to include nonstructural alternatives and, more recently, NNBFs. However, the use of NNBFs in USACE projects remains limited. Incorporating NNBFs into project planning requires an evaluation of their economic justification, considering their impact on flood damage reduction and cost-effectiveness compared to other alternatives. NNBFs offer potential cost savings and environmental benefits but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The extent to which USACE incorporates these factors into feasibility reports is unclear. Overall, the use of NNBFs in flood risk reduction is still a developing area of policy and research.", "This report provides an overview of the U.S. teen birth rate and its changes since the 1950s. The overall trend has been a decline in the teen birth rate, with the rate reaching a record low in 2018. Several factors may have contributed to this decline, including reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives. However, there are still disparities in teen birth rates among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. Teen pregnancy prevention programs have been implemented, but their impact on the birth rate is not fully known. Teen pregnancy has significant social and economic costs for both individuals and society. The report also highlights the consequences of teen pregnancy, such as lower education levels, increased likelihood of living in poverty, and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections. It concludes that further research is needed to better understand the impacts of decreased teen pregnancy and childbearing.", "The House pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule is a rule that discourages or prevents Congress from taking legislative action that would increase the deficit. It prohibits considering direct spending and revenue legislation that is projected to increase the deficit over a 6-year or 11-year period. The rule requires legislation that increases direct spending or reduces revenues to also include offsetting provisions. The rule applies to direct spending and revenue legislation and does not apply to discretionary spending. It also exempts provisions designated as an emergency and is enforced by a point of order. The House PAYGO rule was first established in the 110th Congress, modified in the 111th Congress, replaced by the cut-as-you-go (CUTGO) rule in the 112th Congress, and reinstated in the 116th Congress. The current PAYGO rule covers both mandatory spending and revenues and includes off-budget effects. It is similar to the Statutory PAYGO Act but differs in enforcement and scope.", "Iran is a country with a population of about 80 million. It was ruled by the Shah of Iran until his ouster in 1979. The Shah was overthrown due to his alignment with the United States and his repressive policies. The Islamic Republic of Iran was established after the Shah's overthrow, with Ayatollah Khomeini as its leader. The Iranian regime is characterized by a hierarchy of power, with the Supreme Leader holding ultimate authority. The regime has faced periodic unrest and accusations of corruption. The country's elections are closely controlled, and political parties require permission to operate. The main security organizations in Iran are the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).", "The current economic expansion in the United States has experienced relatively modest economic growth compared to previous expansions. While there was a period of faster growth from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, growth has since slowed. The slowdown has been concentrated in fixed business investment spending and exports. Factors that may have contributed to the slowdown include a fading of fiscal stimulus, monetary policy tightening, trade policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in global growth. However, it is important to note that the recent slowdown in economic growth has not significantly affected job growth, as employers have remained willing to hire workers. The current growth slowdown is seen as a transition to a more moderate rate of growth, rather than a recession. The long-term trend growth rate of the economy is influenced by factors such as the labor force, capital stock, and productivity growth, all of which have been growing at a slower pace compared to previous years. It is projected that trend growth will continue to be held back by low growth in the labor force and capital stock. Fiscal stimulus, regulatory relief, favorable financial conditions, and higher consumer and business confidence have been offered as explanations for the acceleration in growth from 2017, but these factors do not fully explain why growth subsequently slowed. The current growth slowdown was inevitable at some point as it represented a return to the trend growth rate.", "Election security is a major policy challenge facing Congress, with foreign malicious actors such as Russia, China, and Iran seeking to interfere in the voting process. Election administration traditionally focuses on ensuring eligible voters can register and vote, with proper counting and transparency. However, securing elections has become more complex due to foreign interference and the potential for disinformation campaigns. The federal government's role in election security is a topic of debate, as state and local governments are primarily responsible for administration. Congress has appropriated funding for election improvements and enacted legislation related to campaign and election security. The Federal Election Campaign Act and the Help America Vote Act are key statutes in this area. Multiple federal agencies play a role in supporting election security, including the Election Assistance Commission and the Federal Election Commission. However, there is no single agency responsible for election security.", "A majority of the U.S. population has private health insurance coverage, either through their employer or through individual plans. These private health plans must comply with state and federal requirements, such as covering preexisting conditions. However, there are some health coverage arrangements that do not comply with these requirements. These include exempted health coverage arrangements, which are exempt from certain federal health insurance requirements, and noncompliant health coverage arrangements, which do not comply with any federal requirements. Some examples of exempted health coverage arrangements include group health plans covering fewer than two employees and excepted benefits plans that provide limited-scope coverage. Noncompliant health coverage arrangements include short-term, limited-duration insurance and student health insurance coverage. It's important to note that state regulations may apply to these arrangements, but they generally do not have authority over self-insured plans.", "Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, sanctions have been a significant part of U.S. policy towards Iran. The sanctions initially aimed to stop Iran from supporting terrorism and limit its strategic power in the Middle East. In the mid-2000s, sanctions focused on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. From 2010 to 2015, the international community worked together to impose sanctions on Iran in order to persuade Iran to limit its nuclear program. The report examines the various U.S. and international sanctions against Iran, tracking their implementation and impact. It also looks at the freezing of Iranian assets in the United States and the settlement of financial disputes between the U.S. and Iran, including compensation for victims of Iranian terrorism. The report also discusses the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the lifting of certain sanctions under that agreement. Finally, the report explains the sanctions triggered by Iran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, including restrictions on sales of U.S. dual use items, a ban on direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales to Iran, and the requirement to oppose multilateral lending to Iran.", "Offshore aquaculture refers to the practice of rearing marine organisms in ocean waters beyond coastal influence. Currently, aquaculture facilities are located in nearshore state waters, but no commercial facilities operate in U.S. federal waters. The development of offshore aquaculture facilities could potentially increase U.S. seafood production and provide economic opportunities for coastal communities. However, opponents argue that offshore aquaculture could harm the environment and have negative impacts on other coastal activities. Regulatory uncertainty has been identified as one of the main barriers to developing offshore aquaculture in federal waters. A comprehensive regulatory framework is needed to address potential environmental threats and other impacts. Several challenges, including the current regulatory framework, environmental concerns, and economic viability, need to be addressed in order to promote offshore aquaculture. Global aquaculture production has been increasing and now makes up 47% of global fish production. In the United States, aquaculture production has stagnated and makes up a relatively small portion of total seafood production. Offshore aquaculture has the potential to be a viable alternative to land-based and nearshore aquaculture in the U.S. EEZ. The cost of operating offshore may be higher than working in nearshore areas, but research and technological advancements have shown that operating in offshore environments is feasible. While there are technical challenges to overcome, offshore aquaculture has the potential to significantly increase seafood production in the United States. The federal government plays a role in supporting and regulating aquaculture through various departments and agencies. Congress may need to take action to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture.", "The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming a deduction for certain state and local taxes paid. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 established a temporary limit, known as the SALT cap, on the amount of the deduction. This cap has increased federal tax revenues by limiting the deduction for certain taxpayers. There have been various efforts to modify the SALT cap through legislation and regulation. The cap's effect on tax liability varies depending on taxpayer income and state and local tax rates. The SALT cap has reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the deduction and the total tax savings from those claims. The distribution and intensity of the SALT cap's effects on tax liability vary depending on state and local tax policies, local incomes, and price levels. The SALT deduction benefits higher-income taxpayers more than lower-income taxpayers, and the SALT cap has increased the tax burden of high-income taxpayers. The overall effect of the SALT cap on the combined federal, state, and local tax burden depends on how state and local governments respond to the cap.", "The Constitution grants Congress the authority to impeach and remove the President and other federal officials for certain offenses. Impeachment serves as an important tool for holding government officials accountable. The impeachment process consists of two proceedings: the House of Representatives approves allegations of wrongdoing, and the Senate holds an impeachment trial. If the Senate convicts the official with a two-thirds majority vote, they are removed from office. The Constitution sets requirements for impeachment, such as Senators being under oath during the trial. The President cannot use the pardon power for impeachment or removal from office. Understanding the historical practices of impeachment is important for interpreting the Constitution's impeachment clauses. Impeachment has its roots in English and colonial practice and was used to punish political offenses and misconduct in high places. The American colonies adopted their own impeachment practices, which influenced the Framers of the Constitution. They created a system where Congress has the power to impeach and try impeachment cases, rather than involving the judiciary. The Framers limited the scope of impeachable offenses compared to England, focusing on treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. They rejected including \"maladministration\" as grounds for impeachment to avoid making it a tool for mere policy disagreements. The Framers considered impeachment necessary to hold government officials accountable for political crimes or offenses against the state. The specific meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors is not clearly defined, but the evidence suggests that it refers to acts that cause injury to the government or society.", "The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) aims to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system. The United States is a member of the WTO and has committed to following its rules, including those related to domestic farm policy. The US has generally met its WTO commitments, but concerns have been raised that recent ad hoc trade assistance payments to farmers may exceed the annual spending limit agreed to in the WTO.\n\nThis report examines whether the US may exceed its WTO spending limit. It reviews the different types of farm programs that are subject to WTO rules, with a focus on programs that make direct payments to producers. It also discusses how changes made to US farm programs under the 2018 farm bill, as well as the ad hoc trade assistance payments, may affect compliance with WTO commitments.\n\nThe report explains that farm support programs can violate WTO commitments in two ways: by exceeding spending limits on market-distorting programs or by causing market distortions that harm other market participants. In the case of the US, the focus is on potential violations due to excessive spending.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the WTO rules for measuring domestic farm subsidies, including the distinction between product-specific and non-product-specific support. It also explains that certain types of programs are exempt from counting against the spending limits.\n\nThe report then discusses the different types of farm programs that provide direct payments to producers in the US, including traditional farm programs, permanent disaster assistance programs, the federal crop insurance program, and ad hoc programs. It explains how these programs are implemented and how their payments are notified to the WTO.\n\nFinally, the report examines the changes made to US farm programs under the 2018 farm bill and the potential impact on compliance with WTO commitments. It highlights that the 2018 farm bill increased support levels for certain programs and expanded the federal crop insurance program, which could lead to higher program payments.\n\nOverall, the report assesses the possibility of the US exceeding its WTO spending limit for farm programs and the potential consequences of such a violation. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating farm support outlays against both spending limits and market distortions to determine compliance with WTO commitments.", "The Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Act of 1954 established a fund to support U.S. fisheries development and research. Funding comes from the Secretary of Agriculture and is administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of NOAA. The funds are used for fisheries science and management activities, as well as the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program and the National Program. There are concerns about the allocation of funds and whether the fishing industry has enough input. The funding has increased over the years, with most of it going to NMFS activities. The S-K Act requires a minimum of 60% of funds to be used for industry-assistance grants. The use of the funds has evolved over time and Congress is currently considering whether the current funding meets the needs of the fishing industry.", "Congress has passed measures to authorize and fund international family planning activities since the 1960s. This assistance is intended to support U.S. international development priorities by addressing poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth. Family planning programs provide access to contraception and a range of reproductive health services. The U.S. is the largest country donor to these programs, providing $575 million annually. However, funding for family planning remains a subject of debate, with concerns about the support of abortion or sterilization and the cultural appropriateness of the programs. USAID administers these programs and focuses on areas such as healthy pregnancy spacing, community-based delivery of services, contraceptive supplies, surgical sterilization and long-acting contraceptives, integration with HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health programs, and policy analysis and planning. USAID works with implementing partners to provide family planning services, distribute contraceptives, conduct research, and offer technical assistance. These activities aim to support safe motherhood, improve women's empowerment, and contribute to overall development goals. USAID's family planning programs are organized around priorities such as healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy, community-based delivery, contraceptive supplies, access to surgical sterilization and long-acting contraceptives, integration with other health programs, and postpartum contraception. The agency supports programs in over 40 countries, with a focus on priority countries in Africa. These countries have the highest need for family planning services due to low contraceptive use and high maternal mortality rates. The top recipients of U.S. family planning assistance in 2018 were Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania. USAID also has a country graduation process to transition countries off of U.S. assistance once they meet certain criteria and achieve their family planning goals. Overall, family planning programs aim to improve access to contraception, promote safe pregnancies, and contribute to global development efforts.", "In December 2018, a partial government shutdown occurred due to funding disagreements over the construction of a border wall. Congress did not agree to President Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in funding, and instead provided $1.375 billion for pedestrian fencing. Unsatisfied with this amount, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border in February 2019, allowing him to redirect military construction funds. The administration released a plan to transfer $6.7 billion to border barrier projects, with $6.1 billion coming from the Department of Defense. Congress attempted to terminate the national emergency, but the President vetoed the resolution. In September 2019, Congress again attempted to terminate the state of emergency, but the legislation has not been considered by the President. The report provides details on the Administration's plans for FY2020 border barrier funding, including the use of defense funds and various authorities. It also outlines the status of appropriated funds and identifies potential issues for Congress. The report does not cover the overall DHS funding for border barriers or the deployment of military personnel at the border.", "Domestic violence, specifically intimate partner violence (IPV), is a significant issue in the United States, affecting both women and men. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in five women and one in seven men report experiencing severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. Domestic violence is also a leading cause of homicide in the U.S., with 16% of all homicide victims being killed by an intimate partner. In the military, IPV can have negative effects on servicemembers and their families, including decreased readiness and productivity, as well as increased costs for the Department of Defense. The unique nature of military service, such as frequent relocations and deployments, can exacerbate the risks for both perpetrators and victims of IPV. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented various prevention and intervention programs, as well as providing support and resources for victims of domestic violence. Military commanders play a crucial role in addressing IPV within their commands, and there are strict penalties for offenders under the military justice system. However, there are still ongoing challenges and areas for improvement in addressing domestic violence in the military.", "This report discusses the various sources of parliamentary authority for the Senate's procedures. It covers the standing rules of the Senate, as well as other sources such as standing orders, precedents, rulemaking statutes, committee rules, party conference rules, and informal practices. The report also discusses the availability of reference sources that provide information on contemporary Senate procedures, such as the Senate Manual and Riddick's Senate Procedure. It provides an overview of the principles of Senate parliamentary procedure, including the Senate's constitutional rulemaking authority, the importance of unanimous consent agreements, and the role of precedents and informal practices. The report emphasizes the importance of these sources in understanding how the Senate conducts its business and highlights the need for a basic familiarity with Senate procedures.", "Honduras, a Central American nation with significant domestic challenges, including fragile democratic institutions, widespread poverty, and high levels of violent crime. These challenges have led to instability, displacement, and emigration. The US has increased attention on Honduras and its Central American neighbors since 2014, when large numbers of migrants and asylum-seekers began arriving at the US border. The Obama administration launched a new strategy to improve security, governance, and economic prosperity in the region. The Trump administration initially maintained the strategy but sought to reduce foreign assistance. Congress has rejected many of these proposed cuts and has instead appropriated over $2.6 billion for Central America, including $431 million for Honduras, since 2016. However, in March 2019, the Trump administration announced its intention to end foreign assistance to Honduras, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala, due to continued migration. The direction of US policy in the region will be shaped in the 116th Congress as they consider appropriations, foreign assistance authorizations, and other legislation. This report analyzes political, economic, and security conditions in Honduras, as well as issues in US-Honduran relations such as foreign assistance, migration, security cooperation, human rights, and trade and investment. Honduras has a history of political instability and authoritarian governance, and the current president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, lacks legitimacy due to his controversial reelection. The country is classified as \"partly free\" by Freedom House and an \"electoral autocracy\" by the Varieties of Democracy Project. Corruption is widespread in Honduras, and efforts to combat it have been hindered by political interference. Economic policies under Hern\u00e1ndez have focused on sustainability and diversification, and the IMF has provided financing. However, unemployment, corruption, poor healthcare, and insecurity are the top concerns for most Hondurans.", "The K-12 teacher workforce in the U.S. is large, with nearly 4 million teachers employed each year. Teacher turnover is high, with about 1 in 10 teachers leaving their job in 2018. This has raised recruitment and retention issues that are of interest to policymakers. The main federal law addressing these issues is the Higher Education Act (HEA), which provides grant support for schools that prepare new teachers and financial support to encourage people to stay in the teaching profession. The HEA was last comprehensively amended in 2008, but programs associated with it continue to receive appropriations. Currently, there are ongoing discussions in Congress about potentially reauthorizing the HEA. The history of federal teacher recruitment and retention policy dates back to the original enactment of the HEA in 1965, which authorized the Teacher Corps program. This program recruited interns to teach in high-poverty areas while also pursuing higher education courses. Over the years, various programs and amendments have been implemented to attract and retain teachers, including the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships, Christa McAuliffe Fellowships, and Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant program. The current HEA addresses teacher recruitment and retention through the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants. These programs aim to improve teacher education, enhance professional development, and provide financial assistance to students pursuing teaching careers. Loan forgiveness and relief programs are also available to teachers to alleviate the burden of student loans. Ultimately, the report highlights the importance of addressing teacher recruitment and retention issues in the reauthorization of the HEA.", "A pension is a benefit provided by employers to assist employees in preparing for retirement. There are different types of pension plans, including defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) plans. This report focuses on DB plans. Pension plans can be sponsored by a single employer or multiple employers. This report focuses on single-employer plans. Pension plans are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which sets standards for plan participation, vesting requirements, fiduciary duties, and plan funding. ERISA also established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure DB plans in case of plan termination. Funding for pension plans includes the value of plan benefits, the amount set aside to pay for these benefits, and employer contributions. The funding ratio compares a plan's assets to its liabilities and is used to assess its financial health. Underfunded plans may require additional contributions to meet future benefit obligations. The interest rate used by plans affects the present value of benefits and required contributions. The funding requirements and rules for pension plans were established by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). According to data, a significant number of single-employer DB plans were underfunded in 2016, while some plans were overfunded. The most recent data shows that the funding percentage for the 100 largest corporate DB pension plans in 2020 was 82.2%, with a total underfunding of $300 billion. PPA introduced new funding rules and required plans to become 100% funded over a certain time period.", "The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is responsible for managing and developing federal dams and water diversion structures in the western United States. It is the largest wholesaler of water and the second-largest producer of hydropower in the country. Reclamation projects aim to reclaim arid western lands for irrigation and other types of development. These projects operate on a beneficiary pays principle, where beneficiaries reimburse the government for their share of project costs. Reclamation has evolved over time and now focuses on other project types like water reuse and conservation, Indian water rights settlements, and rural water. The bureau's history dates back to the 19th century, when Congress passed laws to encourage settlement and irrigation in the West. The Reclamation Act of 1902 was the first federal legislation to fund large-scale irrigation projects. Reclamation projects are subject to state water rights and operate under state law. The bureau was established as the United States Reclamation Service in 1902 and became the Bureau of Reclamation in 1923. Early projects faced challenges, leading to changes in funding and project development processes. Congress authorized new revenue sources for Reclamation projects and extended repayment terms. Large projects like Hoover Dam and the Central Valley Project were authorized between the 1920s and 1950s. However, Reclamation's construction program slowed down in the 1970s and 1980s due to environmental concerns and the development of prime project sites. The failure of Teton Dam in 1976 raised doubts about the viability of large federal dams. The Carter and Reagan administrations assessed water resource projects and emphasized the maintenance and environmental enhancement of existing projects. In 1982, Congress enacted the Reclamation Reform Act, which made significant changes to reclamation law, such as expanding the ownership limitation and introducing full-cost pricing for water. The Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 realigned Reclamation's priorities and made changes to the management of the Central Valley Project.", "The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program was established by Congress in order to provide greater opportunities for small businesses, specifically women-owned businesses, to win federal contracts. Congress has a long history of promoting small business contracting, dating back to World War II. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized the SBA and declared Congress's policy to promote small businesses and increase market competition by ensuring that they receive a fair proportion of federal contracts. Congress has also established goals and preferences for small businesses in federal procurement, including specific goals for WOSBs, and has authorized set-asides, sole source awards, and price evaluation adjustments/preference for small businesses. The WOSB program, established in 2000, allows federal contracting officers to set aside acquisitions for bidding exclusively by WOSBs in industries where they are underrepresented. However, the program has faced challenges in implementation and oversight, and the federal government has struggled to meet the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs. Efforts have been made to improve the program, including the implementation of a certification process, but progress has been slow. Overall, small businesses, including WOSBs, receive a relatively small portion of federal contracts, with most contracts being awarded through full and open competition or other small business preferences.", "The United States has a large federal loan program for students, with over $1.4 trillion in outstanding federal student loan debt. Many borrowers are having difficulty repaying their loans and rely on student loan servicers for guidance. However, there have been allegations of misconduct by these servicers, leading to congressional hearings and state regulation of servicers. The federal government's role in the student loan industry has evolved over time, with the government now issuing most new loans directly to students. There are several federal statutes and regulations that govern student loan servicing, but it is unclear whether these regulations apply to all servicers. The Department of Education has contracted with multiple entities to service federal student loans, and there are mechanisms in place to address servicer violations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also has authority over student loan servicers and can conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions. There have been questions about the relationship between the CFPB and the Department of Education, and some claim that the current oversight mechanisms have not effectively deterred servicer misconduct. One specific allegation is that servicers steer borrowers toward forbearance instead of more beneficial repayment options.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the third largest federal agency in terms of personnel, and its appropriations bill is the seventh largest of the 12 annual funding measures. This report provides an overview of the FY2021 budget request for DHS, comparing it to the FY2020 requested and enacted levels. The budget request includes discretionary and mandatory budget authority, with some funding offset by collections of fees. There are significant differences in budget authority from discretionary appropriations, including a reduction in border barrier funding and a proposed move of the U.S. Secret Service. The budget request also includes an increase in Transportation Security Administration fee revenues and a reduction in disaster relief funding. The table presents the requested gross budget authority for each DHS component, showing comparisons with the FY2020 requested and enacted levels. The FY2021 budget request includes shifts in funding for various components, including increases for the U.S. Coast Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The budget request also reflects changes in DHS staffing levels. The report provides summaries of the budget requests for each DHS component, highlighting key factors and observations.", "The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is an international agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed in 1961. It was created to address flooding and plan for the development of the water resources of the Columbia River Basin. The CRT provided for additional storage in Canada through the construction of four dams, which provided flood control, hydropower, and other downstream benefits. In exchange, the United States agreed to make cash payments to Canada and provide a portion of hydropower benefits. The Treaty has no specific end date, but either nation can terminate most provisions with 10 years' notice starting in September 2024. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration conducted a review of the Treaty and made their recommendation to the Department of State in December 2013. The recommendation is to modify the Treaty post-2024 to ensure a more resilient and healthy ecosystem-based function throughout the Columbia River Basin. The final decision will be made by the State Department through negotiations with Canada.", "The United States has maintained a close partnership with Europe since the end of World War II. This partnership includes involvement in NATO and economic ties with the European Union (EU). The US has been a key player in the formation and expansion of both NATO and the EU. The relationship is viewed as important for US national security and economic policy. However, President Trump's approach has strained US-European relations. European officials are concerned about his transactional view of NATO, focus on defense spending, and hostility towards the EU. There are also policy divisions on issues such as trade, arms control, and foreign policy. Despite these challenges, the transatlantic partnership has significant benefits for both sides. It has promoted peace and stability, supported democratic and prosperous European allies, and addressed global challenges together. The US and Europe also share a strong economic relationship, which contributes to economic growth and employment on both sides. While there have been occasional irritations in the relationship, the benefits have outweighed the negatives. The US views its leadership in NATO as crucial for its national security strategy, but there have been concerns about the unequal burden sharing of defense spending. President Trump has been particularly critical of NATO and has questioned its value and utility, leading to unease among European allies. However, the Trump Administration still affirms its commitment to NATO and European security. European allies highlight the contributions they have made to NATO operations and emphasize their solidarity with the US.", "The Commemorative Works Act (CWA), enacted in November 1986, provides the legal framework for the placement of commemorative works in the District of Columbia. It ensures that such works are appropriately designed, constructed, and located, and reflect a consensus of the subjects' lasting significance. The CWA applies to areas administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) in the District of Columbia and its environs. The Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) are responsible for overseeing the design, construction, and maintenance of these works. The CWA restricts the placement of memorials to certain areas based on historic importance. If a memorial is located on federally owned and administered land, the federal government is responsible for maintenance. However, some authorized memorials may be sited outside the boundaries of the CWA jurisdiction. Currently, there are 12 memorials in progress, 6 memorials with lapsed authorizations, and 19 completed and dedicated memorials. Some challenges faced by sponsor groups include choosing a desired site location, getting design approval, and raising necessary funds. The CWA has authorized 37 memorials and monuments to be placed in the District of Columbia or its environs since 1986.", "The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program provides low-interest loans to businesses affected by federally declared disasters. There are two types of loans: Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and business physical disaster loans. EIDLs provide working capital for businesses to meet financial obligations and operating expenses, while physical disaster loans are used to repair or replace damaged property. A portion of the loans can also be used for mitigation measures. The SBA experimented with a Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) pilot program from 2000 to 2006, but only four loans were approved. The limited participation may be due to delays in implementing the program and eligibility restrictions. Should Congress decide to reauthorize the PDM program, it could consider eliminating these issues and increasing awareness among businesses.", "In December 2019, a new disease called COVID-19 emerged in China and quickly spread around the world. The disease has major consequences for global health, foreign relations, the global economy, and global security. International institutions and country governments are taking various responses to address these challenges. The report focuses on the global implications of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, organized into four parts: the disease and its global prevalence, country and regional responses, global economic and trade implications, and issues that Congress might consider. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is thought to mainly spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Asymptomatic cases can also transmit the virus. The case fatality rate is difficult to determine, but estimates range. The elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to become severely sickened by COVID-19. As of May 13, there have been over 4 million reported cases and almost 300,000 deaths worldwide. Ten countries account for the majority of the cases and deaths. Individual countries are implementing domestic and international efforts to control the pandemic, with guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has released a strategic plan and has received funding from private donors and countries. The WHO and other organizations are also working on research and development for vaccines and treatments. International financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank, are providing financial support to countries affected by the pandemic.", "Congress establishes advisory commissions for various purposes, such as informing Congress, providing expert advice, and generating policy recommendations. Commissions are authorized to hold hearings, conduct research, make field visits, and deliver their findings in the form of a written report. Commissions can be funded through appropriations, federal agencies, or private donations. Many commission statutes authorize appropriations for commission expenses, and the amounts provided for commissions vary. Commissions can be noncommemorative, focusing on studies and investigations, or commemorative, organizing events and celebrations. Noncommemorative commissions make up the majority, while commemorative commissions generally rely on private donations. Funding levels for commissions have ranged from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars, and the amounts specified in appropriations acts do not necessarily reflect the total funding available for a commission. The data on funding levels for commissions are not exhaustive and may be approximate.", "The Bureau of Reclamation operates the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, a large water storage and conveyance system. The CVP supplies water to agriculture, wildlife refuges, and municipal and industrial water users. The severe drought from 2012-2016 caused major reductions in CVP water allocations and had economic and environmental impacts. Although the drought has ended, water supply issues and controversies still exist. Legislation in the 114th Congress included provisions related to CVP operations and funding for new water storage projects. The State of California and the Trump Administration have proposed changes to CVP operations, which have generated controversy. Overall, ongoing constraints on water supplies are likely for some users due to limited water supplies and the controversial nature of proposed changes.", "This report discusses four pharmaceutical patenting practices that have been criticized: \"evergreening,\" \"product hopping,\" \"patent thickets,\" and \"pay-for-delay\" settlements. These practices are seen as ways for brand-name drug manufacturers to prolong their period of exclusivity and maintain high prices, while limiting competition from generic drug manufacturers. The report also explains the basics of FDA law, patent law, and antitrust law in relation to pharmaceutical patents. It discusses the regulatory processes for drugs and biologics, as well as the abbreviated approval processes for generic drugs and biosimilars. The report highlights the role of patents in providing incentives for innovation, but also acknowledges that they can lead to higher prices. It reviews proposals to reform these patenting practices in order to lower pharmaceutical prices.", "The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) is one of three laws enacted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides funding for testing and ancillary services for the COVID-19 virus, as well as increased Medicaid funding to states and modifications to telehealth restrictions. The act also prohibits private health insurance plans from using utilization management tools for COVID-19 tests. It includes provisions for coverage of testing and related services for individuals covered under various health insurance programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. It also provides funding for the National Medical Disaster System and allows states to use Medicaid to provide testing for uninsured individuals. The act is estimated to increase spending by $2.4 billion and decrease revenues by $94 billion.", "The ancient civilization of Dilmun was a trade hub in Bahrain but declined around 2,000 B.C. Bahrain converted to Islam in the 7th century and fell under the control of various Islamic forces. The Al Khalifa family has ruled Bahrain since 1783 and is led by King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. There is a divide within Bahrain between the ruling family, which is Sunni Muslim, and the Shia majority. The ruling family, led by Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, is seen as less reform-minded and is opposed by Crown Prince Shaykh Salman bin Hamad, who seeks further reforms to address the grievances of the Shia population. Bahrain has a National Assembly, but the king maintains significant powers. The Shia opposition has organized under political societies such as Wifaq and Al Haq, but they have faced repression from the government. In 2011, Bahrain experienced a major uprising led by Shia demonstrators, which was suppressed with assistance from other Gulf countries. The government and opposition engaged in formal dialogue, but the demands of the opposition for a constitutional monarchy were not met.", "Congress has plenary power to regulate immigration, which allows them to make laws concerning non-U.S. nationals that would be unconstitutional if applied to citizens. The Supreme Court has upheld laws excluding aliens on the basis of ethnicity, gender, legitimacy, and political belief. The plenary power doctrine, rooted in the 1889 Chinese Exclusion Case, grants Congress broad authority to restrict the entry of nonresident aliens. Nonresident aliens outside the United States generally cannot challenge their exclusion from the country in federal court. Aliens at the threshold of entry have more access to judicial review of exclusion decisions. The constitutional and statutory rights of U.S. citizens may limit the exclusion power. The Supreme Court has held that excluded nonresident aliens do not have grounds to challenge their exclusion in federal court. The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prevents judicial review of visa denials and other exclusion decisions concerning aliens located abroad. However, it does not apply to decisions of domestic immigration authorities or immigration benefit denials. Some scholars disagree with the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, arguing it lacks a compelling legal foundation. The doctrine is based on the presumption against judicial review of exclusion decisions.", "The United States has been a leader in developing genetic technologies for crops and livestock. In 1994, the first genetically engineered (GE) food, the Flavr Savr tomato, was approved for sale. Today, about 90% of certain crops in the U.S. are planted with GE varieties. In July 2016, Congress passed a law requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (the Standard). The Standard requires disclosure of bioengineered foods to consumers and sets guidelines for labeling. The final rule was released in December 2018, and phased implementation began in 2020. Stakeholder reactions to the Standard have been mixed, with some organizations criticizing it and others supporting it. The Standard addresses applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions. There are ongoing debates and controversies surrounding the Standard, including the definition of bioengineering and the exemptions from disclosure. The Standard does not change how biotech foods are regulated for safety and approval.", "Section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) gives the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to make, change, or revoke safety standards for private sector employers, the United States Postal Service, and the federal government. The OSH Act also includes the General Duty Clause, which requires employers to provide a safe workplace for their employees. OSHA can enforce compliance with these standards through orders, citations, and penalties. However, the OSH Act does not cover state or local government agencies. States can establish their own safety plans, and currently, 21 states and Puerto Rico have plans that cover all employers. OSHA can create standards in response to petitions, consult advisory committees for assistance, and must follow the rulemaking process outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act and the OSH Act. OSHA's rulemaking process for new standards has historically been time-consuming. OSHA can also issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) without going through the regular rulemaking process, but it must demonstrate that there is a grave danger to employees and that the ETS is necessary to protect them. State plans are required to adopt or adhere to an ETS. Judicial review of OSHA standards is allowed, and any person affected by a standard can petition for review within 60 days. OSHA has used its ETS authority sparingly and has not issued one since 1983. Currently, there is no OSHA standard specifically addressing exposure to airborne diseases like COVID-19, limiting OSHA\u2019s ability to enforce protections in these cases.", "This report provides an overview of the FY2021 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS). It includes details on the funding allocated to various departments and agencies within CJS, such as the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, science agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA, and related agencies like the Legal Services Corporation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The report also highlights the mission and responsibilities of each department and agency. The budget request for FY2021 is compared to the previous year's appropriations, with explanations for funding increases or decreases. The report also mentions specific proposals within the budget request, such as the establishment of a Federal Capital Revolving Fund and the elimination of certain programs and accounts.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) operates the Military Health System (MHS), which provides health care services to military personnel, retirees, and their families. The TRICARE program, administered by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), offers health care services to approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries. There are three main health plan options: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) is a premium-based health plan available for members of the Selected Reserve and their families, while TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) is a premium-based health plan for retired members of the reserve components. Both plans have certain statutory prohibitions that limit their participation, such as ineligibility for the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The prohibitions have been put in place for potential cost reasons and to maintain the fiscal stability of the TRICARE program. Reservists and retired reservists who are eligible for FEHB are disqualified from participating in TRS or TRR. Advocacy groups argue that removing the prohibitions would create equality among members of the Selected Reserve and qualified retired reservists. The Department of Defense and Congress have considered proposals to eliminate the prohibitions, but none have been enacted so far.", "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) is a comprehensive law enacted on March 27, 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides additional funding for federal response efforts and includes economic stimulus measures. The law also addresses medical supply shortages, vaccine access and cost, the medical workforce, and the marketing of over-the-counter drugs. It expands reporting requirements for disruptions in drug and device manufacturing, requires the Strategic National Stockpile to contain PPE and other supplies, and extends liability protections for certain respiratory protective devices. It also ensures that vaccines will be covered without cost-sharing and includes provisions for the medical workforce, including liability protection for volunteers. The CARES Act establishes a new process for marketing certain over-the-counter drugs and includes provisions for the Medicare and Medicaid programs to cover telehealth services related to COVID-19. The law does not address education or labor provisions and does not include emergency supplemental appropriations. The law estimates an increase in federal deficits by $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The law does not discuss specific cost estimates, but provides a breakdown of the budget effects. The law also requires a study on the U.S. dependence on critical drugs and medical devices imported from other countries. Additionally, the law focuses on the medical product supply chain, including the reliance on foreign countries for drugs and medical devices. It requires a report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain, including recommendations to improve resiliency. The law also addresses the Strategic National Stockpile, requiring the Secretary to maintain a stockpile of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and other supplies. It defines \"other supplies\" to include PPE and ancillary medical supplies.", "This report provides an analysis of the annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020. It compares the enacted FY2019 appropriations with the FY2020 budget request from the Trump Administration, as well as the appropriations measures developed and enacted in response. The report also includes additional resources on DHS appropriations and explains various budgetary concepts. It outlines the legislative process for FY2020 appropriations, from the Administration's request to the enactment of the appropriations bill. The report highlights the key funding levels and changes for different components of DHS. It also provides information on the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) and the organization of DHS appropriations.", "Congress regularly extends temporary tax provisions known as \"tax extenders.\" There are 33 tax provisions set to expire at the end of 2020, including six related to individual income tax: tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premium deductibility, above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition, credit for health insurance costs of eligible individuals, medical expense deduction adjusted gross income floor, and exclusion for income of certain state and local tax rebates. These provisions were extended through 2020 in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. The act also extended provisions that had expired in 2019 and 2018. The cost of the extensions is provided in Table 1. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation. It has been regularly extended since then. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums was first enacted in 2006 and has also been regularly extended. The above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition was added in 2001 and has been extended multiple times. The rationale for these provisions is to assist households in distress, support the housing market, and promote homeownership and education. Critics argue that these provisions may encourage irresponsible behavior and lead to misallocation of resources.", "The federal contraceptive coverage requirement, also known as the \"contraceptive mandate,\" has been a topic of debate and legal challenges since its enactment in 2010. The requirement, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), requires employment-based health plans and health insurance issuers to cover certain preventive health services, including contraception, without cost sharing. Proponents argue that the requirement promotes women's health and equality, while opponents argue that it infringes on religious freedom.\n\nThe Supreme Court first addressed a challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement in 2014 in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. The Court held that the requirement did not adequately accommodate the religious objections of closely held corporations. Since then, legal challenges to the requirement have continued, with lower federal courts divided over the legality of an accommodation process implemented in 2013. In 2017, the Trump Administration expanded exemptions from the coverage requirement based on religious or moral objections, leading to lawsuits from several states.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to review the legal challenges to the expanded exemptions in a case called Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania. The case is scheduled for argument in May 2020, with a decision expected in the summer. In the meantime, the government is largely unable to rely on the previous accommodation process due to a federal district court's injunction.\n\nThis report provides an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework for the contraceptive coverage requirement, recaps the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby, and discusses the subsequent agency actions and legal challenges. It also considers potential legal questions that could be addressed in the upcoming Supreme Court case and options that Congress has proposed related to the contraceptive coverage requirement.", "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant that has been promoted as a treatment for various conditions. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support its efficacy. CBD is present in various products, including food, beverages, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products. The FDA regulates these products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). CBD is also the active ingredient in the FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures associated with certain forms of epilepsy. CBD can be derived from hemp or marijuana, with THC, a psychoactive compound, found at high levels in marijuana and low levels in hemp. The DEA does not regulate cannabis-derived compounds that meet the statutory definition of hemp, but the FDA treats all cannabis and cannabis-derived products the same as other FDA-regulated products. Changes in the 2018 farm bill removed hemp and its derivatives from the controlled substance list, allowing for the regulation of hemp production by the USDA. However, CBD and CBD-related products that do not meet the definition of hemp are still prohibited under the CSA and regulated by the DEA. The FDA regulates drugs, food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products, each with its own set of requirements. CBD is the active ingredient in Epidiolex, which is used as a prescription drug. The FDA has determined that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce or market CBD as a dietary supplement. However, the FDA has not made similar determinations for other FDA-regulated product categories such as pharmaceutical drugs, cosmetics, and tobacco products. Food containing parts of the hemp plant that include trace amounts of CBD may be lawfully marketed under certain circumstances, such as FDA approval as a food additive or a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) determination. The FDA has allowed certain hemp seed-derived ingredients to be marketed in human foods without food additive approval, as they have been determined to be safe. Overall, the FDA regulates CBD and CBD-related products based on their intended use and the requirements of each product category.", "The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) contains provisions that apply to drug products depending on the novelty of their active ingredient. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates the novelty of the active ingredient in a new drug compared to previously approved drugs to determine if it qualifies for five-year exclusivity. This exclusivity prevents other companies from referencing the new drug's clinical data for approval. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments, passed in 1984, created new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity to reward innovators and recoup their investment in new drugs. Determining the active ingredient can be complicated due to chemical reactions and different derivatives of the drug molecule. FDA defines active ingredient as active moiety, the core molecule or ion of the drug responsible for its action. FDA's interpretation has generated disputes, with some arguing it excludes drugs from NCE exclusivity. Legislation has been proposed to codify FDA's current approach to evaluating NCE exclusivity. Multiple provisions of the FD&C Act include the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient),\" and FDA's interpretation affects the eligibility of drugs for various types of exclusivity. The interpretation has been subject to debate and litigation.", "Surprise billing refers to situations where a consumer receives medical treatment from a provider outside of their health insurance network and is unexpectedly charged a higher amount than they would have been if the provider was in-network. This issue is commonly discussed in relation to emergency services and nonemergency services provided by out-of-network providers in in-network facilities, but it can also occur in other situations such as ground and air ambulance services. Surprise billing is a result of private insurers' use of provider networks. This report discusses the relationship between provider network status and private health insurance billing, as well as federal and state requirements surrounding surprise billing. It also explores various policy issues that lawmakers should consider when addressing surprise billing proposals, including plan types, types of services, consumer protections, financial requirements, enforcement, and the role of states. The report concludes with a comparison of two federal proposals that have been through committee markup procedures. Currently, there are no federal restrictions on providers balance billing consumers, but the Affordable Care Act does have requirements regarding consumer cost sharing for emergency services and ancillary provider services provided at in-network facilities. Some states have implemented their own surprise billing policies, but they vary in terms of payment standards, transparency standards, and coverage of different provider settings and plans. Federal surprise billing proposals aim to address the financial relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers by establishing new requirements to protect consumers and regulate billing situations.", "Historic preservation is the practice of protecting and preserving sites, structures, objects, landscapes, and other cultural resources of historical significance. The federal government plays a significant role in historic preservation in the United States, with various programs and grants supporting these efforts. Congress considers the federal government's role in financing these programs through the annual appropriations process, and issues related to historic preservation are of interest to Congress. Some Members of Congress support eliminating the federal role in historic preservation, while others believe federal support should be maintained or increased. Recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for incorporating preservation needs in federal disaster relief planning. The federal role in historic preservation dates back to the late 1800s, with early efforts to protect ancient Puebloan sites and establish Civil War national battlefield parks. In the 20th century, the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Historic Sites Act of 1935 established national policies and guidelines for historic preservation. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is the most comprehensive piece of legislation addressing federal historic preservation and established the National Register of Historic Places and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) is the primary source of federal funding for preservation projects, supporting formula-based grants to state historic preservation offices (SHPOs), tribal historic preservation offices (THPOs), and certified local governments (CLGs). The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of properties significant in American history, and the National Historic Landmarks program recognizes places of national significance. The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a private nonprofit corporation that encourages the protection and preservation of historic sites and buildings. The report provides an overview of these programs and grant funding, along with a summary of potential issues facing Congress in addressing historic preservation needs at the federal level.", "Congress has been focused on ensuring access to broadband internet service in rural areas. Federal subsidies have been provided to support broadband expansion in rural areas, but there are still millions of Americans without access. Many experts argue that federal spending on broadband expansion has not adequately addressed the lower demand for broadband in rural areas. Factors such as lower wealth, older populations, and lower educational attainment contribute to the lower demand for broadband in rural areas. The report discusses the characteristics of the rural broadband market, federal programs and policies for broadband expansion, and options for Congress to address the issue. It also highlights the importance of broadband for schools, healthcare facilities, and other community institutions. Demographic trends and varying local conditions affect the infrastructure investment behavior of broadband providers in rural areas. Studies show that rural households have a lower valuation of internet access compared to urban households, impacting adoption rates. Small businesses in rural areas also have varied willingness to pay for broadband service, with many valuing basic access rather than high-bandwidth applications. Overall, the report provides an analysis of demand-side issues in rural broadband adoption and offers recommendations for addressing the challenges.", "Policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions are interested in increasing financial support for individuals pursuing non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. There is demand for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree. However, the majority of federal financial aid is not available for these programs. Some schools are seeking creative approaches to increase enrollment and revenues by reaching out to adults interested in short programs that enhance workforce reentry or increase earnings. Several proposals have been made to expand federal support for non-degree programs. However, there are concerns about the employment and earnings outcomes of non-degree programs, the quality of programs, federal costs, student supports, business coordination, and potential income inequalities. Additionally, employers are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring, potentially making it more difficult for non-degree credential holders to find employment. The report provides an overview of existing federal programs and benefits that support individuals pursuing non-degree programs, as well as data on employment and wages in occupations that require non-degree credentials. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs, while work-based learning involves training and education through on-the-job experiences. Work-based learning can take various forms and is often structured to meet the needs of employers or trainees.", "The funding of public elementary and secondary schools in the United States involves a combination of local, state, and federal government revenues. State and local governments provide over 90% of the revenue, while the federal government provides the remaining percentage. This report provides an overview of the mechanisms used by states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to fund public education. It discusses the sources of funding, including property taxes, and the different types of state school finance programs. It also explores the role of federal assistance programs, such as Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, in financing public education. The report concludes with a review of efforts to collect data on per-pupil expenditures at individual public schools. Overall, there is substantial variation among states in the shares of funding provided by state, local, and federal governments.", "The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) within the U.S. Department of Education is responsible for administering federal student aid programs. FSA oversees the provision of financial aid to millions of students attending higher education institutions and manages a large student loan portfolio. FSA operates as a performance-based organization (PBO), which gives it more discretion in budget, personnel, and procurement decisions. FSA was established as a PBO in 1998 to improve federal student aid delivery. However, in recent years, FSA has faced criticism for its oversight, lack of transparency, and accountability to stakeholders. This report provides information on FSA's structure, operations, and challenges, highlighting issues that have received congressional and stakeholder attention. As Congress considers reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, it will be important to examine these issues and consider how FSA's PBO structure may impact congressional goals and policies.", "Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide liquidity to the mortgage market and promote homeownership. The GSEs purchase mortgages from loan originators and issue mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) to investors. The MBSs transfer prepayment risk to investors but guarantee the return of their initial investment. The GSEs are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and have been under conservatorship since 2008 due to financial losses. The FHFA has set goals to restore the GSEs to a safe and solvent condition. The GSEs finance their activities through the issuance of debt securities and MBSs. The GSEs retain the credit risk from the mortgages they purchase and transfer prepayment risk to MBS investors. MBSs are considered more liquid than the original mortgages and are traded in the secondary market. The FHFA has directed the GSEs to share more credit risk with the private sector and standardize processes to increase market liquidity. The GSEs' ability to satisfy their affordable housing goals depends on borrower characteristics and legal protections for loan originators. The GSEs' conservatorship and potential reforms have been the subject of congressional interest. The FHFA's initiatives focus on managing credit and liquidity risks for the GSEs. The $250 billion cap on the GSEs' lending portfolios may limit their ability to influence market pricing. The FHFA has prioritized addressing credit risks and improving the liquidity of MBS issuances.", "This report discusses health care-related provisions that are set to expire during the first session of the 116th Congress. The provisions include those related to Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs. The report also summarizes provisions that expired during the 115th Congress. It focuses on provisions that control mandatory spending and define the authority of government agencies. The report includes tables listing the relevant provisions and provides a legislative history for each. Two specific programs discussed in the report are the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program.", "Capital ratio requirements are regulations that require banks to hold minimum levels of capital to ensure their stability and soundness. These requirements can improve safety and stability but also impose costs, such as reducing credit availability and raising credit prices. There are two main types of capital ratios: leverage ratios and risk-weighted ratios. Leverage ratios treat all assets the same, while risk-weighted ratios assign a risk weight to each asset based on its riskiness. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) is a simplified ratio that allows small banks to opt out of more complex ratios. The CBLR threshold is set between 8% and 10%, and banks that exceed this threshold are considered well capitalized. The federal bank regulators have discretion in implementing the CBLR, and the threshold was set at 9% despite criticism from the industry. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily lowered the CBLR to 8% until the end of 2020. This report provides an overview of capital ratios, the pre-CBLR regime, and the implementation of the CBLR. It also presents estimates on the number and characteristics of banks affected by the CBLR. Overall, capital ratios are important for banks to absorb unexpected losses and ensure their stability, but the calibration and application of these ratios remain subject to debate.", "The House and Senate armed services committees have passed their respective versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA). After a conference committee resolved differences between the two versions, the bill was signed into law on December 20, 2019. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues that may generate high levels of congressional and constituent interest. It discusses issues such as military personnel end-strengths, reproductive health services, and reform of the Military Health System. The enacted bill includes provisions related to these issues, such as approving end-strengths proposed by the Administration and directing a study on infertility among servicemembers. The bill also clarifies certain responsibilities for the Defense Health Agency and other medical entities.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, with countries around the world implementing measures to contain the virus and mitigate its effects. The number of infections and deaths have risen dramatically, and many countries have closed their borders, instructed populations to self-quarantine, and closed schools. This has led to a sharp increase in unemployment, with millions of people filing for unemployment insurance in the United States alone. GDP has also fallen, with estimates showing a significant decline in the first quarter of 2020. Europe has also been heavily affected, with millions of people applying for state support and the Eurozone economy contracting at a significant rate. Developing Asian economies and India have seen significant outflows of foreign investment, raising concerns about a major economic recession. Latin America could also see a rise in poverty due to the crisis. Governments around the world are implementing monetary and fiscal policies to support their economies, but differences in policy approaches are straining relations between countries. Central banks and monetary authorities are intervening in financial markets, and governments are announcing fiscal policy initiatives to stimulate their economies. International organizations are also providing financial assistance to countries in need. The IMF estimates that government spending and revenue measures to sustain economic activity amount to trillions of dollars, and global borrowing is set to increase significantly in 2020. The Federal Reserve in the US and other central banks have taken extraordinary steps to support economic activity, and fiscal spending packages have been approved. Global economic growth is forecast to decline sharply, with projections showing a significant economic contraction in 2020. Global trade and GDP are expected to decline, and the effects of the pandemic are being felt across various sectors including tourism, hospitality, and supply chains. Developing countries, in particular, are vulnerable due to limited financial resources and strained health systems. The economic situation remains highly uncertain, with corporations postponing investments, laying off workers, and filing for bankruptcy. The drop in oil prices has also contributed to the decline in the global economy. The IMF has described the current economic situation as the worst since the Great Depression, and the recovery is expected to be slow and uncertain. In addition to the economic impact, the pandemic poses a threat to international peace and security, and social unrest and violence could increase. The economic effects of the pandemic are far-reaching and will have a lasting impact on businesses, global supply chains, and government responses to health crises. The OECD estimates that the adverse consequences for non-OECD countries are significant, and the effects on global trade and economic activity will vary across countries. China's emergence as a global economic actor has magnified the cost of containing the virus through global interconnectedness. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the global economy and has created challenges for governments, economies, and global leadership.", "This report provides an overview of the FY2020 discretionary appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. It discusses the current funding levels, the President's budget request, and the appropriations passed by the House and Senate. The report compares funding for selected agencies and issues that are of interest to Congress. It also provides a brief description of the agencies and entities funded in the bill. The funding levels vary greatly among agencies, with the most significant appropriations going to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, and the Indian Health Service.", "The text discusses the use of continuing appropriations acts, also known as continuing resolutions (CRs), to provide temporary funding for federal government agencies until annual appropriations bills are enacted. The FY2020 regular appropriations bills were not enacted prior to October 1, 2019, so H.R. 4378 was introduced in the House to provide continuing appropriations through November 21, 2019. The House and Senate passed the legislation, and it was signed into law on September 27, 2019. The CR provides funding at the same levels as the FY2019 appropriations acts, with some exceptions and anomalies. The CR also maintains the statutory discretionary spending limits, with certain amounts exempt from those limits. The report includes an analysis of the CR's provisions, which are organized by appropriations act title. The text also covers agency-specific provisions in the USDA and the Department of Justice, among others.", "\"The Afghanistan Papers,\" published by the Washington Post, consist of documents from interviews conducted by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) between 2014 and 2018, as well as memos from former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld from 2001 to 2004. The papers reveal that U.S. policies in Afghanistan were poorly planned, resourced, and executed, leading to outcomes that did not fulfill stated objectives. The interviews discuss the large amount of money that was poured into Afghanistan and how much of it was wasted or exacerbated existing problems. The influx of money also contributed to corruption and created perverse incentives. The papers show that the U.S. lacked a clear goal in Afghanistan and had too many conflicting objectives. Security interests often took precedence over other issues such as counternarcotics and anti-corruption efforts. Overall, the documents highlight the failures and shortcomings of U.S. policy in Afghanistan.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was enacted to address concerns about deficit and debt levels in the United States. It includes several components, such as increasing the debt limit, requiring a balanced budget amendment, establishing limits on defense and nondefense spending, creating a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and implementing automatic spending reductions (sequestration) if deficit reduction legislation is not enacted. The BCA has been amended over the years to modify the spending limits and the sequester. Congress has the ability to modify or repeal the BCA procedures, but it requires legislation to do so.", "Pensions for civilian federal employees are provided through two programs: CSRS and FERS. CSRS was established in 1920 and FERS in 1986. Both programs require contributions from employees and their employers to fund pension benefits. FERS also includes Social Security as a component. Retirement plans can be defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans. DB plans offer retirement benefits based on salary and years of service, while DC plans are like savings accounts invested in stocks and bonds. In the private sector, pre-funding of DB pensions is required to ensure future payments. The federal government pre-funds FERS, but not CSRS pensions. Employees covered by CSRS did not originally pay Social Security taxes, but since 1984, they have been enrolled in both CSRS and Social Security. Retirement annuities under CSRS and FERS are based on years of service, salary, and benefit accrual rates. Agency contributions to the pension funds are not income to the federal government, and the fund's assets are invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury bonds. Pre-funding of federal pensions promotes efficient allocation of resources, but investing in private-sector securities would raise questions and increase volatility. Employees contribute a percentage of their paychecks to the pension funds, and agency contributions vary between CSRS and FERS. CSRS benefits are not fully pre-funded, and FERS benefits are pre-funded by employee and employer contributions, as well as interest from U.S. Treasury bonds.", "Brazil, as the fifth-largest country and ninth-largest economy in the world, holds significant influence in global governance. It has formed coalitions with other developing countries to advocate for changes in multilateral institutions and protect its interests. Brazil has also played a role in peacekeeping missions and conflict mediation. However, recent domestic challenges have led Brazil to turn inward, diminishing its global appeal. The United States sees Brazil as a natural partner and hopes to deepen the bilateral relationship, particularly under the Bolsonaro administration. Nonetheless, differences over trade and relationships with China pose challenges. The 116th Congress is interested in Brazil's potential impact on U.S. initiatives and has encouraged stronger economic, security, and military ties. However, some members express concerns about the erosion of democracy and human rights in Brazil. Brazil's history includes periods of authoritarian rule, economic instability, and corruption scandals. The country has faced a series of crises since 2014, including a deep recession, high unemployment, escalating crime rates, and corruption scandals. Popular dissatisfaction led to the election of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in 2018. However, his confrontational approach to governance has hindered progress on his agenda. The Bolsonaro administration has implemented market-oriented economic policies, including privatization and pension reform, but has faced challenges in implementing its security platform. Brazil's economic outlook is improving, but challenges remain, including high unemployment and inequality.", "In FY2019, there were 20 million veterans in the US, with 9.3 million enrolled in care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is required to provide healthcare services to eligible veterans through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which is one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the US. The VHA consists of nearly 1,700 VA medical facilities. However, meeting veterans' demand for care has been a challenge, with some veterans experiencing barriers to receiving in-person care. To address this, the VA has been using telehealth services to improve access to care. Telehealth refers to the use of technology to provide healthcare services remotely, without the need for the patient to visit a healthcare facility in person. The VA has established partnerships with private sector vendors to expand access to telehealth services. Telehealth is particularly beneficial for rural veterans who may have geographic barriers to accessing in-person care and for veterans in urban areas who may experience long wait times for care. Veterans need to be enrolled in the VA health care system to access telehealth services, and there may be copayments involved. VA providers, whether employed by the VA or contracted, must hold at least one state license to provide telehealth services. The VA encourages its providers to complete telehealth training programs. In FY2018, the VA provided over 2.29 million telehealth episodes of care to 782,000 veteran patients.", "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has called on Attorney General William Barr and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Michael Carvajal to release federal prisoners who are at risk of serious illness due to COVID-19 and to reduce overcrowding. The ACLU specifically wants BOP to use authorities such as compassionate release and home confinement for elderly offenders. Members of Congress have also urged the DOJ and BOP to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population and guard against exposure to the virus. BOP data shows that COVID-19 has become widespread in the federal prison system, with several prisoners testing positive and dying from the disease. BOP has implemented an action plan to restrict access and movement in federal prisons. The Attorney General has issued memoranda directing BOP to use available authorities to place more prisoners on home confinement and providing directives for prosecutors when deciding whether to seek pretrial detention. Legislation has been introduced that would require the release of some prisoners during a national emergency relating to a communicable disease. The prison environment is conducive to the spread of COVID-19 due to close proximity, shared ventilation systems, and limited access to hygiene. Prisons are also concerned about access to medical care if staff are affected by the virus. BOP operates facilities for both convicted and pretrial prisoners, while the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for initially confining people who have been arrested and charged for a federal offense. BOP has approximately 172,300 prisoners under its jurisdiction, while USMS received around 248,900 prisoners in 2019. There are concerns about the health of prisoners, particularly those over the age of 61 or with chronic conditions. BOP has implemented measures such as suspending social visits, limiting movement of prisoners, and screening employees and prisoners. USMS does not operate its own jail system and prisoners are subject to plans developed by the facility they are housed in. There are authorities that may allow for the release of federal prisoners in response to the pandemic, including federal courts reopening pretrial detention hearings or permitting temporary release and allowing prisoners to be released before completing their sentences or placed in the community to serve the final portion of their sentences. The President also has the authority to grant clemency for federal offenses.", "A 2014 study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 53% of public elementary and secondary schools in the US need money for repairs, renovations, and modernizations. The study estimated that $197 billion is needed to bring these schools up to standard, which averages out to about $4.5 million per school. There is a lack of ongoing federal data on the condition of school facilities, making it difficult to assess the current state of school infrastructure. While the responsibility for school construction and maintenance falls mainly on state and local governments, the federal government has provided funding for specific purposes. The Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2019 (H.R. 865/S. 266) proposes authorizing $70 billion in grants and $30 billion in school infrastructure tax credit bonds for the construction and repair of public school facilities. The grants and bond limits would be allocated to states proportionally based on their prior-year grant allocations. In school year 2015-2016, public schools received about 47% of their revenue from state governments and 45% from local governments, with the majority of local revenue coming from property taxes. While the federal government does provide direct and indirect support for school infrastructure, the funding is limited. H.R. 865 aims to address this issue by providing more funding for school construction and repair, as well as implementing reporting requirements to track the condition of school facilities. The bill also reauthorizes certain tax credit bonds to fund school construction and renovation. Overall, H.R. 865 seeks to improve the condition of public school facilities in the US.", "The 2017 tax revision, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made several changes to the corporate tax rate, business tax deductions, international tax rules, and individual income taxes. The Act was estimated to reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. In its first year, the Act had a relatively small effect on economic growth, with GDP growing by 2.9% compared to a projected growth rate of 3.3%. Projections for the long-term effects of the Act vary, with some forecasting a positive impact on GDP growth and others projecting negative effects. The Act also had mixed effects on consumption and investment, with consumption growing modestly and nonresidential investment growing at a higher rate. The revenue loss from the tax cut was close to projections, but corporate tax revenues were lower than expected. Overall, the first-year effects of the Act on the economy were relatively small and it is unclear if the tax cut will fully offset the revenue losses.", "The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program provides compensation to state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands within their jurisdictions. The program was enacted in 1976 as a response to a shift in federal land policy that prioritized retention of federal lands. PILT payments can be used for various governmental purposes such as firefighting, police protection, and construction of public schools and roads. The Office of the Secretary in the Department of the Interior is responsible for calculating and disbursing PILT payments. There are three payment mechanisms in PILT, with Section 6902 accounting for the majority of payments. Congress has routinely considered amending PILT within appropriations and authorizing legislation. PILT funding has been provided through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations since FY2008. Section 6902 payments are determined by a formula that takes into account the number of entitlement acres, population-based maximum payment, and prior-year payments. The program has nine categories of federal lands that qualify for compensation. PILT funding can vary from year to year, leading to potential challenges for counties that rely on the program.", "Congress is considering federal funding for infrastructure to revive the economy in the wake of COVID-19. This report looks at the impact of transportation infrastructure funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). ARRA was the largest fiscal stimulus measure passed in response to the Great Recession. Infrastructure funding accounted for 13% to 19% of the total cost of ARRA, with programs administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) receiving $48.1 billion. Funding was provided through direct spending, grants to nonfederal entities, tax preferences, and credit assistance. However, infrastructure spending was slower compared to other forms of assistance like unemployment compensation. The ARRA funding had a mixed impact on infrastructure spending, with total spending on transportation infrastructure falling after 2011. The ARRA funding also had mixed employment effects, with highway construction employment experiencing a slight increase but not a sustained recovery until 2015. The financial crisis and recession also affected state and local credit markets, leading to limited access to financing for infrastructure investment. The ARRA included the Build America Bond (BAB) program to address this issue, allowing state and local governments to issue taxable bonds with a federal subsidy. BABs were seen as more efficient and attracted a larger pool of investors. Overall, the ARRA infrastructure funding had a mixed impact on the economy and infrastructure sector, with some positive effects but also challenges in terms of timing, spending, and employment.", "The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) is a comprehensive reform of FEMA's disaster assistance programs. It includes changes to improve disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Some key provisions of DRRA include guidance and training on prioritizing assistance to medical care facilities during power outages, developing evacuation routes, coordinating emergency response plans for hazardous material storage facilities, and establishing a National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. DRRA also allows for funding of wildfire and windstorm mitigation activities, encourages hazard mitigation in communities affected by major disasters, and expands the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to include fire management assistance declarations. The implementation of DRRA involves reporting, rulemaking, and other actions with specific deadlines.", "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for various independent agencies that perform a wide range of functions, such as managing federal real property, regulating financial institutions and markets, and mail delivery. This report focuses on funding for the independent agencies included in Title V of the FSGG appropriations bill. It also addresses general provisions in Title VII and provisions on Cuba sanctions. The bill funds agencies like the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, the judiciary, and the District of Columbia, but not financial regulatory agencies. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an exception, as its funding is considered through the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump's FY2019 budget requested $2.3 billion for independent agencies funded through the FSGG bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with a few differences. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with $1.2 billion in funding for the independent agencies, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with $2.3 billion in funding. The House passed H.R. 6147, including the FSGG provisions, and the Senate passed S. 3107, which also included the FSGG provisions. A conference committee was convened but did not report a conference report before the end of the fiscal year. Instead, continuing resolutions were passed to provide funding for the agencies. The House and Senate passed different consolidated appropriations bills in January 2019, both containing the FSGG provisions. The House bills would have provided $2.3 billion or $2.5 billion in funding, while the Senate did not act on either bill. A conference report was agreed upon and signed into law as P.L. 116-6, providing $1.9 billion in funding for the FSGG independent agencies, including the CFTC. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is a federal regulatory agency that aims to reduce consumer risk from using various products. The President requested $123.5 million for the CPSC in FY2019, while the House and Senate bills would have appropriated $127 million and $126 million, respectively. The final enacted amount was $127 million. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is responsible for improving the administration of federal elections. The President's budget requested $9.2 million for the EAC in FY2019, while the House and Senate bills would have appropriated $10.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The final enacted amount was $9.2 million.", "The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The act includes enhancements for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), and Emergency EIDL grants, as well as emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Small Business Administration (SBA). The act increases the authorization limit for the PPP from $349 billion to $659 billion and provides $100 billion for the HHS and $62 billion for the SBA. The act also expands eligibility for EIDL and Emergency EIDL grants to agricultural enterprises with less than 500 employees. The HHS funding includes $75 billion for the HHS provider relief fund and $25 billion for COVID-19 containment efforts, such as testing capacity and workforce support. The SBA funding includes $50 billion for EIDL and $10 billion for Emergency EIDL grants.", "Economic sanctions are being used by the United States to pressure three major oil-producing countries: Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These sanctions aim to reduce oil sales revenue to these countries, potentially affecting global oil supply and prices. So far, the impact of the sanctions has been mitigated by increased production from other countries and slowing global oil demand growth. Each country's sanctions framework is designed differently, with Iran's targeting its oil export revenue, Russia's aimed at long-term oil projects, and Venezuela's prohibiting petroleum trade with the US. The sanctions on Iran have been in effect for nearly three decades, while those on Russia and Venezuela are more recent. The effectiveness of the sanctions in achieving US foreign policy objectives is beyond the scope of this report.", "Consumer finance encompasses the financial lives of individuals and households, and is an important tool for achieving economic advancement and wealth building. This report focuses on credit and deposit-taking financial products for personal, family, or household purposes. Major consumer finance markets analyzed include mortgage lending, student loans, automobile loans, credit cards and payments, payday loans, and checking accounts. The report also discusses the consumer credit reporting system and the debt collection market. Understanding household finances is important for considering policy issues in consumer financial markets. Research suggests that households make financial decisions based on their unique situations and preferences, and these decisions can be influenced by factors such as income, consumption, savings, borrowing, and asset building. Household income and net worth in the United States are distributed unevenly, with wealth increasing as households age. Consumer behavior in financial markets is driven by the need to build assets, smooth consumption, and handle financial shocks or emergencies. Market failures such as imperfect information and behavioral biases can reduce economic efficiency and consumer welfare. These market failures are important to consider when analyzing consumer credit markets.", "Article III, Section I of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the United States is vested in the Supreme Court and other inferior courts established by Congress. Congress determines the size and structure of the federal judiciary, including the number of circuit and district court judgeships. The Judicial Conference of the United States makes recommendations to Congress for new judgeships based on the needs of the federal court system. Currently, there are 179 circuit court judgeships and 673 district court judgeships authorized by law. The number of judgeships has increased over time as the country's population and caseloads have grown. Congress has the authority to create both permanent and temporary judgeships, with temporary judgeships being used for temporary workload increases or uncertain workload changes. In recent years, Congress has primarily created new judgeships through smaller legislation or appropriations bills. The judiciary can also recommend legislation to Congress for new judgeships.", "This report discusses the availability of data on illicit drug flows into the United States and how these data are used to inform policy on drug trafficking. The report acknowledges that available data on drug production are often estimated, incomplete, imperfect, or lacking nuance. It explains that drug production estimates are calculated based on factors such as crop cultivation, weather conditions, and refining processes, but these estimates can be prone to errors. The report also highlights the challenges in acquiring and analyzing data on synthetic drug production and precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production, particularly due to the proliferation of new psychoactive substances. The report further explains that estimating drug flows in transit is a longstanding challenge and that there is no comprehensive dataset detailing the estimated amount of each type of illicit drug produced in each source country that is suspected to be destined for the United States. However, there are snapshots of seizure data available, which provide a limited view of drug trafficking. The report specifically focuses on the seizure data published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which indicates that larger quantities of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl are seized at ports of entry (POEs) than between the ports. It also highlights the significant amount of marijuana that is seized between the ports. The report concludes by emphasizing that while these seizure data provide useful information on drug trafficking patterns, they should be interpreted with caution and should not be considered as a comprehensive view of all illicit drug flows into the United States.", "The text provides an overview of the political and economic situation in Kosovo. It notes that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and has since been recognized by over 100 countries, including the United States and most EU member states. However, Serbia, Russia, China, and some other countries do not recognize Kosovo. The United States has been a strong supporter of Kosovo's state-building efforts and its ongoing dialogue with Serbia. The text also highlights the key issues facing Kosovo, including the government collapse in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, managing relations with the Serb minority, and economic growth. It mentions that Kosovo is a parliamentary republic with a prime minister and an indirectly elected president. The political situation in Kosovo has been volatile, with government turnover and tensions between the president and prime minister. The economy is recovering but still faces challenges, such as high unemployment rates and dependence on remittances. The text also provides a historical background on Kosovo's independence and the conflict with Serbia. The ongoing dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia is aimed at normalizing relations and eventual EU membership for both countries. Implementation of the dialogue's agreements has been mixed, and there are unresolved issues, such as the scope of Serbian recognition of Kosovo and the situation in northern Kosovo.", "The asset management industry is a complex system involving asset management companies, intermediaries, and regulations. There are two main categories of products in the industry: public funds and private funds. Nearly half of all U.S. households own some form of public funds.\n\nAsset management companies pool money from investors and invest it on their behalf for financial returns. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary regulator of the industry, and there are several statutes that govern its operation.\n\nPublic funds are accessible to all types of investors and include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts. Private funds, on the other hand, are limited to more sophisticated investors and include hedge funds, venture capital funds, and private equity.\n\nThe asset management industry is highly concentrated, with the largest U.S. asset managers managing trillions of dollars in assets. Public funds held $21.4 trillion in total net assets in 2018, while private funds held $8.7 trillion. Other intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, also hold a significant amount of assets.\n\nDifferent types of asset management companies are subject to different regulatory requirements. Public funds are more regulated than private funds. Private funds tend to take on higher risks and have fewer investor access restrictions.\n\nOverall, the asset management industry functions to pool assets, share risks, allocate resources, produce information, and protect investors. However, there are ongoing discussions about the financial stability of the industry, the level of protection for retail investors, and the impact of fintech on the industry.", "Poland is considered a key ally of the United States and has a close bilateral cooperation with the US on various issues such as NATO capabilities, counterterrorism, nonproliferation, missile defense, human rights, economic growth, energy security, and regional cooperation. Poland is the largest and most populous Central European and Baltic country in NATO and the EU. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004 with strong support from the US. Poland is seen as looking to the US for foreign policy leadership. However, concerns have been raised about the governance trends in Poland since the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party came to power in 2015. The party has implemented controversial reforms that critics argue undermine the country's institutions and democracy. The EU has launched an inquiry into these reforms, and there have been threats of suspending Poland's voting rights in the EU. Despite these tensions, Poland's support for Law and Justice has remained steady, as seen in the 2018 regional elections and the May 2019 European Parliament elections. Poland's economy has been successful, with strong economic growth, an expanding private sector, and increasing per capita GDP. However, Poland is not a member of the Eurozone and has shown reluctance to adopt the euro.", "The Troubles in Northern Ireland, which lasted from 1969 to 1999, resulted in the deaths of almost 3,500 people. The conflict arose from a struggle between different national, cultural, and religious identities. Protestants, who identify as British, support Northern Ireland's inclusion in the UK, while Catholics, who see themselves as Irish, desire a united Ireland. The conflict began with a civil rights movement launched by Catholics who faced discrimination. The violence prompted the UK government to deploy the British Army and impose direct rule. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was reached, which aimed to bring peace and reconcile the different communities. However, tensions and challenges persist, exacerbated by the UK's Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland's peace process and economy. The Good Friday Agreement established a framework for devolved government and addressed issues such as decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, and the status of prisoners. Implementing the agreement has been a lengthy and difficult process, and tensions between unionists and nationalists continue. The devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive faced obstacles, particularly regarding decommissioning of weapons by paramilitary groups. The establishment of a new police force, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and ensuring Catholic representation in the force were contentious issues. The agreement also called for the removal of security installations and the normalization of UK security forces in Northern Ireland. The UK government incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and established human rights and equality commissions. Language and cultural issues, such as the recognition of the Irish language, remain controversial. While implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is largely considered complete, efforts have been made to address remaining sectarian tensions and promote reconciliation. Initiatives such as the Haass Initiative in 2013 and the Stormont House Agreement in 2014 aimed to tackle divisive issues and financial disputes.", "Motor vehicle electrification has gained interest and traction in recent years as a potential alternative to internal combustion engines. However, electric vehicles (EVs) continue to be more expensive than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. To promote the development and sales of electric vehicles, many countries, including the United States, have implemented government policies.\n\nIn 2018, over 2 million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles were sold worldwide, accounting for about 2% of all passenger vehicle sales. The demand for electric vehicles is expected to continue growing, as some countries aim to shift away from fossil-fuel vehicles by 2030.\n\nChina leads in electric vehicle adoption, with a significant number of electric buses in service. In the European Union and the United States, the pace of electrification is slower, but there are still efforts to promote electric vehicle adoption.\n\nThere are two types of electric vehicles currently in use: hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) which have both internal combustion engines and electric motors, and plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs) which use electricity from an external source for recharging. The high cost of producing lithium-ion batteries, limited range, and charging infrastructure are barriers to widespread electrification.\n\nIn the United States, more than 361,000 plug-in electric passenger vehicles were sold in 2018, surpassing the sales of hybrid electric vehicles. Various automakers offer electric vehicle models, and Tesla and Toyota have recorded the highest number of vehicle sales.\n\nTo support vehicle electrification, the federal government has implemented tax incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and for the installation of charging stations. The primary federal tax incentive is the credit for plug-in electric vehicles, which ranges from $2,500 to $7,500 depending on the vehicle's battery capacity. The federal government has also invested in research and development to reduce battery costs, increase vehicle range, and decrease charging times.\n\nThere have been proposals in the 116th Congress to modify or eliminate the plug-in electric vehicle tax credit. Some bills propose expanding the credit, while others seek to eliminate it or impose highway user fees on alternative fuel vehicles.\n\nIn addition to tax incentives for vehicle electrification, there have been tax credits for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. However, these credits expired in 2017 and may be extended again in the future.\n\nState and local governments have also implemented their own policies to support electrification, including imposing taxes or fees on electric vehicles to contribute to transportation funding.\n\nInvestment in transportation electrification research and development is another approach to reducing the cost of electric vehicle technologies. The federal government has funded R&D programs through the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\n\nOverall, government policies play a crucial role in promoting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. Tax incentives, research and development funding, and infrastructure investments are key initiatives to support vehicle electrification.", "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is the world's largest emergency supply of crude oil and has been a key part of US energy policy for over 40 years. The SPR's purpose is to reduce the vulnerability of the US to energy supply disruptions and provide protection from short-term consequences of petroleum supply interruptions. The US is obligated to maintain strategic petroleum stock holdings as a signatory to the International Energy Program (IEP) agreement. The SPR's role may be of congressional interest due to changes in the oil market. Oil price volatility can have economic consequences, and the market is influenced by factors such as supply, demand, geopolitical risks, and the value of the dollar. Technological advancements and changes in US oil production have led to a decrease in net imports and increased exports of crude oil and petroleum products. While low oil prices can benefit consumers, they can also pose economic challenges for the oil industry. Some policymakers have suggested increasing oil stockpiles in the SPR during times of oversupply and low prices, but this would require appropriations from Congress. The SPR was created in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent oil embargo. It was designed to mitigate the economic effects of a supply interruption and provide petroleum for the US market. The SPR currently holds around 635 million barrels of crude oil, which is well above the 90-day obligation under the IEP agreement. The SPR's capacity is limited to 713.5 million barrels, and it is physically located across four sites in Texas and Louisiana. The SPR has a maximum drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day for 90 days. The US has the option to release sweet or sour crude oil from the SPR depending on strategic considerations. The SPR's infrastructure has undergone upgrades and improvements to ensure maximum drawdown capability. The US has used the SPR in the past during times of supply disruptions, such as the Persian Gulf War. Refilling the SPR after a drawdown is at the discretion of the President. The US could consider expanding the SPR infrastructure to increase the maximum drawdown rate if needed. The release of oil from the SPR is authorized under specific circumstances and is conducted through a public sale to the highest bidder.", "Social Security provides financial protection to workers and their families in the event of retirement, disability, or death. The amount of benefits workers receive is based on their earnings throughout their careers. However, for workers who have split their careers between jobs covered by Social Security and jobs not covered by it, calculating benefits can be challenging. This is where the windfall elimination provision (WEP) comes into play. The WEP reduces Social Security benefits for workers who have noncovered earnings and are entitled to pension benefits based on those earnings.\n\nCurrently, the WEP formula often overadjusts or underadjusts benefits, resulting in some workers receiving lower benefits than those who have spent their entire careers in covered employment, and others receiving higher benefits. As a result, legislative proposals have been introduced to substitute the current WEP formula with a proportional formula that would provide the same replacement rate for both split-career beneficiaries and those whose entire careers are covered by Social Security.\n\nThe proportional formula would apply the regular Social Security benefit formula to all earnings, both covered and noncovered, and then calculate benefits based on the ratio of earnings from covered employment to total earnings. This would ensure that split-career beneficiaries receive the same replacement rate as those with careers fully covered by Social Security.\n\nThe proportional formula would result in higher benefits for some beneficiaries, particularly those with lower lifetime earnings who are currently receiving lower benefits due to the current WEP formula. Conversely, it would lower benefits for beneficiaries who are currently receiving higher benefits due to underadjustment by the current WEP formula.\n\nImplementing the proportional formula would have implications for benefit amounts, improper payments, and notification to beneficiaries. If applied to current beneficiaries in 2018, it is estimated that about 69% would receive higher benefits, while 31% would receive lower benefits.\n\nOverall, the proportional formula aims to provide fair and consistent benefits to all Social Security beneficiaries, regardless of whether their careers were split between covered and noncovered employment.", "The 2018 farm bill, also known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, includes provisions for rural development. These provisions address issues such as rural infrastructure, rural economic development, and rural business creation and expansion. The bill aims to address challenges faced by rural communities, including decreasing populations, lack of employment opportunities, the opioid crisis, rural hospital closures, aging infrastructure, and lack of broadband access. It establishes new programs and entities related to rural broadband deployment, healthcare, and community development, as well as reauthorizes and amends existing programs. The bill also addresses rural population decline, rural underemployment, rural health issues, aging infrastructure, and the need for a regional approach to rural economic development.", "The U.S. Constitution establishes a two-step process for the House and Senate to remove federal officials through impeachment. The House has the power to impeach a federal official by adopting articles of impeachment, while the Senate has the power to try the impeachment and render a verdict. Two-thirds of Senators voting must agree to convict and remove an official from office. The House initiates the impeachment process through an impeachment inquiry, which is authorized by a simple resolution. The House Judiciary Committee conducts the investigation and prepares articles of impeachment, which are then considered by the full House. If the articles are adopted, managers from the committee present them in the Senate. The House can initiate an impeachment process by drafting a resolution and placing it in the House hopper. The resolution can call for an impeachment or an investigation of an official. It can also be offered on the floor as a question of the privileges of the House. The House may dispose of an impeachment resolution in various ways, including referring it to the Judiciary Committee or tabling it. Material related to the conduct of a federal official may reach the House and be referred to committee prior to the adoption of an impeachment resolution. The House can also receive findings from investigations conducted by the Judicial Conference of the United States regarding impeachable conduct by federal judges. The House may approve an authorizing resolution to conduct an impeachment investigation, which can be taken up by unanimous consent or through other regular processes. The Judiciary Committee conducts the investigation and can subpoena witnesses and materials. The committee may hold public hearings and follow House rules for conducting hearings. The committee can also adopt internal guidelines for the mode and conduct of depositions. The committee's proceedings may be governed by House and committee rules, as well as any specific rules agreed to in the authorizing resolution. The committee may also use information provided from other outside investigations in its impeachment proceedings.", "The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, now called the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) program, provides discretionary grants to transportation projects of national, regional, or metropolitan importance. It was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to improve transportation infrastructure and stimulate economic activity. The program has evolved over time, with changes in criteria and funding amounts. It aims to distribute funding equitably between urban and rural areas. There has been debate and opposition to the program, but it has continued to receive funding from Congress. The program has awarded grants to projects in all states, with California receiving the most funding. There has been a shift in recent years towards prioritizing projects in rural areas. The administration has cited safety concerns as a reason for this shift, but data on road conditions and fatalities do not fully support this rationale. Congress has made changes in the FY2019 appropriations act to limit the share of program funding going to rural areas and redefine urban and rural areas.", "Technological convergence refers to the integration of multiple technologies into a single device or system. One example of technological convergence is the smartphone, which combines various functions like a telephone, computer, camera, and more. The global smartphone industry is valued at over $350 billion. However, technological convergence also presents challenges for regulation, digital privacy, and data security. Congress may need to address issues such as regulatory jurisdiction, protection of consumer data, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a common example of technological convergence, with devices connected to a network exchanging data. IoT applications include industrial automation, healthcare devices, smart cities, and smart homes. The smart home industry alone is estimated to be worth over $30 billion globally. As technological convergence continues to advance, Congress and other stakeholders will need to consider the role of the federal government in regulating and protecting privacy and security in this rapidly evolving landscape.", "The report covers the procedures for demanding that words be taken down in the House of Representatives. Members can call out other members for using disorderly language and request that their words be recorded and read aloud by the Clerk. The Speaker determines whether the words are in order based on House precedents. If the words are ruled out of order, they may be stricken from the Congressional Record. The report also provides a history of the rule and details recent instances of demanding that words be taken down.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 included appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its domestic food assistance programs. USDA's domestic food assistance programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and child nutrition programs. The funding for these programs is mainly administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The enacted FY2019 appropriation provides over $103 billion for domestic food assistance, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion from FY2018. The majority of the funding is for mandatory spending on programs like SNAP and the child nutrition programs. The discretionary budget items include funding for WIC, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), and federal nutrition program administration. The President's FY2019 budget request included several legislative proposals pertaining to SNAP, but none of these policies were enacted as part of the FY2019 appropriation. The enacted appropriation also includes policy provisions such as restrictions on processed poultry from China in school meal programs and changes to the pricing of paid meals in schools.", "The federal government has been transitioning its data storage to cloud-based services since 2009 in order to reduce IT costs and improve efficiency. However, challenges remain, including concerns about security, complexity of migrating legacy applications, lack of skilled staff, and uncertain funding. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services through the internet and can be categorized into different deployment and service models. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a standardized definition of cloud computing, outlining the five essential characteristics and four deployment models. Federal agencies have been planning for cloud adoption since 2010, with the \"Cloud First\" strategy and the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) supporting increased cloud adoption. The government has also developed the Cloud Smart Strategy to provide guidance on cloud implementation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has assessed the progress of cloud adoption in federal agencies, finding that most agencies have made progress in implementing cloud services and have identified benefits such as cost savings and improved customer service. However, challenges include inconsistent tracking of spending data and confusion regarding reporting requirements. Congress has conducted oversight of cloud computing activity, with legislation introduced to establish a risk management process for cloud computing services. Congressional hearings have also been held to examine the role of cloud computing in IT modernization and the use of artificial intelligence in cloud management.", "Congress has a history of creating advisory commissions to aid in the development of public policy, particularly during times of crisis. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the creation of advisory commissions is being considered. This report provides a comparative analysis of five proposed congressional advisory commissions that would investigate various aspects of the pandemic. The proposed commissions are similar in structure, with each being temporary, serving in an advisory capacity, and reporting their findings and recommendations. However, there are differences in membership, appointment structure, and reporting timelines. Considerations such as commission size, member qualifications, compensation, and partisan balance are important in the formation of these commissions. The proposed commissions aim to have bipartisan representation and include experts in relevant fields. Appointment authority would mostly be delegated to congressional leaders, with some proposals allowing for presidential appointments. Deadlines for commission appointments and initial meetings vary among the proposals. Each commission would have a quorum requirement and hold public meetings, with reports being made publicly available. Overall, the proposed commissions offer a platform for evaluating pandemic-related policy issues and complement existing oversight mechanisms.", "The USDA has announced a second round of trade aid in 2019 to assist farmers in response to trade damage from continued tariffs and trade disruptions. The aid package includes three programs: the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), the Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP), and the Agricultural Trade Promotion Program (ATP). The funding for the 2019 package is $16 billion, an increase from the $12 billion in funding for the 2018 package. The MFP will provide direct payments to producers of eligible commodities, with different payment structures for non-specialty crops, specialty crops, and animal products. The FPDP will purchase surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation for distribution to food banks and other outlets, and the ATP will assist in developing new export markets for agricultural producers. There are several differences between the 2018 and 2019 packages, including an expanded funding commitment, an expanded list of eligible commodities, and modified payment formulas for non-specialty crops. Producers can apply for MFP payments from July 29 to December 6, 2019, with payments being made in up to three tranches. The aid package is intended to help agricultural producers while the Administration resolves ongoing trade disputes.", "A 2019 study found that 2 million Americans lack access to running water, indoor plumbing, or wastewater services, with many of these communities being in rural areas or on tribal lands. Congress has authorized projects and programs through various federal agencies, including the Bureau of Reclamation, to address these water supply needs. The Bureau of Reclamation, established in 1902, owns and manages dams and reservoirs capable of storing 140 million acre-feet of water. Congress has authorized Reclamation to develop municipal and industrial water supply projects in rural areas since 1980. These projects often involve taking water from one location and moving it long distances to existing systems. Reclamation-funded water deliveries total about 10 trillion gallons per year. Congress has authorized rural water projects to be funded on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis. Nontribal rural water supply projects receive federal funding for 75-80% of costs, while tribal projects can receive up to 100% federal funding. In 2006, Congress created the Rural Water Supply Program to develop and recommend rural water supply projects. However, no projects were authorized through this program, and it expired in 2016. Reclamation continues to construct authorized rural water projects, with $1.2 billion still needed for ongoing projects. The FY2021 budget request for Reclamation's rural water activities is $30.3 million, with $8.1 million for construction. Congress has funded rural water projects for over four decades, with Reclamation becoming involved in the 1980s. Concerns have been raised about the lack of feasibility studies prior to project authorization and rising costs due to inflation. In FY2020, Reclamation funded $125.4 million in construction at five projects. The budget request for FY2021 is $114.8 million less than the FY2020 enacted funding. Reclamation has emphasized accepting nonfederal contributions above cost-sharing requirements to expedite projects. Four projects were under construction in FY2020, including the Garrison Diversion Unit, Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System, Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, and Rocky Boy's/North Central Montana Regional Water System. The Eastern New Mexico Water Supply project was also ongoing. The Rural Water Supply Program authorized by Congress in 2006 was not implemented due to lack of funding. Reclamation studied about 22 projects under this program, but none were recommended or authorized by Congress.", "This report summarizes the final congressional votes on free trade agreements (FTAs), trade promotion authority (TPA), and U.S membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It provides an overview of how Congress shapes U.S. trade policy and its role in approving FTAs and overseeing their implementation. The report also includes information on the current FTAs the United States is a party to and the process of TPA. Additionally, it provides a timeline of trade agreements, major votes on FTAs and U.S. membership to the WTO, and major votes on TPA legislation. The report contains links to additional resources for more information.", "Intercity passenger rail in America has a long history dating back to the 19th century. Railroads were initially built for both freight and passenger transportation, but as competition from airlines and highways grew, passenger services declined. To preserve passenger rail service, Congress created Amtrak in 1970. Amtrak is a private company with majority shares held by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The government provides federal funds to support Amtrak's operating losses and capital expenditures. In recent years, there have been efforts to improve passenger rail service by designating high-speed rail corridors and providing grants for infrastructure improvements. However, there is ongoing debate about the justification for federal subsidies for passenger rail, as other modes of transportation dominate intercity travel markets. The Trump Administration has called for a shift in responsibility and decision-making to the states. Overall, the government plays a significant role in preserving and improving passenger rail service in the United States.", "The National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program was implemented by the U.S. Air Force in 1995 to ensure access to space for critical national security missions. The program aimed to reduce launch costs and increase competition by selecting one company to design a cost-effective launch vehicle system. The program faced challenges such as reliance on a Russian rocket engine and cost increases, leading to legislative action and the renaming of the program to NSSL in 2019. The program now consists of four launch vehicles, Delta IV Heavy and Atlas V by United Launch Alliance (ULA), and Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy by SpaceX. Additionally, the Air Force awarded agreements to three space launch companies to develop NSSL launch system prototypes. The Air Force plans to award two Launch Service Procurement contracts in 2020 for national security satellite launches through 2027. The consolidation of launch providers has led to concerns about reduced competition and limited options for national space security missions. The EELV program, which preceded NSSL, aimed to reduce costs and improve reliability but faced challenges such as launch failures and the collapse of the commercial launch market. The program eventually led to the formation of ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which has provided space launches on a sole-source basis since 2006. The program's focus shifted from mission success to cost control and faced increasing costs due to instabilities in the launch industrial base. SpaceX entered the space launch market and became certified to compete for national security missions in 2005. In response, DOD adopted a new acquisition strategy in 2011 that included block-buys to stabilize the space launch industrial base and renewed competition in the program. The NSSL program aims to address these challenges and ensure affordable and reliable access to space for national security missions.", "Congress is interested in maintaining the pace of innovation and technological advancement in the US. They have historically supported research and development (R&D), but the landscape of innovation has changed, with private investments surpassing public investments, and the US share of global R&D declining. Some propose establishing agency-related entities that facilitate private donations in federally generated research projects. However, there are concerns about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks of these models. Quasi-governmental entities, which combine public and private characteristics, have been created in the past to address similar needs. They provide stable funding, flexibility, and business-like approaches to government functions, but there are concerns about accountability and transparency. Congress has less influence over quasi-governmental entities than conventional federal agencies, and private sector management techniques may not always be appropriate for government functions. This report discusses agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations that support R&D needs and foster public-private partnerships. It examines their purpose, governance, funding, and performance. Selected foundations are connected to agencies such as NIH, CDC, FDA, USDA, USU, and VA. Federally initiated venture capital firms are also mentioned. Examples are provided to illustrate these organizations' activities. The report concludes by identifying potential issues for oversight and consideration if Congress decides to establish similar organizations.", "Congress and the Trump administration are debating the funding and construction of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border. However, there is a lack of authoritative data on federal investment in border barriers. The history of U.S. enforcement of the border dates back to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, but efforts to construct barriers to deter illegal entry by migrants or smugglers began in the early 1990s. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 directed the installation of additional physical barriers, and the Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandated the construction of certain border barriers. Funding for these barriers has been included in various appropriations structures and has fluctuated over the years. The Trump administration's executive order in 2017 called for the immediate construction of a physical wall on the border. Changes in how funds are appropriated and organized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in recent years have made it difficult to compare funding levels between different time periods. In FY2017, the CBP implemented a new budget structure that eliminated the Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology (BSFIT) account and established the Wall Program, which oversees wall construction. The Trump administration requested additional funding for border wall construction in FY2018.", "The U.S. farm sector is diverse and encompasses various agricultural activities, including traditional field crops, livestock and poultry products, fruits, vegetables, and more. Farm income and rural economic conditions can vary across the United States due to regional factors. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service projects that net farm income will increase by 3.3% in 2020 to $96.7 billion, while net cash income is projected to decline by 10.8% to $109.6 billion. The difference between these measures is due to the treatment of harvested crops. Government farm subsidies are projected to decrease in 2020 but will still be the second-highest since 2006. Farm asset values and debt levels are expected to reach record levels in 2020. Major commodity prices are expected to be mixed in 2020, with some crops and livestock products increasing in price and others decreasing. The U.S. agricultural market has been affected by surplus stocks, adverse weather conditions, and international trade disputes in 2019, causing uncertainty for major commodities. The livestock sector shows signs of expansion, except for cattle, which may be starting to contract. The U.S. hog and poultry markets are expected to continue growing in 2020, but the demand needs to increase to avoid lower prices. Farm-sector revenue sources in 2020 include crop revenues, livestock receipts, government payments, and other farm-related income. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2020 is projected to decrease slightly to $430.9 billion. Crop sales are expected to increase by 1%, while livestock sales are expected to increase by 4.6%.", "The 116th Congress has shown interest in U.S. research and development (R&D) and evaluating support for federal R&D activities. The federal government plays an important role in supporting R&D efforts, but budget caps have affected R&D decisions in recent years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending, easing some budgetary constraints on R&D decisions. The federal government supports various scientific and engineering R&D purposes, including addressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security. Most of the R&D funded by the government is performed by individual funding agencies, and there is no centralized source of R&D funds. Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities and making decisions about the amount and allocation of R&D funding. President Trump's proposed FY2021 budget requests $142.2 billion for R&D, a decrease from the FY2020 level. The budget provides R&D funding for existing programs and activities as well as new initiatives. The report analyzes the President's FY2021 request for R&D funding at the government-wide, multiagency, and individual agency levels. It also examines the funding by the character of work supported and provides information on multiagency R&D initiatives.", "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. It includes a historical review of foreign aid levels, specific country programs, and current foreign aid issues. The report highlights that the MENA region is a major focus of U.S. foreign aid due to its strategic importance and ongoing conflicts. The largest recipients of U.S. aid in the region are Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. U.S. aid to these countries is primarily in the form of military assistance, aimed at maintaining stability and countering threats in the region. Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of economic assistance to address socio-economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of economic opportunities, which contribute to public dissatisfaction and unrest in the region. The report also discusses the Trump Administration's proposed budget request for FY2021, which includes a reduction in aid to certain MENA countries. It also highlights the Administration's decision to not request any aid for the Palestinians for the first time in over a decade. Finally, the report acknowledges the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the MENA region and the potential effects on U.S. and international assistance to the region.", "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a mandate that requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. Small refineries can be granted exemptions from the RFS if they can prove compliance would cause disproportionate economic hardship. The number of exemptions granted has increased in recent years, leading to debate among stakeholders. Some argue that the exemptions undermine biofuel demand and violate the statute, while others believe they alleviate economic burdens on refineries. This report provides an overview of small refinery exemptions, the exemption process, and recent RFS activity. It also summarizes congressional bills related to exemptions and presents other considerations. The report does not analyze the potential impact of legislative or executive actions.", "Coal mining in the United States throughout the 20th century led to the creation of unreclaimed lands. In 1977, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) was enacted to address the hazards caused by abandoned coal mining sites. The objective of reclamation under SMCRA is to restore the lands or waters affected by coal mining to mitigate potential hazards. Reclamation activities include stabilizing waste piles, re-vegetating lands, treating acid mine drainage, and more. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, established under SMCRA, provides funding to eligible states and tribes for reclamation efforts. The fund is funded by fees collected from coal mining operators. The fee rates are determined by the Secretary of the Interior and are based on a per-ton fee or a percentage value of the coal produced. The amount of funding received by states and tribes for reclamation projects depends on the fee collections. However, coal reclamation fees have declined since 2007 due to a decrease in coal production. SMCRA only applies to sites abandoned or left unreclaimed before the enactment of the law in 1977. States and tribes with lands affected by coal mining are eligible for grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund if they have an approved reclamation program. The program must meet federal requirements and can be more stringent than the federal standards. OSMRE administers grants to eligible states and tribes based on a formula that calculates their shares of coal reclamation fee receipts. Some states have already reclaimed all of their priority abandoned coal mining sites and have been certified by OSMRE, while others are still in the process of reclaiming their sites. Uncertified states receive grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, while certified states and tribes receive annual payments from the General Fund. The 2006 amendments to SMCRA authorized General Fund payments to certified states and tribes to prioritize the use of coal reclamation fees for abandoned coal mining site reclamation.", "This report discusses the roles and responsibilities of congressional staff members and the expectations that Members of Congress have for their staff. The report analyzes data from job advertisements posted by Members of Congress between 2014 and 2019 to identify the most commonly listed duties, skills, qualifications, and other expectations for 33 different staff positions. The data was collected from various sources, including the House Employment Bulletin, the Senate Employment Bulletin, and other online job banks. The report provides a breakdown of the positions and the frequency of their advertisements, as well as sample position descriptions that highlight the primary responsibilities, key duties, and applicant requirements for each position. However, it should be noted that the dataset may not be representative of all congressional employment solicitations, and there may be variations in duties and expectations across different congressional offices.", "The text discusses the process of congressional appropriations in the United States, specifically focusing on the actions taken for FY2019.
