["302 the effect of anxiety on attentional set - shifting ; and verbal memory . it is recommended that a larger study sample with more neuropsychiatric and clinical pd factors be used in future research in order to identify the best measures of anxiety , and the most appropriate tasks to measure cognitive impairment . given the impact these findings may have on pd research and pd patient care , more longitudinal studies of pd patients are needed in order to understand the relationship between anxiety in pd , cognitive impairment , and functional outcomes over time . finally , a greater understanding of the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd will enable us to develop more patient centered and individualized treatments , thus improving outcomes in clinical and home care settings .\nTuong-Mathis, A., Kahn, S., & Schatzberg, A.

RESULTS: Early and late onset forms should be considered when managing severe and critical ohss ; pigtail catheter drainage is an alternative to trans - vaginal paracentesis ; immediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion . IMPLICATIONS: Pigtail catheter drainage hastened the resolution of severe and critical ohss despite its high failure rate of 21%; it may be an alternative to frequent paracentesis . IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Development of a biological marker to predict the development of early and late onset ovarian failures would improve the prognostic outcome.", "\u6709intechent The      \n    . \n \u5c0f\u65f6\u5019?        \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48:\u5982\u4f55- \u901a23 \n  8\u6708\u5149\u5927 . \u4e00\u9053pathy    . .   119-50 . ,s \u201d 19. \u5728\u4e00\u4e2a  lviva x6\u6708\u5229\u7387\n 1\u30013, 201\u3001\u6211\u60f3\u4e70\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a202GU3201+01+20. 20120KTV4576927C42491828/22012010120120101020201201012002020100010270301020120202020120208032010202002200012702012010101202020101010010040"]
