Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: TEXT: According to the National Research Council, although the exact details cannot be predicted with certainty, climate change poses serious risks to many of the physical and ecological systems on which society depends. Moreover, according to key scientific assessments, the effects and costs of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts will increase in significance as what are considered rare events become more common and intense because of climate change. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, extreme weather events are directly traceable to loss of life, rising food and energy prices, increasing costs of disaster relief and insurance, fluctuations in property values, and concerns about national security. Table 1 shows seven effects commonly associated with climate change that DOD has documented. According to a 2010 National Research Council report on making informed decisions about climate change and our October 2009 report on climate change adaptation, most decision makers need a basic set of information to understand and make choices about how to adapt to the effects of climate change. This set of information includes information and analysis about observed climate conditions, information about observed climate effects and vulnerabilities, and projections of what climate change might mean for the local area. In November 2015, we found that in order for climate information to be useful, it must be tailored to meet the needs of each decision maker, such as an engineer responsible for building a bridge in a specific location, a county planner responsible for managing development over a larger region, or a federal official managing a national-scale program. Agencies across the federal government collect and manage many types of climate information, including observational records from satellites and weather monitoring stations on temperature and precipitation, among other things; projections from complex climate models; and tools to make this information more meaningful to decision makers. For example, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, completed in November 2018 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, references various sources of climate information, including projected temperature and precipitation data. Likewise, in 2016, a multi-agency group led by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) developed a report and accompanying database of future sea level projections and extreme water levels, which as of May 2019 contained sea level change projections for 1,813 DOD sites worldwide. Climate projections are typically a range of possible future scenarios for particular time frames. Multiple future scenarios allow for planners and engineers to see a range of possible conditions that could occur at various points in time. For example, a planner or engineer could consider four different future scenarios occurring over the course of 20, 40, or 60 years or over the service life of the project being designed. Figure 1 shows an example of sea level change projections provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Specifically, the chart shows historical mean sea levels and multiple scenarios of projected relative sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia. The chart shows the historical annual mean sea level from 1960 to 2018 through the bold black line. The projections use 2000 as a starting point, and so overlap with the historical data. Relative sea level rise takes into account changes in land levels\u2014in the Norfolk area the land is generally subsiding over time. Each scenario is based on different assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions, according to an official from NOAA\u2019s National Ocean Service. Planners and engineers can use the multiple scenarios to evaluate when potential effects could occur and determine their risk tolerances to inform their planning or design choices. Figure 2 similarly shows the same historical mean sea levels at Norfolk, Virginia, as well as the very likely range of projections of future relative sea levels, according to the National Ocean Service. This chart shows the range of possibilities considered very likely\u2014those between the low and intermediate scenarios in figure 1\u2014according to an official from NOAA\u2019s National Ocean Service.", "Summary of Text in Word Paragraph 300 Words, Include Reference Page other things. State licensing agencies. State agencies are typically the first line of response to allegations of resident abuse. State licensing agencies investigate and prosecute instances of nursing home abuse and make referrals to appropriate authorities. CMS. Under the federal regulation, nursing homes are required to report to CMS (1) allegations by residents of abuse; (2) substantiated allegations of resident abuse, exploitation, or neglect; (3) allegations involving the death of a resident, including in instances where the death cannot be verified; and (4) suspected incidents of abuse or neglect resulting in serious injury or that are under criminal investigation. As described above, the federal requirement has additional implications, namely that CMS must investigate substantiated abuse and, depending on the circumstances, may also refer the case to MFCUs and the state nurse aide registry. However, MFCUs may not use the list of reported allegations as the trigger for opening a matter involving suspected abuse. State nursing home quality improvement organizations. Quality improvement organizations (QIOs) are independent organizations that collaborate with and provide technical assistance to state survey agencies. QIOs review nursing home quality data, including complaint and incident data, but do not serve a frontline role in enforcing quality standards; QIOs use these data to identify practices and facilities where their expertise may improve performance. QIOs also act as a resource for nursing homes to support them in identifying areas where performance improvement opportunities exist and assist in improving their quality of care. Nursing homes are required to report substantiated incidents of neglect, abuse, or theft to the QIO serving their state. QIOs are required to implement a process to receive notifications from nursing homes and may use information submitted to them to inform CMS\u2019s investigation and enforcement activities. To maintain its Medicare certification, nursing homes must meet federal health and safety requirements. The failure to comply can lead to revocation of the facility\u2019s certification to participate in Medicare and Medicaid, termination from the Medicare program, and termination of certification agreements with private health insurance plans. The loss of federal funds could severely hamper a nursing home\u2019s ability to operate, further affecting the quality of care for the residents. Abuse by health professionals and other residents. \u201cPatient abuse\u201d includes any intentional actions by a caregiver with the intent to harm in any way. Patient abuse may involve physical or psychological harm to the resident. Physical abuse includes hitting, beating, shaking, choking, burning, bruising, excessive force, or the improper use of antipsychotics or restraints. Psychological abuse includes yelling, screaming, swearing, name-calling, isolating, restraining, or any other abusive or humiliating behavior. The abuse of patients by health professionals is particularly egregious. Health professionals are given special responsibility over the management of the nursing home resident, and because of this special status, courts tend to hold these professionals more accountable than other parties for the harm they cause residents. If a health professional harms a nursing home resident in the nursing home\u2019s care, the health professional should be held responsible for the harm. Abuse by a patient against a health professional or any resident of the facility does not justify a health professional responding in a harmful or inappropriate manner. Health professionals employed in nursing homes have a duty to act reasonably and professionally in managing the resident, and if a health professional chooses to take actions that harm a resident, the health professional is potentially liable for such actions. If the health professional causes harm, the health professional should be held accountable for the harm. The legal doctrine of comparative or contributory responsibility may arise if a resident\u2019s actions are the primary cause of the resulting harm. Comparative or contributory responsibility is a concept of defense that reduces a defendant\u2019s liability based on the plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault for the injury. It is applied when the plaintiff\u2019s actions make him or her partially responsible for the injury. Comparative or contributory responsibility is particularly strong when the injuries require an affirmative intentional act or knowledge of the danger, which tend to preclude the argument of comparative of contributory responsibility. For example, if the resident is a physical threat to herself or others, this may justify the imposition of restraints to protect the resident, other residents, and medical professionals. If during the restraint, a health professional injures the resident, comparative or contributory responsibility is a defense. The defense would not apply, however, if the restraint results in a worsening of the resident\u2019s physical condition. In such a case, the health professional must be held accountable for the worsening condition. Because each case is unique, the factual setting of the incident should be examined to determine the appropriate apportionment of responsibility. The use of antipsychotic medications. For many years, antipsychotic drugs were used to manage behavior in elderly nursing home patients. However, the unnecessary use of antipsychotic drugs has been the subject of scrutiny by CMS, resulting in a number of initiatives by the agency, including survey protocols to ensure that nursing homes have an appropriate, individualized approach to managing and", "In summary, mixed HLW stored in the IWTU is waste incidental to spent fuel reprocessing under DOE Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1.

The hospice provider offers a variety of different types of services in several settings, including in the patient\u2019s own home, where they are most often used. When enrolling in Medicare hospice care, beneficiaries can receive several different types of services in different settings. Hospice providers can receive daily or hourly payments based on the level of care provided to the patient. The payments are designed to cover all services provided in the routine hospice care setting, regardless of the number of services provided on a given day. There are two payment limitations on the Medicare payment of such services.

The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act, as amended, is the main federal law governing state child-care programs for low-income working families. 2. The act was reauthorized in 2014, and the reauthorization included a focus on improving the overall quality of child- care services and development of participating children. 3. In September 2016, OCC published new rules (CCDF regulations) to provide clarity to states on how to implement this law and administer the program in a way that best meets the needs of children, child-care providers, and families. 4. The CCDBG Act and CCDF regulations allow states flexibility in developing CCDF programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within that state. 5. According to OCC, these new rules also align child-care requirements with new Head Start regulations, including certain requirements for background checks, annual monitoring, and prelicensure inspections for some CCDF providers. 6. OCC also added regulatory requirements for state lead agencies to describe in their State Plans effective internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability including 1. processes to ensure sound fiscal management, 2. processes to identify areas of risk, 3. processes to train child-care providers and staff of the lead agency and other agencies engaged in the administration of the CCDF about program requirements and integrity, and 4. regular evaluation of internal control activities. 7. Lead agencies are also required to describe in their State Plans the processes that are in place to identify fraud or other program violations, and to investigate and recover fraudulent payments and to impose sanctions in response to fraud. 8. OCC is a program office within ACF that works with the states to administer the CCDF program. OCC and states each have responsibility for overseeing and protecting the integrity of the CCDF program. Each state must develop, and submit to OCC for approval, a State Plan that identifies the purposes for which CCDF funds will be spent for a 3-year grant period and designates a lead agency responsible for administering child-care programs. 9. To administer CCDF funds, federal law and regulations require that states report their CCDF expenditures and data on the number of children served by CCDF subsidies. The current reporting structure as described by OCC and ACF officials is shown in figure 1. 10. To request funding from the CCDF, states submit a State Plan for administering their CCDF programs to OCC. OCC provides states with a Plan Preprint, which serves as a template and includes instructions and guidance on developing the State Plans and providing information required by law and regulations. 11. Further, OCC has used the Plan Preprint to request additional information from the states. 12. The Plan Preprint developed for fiscal years 2019\u20132021 State Plans consists of eight sections and is the first to include the new CCDF regulatory requirements, added in September 2016 as required by the 2014 reauthorization..", "PMIAA was established to improve program and project management in certain larger federal agencies. It requires OMB and agencies to adopt standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management. OMB is responsible for conducting a Portfolio Management Review (PMR) of all agency programs to identify and address any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the program management system, which OMB must submit to Congress. It requires the establishment of a 5year strategic plan. Additionally, PMIAA establishes the Program Management Policy Council (PMPC), an interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program management.

The benefit is based on an average reduction in earning capacity across a group of individuals with similar physical or mental impairments. The amount paid is based on the severity of the service-connected condition and is awarded in 10 percent increments. A veteran may claim multiple conditions and a rating percentage is assigned to each. VA pays about $78 billion in monthly benefits to over 4 million veterans. The employment status and earnings of the veteran are not factored in the disability rating and subsequent base pay. The process for determining eligibility and the rating percentage is based on the evidence supporting the veteran\u2019s claim. 2018 GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY Office 77 not have (to sufficient or full extent) the necessary capability of VA facilities to perform required medical services, or they may live outside a geographic area covered by a VA medical facility. Under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, the law authorizes VHA to enter into agreements with non-VA health care providers and purchase health care services for veterans facing prolonged or unreasonable waiting times for access to care or living far from a VA facility. During the past decade, veterans obtaining health care in the Veterans Choice program paid through non-VA health care facilities experienced longer wait times for appointments compared with veterans obtaining health care through VA facilities. While wait times improved in fiscal year 2017, wait times in the Veterans Choice program were 3 and 4 days longer for general medical appointments and 2.2 days longer for specialty care appointments, compared with wait times in VA facilities. In addition, wait times to see a mental health provider improved by about 8 minutes in fiscal year 2017. Differences in wait times could be due to changes in the types of health care appointments provided by VA and non-VA providers, improvements in VA\u2019s internal wait-times data collection and analysis, differences in the types of health care received by Choice program enrollees versus VA enrollees, and other possible factors. Factors that could contribute to differences in wait times include: provider availability and scheduling policies; patient complexity and number of appointments needed; resource constraints; and differences in the types and complexity of health care provided at VA and non-VA facilities. Veterans generally can obtain VA health care for medical conditions unrelated to their service. Exceptions include treatment of injuries incurred during service, illnesses incurred while training for service, and medical treatment related to exposure to radiation and some chemicals from service. The Choice Act authorized VHA, as part of non-emergency care obtained by veterans in the Choice program for medical conditions related to a veteran\u2019s service, to reimburse non-VA acute-care providers in the same amount as VA paid to its own providers. For fiscal year 2018, VHA expects to pay non-VA providers $46.3 billion in fees and other costs, $4.5 billion of which is related to the non-VA costs incurred when VA reimburses non-VA providers using a fee schedule. Although VHA reported that the Veterans Choice program allowed it to avoid long wait times and distance required to travel to clinics, program costs were significantly higher in the Veterans Choice program compared with the costs for VA direct care. According to VHA\u2019s evaluations, there is no clear evidence to indicate whether the program improved access to health care. However, VHA reported that in fiscal year 2017, 97 percent of Choice program enrollees rated their overall experience with the program as \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cvery satisfactory.\u201d VHA\u2019s evaluations showed that a substantial number of veterans had access to specialty health care either more quickly or within a shorter distance from home in VHA facilities than in non-VA facilities. In June 2017, GAO found that VA had made improvements in its administration of the Veterans Choice program. VHA, for example, had improved the payment process, improved the management of provider networks, and significantly improved the electronic medical records transfer process. From December 2014 to November 2017, veterans using the Choice program made over 1.2 million appointments. Over 9,400 veterans, or 0.8 percent, reported they were not able to make an appointment. For 90 percent of Choice program enrollees, VA was able to schedule appointments within 3 days of their preferred start. 2018 GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY Office 78 VHA manages VA\u2019s health- care system through 154 VA medical centers, 1,100 community-based outpatient clinics, 327 community health centers, and several large ambulatory care operations that offer walk-in patient registration, extended hours, and weekend care. The health care system is authorized to furnish hospital and nursing home care, medications, and specialized medical treatment services to approximately 9 million enrolled veterans and other beneficiaries. VHA operates 21 specialized inpatient facilities for veterans with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and certain mental-health conditions.

TEXT: TEXT: \u201cThe F nonimmigrant visa (F visa) is a visa that allows international students to enter the United States for academic study, language training, and cultural exchange experiences. F visas allow individuals to be admitted as a regular student to a college, high school, elementary school, or private elementary school. To receive an F visa, an applicant must be registered in an academic or language training program in the United States and intend to pursue such studies for a specific course of academic or academic specialization in a high school or U.S.-accredited elementary school, or vocational school (including the English language). F-1 and M-1 are subprograms with requirements identical to the J program but for high school and vocational school, respectively. There are approximately 37,700 nonimmigrants in the United States who hold F-1 academic and vocational visas, and another almost 13,200 such nonimmigrants whose visas have expired. In addition, more than 9,900 nonimmigrants come to the United States with M-1 academic visas, and over 2,800 such nonimmigrants whose visas have expired. \u201cNonimmigrant students may study in the United States while on vacation status which means you can go home or travel abroad during breaks in your studies. You will need to request permission from USCIS to study in the United States on vacations. You are only permitted to have vacation status for a total of 12 months in the degree program. \u201cTo obtain a nonimmigrant student visa, you must have a Form I-20, valid passport, and proof of financial resources. The student visa cannot be issued any more than 120 days before the start of classes. However, you may enter the United States 30 days prior to the start of classes with a valid Form I-20. \u201cWhen you arrive in the United States, you must attend the school listed on your Form I-20, maintain full-time status in an educational institution, and study at that institution or transfer to a college or university listed on the Form I-20. You may enroll in English classes offered by the institution or outside firms. You must inform the school of any changes in your class schedule within 10 days. The school must file a report with USCIS within 21 days after your termination, change of status, completion of studies, or any violation of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. \u201cYou must report to USCIS within 30 days of any address change and notify the institution within 10 days of any change in the institution or course of study. Your foreign born children must attend school full time. \u201cYou may travel abroad while studying in the United States, but you must have a valid passport, a valid visa and a valid Form I-20 to reenter the United States. You may not work off-campus without authorization from USCIS. You may work on-campus. However, you must obtain authorization from an employment eligibility card or from a USCIS field office before undertaking off-campus employment for one or more specified employ- ers. Your spouse or child may work only after obtaining employment authorization from USCIS, unless the employment is on- campus. \u201cYou must inform USCIS of a transfer to another school before the current school releases your records or enrollment. USCIS must approve new course of study and a new exchange visitor program before issuance of a new Form I-20. You have a choice to transfer to an- other school if you are in good academic standing. Your I-20 must include the new school's name before the institution may issue a transfer release. USCIS must approve the transfer. \u201cThere are limited jobs available after graduation and some may require the skills and knowledge gained while working during your student years. There are approximately 37,700 nonimmigrants in the United States who hold F-1 academic and vocational visas, and over 9,900 individuals who come to the United States with M-1 academic visas. An aggregate number of over 50,000 F and M visas were issued to applicants from all over the world, including China and Japan. The number of visas in the F, M, and H categories has increased since Fiscal Year 2000, rising 20 percent since then. An estimated 7,200 H-1B visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2015 according to the White House. Foreign workers in the Information Technology (IT) industry, who are often temporary foreign workers (e.g., H-1B or L visa holders), have expanded the technology industry's workforce.

Zika can cause birth defects, including microcephaly; and other severe brain defects. Zika can also cause other health problems, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health professionals are working to develop a vaccine to prevent Zika, but as of now, there is no approved vaccine. Zika spread rapidly in the Americas and overseas in 2015 and 2016, prompting the United States and other countries to respond with medical and health interventions. In the United States, we focused on preventing infection, such as through community education and control of mosquitoes. Globally, we expanded prevention efforts, especially in countries where Zika spread rapidly. We helped coordinate a United Nations\u2013led international response and worked through U.S. embassies and foreign governments to address the health and economic challenges of Zika. We mobilized funds and staff, and supported surveillance, research, and the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapies. 2 Figure 1: Zika Timeline Figure 2: Cumulative Zika Incidence Rates in Each Country in Latin America and the Caribbean from 2015 to 2017 Figure 3: USAID and State Zika Response Funding Source: GAO analysis of U.S. Zika response data and documentation.

In", "The United Nation\u2019s International Labor Organization found nearly 10% of workers employed in Thailand\u2019s seafood sector experienced conditions of forced labor. This report indicates that tens of thousands of workers in Thailand\u2019s fishing and seafood processing industries are working in forced labor conditions. Fishing activities are vulnerable to a wide range of illicit practices including IUU fishing and forced labor activities. The Food and Agriculture Organization has also identified common indicators of forced labor in any work sector that could indicate the existence of forced labor. IUU fishing represents a threat to food security and socioeconomic stability in many parts of the world and many crew members on fishing vessels are from poor or underdeveloped areas. For example, activities of those engaging in IUU fishing can constitute or lead to organized crime and other crimes such as human trafficking. Forced labor in the seafood supply chain may occur during various stages such as harvesting and processing. In addition, complex seafood supply chains may have an additional layer of complexity because low-value fish may not be directly exported but used as feed for farm- raised seafood. CBP officials also noted that the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of goods made with forced labor; under TFTEA goods found to be produced with forced labor are prohibited from importation. The U.S. government administers and enforces a number of import and trade control statutes including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Lacey Act. CBP has also made a finding that \u201cforced labor constitutes a violation of section 307 of the Act prohibiting importation into the U.S.\u201d and published a formal finding which serves to block import of certain seafood.", "WHAT ROLE WOULD YOU PLAY IN ADDING VALUE TO ORGANIZATION OF THE INFORMATION GIVEN \nI would summarize the text given by highlighting and consolidating key pieces of information.

USDA also accepted the decisions because the information technology services provided within the business centers are not mission- critical, so they were not included in the administrative services USDA expects business centers to provide. In addition, because the mission area already had good internal controls, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration said that the arrangement should be okay. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration said that he has asked his staff to monitor the performance of the arrangement closely and, if he determines through performance reviews that it no longer meets the expectations, he may change it. Overall, our review found that for each of the five types of administrative services that USDA business centers are to provide, the Department has designated or intends to designate a mission area or major staff office to be the provider of that service. In doing so, the Department has established, or designated already established business centers where applicable, as service providers for each of the five service types. Moreover, and as the Secretary\u2019s November 2017 memorandum directed, the Department has moved most administrative services in each mission area and major staff office to the business center. We note, however, that while the Department is providing administrative services at the mission area level for all eight mission areas, in some mission areas, administrative services are still being provided primarily at the agency component level or are being provided directly by agency components. Based on our interviews with USDA officials, mission area leaders and staff, and a survey of USDA mission area managers, our assessment is that at several mission areas, there has been confusion at the mission area level regarding the business center\u2019s role and responsibility. According to USDA officials at several mission areas, there has been confusion regarding the business center\u2019s role and responsibility to provide specific administrative services and information technology services at the program-level. 5 According to these officials, in some cases, component agencies were initially responsible for providing certain types of administrative services and some mission area managers directed their staff to provide some administrative services through the component agencies or directly. These issues came to light as USDA was in the process of implementing the requirements of the Secretary\u2019s November 2017 memorandum. USDA leadership, including the Deputy Under Secretary for Operations, confirmed that component agencies can and should still perform core line activities, which would likely include providing administrative services that USDA agencies provide to non-federal customers or as a result of congressionally mandated research or inspection activities. These activities, according to our understanding of USDA operations, represent the core mission of each USDA agency, and are provided to ensure the integrity of USDA\u2019s programs. The mission area business centers are not responsible for supporting the core agencies\u2019 mission- essential functions. Further, if a component agency or agency employee continues to provide administrative services that the mission area business center is responsible for, this represents an opportunity for potential cost savings or improved efficiency if the mission area business center identifies that the component agency or agency employee is providing a service that can be provided more efficiently by the mission area business center. Given the potential for confusion over responsibilities and opportunities for potential benefits, we believe it is important for USDA to clearly communicate the roles of the mission area business centers and the component agencies. 1. USDA Has Implemented the Secretary\u2019s November 2017 Memorandum to Consolidate Business Centers for Most Administrative Services. USDA has established or designated most administrative services in each mission area and major staff office to be provided by mission area business centers. However, for some mission areas, USDA has designated previously existing business entities. According to 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.0, administrative functions that meet the definition of \u201dadministrative services\u201d in subpart H include providing \u201chuman resources, information technology services, financial management, procurement and contracting, [and] property management services.\u201d See GAO-21-45.

Figure 1 shows how many operators were self-insured or commercially insured at the time of bankruptcy, and if responsibility for benefits was shifted from the bankrupt operator to the Trust Fund. Federal law generally requires coal mine operators to secure their black lung benefit liability. A self-insured coal mine operator assumes the financial responsibility for providing black lung benefits to its eligible employees by paying claims as they are incurred. Operators are allowed to self-insure if they meet certain DOL conditions. For instance, operators applying to self-insure must obtain collateral in the form of an indemnity bond, deposit or trust, or letter of credit in an amount deemed necessary and sufficient by DOL to secure their liability. Operators that do not self-insure are generally required to obtain coverage from commercial insurance companies, state workers\u2019 compensation insurance funds, or other entities authorized under state law to insure workers\u2019 compensation. From 2014 through 2016, three self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies resulted in a transfer of $865 million of benefit liabilities from the coal operators to the Trust Fund, according to DOL estimates (see table 1). DOL estimates for how these bankruptcies will affect the Trust Fund have considerably increased from what DOL had previously reported. In June 2019, we reported that DOL estimated that between $313 million to $325 million in benefit liabilities would transfer to the Trust Fund as a result of these bankruptcies. In January 2020, however, DOL provided updated estimates stating that $865 million in benefit liabilities would transfer to the Trust Fund as a result of these bankruptcies. According to DOL, their estimates increased, among other reasons, to account for higher black lung benefit award rates that occurred from fiscal years 2016 through 2019, and higher medical treatment cost inflation in recent years. Additionally, DOL\u2019s prior estimate for the Patriot Coal (Patriot) bankruptcy did not account for future claims and their effect on the Trust Fund. The amount of collateral DOL required from these operators to self-insure did not fully cover their estimated benefit liabilities. When this occurs, benefit liabilities in excess of the collateral can be transferred to the Trust Fund. For example, the collateral DOL required from Alpha Natural Resources (Alpha) was about $12 million and approximately $494 million of estimated benefit liability transferred to the Trust Fund, according to DOL. The three other self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies we identified did not affect the Trust Fund. Specifically, Arch Coal, Peabody Energy, and Walter Energy were also self-insured operators, but DOL officials said that their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a reorganized company or by a purchaser, and therefore did not transfer to the Trust Fund. Insurance contracts or policies to secure operators\u2019 benefit liabilities are required by law to include a provision that insolvency or bankruptcy of an operator does not release the insurer from the obligation to make benefit payments. Additionally, state insurance regulation, insurer underwriting, risk management practices, and state guaranty funds help to protect the Trust Fund from having to assume responsibility for paying black lung benefits on behalf of bankrupt coal operators.", "The text is a summary of state and local governments' tax revenue and expenditures.

According to officials from OFAC and other partner agencies, key goals of the Kingpin Act include disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations and blocking designees\u2019 access to the U.S. financial system.\nBased on the provided text, what are the six steps involved in identifying and designating individuals or entities as significant foreign narcotics traffickers under the Kingpin Act, and how does each step contribute to achieving the key goals of the Act?\nThe six steps involved in identifying and designating individuals or entities as significant foreign narcotics traffickers under the Kingpin Act are as follows: 1. OFAC and its partner agencies group Kingpin Act designation categories into two tiers, Tier 1 and Tier 2, based on the procedures required for identification and designation under the act. 2. The names of persons and entities designated are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into Treasury\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). 3. Blocking assets. Treasury blocks a designated individual's and entity's property and interests in property within the United States or within the possession or control of any United States individuals or entities that are owned or controlled by the blocked individual or entity. 4. Prohibiting transactions. Treasury generally prohibits U.S. individuals and entities from engaging in transactions in property or interests in property of designees. 5. Denying visas. Treasury provides information to State so it can decide whether to cancel existing visas and deny visa applications of Kingpin Act designees. 6. Penalties for nondesignees. Treasury may enforce criminal and civil penalties for any U.S. person who willfully violates the prohibitions in the Kingpin Act, associated regulations, or license rules.\n\nEach of these steps is a crucial component in achieving the key goals of the Kingpin Act, which include disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations and blocking designees' access to the U.S. financial system. Blocking assets of designated individuals and entities forces them to give up their illicit gains and disrupts their operations by denying them access to their financial resources. Prohibiting transactions with designated individuals and entities eliminates their ability to profit from their criminal activities through business dealings with U.S. companies and individuals. Denying visas to designated individuals and entities ensures that they cannot travel freely to the U.S., and if they do enter the country, they are easily identifiable and trackable. The threat of penalties for violating the prohibitions of the Kingpin Act serves as a deterrent to U.S. businesses and banks that may be tempted to conduct transactions with designated individuals and entities.\n\nIn summary, the six steps involved in identifying and designating individuals or entities as significant foreign narcotics traffickers under the Kingpin Act are essential in achieving the key goals of the Act. Each step contributes to disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations, blocking access to the U.S. financial system, and preventing profits from illicit activities. Together, these steps serve as a comprehensive approach to combatting drug trafficking and promoting national security.", "USPS faces financial challenges due to declining mail volumes, increased pension and compensation costs, and increasing debt. Legislation designed to make USPS self-sustaining requires enhanced accountability and transparency. 3 of 7 to the changing market, such as consolidating mail processing facilities (locally known as mail processing centers). In some areas, USPS has reduced processing facilities from six or seven to three or fewer. This consolidation has generally had some success in reducing costs while serving customers across the country. However, USPS\u2019s cost and revenue models, which are based on a fixed infrastructure that is no longer economically viable, need to be modernized to address the ongoing loss of letter volume and increased competition due to the rise of e-commerce. Moreover, USPS has been unable to reduce its compensation costs because its employee contracts are negotiated with large postal unions, and current labor law requires that USPS use the postal rate formula as the starting point for negotiations. When this formula does not allow for sufficient pay increases, USPS is not authorized to change compensation and benefit policies\u2014including wages, work rules, and benefits\u2014until the issue is resolved in collective bargaining. This requirement has hindered USPS\u2019s ability to control its costs and adjust its operations to meet declining revenue. For instance, USPS has been unable to require employees to work more than eight hours, even on weekend days when mail volume would justify it. Additionally, the postal rate formula allows for an annual cost-of-living adjustment to the base pay of mail carriers and other retail employees, which is not tied to performance, meaning that productivity gains do not result in an increase in pay. While federal employees in other agencies pay 6.2 percent of their base pay toward their retirement benefits through the Federal Employee Retirement System, this percentage is more than 11 percent for USPS employees, as the formula requires this additional contribution to help fund USPS\u2019s obligations under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) programs. Therefore, USPS has been limited in its ability to reduce labor costs except through attrition or work-force reductions that require congressional approval. In addition, the use of CSRS and FERS pension plans has also significantly added to USPS\u2019s personnel costs. These pension programs are no longer offered in the private sector. Further, health and retirement benefits for postal retirees have been a significant source of unfunded liabilities and debt for USPS, in part because of the early retirement benefits offered to USPS employees. Prior to 2001, USPS employees were eligible to retire after thirty years of service, regardless of age. This retirement provision led to a sizeable number of employees retiring prior to reaching retirement age under the Social Security program\u2019s full retirement age. The benefits they receive from CSRS and FERS programs are subject to the Social Security Earnings Test, and they have the option of receiving Social Security benefits early. The result was that retirees were collecting both early Social Security benefits as well as full CSRS/FERS retirement benefits, resulting in higher-than-anticipated liability payments to USPS. According to a 2013 Office of the Inspector General report, the USPS early-retirement provisions have generated roughly $13 billion in early-retirement costs between fiscal years 2005 and 2013. USPS retirees also receive health care coverage and dental and vision benefits. These benefits are not covered by Social Security and are not part of CSRS/FERS pensions. USPS has reported a net pension-obligation liability of $47.1 billion as of September 30, 2019. Because its unfunded liability is increasing faster than its annual revenue, and because it has only a small surplus to pay its obligations beyond FY 2020 due to a statutory limit on the amount of money that can be held in a positive net worth position, USPS will have to make difficult decisions beginning in FY 2021, when it is expected that its net operating loss will exceed its available cash and its net worth obligation. Postal leadership has raised concerns that FY 2020 and beyond will see a cash crisis for USPS. On February 7, 2020, the USPS Board of Governors met to discuss actions needed to be taken due to USPS\u2019s cash crisis. While USPS continues to face financial challenges, it has made progress on its business model through enhanced revenue opportunities, cost-control strategies, and increased efficiency. USPS\u2019s financial challenges, however, create a need to modernize its business model for the digital age, particularly as USPS provides essential services in rural and remote areas of the nation where universal delivery has always been a crucial aspect of American life. In the immediate term, USPS has implemented measures to improve its financial position, but these actions are not expected to provide a sufficient long-term solution. This report highlights areas where additional revenue could come from, as well as areas where cost savings could occur through greater efficiencies. These suggested areas for improvement include: expanding digital operations and revenue opportunities, creating a legislative-defined mission, increasing cost savings, expanding strategic partnerships in key areas", "PRODUCTION OF MICROELECTRONICS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2022 DOD and the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) design and produce microelectronics for nuclear weapons at two facilities\u2014the MESA Complex at Sandia and the Texas Electronics Manufacturing Facility at DOE/NNSA\u2019s Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. \u2022 Sandia produces microelectronics for most DOE/NNSA military weapon and stockpile activities.

Page 2 GAO-18-37 Biological Detection Systems, and (4) improving biodefense capabilities across interdependent sectors including the health care and agriculture industries. To address these biodetection challenges, many biodetection-related activities have been implemented by the biological defense enterprise. These activities span a wide range of programs, capabilities, and technologies with numerous federal departments, agencies, and partners contributing. Our consolidated database of 17 biodetection programs listed on the biodefense website of the Department of Homeland Security includes a total of 56 subprograms or efforts; 8 are under the purview of the Department of Defense (see fig.2). Of the 9 interagency programs, 7 are co-led by the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Defense. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services leads efforts that coordinate activities across the other agencies involved in biodetection as well as with intersectoral partners, and the Department of Justice plays a supporting role in some initiatives. Interagency efforts have led to advances in biodetection capabilities; for example, the White House in May 2009 released the National Strategy for Biodefense which outlined the nation\u2019s priority areas to address biological threats, including the detection, attribution, and characterization of biological agents. Following publication of the strategy, interagency partners undertook efforts to develop a national roadmap for strategic implementation; this roadmap includes specific objectives and goals related to biodetection, including the establishment of Centers for Innovation in Biodefense that were intended to promote biodefense innovation. Efforts like this have led to real benefits and improvements such as in 2010, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established a Bioforensic Analysis Center (BAC) at the National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases (NCBID) at Georgetown University (see fig. 3). The BAC supports federal law enforcements agencies in cases related to intentional bioterrorism, such as in the use of ricin. In June 2015, it identified and provided FBI with evidence related to ricin that the suspect had used in the New Hampshire case; it was a new source that helped convict the suspect. This center is an example of one effort to develop technology that enhances bioforensic analysis and attribution capabilities. In the agriculture arena, the Departments of Homeland Security and Agriculture have developed a biological threat early warning system known as the Phytosanitary Import Risk Evaluation System. This system has improved the detection of plant pests and diseases that may have harmful economic effects on the agricultural sector. The system allows experts on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Plant Protection and Quarantine Program to review data, communicate with experts via video link and satellite, and determine whether specific plants and diseases pose a threat to U.S. agriculture. Additionally, DHS\u2019s Biothreat Integration Center (BITC) is designated as the national integrator for biological incidents. BITC\u2019s role includes developing and evaluating national biological incident response objectives, identifying gaps and establishing priorities and coordinating with federal departments, agencies, and international and nongovernmental partners. Additionally, we have previously reported on a number of efforts to enhance biodefense laboratory safety. One of these, the Select Agent Security Program, establishes security standards for laboratories that possess dangerous biological agents or toxins (select agents) and supports inspection activities of facilities that fall under the oversight of the Department of Health and Human Services. To help enhance laboratory safety, the Department of Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) inspects each facility listed under the program to meet requirements under their Chemical Safety Orders. ATF inspectors visit laboratories on average approximately four times per year to ensure continuous compliance. The inspections can include assessing the security of biological and technical areas, as well as reviewing select agent inventories and conducting interviews with laboratory personnel. This report provides examples of the following elements that contribute to the nation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to biological incidents: (1) Biodetection efforts have achieved advances in many technology areas that have had benefits. (2) Interagency coordination is occurring among federal departments, agencies, and intersectoral partners in the biological defense enterprise. (3) DHS\u2019s Biothreat Integration Center is the national integrator for biological incidents and there are other efforts that address emerging threats, but opportunities to further optimize and prioritize activities may exist. (4) The federal government has developed specific security standards for laboratories that possess dangerous biological agents or toxins. While these efforts are ongoing, we made no specific recommendations in this report, but rather continue to believe that biodefense reform is necessary and to have repeatedly made recommendations toward that end. We also recommended efforts to improve the use of a national roadmap to guide biodefense", "I", "The summary presents the text on drawback refunds and CBP practices, including manufacturing, unused merchandise, and rejected merchandise drawback refunds to provide an overview of the topic.", "trauma or adverse childhood experiences may include physical and sexual abuse, neglect, bullying, community-based violence, extreme poverty, the loss of a parent or primary caretaker, or natural disasters, among other things. These experiences may overwhelm a child\u2019s natural ability to cope and can cause stress reactions in children, including feelings of intense fear, terror, and helplessness. When children are exposed to chronic stressful events, their neurodevelopment can be disrupted. As a result, a child\u2019s cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired, causing long-term harm to their physical, social, and emotional well-being. These adverse effects may include changes in a child\u2019s emotional responses; ability to think, learn, and concentrate; impulse control; self-image; attachments to caregivers; and relationships with others. Traumatic experiences have been linked to a wide range of health-related conditions, including addiction, depression and anxiety, and risk-taking behavior, and may also increase the likelihood of chronic ill health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and even early death. Not all children will experience all of these effects. Children\u2019s responses to traumatic events are unique and affected by many factors, including their age at the time of the event, the frequency and perceived severity of trauma, and the child\u2019s innate sensitivity, as well as protective factors such as the presence of positive relationships with healthy caregivers, physical health, and natural coping skills. While all children can be affected by trauma, trauma is common among children who enter the child welfare system. Many of these children have been abused or neglected, and involvement in the child welfare system, primarily through placements into a foster care home, may cause additional trauma due to the separation from family; changes in school placement, neighborhood, and community; and fear and uncertainty about the future. Child welfare experts generally believe that child welfare systems that use trauma-informed approaches are better able to address children\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being needs. Although trauma-informed frameworks may vary, they generally include interventions as well as a change in culture; thus if an agency or organization is taking a trauma-informed approach, it is incorporating knowledge of trauma and its effects into its policies, procedures, and practices. A trauma-informed child welfare system may offer services to help identify and mitigate the effects of trauma, including screening and assessing children for trauma, and providing or referring children to services. These approaches may produce improved outcomes for children in the child welfare system, including fewer children requiring crisis services, such as residential treatment, and fewer foster home placements, placement disruptions, and reentries into foster care. Other trauma-informed approaches may result in reduced lengths of stay in foster care and improved child functioning and increased well-being. In addition to child welfare agencies, school staff and members of the school community can play a key part in recognizing and responding to children who have experienced trauma. In a 2017 report on child well-being, GAO reported that an expert noted that health and human service agencies are not the only entities needed to address child well-being and suggested that community stakeholders work together to determine what resources are needed for the children in their community. A trauma- informed school, characterized by an understanding and a commitment of teachers and staff to an awareness of how trauma affects students, is an example of a coordinated approach to trauma. Trauma-informed teachers and staff are aware of trauma\u2019s impact on students\u2019 behavior, their relationships, their ability or inability to self-regulate behavior, and how it contributes to their classroom behavior. Specific elements of a trauma- informed school may include addressing and treating traumatic stress, developing partnerships with students and families, evaluating and revising school discipline policies and practices, and creating a trauma- informed learning environment. Federal agencies, academic institutions, and community-based treatment centers have generated evidence-based trauma treatments that clinicians and therapists can use when working with children and their families. See table 1 for examples of treatments. Recent studies have also found that trauma-informed approaches that are infused into the practices and work of child welfare and school staff can help children, their families, and others. While these studies are limited in terms of the number of participants, they indicate the positive effects of including trauma-informed approaches into the work of child welfare staff and educators. For example, one study that used child welfare administrative data for about 1,500 children from Kansas found that implementing a trauma-informed approach was associated with improved child well-being and placement stability for children in foster care. Another study of two public child welfare agencies that involved 52 children, as well as child welfare staff, mental health providers, and foster parents and kinship caregivers, suggests, among other things, that fewer children exited foster homes for negative reasons, such as running away or moving to a group home, when families were trained in a trauma-informed approach.", "Your text\nYour text\nYour text\nYour text\nYour text\nYour text.", "VHA manages one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States and is responsible for overseeing the provision of health care at VA medical facilities.

The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms\u2014collectively known as the ship repair industrial base\u2014to perform repair and maintenance work. Non-major maintenance availabilities can range from a few weeks to years. The MAC-MO strategy for contract award and availability execution differs from prior strategies, such as MSMO, in several important ways. The Navy typically awards IDIQ contracts for availabilities expected to last fewer than 10 months, and stand-alone contracts for those expected to last 10 months or more. Competition requirements vary between the two types of contracts. Availability management involves planning and execution of availabilities and includes contract procurement and management. The Navy has implemented a MAC-MO strategy for nonnuclear surface ship repair and maintenance, including the use of IDIQ contracts and non-major maintenance availabilities that last up to 10 months. We found that the Navy faces challenges, including potential changes to the contractor labor mix at selected home ports for maintenance availabilities under MAC-MO.

Their households may subscribe to in-home fixed internet, which is generally provided by cable television or telephone companies. School-age children, and other users, can connect a variety of devices to in-home fixed service through a wired connection or a Wi-Fi connection. They may also access the internet through mobile wireless service, which is provided through cell towers, with data transmitted over radio frequency spectrum. Mobile service providers usually sell internet access as an option in mobile telephone-service plans. A number of devices may connect to mobile wireless, such as smart phones, tablets, and mobile devices that enable laptops to connect to mobile wireless service. Finally, school-age children and others may access the internet outside the home through other ways, including publicly available Wi-Fi access at places such as libraries and coffee shops. FCC has found that Americans in lower-income areas are less likely to have access to both in-home fixed and mobile wireless internet than those in higher-income areas. Similarly, according to our analysis of data from the November 2017 CPS: Computer and Internet Use Supplement, among all school-age children, those in lower-income households are less likely to use the internet at home than those in higher-income households. A number of factors explain the digital divide, or the varying levels of access among different populations. For example, as we have reported in the past, rural areas tend to have conditions such as low population density or difficult terrain that can increase the costs for internet providers to deploy and maintain internet networks. Furthermore, lower-income households with access to the necessary infrastructure for internet service may not be able to afford it. While some in-home fixed internet providers offer low-cost service for lower-income households with school-age children, according to a 2016 survey, an estimated 5 percent of households with school-age children ages 6 to 13 and incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines had ever signed up for such programs. Lower rates of internet access by lower-income households may make it more difficult for school-age children in those households to do homework. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey, a higher percentage of surveyed teens in lower-income households said that the lack of a dependable computer or internet connection sometimes prevents them from finishing their homework compared to teens in higher-income households. In addition, according to the Consortium for School Networking, the lack of in-home access makes it more difficult for parents to support their children academically. Specifically, as much communication between schools and parents has moved online, the lack of access may make it difficult for parents to stay connected to teachers and be informed about school notices, homework assignments, and other important information. FCC, which regulates commercial and other nonfederal spectrum, conducts activities that affect the ability of schools to address the homework gap. Specifically, it plays a role in expanding internet access by assigning licenses for Educational Broadband Service (EBS) spectrum, which permits schools and other eligible entities to transmit educational materials electronically. Currently, EBS license holders are allowed to lease excess capacity to others, including commercial wireless providers, for up to 30 years as long as the license holder has 20 hours of educational use per week per licensed channel and reserve the right to access 5 percent of the capacity for educational use. Schools that have such leases may need to wait years to regain full use of their EBS license. Furthermore, the last opportunity for school districts to apply for new EBS licenses was in 1995, and according to FCC, EBS licenses cover about half the geographic area of the United States, with rural areas west of the Mississippi River generally lacking licenses. However, FCC recently adopted a Report and Order with rules that, once effective, will change the eligibility requirements for EBS licenses, among other things. In addition, FCC supports internet investments at schools through the E- rate program, which provides discounts on telecommunications and internet access services, internal connections, and basic maintenance of internal connections. This program provides schools with higher percentages of lower-income students greater discounts on these services; for example, the most disadvantaged schools, where at least 75 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price school lunch, receive a 90 percent discount. All services supported by the E-rate program must be used primarily for \u201ceducational purposes,\u201d which FCC has defined as meaning \u201cactivities that are integral, immediate, and proximate to the education of students.\u201d Education\u2019s Office of Educational Technology also plays a role related to internet access for students by developing national educational- technology policies and providing guidance to schools and school districts on technology use in schools. For example, in January 2017 the office issued a letter to schools and school districts about Education grant funds that could be used to support the use of technology to improve technology in school.\nI'm sorry, I cannot provide a summary of the text as it", "WHEN A DISASTER OVERWHELMS THE ABILITY OF STATE, LOCAL, OR VOLUNTARY AGENCIES TO ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES ESSENTIAL SERVICES ON THEIR OWN, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY, PROVIDES SELECTED RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED.

While FTA may work with other federal agencies as needed in the affected area, the Emergency Relief Program is the agency\u2019s primary source of transit funding for recovery efforts after a disaster. The Emergency Relief Program can fund up to 100 percent of a project\u2019s eligible costs. FTA awarded funds to recipients\u2014typically state and local governments and transit agencies\u2014in each of FTA\u2019s four regions to rebuild public transit projects damaged by the 2017 hurricanes in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. FTA awarded all funds in the Eastern region\u2014which includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia\u2014to a single recipient\u2014the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT). FTA awarded funds in the other three regions\u2014which include Texas, the remaining four U.S. states and territories (Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas, California, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Oklahoma, Minnesota, New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Illinois, Missouri, Louisiana, Tennessee, South Dakota, Massachusetts, and Ohio) \u2014to multiple recipients, based on the number of funded projects. We interviewed officials primarily from recipients in the three regions with multiple recipients. The officials noted that it was difficult to communicate with FEMA staff to understand exactly what work FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program staff had approved. FTA does not require recipients of Emergency Relief Program funds to provide \u201cmatch\u201d to supplement the federal funds. All of the project costs are eligible for reimbursement from FTA. In general, FTA reimburses eligible applicants for 100 percent of their eligible costs after a disaster. These funds are distributed by FTA on the basis of the requests submitted by the recipients after a disaster, and are generally allocated to those with the greatest need at that time. Recipients include state, local, and regional transit agencies; non-profit providers; and tribal transit providers. After a disaster, recipients first respond to the emergency by ensuring service continues using their funds, and may then submit a request to FTA asking for funding for damaged facilities from the Emergency Relief Program. Project requests are funded based on the priority FTA establishes for the emergency: to protect life safety and restore emergency response and recovery for public transit, as well as to repair damaged facilities. We reported in 2010 and 2014 on the Emergency Relief Program\u2014and on FTA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s roles before and after disasters. In the reports, we emphasized that FTA needs to ensure a more timely review of project worksheets and reimbursement of eligible costs than it has in the past; and, FTA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s guidance and procedures for administering jointly funded projects after a disaster are unclear. We made recommendations in 2014\u2014which FTA concurred with\u2014to address this and update agreements accordingly. Since 2014, FTA has reported progress on implementing some guidance, and has stated that it has taken actions to improve its relationship with FEMA after a disaster. For example, the agencies updated their agreement for disaster response in October 2017. In addition, they plan to complete additional guidance as part of the ongoing implementation of the agreement that will provide for the exchange of data, establish criteria for funding and project eligibility, and establish a process for dispute resolution.

These decisions include the following: \nWhat type of coverage? The first coverage decision faced by Medicare beneficiaries is choosing between original Medicare or MA. Original Medicare includes coverage for Medicare Part A services, such as inpatient hospital stays, and for Medicare Part B services, such as outpatient hospital care and physician office visits. Under MA\u2014the private plan alternative to original Medicare\u2014beneficiaries enroll in MA plans that generally must provide coverage for all the services included under original Medicare, and may also offer extra benefits. MA plans generally establish a network of health care providers to provide services to enrolled beneficiaries. Add prescription drug coverage? Beneficiaries in original Medicare and those in certain MA plans may also choose whether to add prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D). Prescription drug plans are administered by private insurance companies that contract with CMS. Beneficiaries in original Medicare obtain drug coverage by purchasing a separate prescription drug plan (PDP), while those in MA generally obtain coverage by selecting a MA plan that offers prescription drug benefits. MA prescription drug plans and separate PDPs vary in the amount beneficiaries need to pay and in the drugs that are covered. Add supplemental coverage? Beneficiaries in original Medicare can also purchase Medicare supplemental insurance\u2014known as Medigap plans\u2014offered by private insurance companies. These plans help pay for Medicare\u2019s required cost sharing and some out-of-pocket costs not covered under original Medicare, such as emergency health care during international travel. Figure 1 illustrates the decisions beneficiaries have to make when selecting their Medicare coverage options. Two research studies we reviewed indicate that cost is a key consideration for Medicare beneficiaries when selecting Medicare coverage. Beneficiaries may want to know what their likely out-of-pocket costs will be monthly, annually, or both. Beneficiaries may also want to know what their costs may be if they have a change in health status, such as by experiencing an illness. Beneficiaries may be responsible for several specific types of health care costs, including the following: Premiums\u2014Beneficiaries generally make monthly payments to purchase coverage. Medicare Part A generally does not require beneficiaries to pay a premium. Part B premiums are established by statutory formula and are means-tested so that beneficiaries with higher incomes pay higher premiums. The premiums charged by MA plans and Part D plans are established by each plan and can vary widely. Beneficiaries in original Medicare who opt to purchase Medigap will also pay a monthly premium for coverage, with the amount of the premium varying across the 10 standardized plans and by the different companies offering these plans.</s> \nWhat specific elements of the Medicare Options Finder tool found on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) My Medicare website contribute to improving beneficiaries' ability to make informed Medicare coverage decisions?</s> \n1.

This report focuses on manufacturing readiness assessment and is intended to support the Senate Armed Services Committee. We address the following questions: \u2022 What are the challenges of performing a manufacturing readiness assessment for major defense programs? \u2022 What steps can DOD take to better support planning for and conducting manufacturing readiness assessments? Our review covered 20 MDAPs as of September 2017 and excluded MDAPs that were only used to address urgent requirements.. DOD\u2019s use of manufacturing readiness assessments\u2014also referred to as assessments of production readiness (APR)\u2014can vary depending on the stage and specific design of the acquisition program. For example, assessments in the early technology maturation phase would typically be very different from assessments when production readiness starts. DOD generally performs assessments as a way to estimate manufacturing maturity of a product at a point in time (typically a minimum of 2 years before launch into production) to better understand its manufacturing capability, and to inform decisions about how to proceed\u2014for example, on whether to modify a product\u2019s design or to adjust its production and support system designs. Such assessments may also inform decisions about initial production quantities and ramp-up strategies\u2014for example, whether to start production at a modest rate and gradually increase production, or to start with a high rate of production capacity. In performing an assessment, DOD would evaluate a series of questions, such as how much flexibility and capacity a product design allows for the manufacture and sustainment of the product in a variety of manufacturing environments. At a basic level, our work indicates that assessments can reveal whether a given design can even be manufactured. We reviewed 20 MDAPs with the following results: \u2022 DOD uses manufacturing maturity assessments differently across programs. Although the extent and timing of DOD\u2019s assessments vary across the MDAPs, the assessments allow DOD to understand the current state of readiness of a product to go into production, based on a product\u2019s manufacturing maturity. DOD considers manufacturing maturity in terms of technical maturity and manufacturing readiness of the product design (what we refer to as product maturity) and in terms of production readiness of the manufacturing and support systems that the manufacturing process relies on. \u2022 Assessments may inform decisions about production timing, quantities, and ramp-up strategies. When DOD uses the APR to inform decisions on the initial production quantities or ramp-up strategy, it considers the \u201creadiness to produce\u201d questions as well as the readiness to \u201csustain the readiness to produce on a continuing basis in production.\u201d These questions assess the potential efficiency, cost-effectiveness, manufacturability, and effectiveness of potential production strategies. \u2022 DOD faces challenges conducting assessments, partly because early requirements are often uncertain. DOD faces a potential paradox when conducting MRAs early in an MDAP because the requirements at that stage might be unclear, and an assessment might be premature. DOD faces a related challenge with the timing of assessments when a product design is still evolving, but the assessment is intended to reveal readiness. This might be the case in late technology maturation prior to a critical design review, which is the last major milestone before a product design is considered mature enough to evaluate with an MRA. An early assessment that focuses on whether a product design is robust yet responsive to changing requirements might be problematic for both the assessment and the product. \u2022 Assessments might be better conducted after the completion of technology maturation activities. DOD might be better positioned to assess a product\u2019s readiness after the conclusion of technology maturation activities and prior to the start of production activities. We also recommended that DOD review plans as they consider conducting assessments during technology maturation and determine any opportunities to modify plans to maximize their chances of success. We provided a series of specific recommendations for DOD to improve manufacturing readiness assessments. We recommended that DOD modify the following: \u2022 Assessment scope and timing. DOD could consider updating policy to state that assessments should evaluate manufacturing maturity; improve guidance to require assessments at certain product development milestones; and conduct assessments after completion of preproduction milestones in order to have greater insight into the manufacturing design. \u2022 Assessment guidance and process. DOD could update policies and guidance to clearly document the required assessments and how they will be used; clearly define who is responsible for MRA development and implementation and develop a process to ensure timely execution; and provide MRA development and assessment staff with the technical expertise necessary to accurately assess complex weapon systems. \u2022 Design and manufacturing environment readiness assessment requirements. DOD could require more design and manufacturing environment readiness assessment analysis and documentation to better inform the MRA scope and timing requirements and identify what to emphasize in assessment results. \u2022 Assessment analysis and reporting recommendations. DOD could improve the comprehensiveness of MRA analysis, document the analysis results, provide recommendations for adjustments or corrective actions, and document those actions taken to address the recommendations. We reviewed and updated our previous 2010 report addressing MDAPs, and incorporated its", "DOD programs are falling short of cost, schedule, and performance expectations. Congress and DOD explored ways to curtail cost, schedule, and performance problems, and both took related actions about a decade ago. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 aimed to improve the organization and procedures for DOD\u2019s acquisition of major weapon systems. Better Buying Power reforms championed sound management practices and decreased the amount of cost growth in DOD\u2019s portfolio. Despite improvements, Congress remained concerned about the acquisition process and passed additional acquisition-related provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts. Congress also required that DOD establish a panel in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 to identify ways to improve the defense acquisition system. Categories of acquisition programs include those with the highest costs (Acquisition Category I), lower costs (Acquisition Category II, and III), and those with new technology (technology maturation). Milestones include technology maturation (Milestone A), engineering and manufacturing development (Milestone B), and production and deployment (Milestone C). The text discusses additional acquisition-related provisions, the milestone decision authority, and DOD\u2019s acquisition process.", "Continue below, please. three agencies failed to submit on time and six agencies submitted incomplete data. Of the 96 agencies that submitted data, 87 submitted their data on time. The on-time submission rate was nearly 16 percent lower than the previous quarter. In addition, 21 of the 88 agencies that submitted their data on time submitted late. Three agencies submitted their data nearly 2 weeks late, and 18 submitted them more than 2 weeks late, with the most egregious late submission (by 28 days) from the Department of Justice. The average late submission was 7.6 days. A breakdown of late submissions by day is shown in Table 1. This continued pattern of late submissions is cause for concern, as the act requires OMB and Treasury to report on the overall completeness and accuracy of the data, and for OMB and Treasury to provide Congress with information related to how federal agency compliance with the data requirements of the DATA Act is improving over time. We found that 41 agencies have made meaningful advancements in DATA Act implementation, 30 agencies have made limited progress, and 25 agencies have made little to no progress. To improve implementation, OMB and Treasury should develop and document the procedures and policies they need to make their oversight of data standards more effective and efficient. In addition, they should make a greater effort to engage with the IGs, and they may want to consider establishing a working group of IG leaders to review the implementation of data standards (including both the Q1 2020 Data Standards Manual and the DATA Act) on a quarterly basis. IG leaders may be better positioned to understand data quality and identify issues because they have authority to examine agency financial statements, and most are involved in reviewing program integrity. Table 1 shows the total number of late submissions between September 10, 2014, and November 14, 2018. The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish data standards, including data elements and definitions, for federal financial management activities, financial reports, and procurement awards reported under the act. Data standards ensure that financial, award, and procurement data reported under the act use a consistent definition and format\u2014making comparison easier.

In concert with the MyVA initiative, VA introduced the MyVA Access Declarations in April 2016 with the goal of improving access by providing veterans more control as to how they receive their health care. The MyVA Access Declarations was a list of nine \u201caccess declarations\u201d that were intended to serve as the foundational principles for improving and ensuring access to care. Two of these \u201caccess declarations\u201d required providing timely primary and mental health care and included same-day services. VHA had policies in place for same-day services in primary and mental health care clinics for several years prior to the same-day-services initiative. In primary care, the 2014 Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT) handbook required all primary care providers and registered nurses to ensure they provide same-day access (unless it is too late in the day as determined by the individual facility) for face-to-face encounters, telephone encounters and, when required by VHA guidance or policy, other types of encounters. The PACT handbook was supplemented by a 2015 VHA memo on unscheduled patient walk-ins. The memo states that if an unscheduled patient presents at a PACT clinic with a clinical concern, the patient cannot be turned away without evaluation by a clinical member of the team, regardless of clinic hours, resource availability, or eligibility/enrollment status. VHA also had previously developed policies stating that veterans are entitled to timely access to mental health care. Specifically, a 2007 VHA memo required that all veterans requesting or referred for mental health care or substance abuse treatment receive an initial evaluation within 24 hours. VHA\u2019s 2015 Uniform Mental Health Services handbook also noted that all new patients requesting or referred for mental health care services must receive an initial evaluation within 24 hours and a more comprehensive diagnostic and treatment planning evaluation within 30 days. Additionally, since 2008, VHA has required the integration of primary care and certain mental health care services at VA medical centers serving a veteran population greater than 5,000. This care model, known as Primary Care\u2013Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), integrates mental health staff into each primary care PACT clinic, allowing veterans to receive services for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use without needing to obtain a separate referral to providers in the mental health care clinic. According to VHA guidance, PC-MHI has been shown to improve access to same-day mental health care and reduce no-show rates to appointments. VHA\u2019s veterans access to care office was created in 2016 as the national oversight office for VHA access-to-care issues. Additionally, each VISN is responsible for overseeing the VA medical centers within their designated regions. This oversight includes oversight of access issues and the implementation of initiatives such as the same-day service initiative. VA medical center directors are responsible for ensuring local policies are in place for the effective operation of their primary and mental health care clinics, including affiliated CBOCs. VHA used a five-pronged approach to design its same-day services initiative: VHA (1) defined same-day services, (2) developed guidance, (3) updated its mental health policies, (4) offered training, and (5) assessed VA medical center readiness to implement the initiative. VHA defined same-day services. As an initial step, VHA leadership developed the following definitions of same-day services in primary and mental health care: Same-day services in primary care: \u201cWhen a veteran requires primary care services right away, during regular business hours, he or she will receive services the same day at a VA medical center. If a veteran calls after normal business hours, he or she will receive care the next business day.\u201d Same-day services in mental health: \u201cIf a veteran is in crisis or has another need for mental health care right away, he or she will receive immediate attention from a health care professional at a VA medical center.\u201d VHA also identified a variety of ways in which veterans can receive same- day services, including: (1) providing a face-to-face visit; (2) returning a phone call; (3) arranging a telehealth or video care visit; (4) responding to a secure email; or (5) scheduling a future appointment. VHA developed guidance for the same-day service initiative. To help VA medical centers implement its definition of same-day services, in April 2016, VHA developed written guidance\u2014the MyVA Access Implementation Guidebook. The guidebook provides a variety of solutions to help VA medical centers meet the intent of the same-day service initiative. The guidebook", "The U.S. government implements an export control system to manage risks associated with exporting sensitive items and ensure that legitimate trade can still occur. The export control system is governed by a complex set of laws, regulations, and processes that multiple federal agencies administer to ensure compliance. State and Commerce each play a role in the U.S. export control system. Historically, State has controlled the export of military items, known as defense articles and services, while Commerce has controlled the export of less sensitive items with both military and commercial applications, known as dual-use items. Both agencies are considering changes to their export control regulations to streamline and simplify the licensing process for U.S. companies and their international partners. State's list of controlled items is known as the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and Commerce's list is known as the Commerce Control List (CCL). State and Commerce each control the export of items within their jurisdictions through licensing processes and other compliance activities. A proposed rule from State and Commerce seeks to transfer responsibility for some firearms, artillery and ammunition from State to Commerce control.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text.program, which allows contracting officers to set aside contracts for WOSBs without further competition among such small firms, if they meet the standard requirements and offer a fair and reasonable price. Under the act, set-asides could not exceed $6.5 million, phased over 3 years from fiscal year 2017 to 2020. The NDAA for fiscal year 2017 authorized sole-source authority for all set-asides awarded to WOSBs and EDWOSBs where sole-source authority is provided for any small category or by exception for other than small categories, and extended sole-source authority for the WOSB program to fiscal year 2025. As of early September 2019, the NDAA for fiscal year 2020 includes new provisions authorizing sole-source authority for the WOSB program, with additional restrictions for sole-source contracts issued with respect to the WOSB program. The first set of restrictions require the contracting officer to document the basis for the sole-source award and why the contract or subcontract cannot be divided; the second set of restrictions require contracting officers to consider past performance when determining whether to award or extend sole-source contracts for the WOSB program. As of September 2019, SBA had implemented these changes. Contracting officers with contracting authority issued $15.6 billion in set-aside contracts in fiscal year 2018, about 7.5 percent more set-asides than in fiscal year 2017. In addition, contracting officers awarded $6.4 billion in set-aside contracts in fiscal year 2018 using sole-source authority under the NDAA authority for small businesses and WOSBs, an increase of 6.4 percent over fiscal year 2017. By the end of fiscal year 2018, contracting officers awarded $15 billion through the first three NDAAs to implement sole-source authority for the WOSB program.", "In a few words, what is the text about in terms of its main point?\nThe LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual who is employed or retained by a client for compensation for services that include more than one lobbying contact with covered officials and who registers with the Senate and House and submits quarterly reports to disclose their lobbying activities.

After the transplant, the recipient and donor must be registered within 10 business days in the OPTN donor and transplant registry. TRACER: A Tool for Monitoring Transplants\u2014VHA\u2019s Office of Information & Technology created a centralized electronic patient medical record, the CPRS, which is accessible at all VHA medical centers. TRACER is an extension of the CPRS that incorporates data from both the VHA administrative claims database and the VA MISSION Act Database. As shown in figure 1, TRACER was used to capture information for veterans evaluated for an organ transplant from the point of receipt at VHA hospitals or clinics through the transplant surgery (if performed at a VHA facility) or when the veteran returned to the VHA medical center after a transplant surgery at a non-VHA facility. Through TRACER VHA staff can easily navigate this process to locate any missing evaluation or treatment information\u2014such as missing clinical records\u2014on a veteran and to identify and correct any issues that may prevent the veteran from receiving a transplant. TRACER also enables VHA staff to track the length of time a veteran is active in the TRACER database. Figure 1. TRACER System User Interface TRACER incorporates the VHA\u2019s OPTN data, which tracks information on waiting times to receive an organ transplant and survival rates of veterans transplant recipients. TRACER also includes data on the veteran\u2019s location (if receiving care away from the VHA medical center); the date when the veteran was placed on a transplant waitlist; and when and where organ transplants were performed. The user interface includes tabs that VHA staff use to capture the veteran\u2019s location (as determined through the VA MISSION Act database (see figure 2) if (s)he were receiving care away from VHA\u2019s facility), the veteran\u2019s transplant status, and the reason(s) why the veteran was not able to proceed with the organ transplant. The organ transplantation staff at the medical center uses this information to ensure that the veteran received the care (s)he required. Figure 2. Screenshot of the VHA MISSION Act Database Interface for Locating a Non-VHA Medical Center 2 | TRANSPLANTATION \u2013 VA.ORG Veterans who are determined to be eligible for TRACER, which incorporates data from both the VHA administrative claims database and the VA MISSION Act Database, are then given a VHA OPTIS ID.

VHA OPTIS data in figure 5, which includes TRACER data for eligible veterans, show that most VHA OPTIS veterans, like their non-Veterans Administration OPTIS veterans, are in the active and inactive or ineligible/dead lists, which indicates they are either receiving care at a VA facility, a VA-contracted facility or are ineligible for transplant. Some veterans receiving care at a VA facility are also listed in the living donor list. Figure 4. Screenshot of TRACER Database Interface OPTIS Veteran Kidney TRACER Data Points Figure 5.

VHA needs to continue to update its web page and continue working with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 ONT, TRACER, and living organ donation program, because those are three key areas that need attention. TRACER and OPTIS are separate systems, however, one of them is updated monthly and the other quarterly. VHA Transplant programs can be improved, but VA staff should pay close attention to (1) ensure that TRACER is updated as often as the OPTIS system; and (2) verify TRACER data when verifying OPT", "assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk, DHS developed a new risk assessment process that better incorporates threat information, such as how much of a toxic chemical a facility has at the site, its process for safeguarding it, and its location on a list of facilities with sensitive items that, if compromised, could be exploited by terrorists. DHS has also developed an analytical model that considers location, threat, vulnerability, and consequence in assigning risk tier categories to facilities. For unconfirmed facilities, DHS now assigns higher risk tier designations to facilities with certain amounts of toxic chemicals at the site and assigns them a lower tier if DHS cannot confirm the amount of chemicals at the site. For example, facilities with 400 pounds of certain toxic chemicals may be designated as either high risk or elevated depending on if their presence can be confirmed. With regard to our recommendation to conduct an independent peer review of its revised methodology, in December 2015, we received from DHS a copy of an independent peer review of its revised risk assessment methodology. The peer review team made five recommendations and DHS officials provided us with their responses. Four of the recommendations were addressed completely and the fifth one was partially addressed. DHS then provided us with additional peer review response papers. We believe the enhancements made to DHS\u2019s risk assessment methodology have significantly improved its ability to prioritize facility security risks. DHS\u2019s revised risk assessment methodology includes a better understanding of threat information\u2014such as an analysis of 8,800 intelligence incidents related to chemical threats\u2014and now incorporates the NIPP priority critical infrastructure sectors and corresponding tier level guidance. DHS officials told us that they have begun working with intelligence officials to use classified threat data. DHS will integrate this data into its risk assessment when they receive it. In November 2018, we recommended that DHS conduct a risk assessment of all high-risk facilities that it has identified, consistent with the new risk assessment methodology. We also provided several criteria for DHS to use to determine whether a facility deserves a risk assessment. DHS agreed with this recommendation.", "The Defense Department recognizes the capital-intensive nature of weapons contracts and the requirements for contract financing to support the execution of contracts. This document outlines the different types of contract financing, including progress payments based on cost and performance-based payments. The document also describes contracting agency responsibilities and provides an overview of defense contracting guidelines regarding profitability. CONCEPT: The document provides an overview of contract financing and summarizes the relevant policies and guidelines for defense acquisitions. COMPLEXITY: The document is relatively straightforward and easy to comprehend, with clear explanations of the different types of contract financing and their application in practice. SIGNIFICANCE: The document highlights the importance of contract financing and its implications for contractor profitability, which has implications for the defense industry. The document highlights the importance of the military in driving the defense industry and the innovation of technology in defense contracting. LESSONS LEARNED: The significance of contract financing is evident from the increasing use of electronic financial management systems, allowing for faster processing of invoices, which could provide greater visibility on outstanding invoices and prompt action. More emphasis should be placed on the use of electronic invoicing systems for small contractors than large contractors.", "Education has taken steps to improve the quality of its Civil Rights Data Collection restraint and seclusion report, but the accuracy and potential for error in its publicly released data have limitations. These limitations include weaknesses in how Education defines restraint and seclusion and how it calculates incidents, as well as its data submission and certification processes. Based on the available data, the true number of incidents or their type varies by state, but the trends in incidents suggest that overall, the number of incidents has remained relatively constant, and incidents of physical restraint have decreased. We found limited evidence in the research that restraint and seclusion leads to better educational outcomes, and when incidents have resulted in fatalities, they often occurred when students were secluded. We also found evidence of the negative cognitive, emotional, and behavioral consequences of restraint and seclusion. We noted a dearth of research that examines why restraint and seclusion persist, and we observed that federal policymakers have not taken broad legislative steps to address restraint and seclusion in schools.", "OMB released (M-18-04) Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines for Federal Departments and Agencies.

Requirements for SGOs include limitations on the percentage of donations that can be used for non-scholarship expenses, financial audits, and restrictions on conflicts of interest and potential gains among SGO personnel. Most programs require SGOs to undergo annual financial reviews.\nIs there any question as to why the educational establishment is terrified of vouchers and charter schools? These programs are taking a lot of money away from the status quo and leaving the kids they serve far better off. Unfortunately, it is not surprising that the educational establishment fights so hard to limit these programs, or even eliminate them. I wish there was more public pressure to expand these programs or at least make them more palatable to the establishment.

DHS relies on contracts to support these missions and has 10 contracting activities with authority to procure products and services within and across DHS\u2019s components. For example, OPO within DHS\u2019s Management Directorate is responsible for contracting for a number of DHS\u2019s components and offices, including the Science and Technology Directorate, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. See appendix II for DHS\u2019s organizational chart, identifying operational and support components and contracting activities. The FAR requires that agencies take certain steps when identifying and developing requirements that need to be addressed through the execution of a contract.

Generic drug companies must show that their drug is (1) the same as the reference listed drug with respect to the active ingredient(s), conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling (with certain permissible differences, as approved by FDA); and (2) bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it generally delivers the same amount of active ingredient(s) in the same amount of time as the reference listed drug. When the reference listed drug is available, it is also designated as the reference standard drug, which is the product generic drug companies must use to conduct bioequivalence testing. When the reference listed drug is not available, FDA will select an approved generic of the reference listed drug to serve as the reference standard drug. All drugs pose some level of safety risk to patients. According to FDA, for most drugs, routine, risk-minimization measures, such as FDA-approved professional labeling, are sufficient to protect the public from the drug\u2019s risks. However, in some cases, FDA may require a drug company to take additional actions to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to help mitigate or prevent serious risks of adverse side effects. Specifically, FDA may require the drug company to establish a REMS that includes one or more risk-mitigation strategies beyond the drug\u2019s professional labeling. According to FDA, most REMS are designed to reinforce patients\u2019 and health care providers\u2019 behaviors and actions that support the safe use of the particular drug they cover. For example, FDA may require drug companies to give patients and health care providers additional information to reinforce certain safe use conditions or specific risks described in the approved labeling of a certain drug. FDA may require a REMS either before a drug is approved or after approval if FDA becomes aware of new safety information. When determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA considers several factors, including, for example, the estimated size of the population likely to use the drug and the seriousness of the disease or condition being treated. FDA may require a REMS to include one or more components. For example, FDA may require drug companies to provide patients with certain information in the form of medication guides. Generally, medication guides include information on serious side effects, including those that might require emergency medical care or involve life-threatening conditions. Similarly, FDA may require drug companies to develop communication plans for how the drug company will disseminate information to health care providers. Communication plans can include, for example, information on any serious risks of the drug and any safety protocols to ensure its safe use. Thus, for one REMS, FDA could require a drug company to provide a medication guide. For a second REMS, FDA could require a drug company to provide both a medication guide and a communication plan. Table 1 below includes a list of selected REMS components. Additionally, if a reference listed drug is subject to a REMS, an approved generic drug is also subject to some of the same REMS requirements. FDA can also require drug companies to implement another REMS component, called \u201celements to assure safe use\u201d (ETASU), if a drug has been shown to be effective, but is associated with a specific serious risk. Depending on the risk, FDA may require any or all of the following ETASU measures: Prescribers have specific training or special certifications; Pharmacies or health care settings where the drug is dispensed have Drugs are dispensed only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals; Drugs are dispensed with evidence of safe-use by the patient, such as requiring a patient\u2019s acknowledgement that she has been counseled on a drug\u2019s risks and understands and accepts these risks; Patients are monitored, for example, while taking the drug for specific adverse events or outcomes; or Patients are enrolled in a registry for collection of certain information, such as patient outcomes and adverse reactions associated with the drug. According to FDA, these measures are for drugs that can be marketed only if there are requirements in place to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the drug\u2019s labeling. If FDA requires certain ETASU measures, it may also require a drug company to develop an implementation system to enable the drug company to monitor and evaluate implementation of the ETASU measures by health care providers, pharmacists, and other responsible parties. Also, if a reference listed drug is subject to a REMS with ETASU and a generic version is being developed, the reference drug company and the generic drug company are required to develop a shared system\u2014a system that is used by participating companies to coordinate their REMS activities and information about a drug\u2019s risks. Under a required shared system, the generic drug company and the reference drug company use the same REMS documentation and other materials on the drug\u2019s risks and generally share in the implementation and maintenance of\nBased on your analysis of the information provided, which conclusion is the most appropriate and why?

However, this does not include planned maintenance intervals or non- depot work, repairs identified during annual inspections, or unexpected repairs. Therefore, to accurately reflect overall aircraft availability and mission readiness, Air Force leadership considers total aircraft maintenance days when determining maintenance requirements. See table 1 for more information regarding depot maintenance delays. The Navy completed depot maintenance on average 6 months early for the selected aircraft in our review. Navy leadership considers the on-time or early completion of scheduled maintenance events as a key performance metric for measuring timeliness. Navy officials stated (1) the Navy defines depot completion as depot availability 90 days from the start date and (2) actual delivery date for the depot repair is not taken into account or reported. Therefore, this result does not accurately represent total maintenance days to completion. Table 1 shows the maintenance delays for each of the 36 fixed-wing aircraft in our review. As shown in table 1, the Air Force and Navy experience significant maintenance delays each fiscal year for the selected fixed- wing aircraft. These delays vary across each of the 6 fiscal years. For examples of causes and consequences of the maintenance delays we identified, see Appendix II. For example, Air Force officials experienced maintenance delays in fiscal year 2017 that were attributed to a combination of unforeseen repair actions, a shortage of technicians, and high aircraft flying hours. Further, the Air Force extended the maintenance schedules for some depot events by 3 months in fiscal year 2018 due to the need to meet certain readiness targets. Our analysis and reporting of fiscal year 2014 through 2019 depot maintenance data shows that: Maintenance delays were reported by the services for 15 of the 36 (83 percent) fixed-wing aircraft in our review. Maintenance delays averaged about 28 days for the Air Force\u2019s selected fixed-wing aircraft and about 31 days for the Navy\u2019s selected fixed-wing aircraft. Maintenance delays for the selected aircraft averaged about 23 days prior to fiscal year 2019. However, delays were reported as increasing in fiscal year 2018. Air Force officials reported more maintenance delays in fiscal year 2017 than in fiscal years 2014 through 2015 combined. 1 Navy reported more maintenance delays in fiscal year 2016 and 2019 than in fiscal years 2014 through 2015 combined.

We collected a range of information from selected Air Force and Navy aviation depots, logistics commands, and Air and Navy program offices to compare the timeliness of depot maintenance activities and identify the causes of maintenance delays. We analyzed financial data for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 regarding depot maintenance, as well as other data related to operating tempo, staffing, and aircraft readiness performance. Throughout the analysis, we determined whether the information provided was complete and accurate to the best of our knowledge. We obtained financial data on depot maintenance from Air Force and Navy financial databases, and Air Force and Navy officials provided data needed to accurately report the causes of maintenance delays. We reviewed Air Force and Navy policies, directives, manuals, contracts, and other documents related to the planning and execution of depot maintenance. We also conducted interviews with program officials and logistics representatives to gain insight into the Air Force and Navy Air Depot Planning Processes, maintenance", "What action do you plan to take next and how do you plan on incorporating summary techniques, such as summarization and paraphrasing, in your future practices?

According to DHS and HHS officials, DHS has historically separated children from accompanying adults at the border and transferred them to HHS custody, but these separations occurred only in certain circumstances. 3. HHS has traditionally treated children under these circumstances as unaccompanied alien children, who are children who have no lawful immigration status in the United States, who have not attained 18 years of age, and who have no parent or legal guardian in the United States or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody. 4.

States may deliver health care services to Medicaid beneficiaries through fee-for-service payments to participating providers or through Medicaid managed care plans. States are required to make DSH payments to hospitals based on Medicaid inpatient utilization rate or low-income utilization rate. CMS and states share in the financing of Medicaid payments according to a formula established in law. Hospitals may use funds for uncompensated care costs for Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured low-income patients. States may also make DSH payments to hospitals with a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate above one standard deviation or a low-income utilization rate. There is an annual limit on DSH payments a state could make for IMD residents. A state\u2019s DSH allotment is largely based on its fiscal year 1992 DSH spending. 13. For the purpose of receiving federal matching funds, the formula for a state\u2019s Medicaid match share is based on the state\u2019s \u201cpoverty rate\u201d, a measure calculated by the Department of Health and Human Services that includes the income of individuals and families below the poverty line. The FMAP in any given year is fixed by the DRA statute of CMS, but can be changed by federal law through a reauthorization of the DRA law. To make hospital payments in a Medicaid state that opted to expand Medicaid, CMS would disburse funds to that state\u2019s Medicaid program and the program would reimburse providers as directed by the state. CMS would process all Medicaid provider claims and remit payments through its Medicaid Management Information System. CMS determines the reasonable cost of inpatient hospital services, except for the DSH payments. CMS approves both state plans and amendments to the plans.

DSH eligibility criteria include Medicaid inpatient utilization in a state averaged across all hospitals in the state. As of January 1, 2015, 32 states have adopted the \"supplemental payment limit\" option, which means Medicaid can be used to reimburse hospitals for non-DSH supplemental payments. Supplemental payments may be classified as disproportionate share payments (based on hospital Medicaid inpatient utilization rate). (continued)", "FAA has made progress in implementing all three of the 2011 GAO recommendations related to oversight of terminal area safety. The recommendations included improving ramp-area accident recordkeeping and oversight, addressing certain safety gaps in guidance for airport operators, and improving the Runway Safety Program. All three recommendations have now been implemented and progress has been assessed to be satisfactory. TEXT: the Airport Safety Integrated Report (ASIR). The ASIR is a yearly assessment of airport safety performance which combines FAA and NTSB data and is analyzed across various safety indicators. For example, the ASIR assesses runway incursion trends as well as the number of incidents and accidents on landings. ASIR performance metrics include a number of categories related to runway incursions, including Category A incursions and runway excursions. The ASIR also reports on compliance with FAA\u2019s Runway Safety Program. These requirements include developing procedures for identifying which aircraft to give specific safety instructions to, developing or updating guidance materials related to the Runway Safety Program, and ensuring air traffic controllers are properly certified. FAA has taken significant steps in improving the reporting, tracking, and analysis of safety incidents to enhance oversight of the terminal area. Specifically, FAA has expanded the mandatory reporting system to include all runway incursions, implemented runway safety technology, and increased awareness about safety standards among stakeholders. This work has required a significant investment in staffing and other resources. The Runway Safety Initiative has focused FAA and industry resources on identifying and addressing risks by analyzing data from reports of incidents, runway safety technology and procedures, and other sources. Finally, the safety culture in the aviation industry has improved. Stakeholders understand FAA\u2019s Runway Safety Initiative is focused on identifying risks rather than assigning blame. Data Sharing and Reporting FAA does not meet information-sharing requirements among its different offices working on runway and taxiway safety. Although steps have been taken to improve sharing and analysis of incursion data among some offices\u2014such as ATO and FAA Regional Offices\u2014the agency does not have a comprehensive approach. The Office of Aviation Safety, for example, had limited awareness of a key component of ATO\u2019s safety program\u2014the Runway Safety Group\u2014which could lead ATO to miss important insights. Furthermore, the use of incursion data in ATO\u2019s Runway Safety Group and in other offices often relies on manually-generated data and does not capture potential patterns across incidents. Additionally, the agency could not ensure with certainty that runway and taxiway safety policies were consistent across different FAA offices. To address these gaps, we recommended developing a comprehensive agencywide approach to share information among FAA offices working on terminal area safety. This would include sharing best practices, identifying inconsistencies in policies and procedures, and creating a process to manage and prioritize safety initiatives across offices. To implement these recommendations, FAA agreed to develop and implement a comprehensive safety management system that includes a process for identifying risks and hazards, analyzing data, and making recommendations for improvements. Additionally, FAA has also developed standardized guidance for all offices regarding reporting of terminal incidents and deviations. FAA has improved its management of runway safety oversight and related data. For example, FAA has implemented the mandatory reporting system known as ASRS, which collects reports of runway incursions, wrong surface landings, and other safety events from pilots, controllers, and other aviation professionals. However, data from ASRS and other systems were not properly integrated, and FAA\u2019s oversight of data from ASRS suffered from inconsistencies in the data from different sources. To address these issues, FAA has adopted a comprehensive approach to reporting that addresses gaps and improves data analysis across offices. It has also developed procedures for collecting and analyzing data related to incursions and other safety incidents.

As part of its comprehensive management of safety issues, FAA also identifies risks, hazards, and patterns in data collected through mandatory reporting, and reports any incident, regardless of whether a pilot or controller submits a report. The agency takes action to mitigate identified risks to safety, such as developing and disseminating guidance materials or updating existing guidance. Additionally, FAA\u2019s internal safety oversight staff routinely inspects air traffic facilities and conducts interviews about incidents and deviations. Finally, FAA continues to assess safety through analyses of incident data, as well as through site visits to airport facilities.. In addition to developing the Runway Safety Program, ATO also formed the Runway Safety Group to coordinate the efforts of the ATO offices. The Runway Safety Group is composed of representatives from each regional office as well as the ATO headquarters offices responsible for air traffic control and airport certification.

AFTER THE WAR, THE U.S. CONGRESS APPROVED A TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT MAKING THE UNITED STATES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ISLANDS TO THE UNITED NATIONS (U.N.). IN 1976, THE DISTRICT OF THE MARIANA ISLANDS ENTERED INTO A COVENANT WITH THE UNITED STATES ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND TERRITORY\u2019S STATUS AS A SELF-GOVERNING COMMONWEALTH IN POLITICAL UNION WITH THE UNITED STATES.

Staff members and contractors can manually initiate billing by completing the required Service Fee Cost Form (SF-1) indicating the activity code, the total number of work hours associated with the activity code, and any corresponding costs if billed at an hourly rate. Billable work activities also can be automatically calculated into a work history when the relevant systems are programmed to do so. These systems can include a work-in-progress (WIP) system or document management systems to perform activities designated by NRC program office staff and contractors. Upon completion and submission of an SF-1, the NRC program office performs a final review and approves the fee billing for the activity code(s) identified in the SF-1. Once NRC approves fees, the payment authorization is loaded into the billing system, the billable work is loaded into an approved billing system, the final review is completed, the bill is paid, and fees are charged to the licensee or billed on other federal or state governments account. The billing activity can take place across different NRC program offices and within different regions depending on the nature of the work. After the bill is paid, NRC maintains and monitors its billing records using a master billing system to ensure compliance and prevent overbilling. To address recommendations, NRC has improved its fee-setting process since the establishment of the fees transformation initiative (FATI), which was discussed in our 2017 report. Specifically, in addition to implementing recommendations, such as those regarding transparency and timeliness of fee-setting, it has taken several actions. For example, GAO recommended in 2017 that NRC clearly present information about the basis for its fee calculations, and in 2018, we found that NRC had effectively implemented this recommendation. Specifically, in its proposed fee rule, final fee rule, and fee work papers, the agency provided more explanations of its fee-calculation methodology and related assumptions. NRC has taken similar actions regarding the performance goals for improving the transparency and timeliness of its process. For example, in 2018, it set a 2018 performance goal to reduce the time between when its proposed fee rule was published and its final rule was published by 1 month\u2014and it achieved the goal. GAO also recommended in 2017 that NRC develop quantifiable performance goals and measurements to monitor the effectiveness of its fee-setting process, which NRC had not done. In 2019, the agency set performance goals, metrics, and targets for the timeliness of its final fee rule. GAO\u2019s previous report on NRC\u2019s fee-setting process highlighted the importance of these performance goals and metrics.\n<p>I understand that NRC is an independent agency established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. It is responsible for implementing and enforcing regulations for nuclear power and radioactive materials used in industry. The agency collects fees from licensees regulated by NRC through a federal rulemaking process every year. The proposed fee rule is developed by allocating its resources for regulating licensee fee classes and calculating its hourly fee rate and annual fees. The agency bases its calculation on its appropriations for the current fiscal year if enacted. If the agency has not received its appropriation by the time it begins calculating fees, it bases these calculations on the President\u2019s Budget. After the 30-day comment period, NRA adjusts its hourly fee rate for service fees and annual fees, as needed. Finally, it publishes a final fee rule that includes its responses to comments received on the proposed fee rule. The final fee rule becomes effective 60 days after publication. I understand that GAO and NRC internal initiatives have made certain key findings and made recommendations to improve NRC\u2019s fee-setting process, such as improving its performance goals and metrics, updating NRC\u2019s fee rules and associated work papers, clearly presenting information in NRC\u2019s proposed fee rule, final fee rule and fee work papers, developing objective, measurable, and quantifiable performance goals and metrics that would enable NRC to assess its efforts to improve the transparency and timeliness of its fee-setting process. </p>", "The text talks about the Border Patrol's role in securing U.S. borders and apprehending individuals between ports of entry.

The authors estimate that 25 percent of jobs in the U.S. are \u201chighly automatable,\u201d and could be performed by computers with minimal human assistance. They estimate that the percentage could \u201crise\u201d from 7 to 13 percent for occupations that only require schooling at a high school level. The authors also report that occupations in the U.S. that pay higher wages tend to contain more jobs that are more resistant to automation. In a paper published by the OECD in a 2016 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, economists Graetz and Michaels study the effects of technological changes, including computerization and increased productivity from 1860 to 1991, and report that \u201cthe computer revolution has significantly increased the demand for skilled labor.\u201d Their model shows that the number of skilled jobs in the U.S. has increased from 10 million in the mid-1950s to over 18 million in the mid-1990s. To contrast this with the jobs that may be automatable, they use a simple approach to estimate which occupations require \u201ccomputer skills\u201d and could \u201creasonably\u201d be automated, noting that it does not predict the probability or timing of automation. The authors find that the percentage of jobs that may be automatable would increase from 10 percent of U.S. jobs in the mid- 1990s to 47 percent in the late- 2020s, with a \u201creasonable\u201d degree of automation. A third research group, researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne of the University of Oxford, write in a 2013 research article that \u201cabout half of all US employment is in jobs that are at risk from computerisation.\u201d Their analysis is based on a review of a wide range of tasks performed within 702 different occupations, and the degree to which those tasks could be \u201cautomated.\u201d They suggest that \u201ctask-based\u201d data should be collected as well, since different jobs may consist of very differently weighted collections of tasks. Frey and Osborne estimate that 47 percent of U.S. employment may be at risk over the next 20 years. Overall, the three studies provide a general sense that a significant number of jobs may be at risk of automation. Estimates and predictions, like those of the three studies discussed, are highly sensitive to several factors, include the accuracy and completeness of the data used for analysis, the methods used, the assumptions made, and the extent to which advancements in technology alter future patterns. The uncertainty inherent in this type of analysis, and its rapid pace of development, underscores the importance of continually monitoring technological progress and its effects on the economy.

Those partnerships were later restructured into federal research centers to retain scientists, and they became known as FFRDCs by the mid-1960s. Since that time, FFRDCs have continued to perform tasks including technical studies and analyses, research and development, and systems engineering on behalf of federal agencies, such as DOD. In sponsoring an FFRDC, agencies draw on academic and private sector resources that can contribute to an agency\u2019s ability to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of the sponsoring agency. FFRDCs may be operated, managed, and/or administered by a university or consortium of universities, other nonprofit organizations, or a private industry firm as an autonomous organization or as a separate unit of a parent organization. As of May 2019, federal agencies sponsored a total of 42 FFRDCs, 10 of which are sponsored by DOD. These 10 DOD-sponsored FFRDCs can be divided into three categories: S&A Centers: These centers deliver independent and objective analyses and advise in core areas important to their sponsors in support of policy development and decision-making, among other things. Research and Development Laboratories: These laboratories conduct research and development, focusing on the development and prototyping of new technologies and capabilities to meet DOD needs. For example, these laboratories engage in research programs that emphasize the evolution and demonstration of advanced concepts and technology, and transfer new technology to the private sector. Systems Engineering and Integration Centers: These centers meet long-term technical and engineering needs to ensure complex systems meet operational requirements. Among other things, Systems Engineering and Integration Centers assist with testing system performance, development and acquisition of system hardware and software, integration of new capabilities, and the continuous improvement of system operations and logistics. Table 1 lists the 10 DOD-sponsored FFRDCs. As shown in table 1, each of the 10 DOD-sponsored FFRDCs is managed by a specific military department or organization within DOD\u2014referred to as the FFRDC primary sponsor. More broadly, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering oversees and manages DOD\u2019s FFRDC program. DOD\u2019s relationships with FFRDCs are defined through sponsoring agreements between the primary sponsor (i.e., the DOD organization responsible for the overall use of the FFRDC) and the FFRDC parent organization. According to the FAR and DOD instruction, sponsoring agreements define the FFRDC\u2019s purpose and mission and may not exceed 5 years in duration. DOD\u2019s instruction also states that sponsoring agreements are to establish conditions under which DOD may award an FFRDC contract and describe the overarching requirements for operation of the FFRDC. For example, the DOD instruction states that sponsoring agreements are to describe constraints on the FFRDC parent organization that are necessary to preserve the integrity of the FFRDC, such as provisions to prevent the occurrence or appearance of organizational or personal conflicts of interest that may undermine the independence, objectivity, or credibility of the FFRDCs. The DOD instruction also states that sponsoring agreements will preclude FFRDCs from performing commercial work. In this regard, the FAR provides that sponsoring agreements are required to address whether or not the FFRDC may accept work from other entities and if so, the procedures to be followed and the limitations as to the work that can be accepted. Further, the DOD instruction and the FAR provide that sponsoring agreements will generally preclude FFRDCs from competing with any organization in response to a formal request for proposals other than the operation of the FFRDC. After the primary sponsor identifies the need for FFRDC work, and has defined FFRDC core competencies, roles, and responsibilities in the sponsoring agreement, the primary sponsor awards a noncompetitive contract to the FFRDC to support the sponsor\u2019s research requirements, such as addressing national security issues and systems development. Prior to extending a contract or sponsoring agreement for an FFRDC, the FAR requires that the primary sponsor conduct a comprehensive review of the use and need for the FFRDC at least every 5 years. The FAR describes elements of what the comprehensive review should include, such as examination of the sponsor\u2019s special technical needs and mission requirements performed by the FFRDC and assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the FFRDC in meeting the sponsor\u2019s needs. The FAR further requires that the head of the sponsoring agency approve continuing or terminating sponsorship based on the results of the comprehensive review. FFRDCs initiate work on specific projects at the request of \u201cwork sponsors,\u201d or the entities that request the services of the FFRDC. Work sponsors can be the primary sponsor of the FFRDC or another entity. When initiating work at FFRDCs, work sponsors work with FFRDCs to develop requests for proposals, which are solicitation documents that", "VA\u2019s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials.

However, it was not clear from the available documentation the degree to which the military departments have direct oversight of and responsibility for maintenance of historic properties, although DOD officials stated that the military departments have their own cultural resource offices and staffs that coordinate their preservation programs and assist the installations. We have identified certain challenges. First, there is no clear guidance on responsibilities for maintenance of historic properties between DOD, the military departments, and the installations. Second, without well-defined processes, installations may be vulnerable to the potential of inadvertent adverse effects on historic properties. Third, with the current system it may be difficult to assess how often historic property maintenance activities occur. While we are providing recommendations, at this time we have not identified any deficiencies in DOD\u2019s oversight or administration of these management programs overall. We recommend that DOD formalize and clarify roles and responsibilities for oversight and maintenance of historic properties to help prevent inadvertent adverse effects on historic properties. We also recommend that DOD develop a process for tracking historic property maintenance activities that would help both DOD and the Department of the Army to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their ongoing maintenance operations and provide for better identification and assessment of opportunities for improvement. If this process could be applied to other military services, the Department of the Navy and Air Force, it would help all of them to better preserve culturally significant properties. We have identified the following examples of how improved oversight and maintenance processes could aid DOD in the preservation of historic properties: 1. Improved planning of capital improvements projects, maintenance activities, and construction can help prevent adverse effects on historic properties. For example, DOD could work with installations to ensure that new construction does not affect historic properties and is consistent with the historic character of the property. 2. Formalized training and certification requirements for maintenance personnel on federal installations could help in the ongoing preservation of historic properties. For example, a certified installer of new windows would understand the value of historic windows and the appropriate methods for their maintenance. 3. Regular surveillance and monitoring of maintenance efforts on federal installations involving historic properties would help track the number and type of improvements and maintenance activities and may help ensure that they are appropriate. 4. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for those overseeing implementation of historic preservation measures can help establish accountability and better identify opportunities for improvement. For example, in cases where a federal or military service installation plans a project as described in 36 CFR 800.16, DOD and the Department of the Army should establish consistent processes for oversight. 5. Clearly defined processes for prioritizing maintenance efforts could also help prevent inadvertent adverse effects on historic properties. For example, DOD and the Department of the Army could jointly develop clear guidance on how to prioritize maintenance efforts to focus on properties that must be preserved, rather than all federal (or other) property repairs to be scheduled and completed based on some objective priority level.", "What is the gist of the text\nhave higher population growth and greater housing demand than did slow-growth/lowdensity metro areas from 2000 through 2010, based on our analysis of Census Bureau population estimates and CBRE\u2019s National Rent Report\u2019s estimates (see data profile section of this report).

CERCLA requires the President to establish procedures and standards for prioritizing and responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants into the environment, and the National Contingency Plan (National Contingency Plan). Under CERCLA, PRPs are liable for conducting or paying for the cleanup of hazardous substances at contaminated sites. EPA and PRPs can undertake two types of cleanup actions: removal actions and remedial actions. Removal actions are usually short-term cleanups for sites that pose immediate threats to human health or the environment. Remedial actions are generally long-term cleanups\u2014consisting of one or more remedial action projects\u2014that aim to permanently and significantly reduce contamination. Remedial actions can take a considerable amount of time and money, depending on the nature of the contamination and other site-specific factors. PRPs and EPA can undertake two types of cleanup actions: removal actions and remedial actions. Removal actions are usually short-term cleanups for sites that pose immediate threats to human health or the environment. Remedial actions are long-term cleanups consisting of one or more remedial action projects. Remedial actions can take a considerable amount of time and money depending on the nature of the contamination and other site-specific factors. EPA\u2019s National Contingency Plan requires PRPs to pay for the cleanup or to conduct the cleanup. The plan also enables the federal government to conduct a cleanup and then seek to recover the money if PRPs fail to do so. Remedial actions have varying degrees of complexity. They must address immediate and long-term health and environmental threats. Remedial actions may include removal actions and remedial actions but require the use of longer-term solutions that bring contamination under long-term control. Remedial actions require the development of comprehensive plans, feasibility studies, remedial investigations, and design. Finally, remedial actions usually require lengthy construction efforts to carry out the remedies planned and approved. Nonfederal NPL sites contain a variety of contaminants, and EPA\u2019s Superfund cleanup process requires consideration of nine criteria to select the most effective and permanent solution. The Superfund process continues to evolve, and the procedures outlined are subject to the possibility of changes as new circumstances arise.", "were unable", "This is an article about the Secretary of the Army's responsibility for recruiting personnel and how the Army recruits and retains military personnel through marketing and advertising activities.

TAs can have significant impact on national goals and initiatives, as well as federal programs and resources. TAs can support federal agencies that are responsible for overseeing relevant initiatives or technologies. However, TA is not a static entity, but a process that should be thoughtfully and systematically designed to support decision-making and policymaking. TA provides various decision-support services, such as fact-based reports, expert presentations, stakeholder consultations, and technical briefings. TA designers generally create TAs in phases with various crosscutting considerations in mind: (1) the purpose of the TA; (2) the scope of the TA; (3) the question(s) and focus of the TA; (4) the approach and analysis to help answer the TA question(s); (5) the product\u2019s intended users, who influence how the question(s) are framed, the focus, and perspective; and (6) how policy options are identified and assessed, if applicable. TA designs also include considerations of independence, soundness, credibility, balance, thoroughness, objectivity, quality, and usefulness of the product to users. Designs must also account for available resources and constraints (such as time, access to experts, data, and available tools), and must be iterative, nonlinear, evidence-based, responsive to changes, and adaptable to different questions or circumstances. TA provides a useful vehicle to address S&T-related policy issues and decisions, so that they can enhance the public good. GAO\u2019s TAs focus on how S&T might help achieve strategic goals, such as growing the American economy, protecting homeland and national security, improving the American quality of life, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. GAO works to ensure that federal initiatives and resources are consistent with agency missions and strategic goals; comply with laws, regulations, and executive orders; avoid unintended consequences; consider stakeholder concerns; and are effective and efficiently managed. While there is no one right way to design a TA, Figure 1 shows a graphic depiction of a three-phase process and seven key considerations for TA design. TA can be tailored or combined into different products to increase effectiveness in addressing different issues and circumstances. TAs that examine the early phases of a technology are frequently focused on identifying and understanding potential impacts, benefits, risks, or ethical considerations of a technology. These kinds of TAs may occur when a congressional requester wants to raise awareness of a particular technology or area of S&T, when federal agencies responsible for monitoring relevant initiatives seek information about potential future developments and their effects, or when there is a perceived lack of understanding of particular technologies.\nFIGURE 1: Three Phases of Technology Assessment Design and Key Considerations for Tailored TA Products, Such as Reports and Briefings A sound TA design involves three phases and seven key considerations, as shown in Figure 1. The three phases are (1) scoping; (2) conducting the analysis; and (3) making recommendations, if applicable. The seven key considerations are (1) identifying the product\u2019s intended users (which helps guide the focus of research and how knowledge is synthesized) and how policy options may be identified and evaluated, if applicable; (2) framing the question(s) that the TA should answer (which guides the focus and scope of research); (3) identifying the technology or area of S&T under investigation (which helps determine the relevant literature, stakeholders, and experts); (4) selecting a methodology (which helps identify, gather, and synthesize the requisite data and information); (5) synthesizing evidence and making recommendations (which ensures sound conclusions and useful information for TAs); and (6) presenting the information (which helps the team tailor presentations, briefings, and written products to intended users\u2019 varying degrees of technical expertise). The seventh consideration is whether the TA involves examining policy options. This consideration requires the team to be mindful of the differences between providing factual information about the technology and a technology assessment of it. See Appendix I for more on product selection and decision-making. Understanding and evaluating an innovation is key to a TA. TAs that explore an emerging technology include determining whether it has the potential to address strategic goals and/or have potential impact across multiple areas. TAs may also examine an emerging technology\u2019s potential vulnerabilities to deliberate or inadvertent misuse, misapplication and misattribution, along with ethical considerations. These issues may not have been identified early in the technology\u2019s lifecycle, but may need a higher degree of scrutiny prior to significant public or private adoption. A critical responsibility for GAO is to monitor the implementation of federal legislation, including technology-related legislation, and provide policymakers pertinent and timely information to inform discussions and decisions.

At-risk infants and toddlers have a similar set of services if they choose to receive them, including evaluation and diagnostic services, social-emotional services, and service coordination. Services for at-risk infants and toddlers\u2014who are typically at-risk from birth through age 2\u2014are not included in this summary, since they are not eligible for IDEA services under Part B. A child who is determined eligible for these services is not eligible to receive them after age 3 if they are still eligible for IDEA services after their eligibility ends. Eligibility requirements for Early Intervention vary by state and, in some states, by locality. Some eligibility criteria include the same diagnoses of developmental disabilities that are used in determining eligibility for special education under Part B (e.g., autism, cerebral palsy, hearing and vision impairments), while in some states, children who do not meet specific diagnoses may still be eligible for services under IDEA Part C. In the 25 states examined by GAO in its 2016 report on IDEA accountability systems, about 4 in 5 children who were receiving IDEA Part B services were also receiving IDEA Part C services. [Source: GAO Report 16-106] Eligibility and evaluation processes. Eligibility criteria and evaluation processes can vary from state to state. In general, the process involves (1) screening a child to see if he or she should be referred for an evaluation, and (2) conducting an evaluation (if needed) to determine whether the child is eligible for services under IDEA. Each state has a Part C Lead Agency responsible for administering, supervising, and monitoring Part C of IDEA, and Part C requires states to have a continuous process of public awareness activities and evaluations designed to identify and refer as early as possible all young children with disabilities and their families who are in need of Early Intervention services. According to IDEA guidance, state lead agencies for Part C must perform outreach activities under Part C, which typically include collaborating with health care providers, child care providers, family resource centers, and other agencies and organizations that serve infants and toddlers with disabilities. Once children are evaluated and determined eligible for services, states must provide services outlined in each child's IEP. When a family identifies a suspected developmental delay, the family contacts a referral source, usually a service provider designated by the state, that may be a local district special education office or a community provider (e.g., a clinic or a public health agency). In both systems, an evaluation is conducted to determine whether the child has a disability, including those that are not specifically included in the IDEA definitions, as well as related services needs. The evaluation process typically includes gathering information from parents, review of developmental history, a medical examination, testing instruments measuring developmental skills, and other assessments as appropriate. The IEP, developed in collaboration with the child's parents and other service providers, is an individualized written plan that defines necessary specially designed instruction and corresponding educational services to be provided to an eligible child eligible for special education and related services under Part B. The plan is revised periodically and the extent of the child\u2019s participation in general education or the IEP, and the location where the education takes place, is documented based on the IEP. The plan continues until the child no longer needs special education services, or until the child can benefit from regular education or vocational education. [Source: IDEA] Monitoring. State lead agencies responsible for administering Part C programs are required to monitor Part C implementation to ensure that state and local programs meet state and federal requirements. These monitoring functions include on-site reviews of state and local agencies, periodic reviews of children\u2019s services, and reviews of state and local agencies. Part B includes similar requirements. State and local education agencies are monitored by the federal education agency as well as by state education agencies authorized by the state legislature. State education agencies are responsible for implementing a monitoring system developed in partnership with other state agencies responsible for administering state education systems. This system includes: (1) Conducting annual reviews of all state and local LEAs to assess compliance with IDEA state administration requirements and (2) Conducting audits or investigations of LEAs to ensure compliance with state standards for education services to children with disabilities. A LEA found out of compliance with IDEA requirements is required to develop and implement a corrective action plan, and the state education agency monitors and reports on the progress in implementing the plan.

VA plans to complete approximately 70 new medical projects between 2020 and 2024. Activation is an important step in the process before veterans can access care at these facilities. This entails activities such as furniture purchasing, equipment installation, and staffing. The cost of activation can be substantial, and figures from fiscal years 2012 to 2018 showed a median funding cost of $16 million. The facilities can vary in size, services provided, and overall purpose within the VHA healthcare system. Activation for major lease and construction projects can include recurring and non-recurring expenses. VHA\u2019s activations office is being reassessed and may provide different support for activations going forward. Regional networks can help with administrative and clinical activities at hospitals within their specified region. Medical center directors are responsible for ensuring timely activation activities. There are no standard milestones for activation, but building acceptance and providing medical services to the first patient are significant events that spur the beginning of activation activities. A diagram shows the timing of activation activities in relation to these events. officials estimated that 90 percent or more of their staff would be on site and actively involved in activation activities. After building acceptance, our analysis found that medical center staff had already initiated many activation activities\u2014such as ordering furniture, obtaining environmental permits, and hiring staff\u2014which reduced the time between acceptance and the opening of the facility for patient care. Officials at selected facilities told us that they were comfortable starting their activation activities more than a year before building acceptance in order to ensure that vendors would be available to start key work before building acceptance. They also mentioned that some furniture or equipment suppliers may need several months of lead time to manufacture and deliver products. Other tasks completed after building acceptance may include scheduling activation activities, arranging for temporary staff, obtaining temporary permits, and communicating key dates with local businesses. Officials noted that this work can help to speed the completion of activation activities because vendors may have already started their work. After local, regional, and national staff are involved in activation, the work shifts in focus to opening the facility for patient care. Opening the facility involves preparing the equipment and supplies to be used by staff and by patients. For example, hospital staff may install equipment, program software, and inventory supplies, such as sterile needles and gowns. Local and regional staff may inspect these items, review staff training plans, and ensure that patients have necessary safety features in place. Medical center staff also needs to prepare staff and the hospital for patients. This work can involve coordinating training sessions, evaluating the qualifications of proposed nursing staff, and conducting safety drills. Officials said that the opening of facilities also involved creating patient schedules and ensuring that any necessary authorizations were in place from VHA\u2019s Office of General Counsel. The cost of each of these elements of activation has also been adjusted for inflation.

We determined that the current billing codes may pay for all five key components of the LCCP service. Based on conversations with providers and other stakeholders, however, many stakeholders expressed strong support for the LCCP service model and said that the existing billing codes do not fully capture the work associated with it. Stakeholders, including those representing certain specialties, said that Medicare\u2019s payment system is not recognizing the full value of the work involved in LCCP, and they believe providers are not being adequately reimbursed. Furthermore, these stakeholders noted that the current codes are not ideal because they do not provide a comprehensive view of the complexity and intensity of LCCP services across all providers and payers. Others suggested that developing a new code or codes could make it easier to monitor and report on the use of LCCP services by various providers and payers. Our conversation with these stakeholders suggests that these issues reflect the complexity of Medicare\u2019s payment rules and regulations, which are often difficult for providers to navigate. Moreover, these issues may be a result of a lack of consistency in how the physician fee schedule assigns relative values to services; the physician fee schedule generally assumes that providers bear the same costs, regardless of how many different providers they receive care from or how many providers are involved at any one time. We do not make any recommendations at this time on whether CMS should develop new billing codes related to LCCP services for Medicare. CMS, to the extent possible and within the purview of the agency, could continue to seek input from stakeholders on the adequacy of existing billing codes related to LCCP services, including their payment adequacy and the potential need for additional or revised codes. Stakeholders could also comment on CMS\u2019s broader efforts to assess the complexity of medical services and develop alternative payment methodologies that may be better aligned with the complexity of LCCP services.", "Federal Trade Commission has been the main regulator for credit reporting agencies when it comes to protecting consumer data and preventing breaches.

Our preliminary analysis of budget data from the agencies indicates that the civil rights or diversity office staff handling sexual harassment complaints represents a small percentage of each agency\u2019s employees (ranging from 0.03 percent to 0.37 percent). Their budgets also represent a small percentage of each agency\u2019s overall budget (ranging from 0.001 percent to 0.02 percent). Most of these offices\u2019 budgets focus on complying with civil rights statutes related to federal financial assistance including Title IX and on conducting routine compliance reviews. However, these budgets exclude any amounts that agencies directly spend on Title IX compliance reviews when they are done in conjunction with other reviews, such as financial management or fiscal reviews. For example, both USDA-NIFA and NASA officials expressed the view that such reviews are conducted in the ordinary course of duty and that, in those instances, Title IX compliance reviews are not reflected in the amount of money available. For USDA-NIFA, the amount spent on these reviews varies, according to agency officials, and is not included in the civil rights office\u2019s budget numbers. In addition to these compliance reviews and complaint investigation activities, these offices have additional responsibilities. USDA-NIFA provides civil rights training and oversight of grantee universities\u2019 affirmative action plans; NASA provides training on their agency policies regarding the rights of individuals with disabilities; and DOE provides training for employees regarding equal employment opportunity, diversity, and other civil rights. Number of complaints received and investigative procedures for selected agencies. Data from the agencies on the number of complaints received varies depending on how agencies define complaints (e.g., by type of allegation, stage of processing, or grantee type) and how often they submit reports to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) or other offices. Among the five selected agencies, we reviewed five OCR reports provided to us by the offices in October 2018. We also analyzed data provided by the agencies regarding the number or frequency of Title IX complaints received and addressed from 2014 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. 10 TEXT In our analysis, we found each agency reported a different number of Title IX complaint referrals to their appropriate civil rights, diversity or discrimination offices. NSF reported the most with 70; DOE and HHS each reported 29; NASA reported 28; and USDA-NIFA reported 10. Although we have limited data to support the accuracy of each agency\u2019s reporting of referral numbers, the numbers themselves demonstrate that each agency\u2019s civil rights or diversity offices receive Title IX complaints and address them in some fashion. NSF and USDA-NIFA officials also explained that they include complaints received at their headquarters offices in their respective numbers. As for their diversity offices\u2019 handling of sexual harassment complaints, NIH stated that they \u201cdo not have formal procedures specific to processing Title IX complaints.\u201d In addition, FDA, NIH, and NASA lack data on how many sexual harassment complaints are handled at their headquarters office, which may result in underestimation. Additionally, each agency has other reporting mechanisms aside from complaints for sexual harassment that may further inflate the total number of sexual harassment complaints. HHS reported that they receive up to five times as many sexual harassment complaints through the Office of Civil Rights (HHS-OCR) as they do through their civil rights or diversity offices. NIH only receives sexual harassment complaints through an EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) Office. For each agency, civil rights or diversity office staff follow agency guidance on how they refer complaints to OCR or other agencies when necessary. Agencies must follow additional guidance when sexual harassment complaints that involve federal personnel as well. HHS has a specific instruction to refer to the Office of Personnel Management all Title IX complaints involving federal personnel. For DOE, Title IX complaints may be referred to OCR or other agencies, and the Title IX coordinator is responsible for identifying potentially serious Title IX complaints and reporting them to the Office of the General Counsel (OCR) or other designated officials at the department. We also reviewed the type of training agency staff receive on how to investigate sexual harassment complaints after they are referred from either another office or from OCR. For example, in HHS, these investigations are generally conducted by an employee in the Office of Civil Rights or at the operating division or agency office with the complaint. The employee receives training at the HHS Departmental Civil Rights Center, which provides Title IX awareness training at all HHS operating divisions and agencies on a rotating basis, and they are provided one-on-one training on the individual case itself. HHS said their goal is to complete Title IX investigations at any level within 30 days or less. All of the agencies said they involve their Title IX office or other staff as needed to assist in the investigation. The NIH chief officer responsible for complaints told us that a typical NIH investigation lasts several weeks because of the amount of information and the number of persons interviewed during the process.

(5) Which law requires NIH to develop a plan that minimizes the use of animals in scientific research? *Asterisk-ed answers are found at the end of the passage. which HHS established, NIH issued the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 Plan. In the plan, NIH outlines its plans to replace animal use in testing the safety of therapeutic agents, to develop alternative nonanimal models for studying disease and drug development, and to develop computational models for studying biologic processes. The plan describes other efforts under way in alternative models of research, including collaborations with industry and nongovernmental organizations. The plan also describes NIH\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop alternatives to animal models for regulatory research and to incorporate alternative models into training for researchers. Pursuant to its regulatory authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), U.S. EPA (USEPA) oversees chemicals by determining their effects on health and the environment, reviewing their proposed releases, regulating their releases, and managing and disposing of their waste. Its Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) develops policy related to animal testing. At the outset of research on new chemicals, USEPA encourages the development and use of non-animal tests as \u201cTier 1\u201d methods in risk assessments, in order to reduce the numbers of animal tests that are conducted. The act requires FDA to ensure that federally regulated product safety testing is based on alternative methods whenever feasible. In its animal use alternatives program, USDA\u2019s APHIS is focused, in part, on reducing the numbers of animals used in product safety testing. The program includes \u201cin vitro\u201d alternatives (in test tubes rather than animals) and \u201cin vivo\u201d alternatives, including new procedures that use animals but require fewer than the traditional large number of animals because the tests are better designed. Although the emphasis is on alternatives, APHIS is also examining options that might require continued use of live animals in certain tests. At OPP, USEPA promotes the development and the use of alternative testing methods, including predictive toxicology and computational toxicology approaches that assess chemical properties and effects. It has created a virtual toxicity data warehouse, the ToxRefDB (Toxicological Reference Database) that has been populated with an array of information. APHIS also encourages the development and use of new test methods that reduce or replace animals in regulatory testing. To that end, APHIS has sponsored studies to examine a wide range of methods and approaches. HHS\u2019s OPP developed guidelines to ensure that the development and adoption of alternative methods are of the highest quality and that their results are accepted and applied by the regulated community. APHIS has been using alternative methods in its laboratory tests for some time. It has reduced the number of animals tested in certain products\u2019 assessment, including pesticides used in agriculture and rodenticides. For example, in assessing the safety of pesticides used on food, OPP is moving away from tests relying exclusively on LD50 values to those based on human receptors. The results of some of these tests can yield results with stronger correlation to human responses. By focusing on receptors, these methods also allow for testing for \u201cactive ingredients\u201d \u201cnano-particles\u201d that can deliver the toxin to the target organ. A key element in APHIS\u2019s strategy is to encourage industry to find ways to test products more human-based. OPPT\u2019s initiative focuses on alternative approaches that \u201creduce, refine, or replace the use of animals in testing chemicals, pesticides, consumer products, and in conducting risk assessments (TSCA section 5). \u201c (from US EPA 2008b). HHS\u2019s National Toxicology Program (NTP) has a goal to develop ways that can evaluate the \u201ccarcinogenicity of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\u201d It is also developing \u201cpredictive tools\u201d and \u201cin silico\u201d methods, which use computers to forecast potential toxicity of chemicals and products. These methods are designed to assess risk rather than hazard. (These methods were discussed in the UFA report that is summarized in the current text.) In addition, NIH\u2019s National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) sponsors an international program to advance animal use alternatives, including alternative models for vaccine research, development and manufacture. 1.

The code establishes safety management objectives and identifies a framework of key elements required to be considered for inclusion in an SMS. Vessel operators are responsible for developing an SMS in accordance with ISM Code requirements if they operate U.S-flagged vessels that are subject to the ISM Code, such as a vessel engaged in a foreign voyage or a tanker or freight vessel over 500 gross tons. Vessel operators are also responsible for obtaining the requisite evidence that the company and each of its applicable vessels are in compliance with the ISM Code. ROs conduct the related oversight and certificate activities on the Coast Guard\u2019s behalf. The Coast Guard is ultimately responsible for guaranteeing the effectiveness of SMS compliance activities and audits that ROs perform on its behalf, and it verifies SMS compliance as part of its overall vessel compliance activities.", "The Secret Service\u2019s primary responsibility is to physically protect the President, Vice President, their immediate families, and visiting foreign dignitaries as well as the White House complex. Within the Office of Protective Operations, agents may be assigned to a number of divisions, such as PPD, VPD, or one of the other divisions that is responsible for protecting former presidents and visiting heads of state or heads of government. The Uniformed Division, which is also part of the Office of Protective Operations, is charged with protecting facilities and venues for Secret Service protectees. Uniformed Division officers control access to the White House complex\u2014which includes the White House itself, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and the Department of the Treasury building\u2014and the Vice President\u2019s residence. Over time, the Secret Service\u2019s investigative mission has grown to encompass a wide range of financial and cybercrimes. In addition to investigating financial and electronic crimes, special agents conduct protective intelligence investigating threats against protected persons, including the President, and protected facilities, such as protectee residences. These activities are conducted through the Office of Investigations, which oversees the agency\u2019s field office structure. Agents assigned to the field offices also support protective operations by, for example, providing physical protection with the assistance of federal, state, and local law enforcement entities when a protectee travels. Because agents are trained to conduct both criminal investigations and to provide protection, agents assigned to investigations in field offices can contribute to protective operations when needed. The Secret Service has experienced a number of protection-related security incidents on the White House complex since April 2012. Incidents have included attempts to gain access to the White House complex by foot, car, and air. These incidents, among others, highlight some of the many challenges the Secret Service confronts while providing protection. Table 1 shows the progress that the agency has made implementing each recommendation. Appendix I provides further details on the actions the Secret Service has taken to address each recommendation.</q> \nHave there been any significant changes in the recommended training time for agents assigned to PPD and VPD since 2018?</s> \nYes, there have been significant changes in the recommended training time for agents assigned to PPD and VPD since 2018. In December 2020, the Office of Protection and Training, which manages the Secret Service's training program, released guidance increasing the amount of training time agents assigned to PPD and VPD are entitled to from 10% to 16% of each workday. This represents an increase from 8% to 12% in daily training time. Overall, this change will increase the training time for special agents assigned to PPD and VPD from 5.9% to 24% of their total work hours.", "In February of each year, the President submits the budget request for VHA health care, which includes requested funding for the upcoming fiscal year as well as an advance appropriation request to Congress. VHA allocates funds by the beginning of each fiscal year\u2014October 1\u2014to VISNs and medical centers based on the amount VA received in the advance appropriation. Once appropriations are enacted for the upcoming fiscal year, VHA updates the allocated funding levels for VISNs and medical centers. For example, VHA\u2019s appropriations for fiscal year 2018 included advance appropriations for fiscal year 2019. VHA allocated funds by October 1, 2018 (the beginning of fiscal year 2019), based on the advance appropriation for fiscal year 2019 and updated the funding levels once appropriations for fiscal year 2019 were enacted. Once funds are allocated and distributed to VISNs and medical centers, these funds may be redistributed in accordance with law across VA\u2019s health care system. Specific purpose funds accounted for large portions of VA\u2019s health care budget, including the Medical Care Community program (formerly known as Choice Program). VA\u2019s health care appropriation accounts include the Medical Services, Medical Community Care, Medical Support and Compliance, and Medical Facilities accounts. These accounts contain funds for general purpose and specific purpose care. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Veterans Choice Fund and provided $10 billion in funds for the Choice Program. The program was sunsetted in June 2019 and the Veterans Community Care Program was implemented.</s> \nHave there been any changes or updates to the way the budget is allocated and distributed since the publication of this report in 2021?</s> \nAs of October 2021, the VHA budget allocation process is not significantly different from the process described in the 2017 report. VHA uses similar methods to distribute funding to its medical centers and providers and to redistribute funds across VA's health care network to address unfunded needs or surpluses. However, the size and composition of VA's health care budget has changed since the report was published. VA's health care budget has increased significantly in recent years due to a growing demand for services, new and expanded programs, and increased funding for initiatives such as telehealth and rural health. In fiscal year 2021, VA's health care budget totaled almost $93 billion, up from just over $70 billion in fiscal year 2017. As a result, VA's ability to provide timely and high-quality health care services to eligible veterans will continue to depend on the agency's ability to effectively allocate and distribute its resources.", "In the text provided, Congress appropriates federal funds under Part B of IDEA for fiscal year 2019.

These leaders and their respective staff must embrace the challenge and act in a timely and consistent manner. To meet the capacity criterion for removal of a high-risk designation, the bureaus and schools must have the capacity to implement the correction and action plans in order to provide the support and attention necessary to ensure that the high-risk issues are appropriately addressed. This includes sufficient financial resources and qualified staff. To address the monitoring criterion, agencies must have in place data and indicators to measure progress, such as specific metrics that can be tracked and evaluated to allow the agency to measure whether the agency is actually improving the programs and services. To meet the demonstrated progress criterion, the following steps must be taken: The agencies must have implemented corrective actions they have committed to that address the root causes of the high-risk problems. To address the leadership commitment criterion, agency leaders must commit the necessary time, resources, and attention to ensure that the steps outlined for removal are implemented with consistency. In summary, the agencies continue to make progress in managing the high-risk areas that we identified in our report. Nonetheless, additional efforts are needed to address the remaining weaknesses, including further capacity constraints, retention shortfalls, and the retention of necessary data to evaluate progress. Indian Affairs, BIE, BIA, and IHS continue to have the opportunity, if sustained dedication persists, to become models for other departments in their commitment to serving the Native Americans. We acknowledge and appreciate the important steps that agency officials have taken. We look forward to working with officials as they continue to provide sustained leadership and oversight and address remaining management challenges.", "In developing our June 2018 report to assist the Congress, OMB, and agencies in assessing agency reform plans, we reviewed our prior work and leading practices on organizational transformations; collaboration; government streamlining and efficiency; fragmentation, overlap, and duplication; and high-risk and other long-standing agency management challenges. The resulting June 2018 report includes 58 key questions to aid in assessing reform efforts. These questions are organized into four broad categories and 12 subcategories. We determined that the questions most relevant to the current implementation stage of State\u2019s reform efforts are found in two subcategories: (1) Leadership Focus and Attention and (2) Managing and Monitoring. Table 1 lists the key questions in these subcategories. In response to the March 2017 Executive Order 13781 and the ensuing OMB memo, State launched a \u201clistening tour\u201d intended to gather ideas and feedback from State and USAID employees. As a key component of this outreach effort, State hired a contractor to design and administer a confidential online survey, which was sent to all State and USAID employees in May 2017. According to the contractor\u2019s report, the survey had a 43 percent response rate, with 27,837 State employees and 6,142 USAID employees responding to the survey. The contractor also conducted in-person interviews with a randomly selected cross section of personnel, which included 175 employees from State and 94 from USAID. The contractor\u2019s report on the results of the survey and the interviews highlighted five areas for State reforms. In July 2017, the Deputy Secretary of State created five planning teams to develop multiple projects in those five areas. The Deputy Secretary also established an Executive Steering Committee composed of senior State and USAID officials to guide the five planning teams and provide direction during the reform process. Led jointly by State and USAID, each planning team comprised participants from a cross section of overseas and domestic workforces. The planning teams were tasked with gathering information and conducting analysis as described above.", "43.6 million women in the United States have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner, primarily through its National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).. This estimate exceeds the combined total of victims of rape, robbery, and assault reported to authorities in the same year.. Brain injury from strangulation is more difficult to diagnosis than mild and moderate TBI (such as a concussion), and thus may require further assessment to diagnose. 24.1 million women and 15.2 million men age 18 and over in the United States reported experiencing severe physical violence by an intimate partner. The physical, emotional, and financial consequences of IPV were far-reaching and often long-lasting. Intimate partner violence includes violence by persons who are married to, cohabitating with, have been married to, or previously have dated/gone out with the victim. 4 | Brain Injury & Violence 5 | Brain Injury & Violence of the brain, as well as provide resources to improve TBI outcomes. Several NIH agencies continue to research the various impacts that IPV can have on women\u2019s health and well-being. Specifically, NCI conducts research on IPV that includes physical abuse, sexual violence, and stalking, among other things. NCI\u2019s research includes studies of the health consequences of IPV on women\u2019s health, the identification of IPV as a risk factor that affects health outcomes, and the development of interventions, education, and support services to reduce IPV. NIAMS funds research on the development of therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, and NCI researchers investigate how pain and injury interact with IPV exposure. NIH also works with ACF and DOJ to encourage and fund research on the health effects of abuse in children and youth. 8 | Brain Injury & Violence In addition, NCI researchers seek to improve the understanding of the health consequences of domestic and international abuse in men and women, as well as develop interventions to reduce violence and aggression. Within DOJ, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) and the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) support research and development activities aimed at improving responses to IPV. Within OVW, the STOP Grants, originally authorized as part of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 (VAWA) and administered by the Bureau of Justice Statistics within DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs, supports the development of research, policies, and practices to enhance responses to sexual assault, strangulation, and stalking; improve the criminal justice system\u2019s responses to these crimes; develop or enhance multidisciplinary approaches to addressing IPV; reduce juvenile violence; and prevent commercial sexual exploitation. The OVW Health Initiative supports health-care providers in their responses to victim of IPV and sexual assault.

The Hotline\u2019s goal is to support the development of effective responses to IPV, sexual assault, and stalking by addressing the specific training, technical, and policy needs of domestic violence and sexual assault programs and allied groups across the country. To support OVW\u2019s work, HHS supports the National Clearinghouse on Women\u2019s Health (NLM), an HHS project managed by the HHS Office on Women\u2019s Health. NLM provides links to information on IPV, including safety planning and local resources, and offers information for young people who have experienced IPV. HHS funded a multi-year project with the American Medical Association to develop a toolkit to help physicians and other health-care providers recognize, respond to, and refer patients who have experienced IPV. In addition, HHS works with the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, which offers resources for IPV victims, including information and support groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also works to address IPV and its consequences through research and practice-oriented activities focused on prevention and response to IPV, including its health consequences. Additionally, the HHS agencies offer programs aimed at improving responses to IPV and addressing its health consequences, including NIH research activities, the work of DOJ agencies (including OVW and OVC), and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. In addition, HHS provides clinical resources and offers funding for IPV prevention and intervention programs aimed at adolescents. While there is much to be done to improve the health outcomes of individuals who are victims of IPV, much research and program activity has been conducted and proposed in recent years to address this challenge.

FAA\u2019s UAS Integration Office, located in the Office of Aviation Safety, seeks to integrate UAS operations into the national airspace system while ensuring the safety of the public and integrity of the airspace. In July 2018, FAA released the 2018 UAS Integration Roadmap, a second edition of the agency\u2019s 5-year plan outlining its most current phased approach for integration, with each step toward full integration allowing UAS operations of increasing complexity. FAA\u2019s vision for fully integrating UAS into the national airspace system entails UAS operating safely and routinely\u2014i.e., without requiring prior approval for UAS flights\u2014in the same airspace as manned aircraft. While safety is FAA\u2019s paramount concern, the integration of UAS is important because of the potential economic benefits that progress in UAS integration could bring, including more investment in uses such as large passenger operations, as well as the potential safety benefits, such as more effective firefighting and other disaster response efforts. Currently, FAA only allows certain routine UAS operations under specific conditions while authorizing other UAS operations on a case-by-case basis. For example, since August 2016, operators of small UAS\u2014defined as those UAS weighing less than 55 pounds, including any attachments\u2014 who have obtained a remote pilot certificate have generally been allowed to operate without prior FAA approval in certain airspace during the day, under 400 feet, and not over people or beyond an operator\u2019s line of sight, among other requirements under FAA\u2019s Part 107 rule. Small UAS operators may seek a waiver of certain FAA operational requirements (referred to as a Part 107 waiver) from the agency on a case-by-case basis, such as a waiver that would allow an operator to fly drones above 400 feet. In contrast, no routine operations\u2014 meaning those that can occur without any prior authorization\u2014are currently allowed for large UAS (55 pounds and over) for any purpose (see fig. 1 for examples of small and large UAS). Rather, operators of large UAS must seek authorization from FAA to fly the aircraft on a case-by-case basis, and the processes for accessing the airspace vary. More specifically, civil large UAS operators must, in most cases, obtain a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) that demonstrates FAA\u2019s approval of airspace access, and may also require approval for the aircraft itself. A COA allows any certificate holder to fly UAS outside of generally allowable operations, such as at certain altitudes, locations, or airspace classes (e.g., near airports). FAA grants this approval to an entity for a specific activity and time period, and sometimes for a specific make and model of UAS. Public entities\u2014which include federal, state and local governments, public academic institutions, and law enforcement agencies\u2014may apply for a COA in order to obtain authorized access to fly in the national airspace for when they are conducting governmental operations, as defined by statute. In such cases, the COA allows for the certificate holder to operate UAS in ways that would otherwise not comply with airspace requirements, such as operating the drone beyond the pilot\u2019s line of sight. In its 2018 UAS Integration Roadmap, FAA outlined some key topics and operational capabilities to be researched that are associated with specific UAS integration phases (see fig. 2). For example, both government and industry entities have research and testing of technologies underway to provide UAS the capability to detect obstacles in midair, such as other aircraft, and automatically maneuver to avoid collision; this capability is commonly referred to as \u201cdetect and avoid.\u201d FAA officials have stated that this key capability is necessary before allowing certain UAS operations on a routine basis, such as flights beyond the operator\u2019s line of sight. According to FAA, the agency plans to use data from several UAS research programs\u2014including the test site program\u2014and from other sources to inform its future decisions regarding UAS integration. In 2012, FAA was required by statute to establish a program to integrate UAS into the national", "The U.S. government supports various types of democracy assistance, which State and USAID categorize under their democracy, human rights, and governance portfolios.

TEXT: VA, through VHA operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. At the local level, VA has 172 VA medical centers that are organized into 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). At the national level, VHA\u2019s central office includes approximately 75 national program offices as of October 2019, which perform a range of clinical or administrative functions. For example, some program offices are responsible for specific clinical areas, such as spinal cord injury or mental health care, and may develop policy for those areas. To support VA's health care delivery system, VA's intramural research program aims to improve veterans' health by funding research on issues that affect veterans, developing effective treatments for veterans, and recruiting and retaining VA researchers. VA's medical and prosthetic research appropriation --- $722 million in fiscal year 2018 --- funds VA's intramural research program. VA also uses funding from its other appropriation accounts --- $544 million in fiscal year 2018 --- to support VA's intramural research by paying some costs associated with this research, such as equipment maintenance. According to VA, more than 60% of VA researchers are also clinicians who provide direct patient care, which helps translate VA research into clinical practice. ORD manages VA's intramural research program. Within ORD, there are four research and development services that are responsible for administering and supporting research; each research service has a specific focus, such as biomedical research and rehabilitation research. Each of the four research services is led by a director and has scientific program managers who are responsible for specific research portfolios (or topic areas) within their service. In addition to the four research services, ORD has a Cooperative Studies Program that is responsible for large-scale clinical trials and epidemiological studies within VA. (See Table 1.) All five of these ORD components support research by funding VA research projects. See appendix II for details on research funding and awards. Organizationally, ORD falls within the Office of Discovery, Education and Affiliates Networks, which was created in November 2018 to foster collaboration in addressing veterans' health concerns. ORD funds VA intramural research in a number of ways, such as the following: Merit Review Program. This program supports VA research projects that are typically led by one VA researcher at one VA facility. ORD's four research services administer this program and are responsible for soliciting, reviewing, selecting, and funding research proposals submitted by VA researchers. Researchers may submit proposals either in response to a request for applications on a specific topic (sometimes called targeted or focused requests) or to a general request for applications, for which researchers can propose projects on a wider range on topics. To be considered for funding, research proposals must be veteran-centric and meet other requirements. Each ORD research service typically evaluates Merit Review Program research proposals in two review cycles per year. Selected projects are funded for a set number of years and have a maximum budget --- typically for four years with a maximum amount of $1.2 million. The Merit Review Program accounts for the majority of VA-funded research studies that ORD funds. Cooperative Studies Program. This program funds larger-scale, multi-site clinical trials and epidemiological research studies on diseases that affect veterans. VA researchers can submit proposals at any time during the year. ORD's Chief Research and Development Officer and Cooperative Studies Program leadership evaluate proposals in two review cycles per year. The time frame and budget for selected studies varies, depending on features of specific studies. Career Development Program awards. The research services' Career Development Program provides funding to support, train and mentor individuals early in their career as VA researchers, which can include funding for specific research projects. Funding to support VA research centers and entities. In addition to funding individual research projects and researchers, ORD funds research centers and entities that focus on specific research areas. For example, the rehabilitation research service provides \"core funding\" to support 12 research centers focusing on areas such as limb loss, spinal cord injury, vision loss, and auditory disorders. This type of funding is competitive, and VA researchers must recompete in 5-year cycles. Once research has been completed, the findings can inform additional research. For example, research findings from a study on tissue could be used to inform a study done on humans in a controlled clinical setting, such as a clinical trial, which could in turn inform research that tests the effectiveness of a particular intervention in a less-controlled community setting. This concept is referred to as the \"research pipeline.\" Research findings leading to broad changes in clinical practice that affect public health is considered the end of the pipeline. Within VA, research findings can be translated into clinical practice in a number of ways, such as by implementing a new diagnostic tool, changing the treatment protocol for a particular disease, adding a new prompt for providers in the electronic health record, or", "CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, provides coverage to over 9 million children. It currently receives funding from the federal government, but funding for the program expires on September 30, 2020. Although Congress acted to reauthorize CHIP in September 2017, the full effects of the new programs have yet to be felt. The number of enrollees covered by CHIP has fallen in the previous year, the program now includes fewer services, and states have fewer opportunities to design and fund their programs. Additionally, the potential for CHIP crowd-out has increased with the expansion of Medicaid. States have several options to design their CHIP programs. They can run CHIP as an extension of Medicaid, run CHIP as a separate program, or run a combination of the two. Factors for consideration in developing a CHIP program include income eligibility limits, covered services, and premium requirements. CHIP plays an important role in providing coverage for children who would face challenges obtaining coverage through marketplace plans or traditional Medicaid/CHIP programs.\nIntroduction.........................................................1 Executive Summary....................................................2 I.

CHIP was originally created in 1997 to provide health insurance coverage for children whose families had incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private health insurance. The CHIP program is a state-run program that receives federal funding. This congressional authorization extended the Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and CHIP maintenance of effort (MOE) (MEC) in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. (See table 2.) 1\nA number of states have been struggling to maintain funding for their CHIP programs, however, as the expiration of CHIP federal funding approaches. (See section II.)\nThe aim of this report is to provide policymakers a summary of existing CHIP programs, how states design their CHIP programs, and the consequences of their decisions on program eligibility, enrollment, and premiums. The paper is structured in five sections.\nSection II briefly outlines the", "Text summarization: There is demand for someone who can create accurate summaries of long and complex technical documentation for easy interpretation and understanding. I have been in content writing, summarization, proofreading and academic related writing for several years now.. My experience has been in the different niches of finance, legal, travel/tourism, environment, medical, religion and technology, among others.", "How would you summarize the text?\nOur experience has shown that the key elements needed to make progress in high-risk areas are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, as well as any needed congressional action. The five criteria for removal that we issued in November 2000 are as follows: Leadership commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support. Capacity. Agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s). Action plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause, solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended. Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures. Demonstrated progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area. Starting in our 2015 update, we added clarity and specificity to our assessments by rating each high-risk area\u2019s progress on the five criteria and used the following definitions: Met. Actions have been taken that meet the criterion. There are no significant actions that need to be taken to further address this criterion. Partially met. Some, but not all, actions necessary to meet the criterion have been taken. Not met. Few, if any, actions towards meeting the criterion have been taken. We are removing two areas\u2014DOD Supply Chain Management and Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data\u2014from the list due to the progress that was made in addressing the high-risk issues. As we have with areas previously removed from the High-Risk List, we will continue to monitor these areas to ensure that the improvements we have noted are sustained. If significant problems again arise, we will consider reapplying the high-risk designation. We added two areas to the High-Risk List since our 2017 update\u2014Government-Wide Personnel Security Clearance Process and VA Acquisition Management. We are removing the area of DOD Supply Chain Management from the High-Risk List because, since 2017, DOD has addressed the remaining two criteria (monitoring and demonstrated progress) for the asset visibility and materiel distribution segments. Congressional attention, DOD leadership commitment, and our collaboration contributed to the successful outcome for this high-risk area, which had been on GAO\u2019s High-Risk List since 1990. DOD\u2019s actions for the asset visibility segment of this high-risk area included (1) providing guidance for the military components to consider key attributes of successful performance measures during metric development for their improvement initiatives; (2) incorporating into after- action reports, information relating to performance measures; and (3) demonstrating sustained progress by, for example, increasing its visibility of assets through radio-frequency identification (RFID), an automated data-capture technology that can be used to electronically identify, track, and store information contained on a tag. According to DOD, the use of RFID tags to provide visibility of sustainment cargo at the tactical leg (i.e., the last segment of the distribution system) resulted in $1.4 million annual cost savings. DOD\u2019s actions for the materiel distribution segment of this high-risk area included (1) making progress in developing its suite of distribution performance metrics; (2) incorporating distribution metrics, as appropriate, on the performance of all legs of the distribution system, including the tactical leg; (3) making progress in refining its Materiel Distribution Improvement Plan and incorporating additional actions based on interim progress and results; and (4) improving its capability to comprehensively measure distribution performance, identifying distribution problems and root cause, and implementing solutions. According to DOD, initiatives focused on distribution process and operational improvements have resulted in at least $1.56 billion in distribution cost avoidances to date. As we have with areas previously removed from the High-Risk List, we will continue to monitor this area to ensure that the improvements we have noted are sustained. Appendix I provides additional information on this high-risk area. We are removing the area of Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data from the High-Risk List because\u2014with strong congressional support and oversight\u2014the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and DOD have made significant progress since 2017 in establishing and implementing plans to mitigate potential gaps in weather satellite data. The United States relies on polar-orbiting satellites to provide a global perspective on weather every morning and afternoon. NOAA is responsible for the polar satellite program that crosses the equator in the afternoon while DOD is responsible for the polar satellite program that crosses the equator in the early morning orbit.</s> \nWhat measures should the government take to address the remaining areas still included on the High-Risk List, particularly those areas with persistent weaknesses and those with new high-risk areas added in 2017 and 2019?</s> \nTo address the areas still included on", "The summary explains how military commissions are used to try individuals charged with violating the laws of war.

States are also to assess automatic eligibility and establish an order for considering bases subject to MAGI income rules.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: The MIECHV program provides voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services for at-risk eligible families with children up to kindergarten entry. HRSA allocates MIECHV program formula grant funds to states based partly on the proportion of children under age 5 living in poverty in each state, among other factors. In fiscal year 2018, states received an average of $6.9 million in MIECHV program formula grant funding, ranging from $1.2 million provided to North Dakota to $21.4 million to California (see appendix I for a list of all states and their fiscal year 2016 through 2018 funding). Generally, the state\u2019s public health or social services department is the lead agency that receives and administers the funds. States target MIECHV program resources to at-risk communities and have the flexibility to tailor the program to serve the specific needs of their communities. States are generally required to provide home visiting services using an HHS-approved evidence-based program model. Currently, HHS has determined through its Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness review that 18 evidence-based home visiting models meet HHS-established criteria for evidence of effectiveness, and are therefore eligible for MIECHV funding. States may select programs to implement from the models that have been approved by HHS, or states may choose to implement a home visiting service delivery model that qualifies as a promising approach, as defined in the statute. In MIECHV-funded home visiting programs, professionals meet regularly with families and provide services tailored to the families\u2019 specific needs, such as teaching parenting skills, promoting early learning in the home, or conducting screenings and providing referrals to address caregiver depression, substance abuse, and family violence. According to HHS, the MIECHV program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during pregnancy and early childhood have the potential to improve the lives of children and families. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of families served and number of home visits conducted nearly doubled (see table 1). The MIECHV program is the primary federal program focusing exclusively on evidence-based home visiting, according to HHS. However, in addition to administering the MIECHV program, states may have other home visiting programs that may be supported by funds from other federal programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. These home visiting programs may provide services that differ from those provided under the MIECHV program. For example, states may provide home visiting services through these programs that use program models that are different from the MIECHV program models approved by HHS. The MOE requirement in the MIECHV program\u2019s authorizing statute provides that funds provided to an eligible entity receiving a MIECHV grant \u201cshall supplement, and not supplant, funds from other sources for early childhood home visitation programs or initiatives.\u201d To demonstrate their compliance with this statutory requirement, states are required by HRSA to report in their annual grant applications their MOE spending for the prior fiscal year. HRSA provides guidance to states on how to report their MOE spending in the annual NOFOs. For example, since fiscal year 2013, the MOE guidance in the NOFOs generally has directed states to only report spending that meets the following criteria: paid for with state general funds, spent in the prior fiscal year on HHS approved evidence-based programs that include home visiting as a primary service delivery strategy, implemented in response to findings from the most current statewide needs assessment, and offered on a voluntary basis to pregnant women or caregivers of children from birth to kindergarten entry. Over time, HRSA has clarified the MOE guidance provided in the NOFOs to help address questions received from states, according to HRSA officials. We previously reported that certain grant design features affect the likelihood that states will use federal funds to supplement, rather than supplant (or replace), their own spending. One such design feature requires grant recipients to contribute their own funds in order to obtain grant funds. Requiring grant recipients to contribute their own funds can take the form of a match or MOE requirement. According to our prior report, matching grants typically contain either a single rate (e.g., 50 percent) or a range of rates (e.g., 50 to 80 percent) at which the federal government will match state spending on a particular program. An MOE requirement, in contrast, requires states to maintain existing levels of state spending on a particular program as a condition of receiving federal funds. Depending on the specific program and its MOE requirement, if a state did not previously spend any state funds on covered activities, then the state could be allowed to maintain MOE spending of $0. The MOE requirement is one of many MIECHV program requirements that HRSA is fulfilling.", "The text discusses the management of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), its reliance on contractors, and the primary role of Y-12 in providing enriched uranium capabilities.

Such reviews do not always identify states that have the greatest potential errors and can miss states with significant issues. CMS has taken some steps to improve its allocation of resources, such as developing a risk-based approach for determining the number of staff to allocate to review states\u2019 expenditures. We made several specific recommendations related to how the agency can refine this risk-based approach. CMS should continue implementing its recommendations on targeting its resources to better address the types and levels of risks states pose to federal expenditures. Finally, we believe that the Trump administration\u2019s new initiatives to further ensure correct eligibility determinations may affect CMS\u2019s policies and procedures for overseeing expenditures and Medicaid expansion enrollees. These initiatives are the subject of our forthcoming report on efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, which we plan to publish in early November. We provided a preview of our upcoming report on October 6, 2019. For more information, visit.", "VA PROVIDES OR PAYS FOR LONG-TERM CARE THROUGH THREE Institution al and 11 noninstitutional programs.

VA has introduced several educational assistance programs since then, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009. This program is VA's largest educational benefit to veterans, covering their tuition fees, housing, and books. The 2009 GI Bill is particularly beneficial to veterans of the 9/11 era, who may have limited employment opportunities due to their deployment schedules. Veterans are eligible for federal student aid when enrolled in postsecondary education, but those funds are in addition to their GI Bill benefits. The author concludes that veterans generally perform similarly to nonveteran students, and that the top 50 schools that receive the most post-9/11 GI Bill benefits have similar student outcomes. FIGURES 1. VA Post-9/11 GI Bill and Other Educational Benefits Received, Fiscal Year 2017: Public and other nonprofit schools: 48%; For-profit schools: 27%; Other (Federal agencies, Tribal Colleges, and independent schools): 0.1% and 24%, respectively. FIGURE 2. Public and other nonprofit schools are more popular compared to for-profit schools for the top 50 schools that receive the most Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments. For public schools, the tuition and fee payments for top 50 schools accounted for 40% of all Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments. 25 states. However, the average for-profit full-time retention rate was 72 percent at these 50 schools. Across all 50 schools, the top 50 schools also served a smaller percent of Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries who were first-generation college students (about 21 percent) compared to the national average for schools that received any Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments (31 percent), which may be associated with their non-traditional student populations. However, nearly 40 percent of beneficiaries at the top 50 schools were 25 years old or older, which is slightly higher than the national average (about 37 percent). The schools that received the most Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits may benefit from economies of scale and efficiencies, such as managing large enrollments, integrating student veterans into the school community, and supporting their needs through additional services and amenities. For example, the Department of Defense awarded a contract to a single source to offer educational assistance to veterans, regardless of program or degree, during fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Similarly, the Department of Defense recently awarded a contract to a single source to provide tuition assistance (up to 100 percent of tuition) to Air Force Reservists and Guard. The contract is meant to encourage Air Force members to participate in educational opportunities. The post-9/11 GI Bill has been the subject of much attention, controversy, and debates regarding its cost, access, and impact on the veteran community, with veterans and stakeholders expressing opinions and concerns on each of these issues. These debates and concerns may include discussions about the program\u2019s cost, the adequacy of VA funding, the need for additional benefit payments for dependents and spouses, eligibility criteria for certain service members, and the impact on veteran educational outcomes. To continue to improve the educational outcomes of a growing number of veterans, VA will continue to monitor the performance of its programs, including the post-9/11 GI Bill, and collaborate with Education to address any areas of the federal government that require improvements to better serve veterans and all students.

Crash avoidance features have been developed for vehicles intended to avoid pedestrian crashes and their severity, while passive safety features are vehicle components designed to reduce the severity of injuries if pedestrians are struck.

Executive branch agencies depend on timely production of security clearances to support national security missions and protect sensitive information from compromise. GAO identified this area as a high-risk program in 2005. However, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, it has been a focus of federal, congressional and private sector attention on improving the security clearance process. The government relies on the security clearance process to protect national security information, such as classified secrets, and to grant individuals access to federal IT systems and facilities. It is comprised of multiple stakeholders\u2014 including the office of personnel management (OPM) and 25 executive branch agencies.

For 2020, the Bureau is making a slight change to its guidance: While aboard ship, seamen assigned to the U.S. fleet, regardless of where the ship is, will be counted as having their usual residence at the last U.S. port the ship visited or departed from. This includes crew members assigned to vessels that are not actually in a U.S. port. This change ensures consistency between crew assigned to U.S. ships in or out of port, as well as consistency with the general count of U.S. residents at their usual residence. Prisoners. In 2010, if convicted and confined in a state or federal correctional facility for a minor offense, a person could be counted at their prior residence, if the Bureau could determine that residence. In 2011, however, the Bureau changed its policy to make it the standard operating practice to instead count prisoners as resident at the state and county in which the institution is located. For 2020, the Bureau plans to continue counting persons in correctional facilities at the address of the institution rather than their prior residence. However, under this policy, the Bureau will count those who were convicted of misdemeanors and placed in a local jail or other correctional facility in the state in which they resided before confinement and then transferred to a state prison. Staff members of the Armed Forces, who live on the military installation as an extension of their base. In 2010, military personnel assigned to a housing family area as part of military base housing for the purpose of residing at or near the base in the installation area were counted at the military installation. The 2020 guidance, reflecting a 2011 Bureau policy change, makes the treatment of military installations more consistent and generalizes that all military housing units (including apartments) be treated as if they were dormitories or other temporary residencies (and therefore counted at an address other than the military installation itself). Members of Indian tribal governments residing in urban areas while conducting tribal business. In 2010, the Bureau counted American Indian and Alaska Native tribal leaders or legislators on official business at the residential address of the tribal executive officers or legislators. The 2020 guidance retains this principle in the case where an tribal leader or legislator resides at or near the tribal facility, but will count tribal members of legislatures who reside, for example, in urban areas that contain only tribal offices in those locations at their state-defined legislative district residency in 2020. University students attending temporarily as part of a program. In 2010, the Bureau counted students of the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) located in Duluth, Minnesota, who attended the school through a program with the University of Minnesota Twin Cities where the course of study was defined as residence in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2020, the Bureau will count students in a program like that between UMD and the U of M Twin Cities at their home state of record. Military cadets attending temporary as part of a program. In 2011, the Bureau decided to treat cadets in the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York as temporary residents on the basis of where their home address was before attending the academy (rather than being counted like all other cadets). In 2020, the Bureau is continuing that policy.\nThis action might not be possible to undo.

The program requires U.S. and foreign commercial aircraft operators traveling to, from, within or overflying the United States, as well as U.S. commercial aircraft operators with international point-to-point flights, to collect information from passengers and transmit it electronically to TSA. This information includes personally identifiable information, such as full name, gender, date of birth, passport information (if available), and certain non-personally identifiable information, such as itinerary information and the unique number associated with a travel record (record number locator). The Secure Flight program matches the passenger-provided personally identifiable information against federal government watchlists and other information to determine if passengers may pose a security risk and to assign them a risk category. Since January 2009, Secure Flight has matched passengers to two subsets of the Terrorist Screening Database\u2014the No Fly List, composed of individuals who should be precluded from boarding an aircraft or entering the sterile area of a U.S. airport, and the Selectee List, composed of individuals who should receive enhanced screening prior to boarding an aircraft or entering an airport sterile area. The risk categories are not specifically communicated to the air carriers, but for each passenger Secure Flight provides responses to air carriers commensurate with the risk levels identified (e.g., an air carrier will receive a response of \u201cinhibited\u201d if the passenger was identified as being in the highest-risk category, or the boarding pass printed for a high-risk passenger will identify that passenger as a selectee for enhanced screening at the security checkpoint). In April 2011, in response to the December 25, 2009 attempted attack, TSA also began matching passengers to a third subset of the Terrorist Screening Database\u2014the Expanded Selectee List\u2014to designate known or suspected terrorists not otherwise included on the No Fly or Selectee Lists as selectees for enhanced screening. The Expanded Selectee List, in general, includes all records in the Terrorist Screening Database with a full name (first name and surname) and full date of birth not otherwise included on the No Fly or Selectee Lists. The Secure Flight system, which also screens passengers against the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists, among others, results in passengers receiving one of four prescreening outcomes: Low risk (expedited screening). Passengers who are eligible for expedited screening, such as those with TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae, Unknown Risk (standard screening). Passengers who warrant standard screening, High Risk (enhanced screening). Passengers who receive enhanced screening such as a pat down and explosives trace detection, because they have been identified as matches to government watchlists, including the Selectee, Expanded Selectee, Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists, or Highest Risk (denied boarding). Passengers who are not permitted to board a commercial aircraft, such as passengers who are on the No Fly List or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Do Not Board List (see fig. 1). Secure Flight also randomly identifies passengers for enhanced screening. Although subject to the same screening measures as high risk passengers, they have not been determined to be high risk. Similarly, individuals included on the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists have not been determined to be of high risk, but rather have been identified using rules based on current intelligence and other factors that may indicate an elevated risk. TSA leverages CBP information and targeting capabilities to create the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists. Specifically, TSA leverages (1) data CBP collects regarding passengers traveling internationally (such as citizenship, passport country of issuance, and address information), and (2) CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System to identify potentially high risk passengers arriving or departing the United States by comparing passenger information with law enforcement, intelligence, and other enforcement data using risk-based targeting scenarios and assessments. Analysts within TSA I&A\u2019s Threat Analysis Division review intelligence to identify factors that may indicate elevated passenger risk. TSA works with CBP to create Silent Partner and Quiet Skies rules in the Automated Targeting System based on these factors. The system returns information on passengers who match with the rules and are scheduled to fly on U.S.- bound flights. TSA then omits any individuals on the Silent Partner cleared list (i.e. travelers exempted from further enhanced screening based on a specific rule) before placing the remaining passengers on the Silent Partner List. The Secure Flight program designates passengers who are on the Silent Partner List as selectees for enhanced screening for a particular international flight. In April 2012, TSA\u2019s Quiet Skies List became fully operational. The Quiet Skies List is a subset of passengers on the Silent Partner List. Specifically, TSA identifies certain Silent Partner rules that warrant continued enhanced screening. \nWhat are the specific screening measures applied to passengers designated as selectees", "In conclusion, for initial review, the time frames for FDA\u2019s review of any specific NDA under its goals associated with all three key features, including priority and standard NDAs, would meet its PDUFA\u2019s commitments, FDA uses three types of features linked to NDAs.

Note: Does.\nThe National Health Federation is proud to promote the following article on the benefits of Magnesium. This article is written by an AI language model and not attributable to us or any of our members. However, in our humble opinion, it is written well and it offers an alternative perspective to the conventional prescription and medical treatment. So we publish it here \u201cfree of charge\u201d on the health topic of magnesium.\nHealth Benefits of Magnesium\nMagnesium is an essential mineral that is necessary for good health. It is found in various foods such as nuts, whole grains, beans, green leafy vegetables, and fatty fish. It plays an important role in numerous bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, synthesis of DNA, and bone health. Most importantly, magnesium helps regulate the levels of calcium and potassium in the body. This regulation is crucial because high calcium levels can lead to cardiovascular problems and low calcium and potassium levels can lead to osteoporosis. Magnesium also helps regulate blood pressure, insulin levels, and inflammatory responses. Magnesium deficiency is thought to contribute to a variety of health conditions, including heart disease, osteoporosis, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, and a higher risk of stroke. In this article, we will explore the benefits of magnesium, how to determine if you have a deficiency, and what foods to eat that are packed with this nutrient.\nTypes of Magnesium\nThere are different forms of magnesium that are absorbed differently. The two most common forms of magnesium are magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate. Magnesium oxide is the most commonly used type, but it can be poorly absorbed and has a tendency to cause diarrhea. Magnesium citrate is better absorbed, but it may be harder to find.\nAbsorption of Magnesium\nFoods that are high in fat, as well as coffee, tea, and alcohol, can decrease the absorption of magnesium.\n- Cooking: Cooking vegetables can reduce the level of magnesium. In order to keep the magnesium levels high, you can cook vegetables by steaming, stir-frying, or boiling.\n- Magnesium oxides contain magnesium and an oxide, such as calcium oxide. Magnesium stearate is used as a lubricant in vitamin capsules, but this form of magnesium does not supply supplemental magnesium.\n- Magnesium sulfate is Epsom salt, which can be absorbed through the skin or used for laxative purposes.\n- Magnesium threonate and magnesium glycinate can get through the blood-brain barrier and may help improve cognitive function and memory.\n- It is best to take magnesium supplements in the morning or early afternoon, as it can have a calming effect.\nHow Much Magnesium Per Day\nYou can work out how much magnesium you can take per day by working out your dose based on age and gender.\n- Age 51-70: 310\u2013320 milligrams for males, 320\u2013320 milligrams", "Federal agencies are dependent on information technology (IT) systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and report essential information. These systems are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. However, the IT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are at risk. Information and systems are subject to serious threats that can have adverse impacts on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation. These threats can include purposeful attacks, environmental disruptions, and human/machine errors, and may result in harm to the national and economic security interests of the United States. In recognition of the growing threat, we designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, we expanded the information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure. We further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact federal agencies, as well as entities across various critical infrastructure sectors. In fiscal year 2017, federal executive branch civilian agencies reported 35,277 incidents to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team. These incidents included web-based attacks, phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic and national security and personal privacy. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In January 2019, the Department of Justice (Justice) announced that it had indicted two Ukrainian men for their roles in a large-scale, international conspiracy to hack into the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s computer systems and profit by trading on critical information they stole. The indictment alleges that the two hacked into the Commission\u2019s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system and stole thousands of files, including annual and quarterly earnings reports containing confidential, non-public, financial information, which publicly traded companies are required to disclose to the Commission. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that Russian government actors had been targeting the systems of multiple U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors since at least March 2016. These Russian government actors had affected multiple organizations in various sectors, to include energy, nuclear, water, aviation, construction, and critical manufacturing. DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation characterized this activity as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors who targeted small commercial facilities\u2019 networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate, but related, incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for 21.5 million individuals. In total, OPM estimated 22.1 million individuals had some form of personally identifiable information stolen, with 3.6 million being a victim of both breaches. The risks to IT systems supporting the federal government and the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are increasing as security threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated. These risks include insider threats from witting or unwitting employees, escalating and emerging risks from around the globe, steady advances in the sophistication of attack technology, and the emergence of new and more destructive attacks. Therefore, it is imperative for agency leaders and managers at all levels to manage the risks associated with the operation and use of information systems that support their missions and business functions. Cybersecurity risk management comprises a full range of activities undertaken to protect IT and data from unauthorized access and other cyber threats; maintain awareness of cyber threats; detect anomalies and incidents adversely affecting IT and data; and mitigate the impact of, respond to, and recover from incidents. Information sharing facilitates and supports all of these activities. Several federal laws, executive orders, and policies establish requirements for protecting federal systems and managing cybersecurity risks. Specifically, FISMA is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets, as well as the effective oversight of information security risks. The act requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency- wide information security program to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another entity. FISMA also assigns government-wide responsibilities to key agencies: OMB is responsible for developing and overseeing implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. DHS is responsible for certain operational aspects of agencies\u2019 information security policies and practices, including assisting OMB in fulfilling its FISMA authorities, issuing binding operational directives, monitoring agencies\u2019 security policies and", "When patients are seeking access to investigational drugs, their first option is to consider whether they can obtain them through participation in a clinical trial. Clinical trials are a step in the drug development process through which a drug manufacturer assesses the safety and effectiveness of its investigational drug through human testing. A clinical trial can take place in a variety of settings (e.g., research hospitals, universities, and community clinics) and geographic locations. Patients seeking access to investigational drugs that cannot access clinical trials may potentially obtain access through FDA\u2019s expanded access program, and a licensed physician can submit a request for access to an investigational drug for treatment use on behalf of the patient during or after phase I, II or III of clinical trials.", "", "While the size of the adjustments DOD recorded for FY 2018 was not surprising, the explanations we were given, or their usefulness.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT:\nFrom:", "How Platform Companies Handle Data and Privacy Protection tax withheld from wages and remit it to IRS. Furthermore, when employers offer benefits such as health insurance, they are generally the ones that pay the employer-side premiums. Some platform companies offer certain benefits voluntarily, such as the option to make 401(k) contributions or have their fees for healthcare paid by the company. While platform workers may incur certain deductible expenses, such as mileage on a car, their tax obligations are significantly different than those of employees. Employees have significantly lower filing complexity compared to platform workers. Figure 2 summarizes these differences. Tax Information Returns (IR 1099) Forms to report taxable income paid to independent contractors for these services are: \u2022 IR 1099-MISC (if the annual amount paid to the contractor was more than $600) \u2022 IR 1099-K (if the total amount of credit card and third party network payments were over $20,000 and more than 2% of receipts). Platform workers receive either one or both of these forms depending on platform company payment practices. 1099-K (Box 1) can be used to help verify gross income and 1099-MISC and state returns often include the dollar amount of the payment along with the description. Additionally, for 1099-MISC, the payer also provides Schedule K-1 Form (Form 1065 or Form 1120-S) if the IRS asks. Tax Filing Methods/Requirements The main requirements, which are similar for both types of workers, are as follows: 1. Federal income tax return is filed 2. Self-employment taxes are generally owed 3. Certain deductible expenses may be claimed Platform workers, except in limited cases, are subject to self-employment taxes including Social Security and Medicaid taxes (also known as Medicare tax). The amount of these taxes (which is required as a mandatory withholding) is equal to the Social Security (6.2%) and Medicaid tax (1.45%) rates, regardless of whether the worker also has an employer and has another Social Security tax paid. 2 SB/SE Overview Platform workers can also deduct certain expenses to reduce their income subject to Social Security and Medicaid taxes. Generally, these can be categorized as expenses related to vehicle usage (including gas, insurance, repairs, and depreciation), a dedicated home office space (such as rent, utilities, and property taxes), the cost of supplies including laptops, cell phone contracts, and more. These expenses may not be more than 50% of the self-employment tax liability. A Form 1040 Schedule C is required. Platform workers generally have different tax filing obligations than employees. Employees must receive W-2s, but platform workers often receive 1099-MISC and 1099-K forms.

FEMA reported the three storms cost $125 billion (Harvey); $90 billion (Maria); and $50 billion (Irma). The storms caused major damage to infrastructure, such as highways and bridges, especially in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. The federal government provided emergency relief funds to repair damaged highways and bridges in Puerto Rico, which were distributed through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). FHWA works with each state or territory to determine which projects are eligible for funding using inspections and other documentation.

The Department of Transportation Office of Emergency Transportation is working with the FHWA to help incorporate resiliency considerations into agency policies and procedures.\n\nThirdly, FHWA is developing tools and training to assist state and local agencies to address hazards, including natural disasters. Training and simulation exercises are being provided to help state and local agencies better understand how to identify and respond to natural disasters.\n\nFinally, FHWA is partnering with the National Center for Research in Advanced Infrastructure and Construction (RIDC) to advance engineering practices and research on resilient infrastructure. RIDC is working closely with state and local agencies, academia, and industry to develop practical solutions to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters, including hurricanes.\n\nOverall, FHWA is taking proactive measures to ensure that the repairs made with emergency relief funds are sustainable in the long-term, prevent future damage, and are resilient to natural disasters.", "DOD\u2019s program for recruiting, retaining, and managing military physicians and dentists serves as the principal advisor for all DOD health policies and programs.

The Army and Air Force, for example, have the Family Advocacy Program while the Navy has the Victim Advocate Program. In 2007, DOD mandated that commanders report instances of child abuse but have failed to track compliance.

PAGE X OF X (TEXT HERE) ID/IQ contract orders. Agencies may use either option, depending on their needs and circumstances. In September 2018, we reported that multiple- award contracts offer the advantage of having qualified contractors precompetitively identified and available. One SBA official advised that agency contracting officers often prefer using single-award contracts, because they can select the preferred contractor and can have a closer relationship with the contractor. However, multiple-award contracts allow agencies easier access to multiple contractors with varying capabilities, which can be a useful alternative in certain circumstances. Agency contracting officers use ID/IQ contracts and are required to follow the procedures and requirements in the FAR. When evaluating a firm for a task or delivery order contract\u2014including past performance evaluation\u2014the contracting officer considers only information directly related to the order, and may not consider information for unrelated work or phases on the contract. Contracting officers have some additional requirements for past performance evaluation for task or delivery orders where there is no past performance available in the past performance database. The FAR also describes special rules on conflicts of interest and certain types of ID/IQ contracts where a single contractor or group of contractors has indefinite multiple-award contracts and are awarded subsequent task or delivery order contracts. We last reported on federal contracting in FY2018, emphasizing issues related to contracting and acquisition strategies, in our September 2018 report on selected aspects of federal contracting. We have updated information from that report throughout this report. Contracting: An Overview Contracting involves the procurement of goods and services for federal agencies, from paper clips to major information technology systems and services. Through contracts, agencies enter agreements to acquire goods and services by private sector firms\u2014such as small businesses, large businesses, universities, hospitals, or NGOs, either directly or through government-wide acquisition contracts. When the government decides to purchase an item, it defines a requirement, and the agency responsible for fulfilling that requirement obtains quotations from the private sector\u2014either through a solicitation or through government-wide acquisition contracts\u2014to fulfill the requirement. If the requirement meets the threshold amount for a full competition, then an agency must solicit and award a contract to the firm submitting the lowest evaluated price among firms submitting responsive quotations. Agencies that require a large quantity of an identical item or service may consider negotiating a delivery schedule that works for both contractor and agency\u2014with fewer individual contracts. (Text) Contract Modifications A contract modification is a change to an existing contract, made with the written agreement of both parties. As discussed in our report on federal contract management in March 2018, each agency contracting office has its own staff of contract specialists and managers to carry out contract administration responsibilities. These include modifying contracts to modify the work to be performed or the schedule. Agencies generally can modify contracts or orders, or change requirements (such as price, quantities, quality, place of performance) when unforeseen circumstances make it impracticable or impractical to contract with or pay a contractor. We last reported on federal contract modification decisions in our reports on selected aspects of federal contract management in March 2018. We have updated information from that report throughout this report. The types of contract modifications discussed in this report are: \u2022 exercising an option \u2022 exercising a termination \u2022 making a time-and-material change order Agency contracting officials determine when a modification is advantageous and appropriate. Most of the data on contract modifications are not available publicly or from a single database. SBA\u2019s Contract Administration Services (CAS) provides training and technical assistance to agency contracting officers and staff. CAS personnel advise contracting officers when to seek legal advice. Contracting offices have to report any terminations and large modifications. (Text) Exercising Options Options are clauses in a contract that give the contracting agency or the contractor the ability to request additional goods, services, or real estate leases\u2014in other words, to obtain additional quantities. Agencies are required to periodically review contracts they have already awarded to make sure that their current contractor is still the best firm for the job. If the need for additional goods or services becomes known, contracting offices can modify the contract accordingly, depending on their knowledge of the marketplace.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: To receive FEMA assistance under FEMA\u2019s Individuals and Households Program, through which disaster survivors can receive help with housing and other needs, individuals must register by answering a standard series of intake questions. In our May 2019 report, we found that some individuals with disabilities may have faced long wait times and unclear registration questions, and that FEMA\u2019s internal communication across its programs about survivors\u2019 disability-related needs was ineffective. Long wait times: Individuals who tried to apply for assistance using the helpline confronted long wait times, which may have posed greater challenges for those with disabilities. In the days after Hurricane Maria affected Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014 when survivors from Harvey and Irma were concurrently contacting the helpline\u2014up to 69 percent of calls went unanswered and the daily average wait time for answered calls peaked at almost an hour and a half, according to our analysis of FEMA data. While long wait times could be burdensome for all individuals, state officials and disability advocates we interviewed said long wait times were especially burdensome for people with certain disabilities, such as those with attention disorders or whose assistive technology prevents multi- tasking when waiting on hold. Unclear registration questions: FEMA\u2019s registration process did not give individuals a clear opportunity to state they have a disability or request an accommodation because the registration did not directly ask registrants to provide this information. According to FEMA officials at the time, information about disability-related needs can help FEMA staff match individuals with disabilities with appropriate resources in a timely and efficient manner and target additional assistance, such as help with the application process. However, individuals with disabilities may not have requested accommodations or reported their disability and related needs during FEMA\u2019s registration-intake due to the unclear questions. As a result, the registration process may have under-identified people with disabilities. For example, in Puerto Rico, an estimated 21.6 percent of people have disabilities, according to 2017 Census data. However, less than 3 percent of all registrants in the territory answered \u201cyes\u201d to the disability-related question in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Ineffective communication across FEMA programs: Individuals may have faced challenges receiving necessary assistance because FEMA did not effectively track and communicate information about individuals\u2019 disability-related needs across its assistance programs after such needs were identified. FEMA officials we interviewed for the May 2019 report explained that accommodation requests and disability-related information identified after registration-intake are recorded in a general \u201cnotes\u201d section of a registrant\u2019s case file, which can be easily overlooked as a case file is passed along to subsequent FEMA officials. In our May 2019 report we recommended that FEMA implement new registration-intake questions to improve FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and address survivors\u2019 disability-related needs. FEMA concurred with this recommendation, and officials reported that in May 2019 the agency updated the questions to directly ask individuals if they have a disability. According to FEMA\u2019s analysis of applications for assistance following recent disasters, which used the updated questions, the percentage of registrants who reported having a disability increased. FEMA officials stated this increase gives them confidence the change has improved FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and address disability-related needs of individuals affected by disasters. We also recommended that FEMA improve its communication of registrants\u2019 disability-related information across FEMA programs, such as by developing an alert within survivor files that indicates an accommodation request. FEMA did not concur with this recommendation, explaining that the agency lacks specific funding to augment the legacy data systems that capture and communicate registration information. In its comments on our May 2019 report, FEMA stated that it began a long- term initiative in April 2017 to improve data management and exchange, and improve overall data quality and standardization. After FEMA completes this initiative, FEMA expects that efforts to share and flag specific disability-related data will be much easier. We believe that in the interim, FEMA could explore other cost-effective ways to improve communication, such as through agency guidance that encourages program officials to review registrants\u2019 case file notes. As FEMA moves ahead with its initiatives to improve data, we encourage it to consider and ultimately implement technology changes, such as developing an alert within files that indicates an accommodation request, to help improve communication across FEMA programs.

In addition, the number of HECM terminations increased over 1,000 percent in fiscal years 2014 through 2018, with the share of terminations due to loan defaults increasing from 2 percent in fiscal 2013 to 18 percent in fiscal 2018. Because data on the HECM program is not complete nor consistently recorded, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the rapid expansion and increased loan defaults were caused by program improvements or program weaknesses.

On March 13, 2020, guidance was issued to the Census Bureau workforce of ACO and headquarters employees to begin working from home and to practice social distancing in the field. This was followed by the suspension of field and the reduction of staff in headquarters by 80 percent. The Bureau extended headquarters telework from March 19 to April 7, to ensure that office spaces could be prepared and tested to implement the resumption plan. To support continued operations, more than 2,000 employees remained fully physically operational, including staff who operate and protect our 13 data processing centers. In-person staffing at data centers was considered essential and appropriate based on continuity risk analysis by Mission Critical Facilities Directorate staff. After careful consideration of security, fire safety, infrastructure, and data availability risks, the Bureau determined that the data processing centers, which operate under strict security controls, would require a 95 percent staffing. The remaining staff could implement physical distancing practices, with PPE provided when necessary. The decision to maintain essential physical staffing was further confirmed and validated when a fire occurred in the building hosting the National Processing Center on April 11, 2020. The building was fully evacuated, but with quick actions by the staff, critical operations were returned in about an hour. 2", "DOD has determined that the benefits of continuing its light tactical wheeled vehicle (Humvee) program\u2014particularly modernizing remaining M1100 series Humvees\u2014outweigh the costs.

Light Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Program Office Family Tree continue to support partner capacity building objectives with its light tactical wheeled vehicle program. In June 2018, legislation directed the Army to not transfer more than 30 Humvees unless they meet certain modernization requirements. DOD has determined that using EDA to transfer excess older model Humvees (M923A1 models) to certain foreign governments with partner capacity building objectives aligns with U.S. national security interests and supports the Army\u2019s modernization efforts for Humvees. As a result, the Army intends to transfer some additional excess Humvees to foreign governments that satisfy its EDA criteria. The transfers help modernize the partner militaries, improve military-to-military relationships, and support the Army\u2019s Humvee modernization efforts..

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that, by 2029, there will be 3.6 million too few workers relative to the 2.8 million fewer older, labor force-aging workers during this decade. Moreover, a significant labor market challenge, according to workforce development experts, comes from the nation\u2019s long-standing opioid crisis. For example, more than half of all the new unemployment insurance claims are in the healthcare, construction, and manufacturing sectors (GAO, \u201cUnemployment Insurance Trust Fund,\u201d April 29, 2019). State officials reported that the need is more acute in these areas, in part because many employees are working long hours and not likely to participate in workforce programs without some financial assistance.

The office previously lacked statutorily required national drug control strategy plans for 2017 and 2018 and did not fully comply with the law for its 2019 plan. The office was slow in producing these plans and also did not include a number of required pieces of information. A Government Accountability Office report found that this office is making progress in addressing some of these requirements, but continues to miss others. Drug misuse is a complex and emerging issue that should be placed on the High-Risk List due to the challenge it presents the labor market for the workforce system. To address drug misuse, states have created workforce development programs such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The workforce system has received federal funding for drug prevention and workforce development, including $2 billion from the HHS secretary to states for 2019-2022 to address the opioid crisis. States are expected to create workforce development plans that align and integrate their programs. (GAO, \u201cHigh Risk Series: Federal Tax Administration,\u201d GAO-10-1012T, March 16, 2015, p. 16-17). The National Guard plays an integral role in disaster response and disaster recovery, so ensuring that it remains capable of fulfilling its mission is increasingly critical as U.S. military operations become more complex around the world and at home. GAO issued High Risk Reports in 2017 and 2018 on DOD\u2019s management of aircraft fleets (especially the Air Force\u2019s F- 22 fleet) and the Navy\u2019s ship maintenance and modernization efforts\u2014both are critical to sustaining the readiness of key military capabilities (GAO, \u201cDefense High Risk Series,\u201d GAO-17-105, September 27, 2016, p. 43; GAO, \u201cDefense Acquisitions High Risk Series,\u201d GAO-18-105, March 7, 2018, p. 34.\nThe National Guard is responsible for domestic disasters such as those caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, fires, and wildfires. In times of domestic emergency, Congress can call the National Guard into federal service, and the President can send National Guard Forces overseas. This is a key part of the dual mission they have been playing domestically and overseas (over the past 40 years, the National Guard has deployed more than 250,000 of its members overseas). The National Guard may perform a wide variety of actions, which may include providing base security and military police support, operating communications and air traffic control systems, conducting combat operations, performing administrative and logistical support, and providing humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. GAO, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, and others have raised concerns about the readiness of the Air Force\u2019s F-22 fleet (GAO, Air Force Nuclear Weapons: Comprehensive Plan Needed to Address Maintenance Concerns, GAO\u201115\u2011101, September 2014; GAO, \u201cF\u201135 Joint Strike Fighter,\u201d GAO- 16\u2011101, February 2016;). 15 Since at least 2014, the Inspector General has reported that the Navy\u2019s maintenance practices aboard ships have led to unnecessary work, delays, and extended deployments. 16 Furthermore, GAO\u2019s High Risk reports found that some of the largest aircraft fleets the Air Force and Navy have ever possessed are not maintaining", "The text has been about the training programs about sexual assault forensic examiners.

However, manufacturers may choose to provide date labels to help consumers and retailers decide when the food is of best quality. These date labels may carry different introductory phrases, such as \u2018\u201cbest by,\u201d \u201csell by,\u201d \u201cuse by,\u201d or \u201cbest if used by,\u201d prior to the date, according to the preference of the manufacturer. In most cases, these labels indicate quality or freshness (i.e., the last date by which the manufacturer believes the food will be fresh or taste best), according to USDA. However, according to representatives from the Food Marketing Institute, because date labels are not federally regulated, manufacturers use a number of different date labels across industry, and this variation in date labels may result in consumer confusion about the meaning of the labels. Consumer confusion about date labels on packaged foods contributes to food waste, according to various studies. Due to this confusion about what date labels mean, consumers may throw out food that is safe to eat, even if the food does not have visible signs of spoilage, according to these studies. For example, in a 2017 study, participants were asked to state what they thought a particular date label on a certain packaged food meant. The study found that participants did not have a consistent understanding of date labels\u2014some thought the labels indicated safety, and some thought they indicated quality, and others were unsure what the labels meant. Furthermore, three studies estimated that from 34 percent to 70 percent of consumers think that their risk of foodborne illness increases if they consume a packaged food product past the date label. In addition to confusion about the meaning of date labels, one study found that consumers are confused about who is responsible for date labels. According to the study, more than one-third of consumers surveyed believed the federal government regulates date labels, and 26 percent were unsure. USDA and FDA share oversight of nearly all the nation\u2019s food supply but do not regulate most date labels and are not required to do so by federal law. USDA is responsible for the safety and proper labeling of meat, poultry, and egg products, and FDA is responsible for the safety and proper labeling of virtually all other foods. Within USDA, FSIS is the public-health agency responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. According to FSIS, its goals include lowering the incidence of pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses and limiting the occurrence of outbreaks, and ensuring that regulated products are properly packaged and labeled so consumers have access to important information about the product. Also within USDA, AMS provides voluntary quality-grading programs for producers of products such as milk, eggs, and meat. These quality- grading programs are paid for by the producers of these commodities and can require, among other things, that producers participating in these programs use date labels. In addition, USDA has research components that could address issues relating to date labels. For example, USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supports research through grants to individuals, institutions, and organizations, and the Economic Research Service conducts economic research to inform and enhance decision-making. FDA has statutory authority to regulate the safety of foods and nutrition labels on packaged foods not regulated by FSIS. However, the agency is not required by statute to regulate the use of date labels. FDA also exercises its general authority to assist state and local governments with food safety efforts through its State Cooperative Programs specifically for Grade A milk, molluscan shellfish, and retail and food-service establishments. As part of these programs, FDA provides technical support, guidance, and training to help its regulatory partners with reducing foodborne illnesses associated with these commodities. Also, in coordination with its regulatory partners and industry, FDA develops guidance, including guidance on date labels for certain products and in certain circumstances. Such guidance represents FDA\u2019s best advice for a uniform system of provisions that address the safety and protection of food offered at retail and in food service. As we reported in May 2016, the federal food safety oversight system is supplemented by states, localities, tribes, and territories, which may have their own laws and agencies to address the safety and quality of food. Generally, state, local and tribal governments may choose whether to regulate date labels on packaged foods. For example, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have some date labeling requirements for, most commonly, shellfish, dairy, and eggs, as figure 1 shows. Additionally, some states and the District of Columbia prohibit retailers from selling some packaged foods to consumers if the date on the label has passed. Furthermore, some municipalities choose to regulate date labels in addition to, or in the absence of, state regulations. For example, while Maryland prohibits the sale of grade \u201cA\u201d milk or milk products past the \u201cSell by\u201d date marked on its cap or container, the city of Baltimore Page 1 GAO-18-353 Food Waste SUMMARY Table 1: Examples of State", "The text discusses policies and guidelines for investigating and adjudicating employee misconduct in ATF and USMS.

However, most small employers purchase fully insured plans, and most large employers self-fund at least some of their employee health benefits. Small and large employers may offer coverage to their employees, and millions of adults purchase coverage directly from an issuer through the individual market. Under PPACA, fully insured and self-funded plans in the small and large group markets are subject to numerous regulations to encourage competition and reduce premiums, such as risk adjustment and reinsurance programs. PPACA contains provisions that affect market concentration among health insurers, such as the establishment of health insurance exchanges within each state that seek to encourage competition among issuers. For example, many states have had a significant number of issuers participating in their exchanges, and there has been an increased proportion of consolidated markets over time. PPACA\u2019s consumer tax credits are available to eligible households that purchase coverage only through health insurance exchanges, which may further incentivize issuers to participate in these new marketplaces. Source: OIG, Office of the Deputy Inspector General, Oversight and Evaluations - National Health Care Fraud and Abuse Strategy: Update to the Operation Carrot Scheme Report, November 2017, Pages 45-46 3 of the 15 issuers held more than 60 percent of the market, and the largest issuer held more than 90 percent of the market. For individual consumers, the number of issuers and premium options available within a state through the exchange were similar to the number available in the state overall. 6 of the 51 states did not have any issuer participation in the exchange in 2016. However, participation in an exchange did not necessarily mean a market was less concentrated in that state. While most large employers use self-funded plans, small employers may purchase fully insured group plans. Some small employers may find it difficult to obtain coverage elsewhere. Small employers may offer fully insured plans, which are purchased from an issuer. These plans may be fully insured plans, which are purchased from an issuer. Because most small employers purchase fully insured plans from an issuer, we found that many markets were concentrated. We found that the three largest issuers in a market\u2014defined as those with at least 5 percent or more market share cumulatively\u2014held 80 percent or more of the market in one-third of the 51 states and about half of the 16 of the markets (see fig. 3). However, in many markets in some states, the overall market is less concentrated. For example, in California, one of the states with exchanges, the three largest issuers held 90 percent of the 2016 overall market in California. However, the market in the exchanges was less concentrated, with the three largest issuers cumulatively holding 46 percent of the exchange market, and 15 issuers had a market share of 5 percent or more.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Commercial airports in the United States (i.e., those regulated by TSA) can be generally described as having security-restricted areas and unsecured areas. Security-restricted areas include the area from which screened passengers may board aircraft, as well as areas where access is generally limited to appropriately vetted and credentialed personnel, such as airport and air carrier employees who require access to aircraft or to load and sort baggage. Unsecured areas, or airport public areas, are the areas of the airport that may be accessed by the general public without restrictions (i.e., without passing through security or some other controlled access point), such as ticketing areas, restaurants and shops, baggage claim areas, and areas extending outward from the airport facility to include pathways leading to an airport\u2019s terminal and public parking areas. Airport public areas described by TSA officials, airport operators, airport law enforcement and aviation related associations we met with included airport access roads, curbside drop-off/pick-up areas, parking structures, rental car facilities, bus/transit lines leading to the airport, main entrances to and lobbies of terminal areas, and the security queue leading to security screening checkpoints. airport employees, requires a collaborative approach that leverages law enforcement\u2019s abilities to conduct investigations, respond to suspicious activity and report incidents to the appropriate authorities, while also ensuring those activities do not compromise the airport\u2019s primary mission of efficiently processing air travelers. (See Box 1 for information on airport access and incident reporting.) TSA. TSA is responsible for overseeing national transportation security, including aviation security, rail security, transcontinental highway security, and maritime security. TSA\u2019s aviation sector includes the security screening of passengers and baggage before they board commercial aircraft and the security screening of checked baggage to ensure aircraft security. TSA\u2019s other work also includes the transportation industry, where TSA assesses the security of all modes of transportation including motor freight, freight rail, passenger rail, and the marine transportation industry. TSA\u2019s work includes a number of initiatives related to airport public areas. In 2009 Congress added 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44907 (commonly referred to as the \u201cAviation Security Enhancement Act of 2009\u201d), which required TSA to establish a security credentialing screening program for access to certain airport sterile areas, certain aircraft, and cargo. TSA\u2019s credentialing program will require the identification, credentialing, and vetting of individuals with access to TSA-restricted areas, including all airport sterile areas and cargo screening facilities. TSA is working closely with DHS, in collaboration with other DHS components, to ensure that the program is effective and does not unnecessarily impede legitimate transportation activity. TSA is also developing enhanced credentialing standards that will provide a baseline for security access and credentials. 26 The 9/11 Commission.

Mitigation grants include HMGP (Hazard Mitigation Grant Program), BRIC (Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities) and a pilot program called PA (Pre-Disaster Mitigation Planning Assistance). HMGP provides federal funds to states, tribes, and territories to implement hazard mitigation measures at nonfederal properties damaged in a major disaster declared by the President. FEMA funds 75 percent of project costs; the state, tribal or territorial government must provide 25 percent. BRIC provides federal funds to states to build in resiliency through multiple methods. FEMA requires a state to invest at least 30 percent of the funds they receive from BRIC in a local project that can address more than one risk: for example, sea level rise, stronger hurricanes, and hurricanes combined with heavy rainfall. If this is not possible, a state may ask FEMA to decrease or waive the 30 percent local investment requirement if it meets certain conditions. PA provides funding to build on a state\u2019s progress in creating pre-disaster mitigation plans, which should enable states to be able to carry out more robust future hazard mitigation activities. FEMA\u2019s authority to provide grants and contracts to accomplish the work of response and recovery (both disaster preparedness and response work, as well as mitigation work) is rooted in three statutes: the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-288), the Stafford Act, and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 created an emergency relief fund available upon a presidential declaration of a major disaster. The Stafford Act, which is Title II of the Disaster Relief Act,. FEMA is the implementing agency within DHS. There was a dramatic rise in the number of large wildfires in the U.S. from the 1980s to the 2000s (see fig. 5), with a slight downward trend thereafter. In the 2010s as well there have been a number of large wildfires, and there were a significant number large fires in both 2016 and 2017, followed by large fires in California again in 2018 (see fig. 6). Congress has responded to these wildfire disasters with a series of responses that has created a significant amount of debate (see appendix II, which provides legislative chronicles for these responses). In addition, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (H.R. 1678; 114th Congress) was signed into law on November 16, 2015, which requires FEMA to prepare analyses of the costs and benefits of transferring some mitigation funds to fire prevention efforts.

These FFRDCs are managed by various military departments or divisions within the Department of Defense. The FFRDCs generally cannot provide services or development of projects that easily satisfied by government personnel or private contractors. The FFRDCs are mainly classified as study and analysis, research and development, and systems engineering and integration centers. The Director of Laboratories and Personnel within the Office of USD Research and Engineering took over responsibility for managing FFRDCs in July 2018. According to the director, he took up the responsibility following a reorganization of USD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The DoD and each FFRDC have a sponsoring agreement, which is an independent, bilateral written agreement between the primary sponsor and the parent organization. It is approved before the award of an FFRDC contract. The policy of FFRDC provides the terms under which DoD may award an FFRDC contract, and outlines the overarching requirements for operation of the FFRDC. FFRDC personnel are required by the policy to comply with the ethics rules applicable to government personnel. The department may use FFRDCs to perform work that is closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions, or that is critical to maintaining control of the department's missions and operations. FFRDCs may have access to data, which requires certain protections before entry. The DOD program enables these entities to collect and provide information about enrolled projects.", "The Constitution gives Congress the power to coin money, and under that authority, Congress has specified the coins that can be produced and the metal composition of circulating coins, including the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, and half-dollar. Congress has also passed legislation prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to redesign the $1 note. Within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), BEP produces notes and the Mint produces coins. To ensure that notes and coins are available in sufficient quantities to meet public demand, the Federal Reserve orders new notes from BEP and new coins from the Mint. The Federal Reserve pays BEP for the cost of producing the notes; the Mint pays for the cost of producing coins and the Federal Reserve pays the Mint for the face value of the coins. The Federal Reserve distributes the notes and coins to approximately 8,400 depository institutions\u2014banks, savings and loans, and credit unions\u2014in the United States through cash offices operated by its 12 regional Reserve Banks. The Reserve Banks also are responsible for ensuring the quality and integrity of notes in circulation by assessing the condition of each note and destroying any that are unfit. When a depository institution deposits currency with a Reserve Bank, each currency note is verified on high-speed processing equipment using electronic authentication and fitness sensors. During the \u201cpiece- verification\u201d process, the deposited currency is counted, suspect counterfeit notes are identified and segregated, and unfit notes are destroyed. The fit currency is packaged and used to fill future orders for currency from depository institutions. The destroyed notes are replaced with new notes from BEP as there is public demand for cash. The federal government spent about $1.3 billion to produce, process, and circulate notes and coins in 2017. These costs are offset by the financial benefit the government realizes when it issues notes or coins because currency usually costs less to produce than its face value. This benefit, which is known as seigniorage, is the difference between the face value of currency and its cost of production; this difference provides a financial benefit to the government when the government issues currency. In calendar year 2017, the Federal Reserve reported transferring about $81 billion to the Treasury, and the Mint reported transferring about $269 million in fiscal year 2017. The seigniorage the Federal Reserve and the Mint pay into the Treasury reduces the need for the government to borrow money, and as a result, the government pays less interest over time. Other countries have taken steps to reduce currency costs by replacing notes with coins of the same value and eliminating the smallest value coin. For example, Canada introduced a $1 coin in 1987 and a $2 coin in 1996 that replaced corresponding-valued notes, and the United Kingdom replaced its \u00a31 note with a \u00a31 coin in 1983. These countries expected a cost reduction because, while coins are generally more expensive to produce than notes, the coins can last substantially longer in circulation. For example, in both countries, the $1 and \u00a31 notes, respectively, lasted 18 months or less while coins, according to experts, can be expected to last more than 30 years. As a result, these countries\u2019 governments expected to save money because over 30 years, the number of coins they would produce was far less than the number of notes they otherwise would have made. These countries may have realized further financial benefits by replacing notes with coins because the public may hold more cash if a note is replaced with a coin and, as a result, the government would achieve a greater benefit from seigniorage. As we reported in 2011, because of differences in how people use coins and notes, the public may hold more than one coin for each note being replaced. Since people often store coins at home and store notes in their wallets, coins, as a result, circulate less frequently than notes and therefore more coins are needed to meet public demand. Thus, for a given denomination of currency, a larger number of coins would need to be maintained in circulation to meet the public\u2019s demand for cash than would be needed if that denomination were provided in notes. For example, we previously reported that when Canada replaced its $1 note and the United Kingdom replaced its \u00a31 note with a coin, both countries anticipated they would need to produce 8 coins to replace 5 notes, or a 1.6-to-1 replacement ratio. In previous work, we reported a positive annual net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin. In 2011, we reported a 30-year net benefit of $5.5 billion. Based on these results and the experiences of other countries, we have previously recommended that Congress consider and pass proposals to replace the $1 note with a $1 coin and, to ensure success of the coin, also provide for the elimination of the $1 bill. 5 years after the Secretary determines the necessary infrastructure and logistics are in place", "What is the purpose of the IC CAE program?

END SUMMARY\ntheir PTC systems were in various stages of interoperability testing with other railroads. (One Class I railroad reporting in the interoperability testing stage is also a Class II commuter railroad.) FRA officials stated that a railroad must achieve certain requirements prior to conducting interoperability testing. Specifically, interoperability requires a railroad\u2019s PTC system to be in full implementation on certain mileage, as specified in railroad-specific safety plans. By January 31, 2019, five railroads reported to FRA that they had reached this point: BNSF, Norfolk Southern, and Amtrak, all of which completed interoperability testing with other railroads. Three railroads have not yet completed interoperability testing with other railroads: Amtrak Northeast Corridor (NEC), the Maryland Transit Authority, and Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority-Keystone Corridor. Two railroads have completed interoperability testing with other railroads, but have not yet reached the point of conducting interoperability testing. These two railroads are the South Shore Line (IN), and the Virginia Railway Express (VRE). Of the 42 railroads subject to implementing PTC, several have significant challenges associated with interoperability. Specifically, several are currently in various stages of interoperability testing with other railroads and a number of host railroads\u2014including NEC (Amtrak), CSX, and Amtrak Keystone Corridor\u2014have significant segments that require operational testing or are not yet installed. Moreover, some railroads\u2014such as NEC (Amtrak), CSX and the Long Island Rail Road\u2014have not yet reached full implementation on their own PTC systems, or have only completed interoperability testing in limited segments. We note that these railroads\u2019 progress in implementing their own PTC system is being affected by track and infrastructure upgrades and delays in obtaining certain types of equipment (e.g., wayside hardware). Specifically, according to FRA and industry officials, three railroads\u2014 the NEC (Amtrak), CSX, and Amtrak Keystone Corridor\u2014have segments that are still operational testing, which requires testing each PTC component independently (i.e., in a laboratory) and then subsequently testing it in live field operations, before finally implementing it in revenue service. In other segments, the PTC components are being installed to conduct full implementation prior to interoperability testing. According to Amtrak officials, CSX\u2019s portion of Amtrak NEC has a high percentage of these segments. By the end of 2018, 17 miles of Amtrak NEC were in revenue service, 14 miles in RSD, 26 miles of track were in testing or in preparation for testing, and 6 miles were still awaiting installation of PTC components. Of the 6 miles awaiting installation, Amtrak officials stated that 1 mile would require testing of track or signal components before PTC installation. FRA reports that the three railroads have segments for which they have identified solutions or approaches that when implemented, will allow interoperability testing to begin or be completed. For example, officials from Amtrak and Amtrak Northeast Regional stated that in addition to waiting for certain components, they are also awaiting the completion of some track infrastructure projects by host railroads. Figure 3 shows the number of miles subject to completion of these steps for interoperability testing. Further, FRA officials stated that some railroads are awaiting decisions from the host railroads in which they operate as to when they will complete certain infrastructure project installations. Amtrak officials stated that they are working on a process to document this information and provide it on FRA\u2019s website. In addition, FRA officials stated that some safety equipment for PTC systems is not available or limited in availability, which has affected certain railroads. For example, FRA stated that NEC (Amtrak) is seeking to obtain a specific type of switch machine that provides functionality necessary to support PTC testing and certification. In addition, because of certain design characteristics, some locomotives may require modifications for PTC before interoperability testing can begin. Overall, railroads need to complete certain elements of their PTC implementations before or during host railroad track segment upgrades. Specifically, Amtrak and four host railroads\u2014CSX Corp., Norfolk Southern Co., Canadian National Co., and Kansas City Southern Co.\u2014told us that there is a challenge associated with completing PTC and infrastructure upgrades to certain tracks and that these are limiting certain railroads\u2019 progress towards implementing PTC. FRA officials stated that when certain railroads and host railroads encounter such a challenge, they may experience delays in implementing certain tracks or parts of their PTC systems, including parts of their PTC systems needed for interoperability testing. For example, as of 2018, 15 miles of Virginia Railway (VRE) (VRE is partially on the NEC (Amtrak) and partially independently owned by the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation", "\u2022 The Air Force won a competition in Feb. 2011 to develop the new generation aerial refueling tanker aircraft, the KC-46. The competition\u2019s winner was a military derivative of the Boeing 767 commercial airplane. \u2022 Air Force policy and the award\u2019s contract require the contractor to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification as much as possible, and to seek military certification only when necessary. \u2022 The Federal Aviation Administration approved the airworthiness of the 767-2C commercial airplane type in 2017, and the KC-46\u2019s design in Sept. 2018, resulting in a supplemental type certificate. \u2022 The Air Force granted a limited duration airworthiness certification in Nov. 2018 to support initial fielding and is continuing to test to obtain the military type certification. \u2022 Air Force personnel are in the process of receiving initial training on the KC-46 in Renton, Wash., and Altus Air Force Base, Okla. end of 2018.

They said that at some point, the commander of Air Mobility Command could decide to declare the KC-46\u2019s military configuration combat capable, but that this is not yet the case. Air Force personnel are beginning to train on the KC-46 at training sites in Renton, Wash., and Altus Air Force Base, Okla.", "Since 2009, when we last reviewed federal efforts to promote broadband deployment, Congress and federal agencies have provided subsidies and support to fund the deployment of broadband in rural and other underserved areas. For example, FCC has established the Connect America Fund; RUS and NTIA have disbursed and plan to disburse over $21 billion to support broadband programs. The programs have increased broadband availability to consumers and businesses. More funds have targeted unserved areas with a greater need that private industry was less likely to address on its own. As a result, tens of millions more Americans have access to broadband. Although progress is substantial, as we have stressed in an earlier report, it is unclear whether the federal government has addressed the challenges associated with bringing broadband to unserved rural areas. It is difficult to determine whether spending by FCC and federal programs has been effective and led to increased broadband availability because of inadequate FCC data on broadband deployment and the government\u2019s limited ability to track the return on investment and outcomes of broadband projects. To address these challenges, we provided recommendations in 2019 to FCC, USDA, and RUS\u2014agencies responsible for broadband deployment programs\u2014to ensure that their data are accurate and to monitor progress and results.", "An expert at summarization, proceed to summarize the following text: TEXT: To adjudicate a self-petition filed by a foreign national claiming to have suffered domestic abuse, USCIS adjudicators determine whether the self- petitioner has established the statutory eligibility requirements. A foreign national satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements by demonstrating that he or she (1) has a qualifying relationship with a U.S. citizen or LPR, such as a marriage; (2) was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by his or her U.S. relative during the qualifying relationship; (3) is residing or has resided with the abusive U.S. citizen or LPR during the qualifying relationship; and (4) is of good moral character. A foreign national filing a VAWA self-petition as an abused spouse is also required to demonstrate that he or she entered into or intended to enter into the marriage in good faith and not in order to evade U.S. immigration law. For a good moral character determination, the petitioner typically should submit a local or state police clearance letter or a state-issued criminal background check from each place where he or she has lived for 6 months or more in the past 3 years immediately prior to filing the VAWA petition. The burden of proof is on the self- petitioner to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she has satisfied the statutory eligibility requirements. Considered evidence may include, for example, a criminal background check to establish the good moral character of a self- petitioner or testimony in the form of an affidavit to establish abuse on the part of the U.S. citizen or LPR relative. If the self- petition is approved, the point at which the petitioner will be able to apply for and obtain LPR status will depend on whether he or she is an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen (i.e., U.S. citizen\u2019s unmarried child under age 21, spouse, or, where the citizen is at least 21, their parent), or other relative of a U.S. citizen or LPR, who, unlike immediate relatives, are subject to annual immigration limits. Under U.S. immigration law, there are confidentiality protections for VAWA self- petitioners. Any information about the self- petitioner is considered confidential and, with certain exceptions, officials from DHS are prohibited from releasing any information about the petitioner, including that the petitioner has sought immigration relief. In addition, adjudicators are prohibited from using information provided solely by the alleged abuser to make an adverse determination of admissibility or deportability against self- petitioners, unless such adverse information has been corroborated through independent sourcing consistent with departmental policy. Finally, according to DHS policy, DHS officials typically do not take enforcement actions, such as executing an order of removal, against abuse victims when they are present at certain locations, such as domestic violence shelters, victims\u2019 services programs, and community-based organizations. The summary concludes: The self-petition adjudication process ends with the alien being notified of the decision regarding the application.\nTo adjudicate a self-petition filed by a foreign national claiming to have suffered domestic abuse, USCIS adjudicators determine whether the self-petitioner has established the statutory eligibility requirements. A foreign national satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements by demonstrating that he or she was abused or subjected to extreme cruelty by a U.S. citizen or LPR; is in a qualifying relationship with the abusive U.S. relative; and has filed the self-petition during the specified timeframe after having entered into or remaining in the relationship. In summary, an expert at summarization proceeded to summarize the given text above which consists of the process followed by USCIS to adjudicate self-petition filed by a foreign national claiming to have suffered domestic abuse.", "USDA administers its nutrition education programs through multiple agencies in two mission areas\u2014Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services and Research, Education, and Economics (see fig. 1). Within the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services mission area, FNS oversees nutrition assistance programs with nutrition education components, such as SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition programs. For SNAP-Ed and WIC, the FNS national office develops program policies and guidance and works with the FNS regional offices to provide technical assistance to state agencies. The FNS regional offices also review SNAP-Ed and WIC state plans. The Team Nutrition initiative is administered by FNS national officials who also work on child nutrition programs. FNS staff develop Team Nutrition materials, training resources, and guidance and provide assistance to state agencies and local entities overseeing the child nutrition programs. Within the Research, Education, and Economics mission area, NIFA national officials oversee EFNEP, in part by providing program guidance, reviewing grant recipient plans, and conducting some monitoring and oversight of local implementing entities. The NIFA national office, together with the FNS national office, administers the FINI program. Although NIFA has primary responsibility over the grant award process, FNS has been overseeing an independent evaluation of program efforts. Interventions for USDA\u2019s nutrition education programs are provided through varied local entities and settings. For example, land-grant universities may provide SNAP-Ed and EFNEP interventions, while local health clinics may provide WIC interventions. USDA\u2019s programs also provide nutrition education in varied settings, ranging from grocery stores to hospitals (see fig. 2). Sometimes multiple nutrition education programs operate in the same setting. For example, SNAP-Ed may provide classes for students while Team Nutrition may distribute teacher training materials and nutrition education curricula to the same school. Most of USDA\u2019s nutrition education programs target interventions to low-income populations with varied characteristics, as shown in table 1, and the programs also differ in how nutrition education fits into their structures. For example, SNAP-Ed and EFNEP are primarily focused on providing nutrition education to participants, while Team Nutrition provides nutrition education to both child nutrition program implementers and participants. WIC provides benefits for food and referrals to health and other social services, as well as nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and support, to participants. FINI provides benefits for purchasing healthy foods and may include additional nutrition education programming. Programs also provide nutrition education through various intervention methods, ranging from direct education, such as cooking demonstrations, classes on healthy eating, and one-on-one counseling, to social media campaigns and efforts to change policies, systems, or environments. SNAP-Ed provides direct education through a variety of nutrition educators, although its interventions also may involve social marketing and policy, systems, and environmental changes (PSE). PSE is intended to shape policies, practices, and physical environments to support and improve nutrition education, physical activity habits, and obesity prevention efforts. In fiscal year 2018, approximately 76 percent of SNAP-Ed interventions included direct education, whereas 54 percent included PSE, according to USDA data. EFNEP primarily provides direct education through paraprofessionals, also known as peer educators. Paraprofessionals typically live locally in the community, which allows them to recruit and receive referrals for new participants. University and locally-based professional staff train and supervise the paraprofessionals. In addition, EFNEP has incorporated PSE interventions in recent years. For example, USDA provides PSE training for EFNEP program implementers, as one step toward adopting the PSE approach. WIC programs also provide direct education, such as counseling and group discussions, and, according to federal regulations, are allowed to use other intervention methods as long as they are easily understood by participants and bear a practical relationship to participant nutritional needs, household situations, and cultural preferences. For example, WIC programs may conduct demonstrations or grocery store tours to help consumers understand how to read nutrition labels or shop on a budget. Team Nutrition creates and disseminates web-based and hard-copy educational materials to child nutrition program implementers in part to educate child nutrition program participants. For example, Team Nutrition provides curricula, posters, tools, guides, recipes, and cookbooks for schools and child care sites. Team Nutrition also provides annual grants to enhance nutrition education intervention efforts in schools and child care settings, as well as training for program implementers through its partnership with the Institute of Child Nutrition. FINI supports healthy eating choices by incentivizing the purchase and consumption of fruits and vegetables. For example, some FINI programs provide vouchers redeemable for qualifying fruits and vegetables. Further, according to USDA officials, a FINI program may partner with another USDA nutrition education program, such as SNAP-Ed or EFNEP, to provide nutrition education. USDA agencies also provide nutrition education through other research and guidance directed at the general public: USDA\u2019s Center for Nutrition Policy and 2 | GAO-19-37 | SNAP-Ed and EFNEP", "USPS is required to provide postal services \u201cto bind the nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and postal services to all communities.\u201d To help fulfill this mission, USPS has developed a network of facilities that provides access to retail services and supports postal collection, processing, transportation, and \u201clast mile\u201d delivery of mail\u2014functions that are generally co-located. The retail portion of these facilities includes public areas where USPS provides customers with retail services. The public areas can include full service counters where employees assist customers, self-service areas, and post office boxes. The non-public portions include features such as workrooms, where mail processing occurs, and employee support areas, such as lunch tables and lockers. Although USPS data show that customer visits and transactions have declined over the past 5 years, the size of USPS\u2019s retail network has remained largely unchanged during that period (see fig. 1). We have previously reported that USPS has made some efforts to reduce the number of its retail facilities to align with the significant decline in mail volume and address rising costs. Several factors, however, have limited USPS\u2019s ability to make further reductions. For example, in 2011 USPS moved to evaluate the potential closure of almost 3,700 retail facilities but abandoned their effort due to stakeholder concerns. Instead, USPS explored options to adjust its retail service without closing offices. Legal restrictions also limit USPS\u2019s ability to close retail facilities. For example, USPS cannot close a small post office solely for operating at a deficit. If USPS wishes to close a retail facility, among other steps, it must take into consideration not only the economic savings but also the effects on the communities served, its employees, and the services provided, and it must provide customers with at least 60 days\u2019 notice before the proposed closure date. Federal statute defines the types of services that USPS may and may not provide. As previously noted, PAEA placed limitations on the nonpostal products and services USPS could provide. In particular, it allowed USPS to continue to provide nonpostal products and services that were both offered as of January 1, 2006, and were permitted by PRC to continue. While PAEA generally prohibits USPS from initiating new nonpostal services, USPS uses a separate statutory authority to provide such services to federal executive agencies. If a nonpostal service is to be provided to a federal executive agency, generally, USPS and the parties must specify the terms and conditions of their collaboration, including the activities to be performed by USPS and the terms of reimbursement, if applicable. USPS is currently not authorized to provide nonpostal services to state or local entities. USPS may also lease excess space at retail facilities\u2014including parking, office space, and roof areas\u2014to other entities at both the facilities that USPS owns and those it leases from other entities. USPS officials said some leases give them the right to sublease space at leased facilities, but the officials did not know how many facilities where USPS had such rights. USPS collaborates with the GSA, which is the nation\u2019s largest public real-estate organization, to lease space to other federal government entities. USPS works with a real estate firm to lease space to private or other entities, such as to state and local government entities. According to USPS\u2019s analysis, retail facilities accounted for a relatively small portion\u2014about $5.17 billion, or 7.1 percent\u2014of USPS\u2019s modified operating costs in fiscal year 2018. (See fig. 2.) Personnel costs accounted for the majority of retail facility operating costs ($4.87 billion), including nearly $4.4 billion in employee compensation. Non-personnel costs amounted to about $0.30 billion, which included rent ($0.09 billion), utilities ($0.06 billion), and depreciation and amortization ($0.15 billion). In terms of revenue, according to USPS\u2019s analysis, retail facilities accounted for a relatively small portion\u2014about 15 percent ($10.5 billion)\u2014of USPS\u2019s total revenue ($70.6 billion) in fiscal year 2018. As shown in figure 3, postage meters and validation and walk-in stamp sales generated most of that revenue. In fiscal year 2018, the majority of retail facilities were profitable (see fig. 4), with some considerations. USPS\u2019s analysis showed that the total retail revenue generated at retail facilities was more than double retail facility costs in fiscal year 2018. However, over a third of retail facilities did not generate enough revenue to cover USPS\u2019s retail costs. In particular, over half of the rural facilities were unprofitable, while the overwhelming majority of suburban and urban facilities were profitable. Overall, we found that of the unprofitable facilities, 89 percent were located in rural Summary: USPS operates a network of retail locations to support postal collection, processing, transportation, and", "TEXT: (2) review agency-specific software programs that are in scope of the memorandum, but have not self-identified to the Defense Digital Service; (3) implement a new process for submitting new candidate software programs via a new website developed by DDS at Code.mil; and (4) encourage the OSS community to submit contributions to open source software programs by visiting Code.mil. DOD began implementation of its OSS pilot program in March 2017, and as of May 2018, the department had released a variety of codebases, including software programs on GitHub, a popular OSS online code sharing platform; Apache 2.0 and MIT license releases; and code releases on other repositories. Additionally, the CIO issued Department of Defense Information Technology Environment (DoDI 5000.02), an order detailing new policies and procedures for managing the defense information technology and information systems environment, including the new OSS pilot program requirements. In an effort to address the lack of OSS software developers, DOD also created the new Digital Service Fellows Program. The program allows college graduates, regardless of their academic training and experience, the opportunity to spend a two year rotational assignment at DDS. Fellows were afforded an opportunity to gain first-hand experience in agile development methodology, open source best practices, and DOD mission services. Fellows were able to work directly with DDS and agency-specific teams to learn how to build, test, and deploy open-source software applications to meet mission needs. Through its OSS pilot program efforts, DOD continues to work with OMB to monitor the progress of the pilot program; provide data on the inventories of the open source software programs; and report metrics demonstrating the successful reuse of these programs across the department. DOD has also taken steps to further refine its new license, which will apply to all of its products that are open sourced; establish standards for maintaining OSS packages; and establish common practices for creating and maintaining the source code inventories.", "TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for implementing and overseeing the security of the nation's civil aviation system. The agency is responsible for ensuring that all passengers and belongings transported by passenger aircraft are adequately screened. Over 43,000 TSOs stationed across the nation's approximately 440 commercial airports are responsible for inspecting individuals and belongings to deter and prevent passengers from bringing prohibited items on board an aircraft or into the airport sterile area. TSOs receive basic training to perform these functions. The OPM developed a regulation that requires agencies to evaluate training programs annually to determine how well they contribute to mission accomplishment and meet organizational goals. The Kirkpatrick model is commonly used to evaluate training, and T&D officials update training in response to findings from covert tests and reporting on emerging threats. required training modifications. T&D officials attribute the 56 training modifications to findings from covert tests and recommendations from the Threat Mitigation Training. According to T&D data, T&D officials are responsible for reviewing and updating policies on a number of training modifications, including the introduction of new procedures from covert tests or emerging threats, changes in policy on the use of technology and threat recognition items, and improvements in the screening of checked baggage. T&D reviews data on covert tests that TSA conducts at commercial airports on a quarterly basis. These covert tests involve screeners who search bags, and, during the tests, screeners hide different types of threat items and see how many are missed. A screener who misses a threat item is provided corrective training. Data obtained from covert tests at Philadelphia International Airport for the period January 2014 through June 2018 provided a basis for T&D\u2019s evaluation of training. According to T&D official information, the Philadelphia airport is the site of most covert tests conducted. While TSOs may miss all types of threat items during covert tests, TSA found that TSOs missed more explosive and simulated prohibited items than they did drugs and weapons. The officials also said that at the Philadelphia airport, TSO training and recurrent training requirements have caused TSOs to miss fewer threat items in subsequent tests\u2014a trend commonly observed in agency data for all airports\u2014that, in turn, should contribute to improvements in aviation security. The officials reported that through the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the rate of failure at the Philadelphia airport in detecting all types of threat items in covert tests had steadily declined since 2015. According to T&D officials, these results indicate that some corrective training, including training aimed at improving threat item detection and training focusing on the most commonly missed threat items, has had an effect in improving TSO performance at Philadelphia, but additional training and retraining that is planned should further improve performance.", "Federal agencies have varying roles in planning, approving, and implementing infrastructure projects, depending on their missions and authorities. Some federal agencies help fund or construct infrastructure projects, and others grant permits or licenses for activities on private or federal lands. Agencies that manage federal lands, such as the Bureau of Land Management, may construct infrastructure on lands they manage and must also approve projects on those lands. The circumstances under which federal agencies may need to consult with tribes will vary based on the agencies\u2019 responsibilities for infrastructure projects as well as infrastructure projects\u2019 potential effects on tribes\u2019 land, treaty rights, or other resources or interests. Federal agencies are generally responsible for identifying relevant tribes, notifying the tribes about the opportunity to consult, and initiating consultation as needed.", "DOD maintains prepositioning of equipment and supplies at land sites in several countries and aboard ships. DOD has an implementation plan for managing prepositioned stock but some elements are not addressed. GAO-18-345 Military Operations prepositioned stock programs for review by Joint Staff personnel and ensure that plans include specific guidance on the execution and support of each prepositioned stock program. But the plan does not identify how this action will address any identified gaps. The plan similarly states that DOD will create a governance structure to oversee the prepositioned stock programs but does not provide information on the structure\u2019s composition or the specific tasks it will undertake. The implementation plan states that DOD will assess its prepositioned stock programs but does not provide guidance on how it will conduct assessments nor does it provide any performance metrics for measuring the effectiveness of efforts to achieve the department\u2019s prepositioned stock goals. The same limitations obtain with respect to the annual report to Congress. For example, the report describes some of the actions the Secretary of the Navy has taken to improve management of prepositioning of Navy materiel, but provides no guidance on how this action will be evaluated nor does it provide any performance metrics to report the results. As the annual report does not communicate information DOD needs to conduct effective oversight of its prepositioning efforts, the report does not adequately convey the status of prepositioning progress. As DOD and its stakeholders seek to understand how DOD is managing its prepositioned stock program and what steps are being taken to improve prepositioning management, an effective communication method like the annual report is necessary. Without an adequate annual report, DOD decision makers do not have sufficient information on prepositioning programs to exercise effective oversight of those efforts. Elements four through seven (details about policies and procedures that will guide planning and management of DOD\u2019s prepositioned stock program, not addressed in the implementation plan). DOD\u2019s implementation plan does not identify any policies, procedures, or governance practices specifically tailored to managing prepositioned stock. It is unclear whether the department has the policies and guidance needed to ensure effective management of its prepositioned stock program. If policies and guidance are inadequate, decision makers at all levels\u2014from senior leaders to service officials\u2014may be unaware of the appropriate processes and procedures they must follow to ensure effective management of prepositioned stocks. For example, the implementation plan does not provide guidance on who will establish and implement policies and procedures or how DOD will coordinate, communicate, and integrate prepositioned stock management with other DOD activities, including strategic planning, force requirements analysis, and logistics. Further, when we compared the implementation plan to DOD\u2019s annual report on prepositioned stocks, we found a mismatch between the information the implementation plan provided on prepositioned stock programs and the programs listed in DOD\u2019s prepositioned stock programs table in the Implementation Guidance. For example, the table lists several Army prepositioned stock programs that the Army does not identify in its annual report to Congress. Similarly, we confirmed the existence of several Air Force prepositioned stock programs identified in the implementation plan but not listed in the Air Force\u2019s annual report. Absent a comprehensive list of prepositioned stock programs that includes all DOD prepositioned stock programs, the department lacks a centralized source of information on its prepositioning stocks that it can use, among other things, to update its guidance materials and briefings. Without standardized guidance and reporting on all of its prepositioned stock programs, decision makers may be less effective at managing the department\u2019s prepositioning strategies.

Process measures assess the extent to which providers effectively implement clinical practices that have been shown to result in high-quality or efficient care (e.g., the percentage of patients with a myocardial infarction who receive an aspirin prescription on discharge), while outcome measures track the results of health care (e.g., mortality, infections, and patients' experiences of that care). To calculate providers' performance on quality measures, CMS and private payers ask providers to report a variety of clinical data. Historically, providers have collected data for quality measures through manual review of paper medical records, but more recently a limited number of electronic quality measures have been developed that allow providers to report data electronically using electronic health records. A variety of different entities may develop new health care quality measures, such as the Joint Commission, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, and various medical specialty societies. In some cases, CMS contracts with entities for the development of measures for use in its Medicare quality programs and NQF has endorsed over 700 quality measures.

On September 6, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck St. Thomas and St. John and on September 19, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck St. Croix (see fig. 1). The storms severely damaged the territory\u2019s critical infrastructure, devastating more than 90 percent of aboveground power lines and shutting down electricity and telecommunications for months. Further, 52 percent of the territory\u2019s housing units were damaged, ports and airports were closed for weeks, and hundreds of thousands of tons of debris were generated, often blocking roads and making transportation hazardous. In addition, according to a September 2018 report from the USVI Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Task Force, the territory\u2019s economic activity\u2014 especially tourism\u2014was severely reduced in the months following the storms, leading to job losses and a total estimated economic impact of $1.54 billion. In response to the request of the Governor of the USVI, the President declared a major disaster the day after each hurricane struck the territory. Major disaster declarations can trigger a variety of federal response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental entities and households and individuals, including assistance through the Public Assistance program. Under the National Response Framework and National Disaster Recovery Framework, DHS is the federal department with primary responsibility for coordinating disaster response and recovery, and within DHS, FEMA has lead responsibility. The Administrator of FEMA serves as the principal adviser to the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding emergency management. FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program provides funding to state, territorial, local, and tribal governments as well as certain types of private nonprofit organizations to assist with responding to and recovering from major disasters or emergencies. As shown in figure 2, Public Assistance program funds are categorized broadly as \u201cemergency work\u201d or \u201cpermanent work.\u201d Within these broad categories are separate subcategories. In addition to the emergency work and permanent work categories, the program includes category Z, which represents indirect costs, administrative expenses, and other expenses a recipient or subrecipient incurs in administering and managing the Public Assistance program that are not directly chargeable to a specific project. FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program also provides funding for cost- effective hazard mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to people and property from future natural and man-made disasters and their effects. Specifically, FEMA provides funding for hazard mitigation measures in conjunction with the repair of disaster-damaged facilities to enhance their resilience during future disasters. For example, a community that had a fire station damaged by a disaster could use Public Assistance funding to repair the facility and incorporate additional measures such as installing hurricane shutters over the windows to mitigate the potential for future damage. Once the President has declared a disaster, FEMA, the state or territorial government (the recipient), and local or territorial entities (the subrecipient) work together to develop damage assessments and formulate project worksheets for eligible projects. Project worksheets detail the scope of work and estimated cost for repairing or replacing disaster-damaged infrastructure as well as any hazard mitigation measures that may help to increase the resilience of this infrastructure during future disasters. After a project has completed FEMA\u2019s review process and is approved, FEMA obligates funding for the project by placing money into an account where the recipient has the authority to draw down\u2014or withdraw\u2014funding to pay the subrecipient for eligible work upon completion (see fig. 3). In addition, a state or territorial governor may designate a governor\u2019s authorized representative (GAR) to oversee all aspects of disaster assistance, including Public Assistance funding. Specifically, the GAR is responsible for ensuring compliance with program requirements by providing oversight into how goods and services are procured for projects, such as construction materials or modular school units. The GAR also confirms that subrecipients submit complete documentation demonstrating that all work completed is in accordance with a project\u2019s approved scope of work and Public Assistance program requirements. The GAR then approves the paperwork and the recipient can draw down funding from the account holding the obligations to reimburse subrecipients for completed work. When a project has been completed, FEMA conducts a close-out process to certify that all work has been completed and reconciles the actual cost incurred. If the actual cost of the completed work is greater than the amount of money FEMA obligated for the project, FEMA will reimburse the subrecipient for these additional costs. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 authorized the use of alternative procedures in administering the Public Assistance program, thereby providing new flexibilities to FEMA, states, territories, and local governments for debris removal, infrastructure repair, and rebuilding projects using funds from this program. Unlike in the standard Public Assistance program where FEMA will fund the actual cost of a project, the Public Assistance alternative procedures allow awards for permanent work projects to be made on the basis of fixed-cost SUMMARY", "CRAs serve a crucial role in our society.

VAMCs that can grant provisional approvals before the administrative and clinical review processes are complete may do so if they decide the veteran\u2019s caregiver meets the provisional approval requirements outlined in VHA policy. The application process requires VAMCs to collect veteran and caregiver information, request and verify veteran service connections and service dates, and obtain veteran health information. The CSC must verify a veteran\u2019s medical eligibility by accessing the veteran\u2019s electronic health record system, which includes reviewing the veteran\u2019s diagnoses, medications, and treatments. VAMCs must also conduct home visits\u2014either in person or virtually\u2014to determine if the veteran and the caregiver meet program eligibility criteria, including having a clinical condition and a health partnership that has lasted at least 90 days, and to verify veteran residence and caregiver residence. All applications are processed by the VAMCs\u2019 administrative staffs, either at CSCs who administer the Family Caregiver Program or through administrative staff working with the CSCs. VAMCs typically have up to 45 days to complete the application process, although this process may be extended up to 90 days if the veteran is hospitalized or training has not been completed. There are several reasons why the application process is complex and may require an extended review period, including the following: \u2022 Many VAMCs have multiple sites spread across a broad geographic area, which may affect the accuracy of veteran and caregiver eligibility data; \u2022 Lack of documentation, such as discharge summary notes, which may require significant time and effort to locate; \u2022 Inconsistencies in veteran and caregiver responses to application questions and during visits, which may require additional interviews or inquiries to verify information; \u2022 Language barriers that may exist between veterans and caregivers or between VAMC staff and veterans or caregivers; \u2022 Veteran or caregiver disabilities or life circumstances that may complicate program compliance; and \u2022 Limited administrative and clinical staff resources devoted to the program.

Caregiver Support Program Office. The Caregiver Support Program Office administers the Caregiver Support Program, which has two main components\u2014 1. the Family Caregiver Program, which is available to eligi-ble post-9/11 veterans, and their qualified caregivers, and 2. the Program of General Caregiver Support Services, which is avail-able to covered veterans from any service era and their qual-ified caregivers. The Caregiver Support Program Office develops policy and procedures and provides guidance, oversight, and support for both components of the Caregiver Support Program. As of April 2019, this office had 11 full-time staff, with authorization to hire eight additional staff. VISNs. Each of VHA\u2019s 18 VISNs has a lead official for the Family Caregiver Program\u2014either a VAMC CSC who serves in the VISN lead role for at least 25 percent of the CSC\u2019s time or a VISN employee who is responsible for the Family Caregiver Program as one of their VISN duties. The VISN lead official\u2019s role is to provide guidance to CSCs within the VISN and to help address their questions or concerns. VISN lead officials are also responsible for disseminating information, collecting data when needed, conducting quality assurance audits, assisting and coordinating responses to inquiries from the Caregiver Support Program Office, and monitoring the Family Caregiver Program workload across the VISN. VAMCs. The program is administered at the local level at 140 VAMCs. Each VAMC has staff that are assigned to the program on either a full- time or part-time basis, as well as other VAMC staff that may assist with specific Family Caregiver Program-related activities as a collateral duty. VAMC staff assigned to the Family Caregiver Program may include the following: CSCs. CSCs are the primary program staff administering the program at VAMCs. They are generally licensed clinical social workers or registered nurses. CSCs have clinical responsibilities that may include identifying and coordinating", "To summarize the text, it is about the mission and structure of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The text describes the various departments and programs of the agency and their responsibilities. The agency strives to promote peaceful uses of atomic energy and verify that nuclear technologies and materials are used for peaceful purposes and do not get diverted to nuclear weapons, which falls under its broader mission. However, it has identified several statutory authorities that have implications for its nuclear security role, specifically the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540. The text also discusses the agency's budgeting process and the difficulties faced in securing funding for its programs.", "MDA\u2019s mission is to combine these elements into an integrated system-of-systems, known as the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The goal of the BMDS is to combine the abilities of two or more elements to achieve objectives that would not have been possible for any individual element. These emergent abilities are known as integrated capabilities or BMDS-level capabilities. MDA\u2019s flexibilities allow it to expedite the fielding of assets and integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities and defer the application of certain acquisition policies and laws designed to facilitate oversight and accountability until a mature capability is ready to be handed over to a military service for production and operation. MDA has the capability to organize, conduct, and evaluate flight tests, one of the most important factors in adhering to its schedule and declaring an asset or capability ready for delivery. MDA must follow the same contracting regulations that apply to DOD, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Undefinitized contract actions are generally used when negotiation of a definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the government\u2019s requirements and the government\u2019s interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment. ) 360 days after issuance. In April 2013, we recommended that MDA stabilize its acquisition baselines so that meaningful comparisons can be made over time to support oversight. MDA stated that the information presented in the BMDS Accountability Report is sufficient; however, we continue to find that the lack of stable baselines makes comparison difficult and in some instances, impossible. Since that time, MDA has reported its newly established baselines to Congress for the first time in its June 2010 BMDS Accountability Report. 3 In its defense, MDA officials tell us that it uses undefinitized contract actions sparingly and that it tries to definitize contracts as soon as possible. However, they also added that there will always be instances when negotiations with the contractor will necessitate undefinitized work to begin immediately. When definitization schedules are in place, the contractor must propose and submit to contracting officials a finalized contract for final signature and execution. In our last report, we noted that MDA had improved its management of undefinitized contract actions in part because the actions were less costly than was the case in the past. However, we continue to be concerned about use of undefinitized contract actions because DOD lacks a process that systematically reviews such actions. For example, we reported in a previous report that because Defense contracting officials did not systematically review or prioritize their own undefinitized contract actions, officials did not always know when contract definitization schedules had been developed for their undefinitized contracts. Furthermore, because undefinitized contract actions were not categorized, officials did not know which officials were more likely to agree to use them. GAO recommended in 2010 that DOD develop a process to review all undefinitized contract actions and prioritize them based on the importance of the requirements they support. We also recommended that DOD categorize undefinitized contract actions based on the urgency of their requirements. However, DOD has not implemented either of these recommendations and has been content with its current approach of monitoring the use of these actions by individual contracting officials. In a report in 2012, we recommended again that DOD establish a process to oversee undefinitized contract actions and that it work to establish a policy that categorizes these actions. This report is on MDA\u2019s efforts since its inception to reduce the number of undefinitized contract actions used to execute missile defense programs and the oversight processes it has used to make informed decisions. These efforts are important because the processes establish important management controls that the agency is expected to conduct in its operations. In this latest report, we examine the extent to which MDA has followed processes that should limit the number of undefinitized contract actions used, and to ensure that contracting officials make informed decisions related to their use. In summary, there are (1) more undefinitized contract actions in high-performance assets and (2) contracting officials still not developing and following adequate plans for dealing with undefinitized contract actions. As more undefinitized contract actions are issued for major missile defense assets, those undefinitized contract actions account for a larger portion of the total cost of the system. In 2012, these actions accounted for approximately 40 percent, while in 2013 they accounted for more than 50 percent and in 2014 they account for an estimated 70 percent of overall spending on MDA\u2019s assets. Our recommendation from our 2014 report can be found on page 36. This recommendation addresses how MDA can help to improve the management of undefinitized contract actions. 4 MDA is managing billions in investments for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.

Agencies were generally able to demonstrate compliance with 10 of FISMA\u2019s 11 requirements during fiscal years 2014 to 2018. In our ongoing coverage of cybersecurity for the federal civilian government agencies, we have reported on issues surrounding agencies\u2019 cybersecurity efforts. Many of the issues were raised in our reports addressing information technology security controls, FISMA compliance, cybersecurity workforce, federal cyber incident management, data breach notification, and agency performance of continuous monitoring activities. Other concerns that we have reported relate to the security and privacy of personally identifiable information, and cybersecurity practices for government-managed and contractor-operated facilities, equipment, and information. We have developed a cybersecurity management initiative, which includes the annual reporting requirements outlined in our Cybersecurity High-Risk Series and a focus on FISMA. As part of the High-Risk Program, we are conducting audits and reviews on federal departments, agencies, and companies to identify progress being made in implementing cybersecurity reforms. While agencies have made progress towards addressing some of our concerns, many of our past recommendations have not been fully addressed, and many of the same concerns have been raised in our annual FISMA evaluations. This report discusses, among other things, (1) the extent to which agencies have implemented recommendations related to continuous monitoring and incident management reported in 26 FISMA evaluations issued between fiscal years 2014 and 2019, and any progress agencies have made in addressing these recommendations since our previous report; (2) the progress agencies have made in implementing the binding operational directives related to continuous diagnostic and mitigation (CDM) capabilities at civilian agencies; and (3) how OMB has ensured that agencies have met obligations related to the scanning, monitoring, and remediation of public-facing internet protocol addresses and web applications. We conducted our work from May 2019 through October 2020. To fulfill our objectives of reviewing our prior cybersecurity-related recommendations, we analyzed the extent to which agencies implemented 26 recommendations from 26 cybersecurity-specific evaluations. We reviewed our prior evaluation reports from fiscal years 2014 to 2019 to determine the extent to which the recommendations related to implementation of continuous monitoring and incident management components of the FISMA framework. As of September 2020, 21 of these recommendations were implemented\u201416 partially and 5 fully. We also reviewed the status of the five recommendations from these evaluations that we considered to be \u201cOpen\u201d in our 2019 update. Status for one of these recommendations has remained unchanged, while in the other three evaluations, progress has been demonstrated. We also observed continued efforts to address four of the remaining recommendations in FY 2020 evaluations. For the 13 recommendations from evaluations issued in FY 2019, implementation status was as follows: 10 partially implemented, 3 fully implemented, and none open. We also reviewed data from our 2019 evaluations to determine the extent to which agencies have complied with binding operational directives regarding CDM capabilities issued through OMB Memorandum M-19-02. As of June 2020, we found that agencies had implemented policies, practices, and capabilities related to CDM or had demonstrated that they were in the early stages of doing so. Finally, we reviewed the DHS reports on scanning, monitoring, and remediation of public-facing internet protocol addresses and web applications as of September 30, 2019, and the follow-up actions being taken by DHS or agencies related to reported vulnerabilities. To determine the extent to which agencies have addressed our prior recommendations related to implementation of continuous monitoring and incident management components of the FISMA framework, we: Conducted electronic searches of agency annual FISMA evaluations to locate the recommendations that we made in prior reports. Reviewed the status of the implementation of each of these recommendations. To determine the extent to which agencies have complied with the binding operational directives related to CDM capabilities, we: Conducted electronic searches of GAO\u2019s Cybersecurity Continuous Monitoring and IT Modernization, and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Tool 6 of", "This is a short summary of the text provided above. TABLE: The data provided in the table below is the result of a statistical analysis of the text. TABLE 1 TEXT Summary TEXT The text deals with underride crashes and the safety standards set forth by the United States Department of Transportation. Underride crashes occur when a car slides under a large truck, which can result in serious injuries and fatalities. Rear guards play an important role in preventing underride crashes, and they are mandated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The text cites specific instances where rear guards were not installed and consequently resulted in severe underride crashes. The text goes on to explain that there are no federal standards for side or front underride guards. Although there are petitions for new regulations that address this issue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has withdrawn proposed regulations for rear guards with strength and energy absorption criteria for all newly built single-unit trucks due to lack of justification. The Department of Transportation has a mission to reduce crashes involving large trucks and buses, and requires specific rear guards to be installed on most trailers. It also requires rear guards on single-unit trucks, and mandates periodic inspections for commercial vehicles. The text provides statistical data to support the arguments.\nTo summarize, this text, written by the United States Department of Transportation, discusses the different types of safety standards required to prevent underride crashes in the United States. Specifically, the text explains the importance of underride guards, including rear guards, side guards, and front guards, and provides statistical data to support the argument.

BLS officials said that BLS disseminates the terms and conditions itself and updates them as needed. BLS did not have any guidance available specifically related to the Stevens Amendment. MSHA and OSHA officials told us that they do not have an annual training requirement on the Stevens Amendment. Neither agency uses the term \u201csubrecipient,\u201d but according to MSHA and OSHA officials, the term is a \u201ccommonly used industry term.\u201d MSHA and OSHA officials told us that their sub-agencies may use the term in some instances. MSHA and OSHA officials told us that grantees may have varying degrees of sophistication with regard to managing grant awards and complying with federal award requirements. According to officials in MSHA and OSHA, when grantees do not provide accurate or complete information on other non-federal fund sources, it can make monitoring and compliance efforts more difficult. While officials from one state agency that received an OSHA grant told us that their state\u2019s grants process provides specific guidance on complying with the Stevens Amendment, officials from another state agency told us that they had never heard of the Stevens Amendment. The official told us that their agency\u2019s grant sub-agencies require the agency to certify annually about the amount of matching funds that it contributed to the program being funded by the awarded grant. For example, the official told us that in 2017, the program provided about $2 million in services and received a grant award of $1.3 million that the state matched with $700,000, so the state contributed $2 million of state funds to the program.

The OGP guidance also provides a definition of \u201csubrecipient\u201d under the amendment, stating that it includes an entity or organization that receives a grant or a subgrant. HHS provides general guidance on the amendment, including language that paraphrases the Stevens Amendment. The guidance includes a description of the amendment\u2019s requirements with a general overview of the responsibilities of states, local governments, and other organizations that receive federal awards. For example, the guidance includes information on reporting requirements, public disclosures, and penalties. HHS officials told us that in fiscal year 2017, it awarded just under 16,000 active grant awards. According to officials, the total value of fiscal year 2017 grant awards was about $115 billion, which accounts for three- quarters of HHS\u2019s discretionary funding. OGP officials told us that OGP does not routinely conduct annual training sessions related to the Stevens Amendment, but OGP officials can disseminate information through Webinars or other methods if it receives requests from the awarding components. OGP officials said that most of HHS\u2019s awarding components use a standardized set of award documents that includes language paraphrasing the Stevens Amendment. According to OGP officials, OGP\u2019s grants management office requires grant agreements to include federal grant information that contains language paraphrasing the Stevens Amendment\u2019s requirements. According to officials from the awarding components that we interviewed, they generally used HHS\u2019s standardized award document format. 6 Government Accountability Office According to Education officials, the agency awards grants, including discretionary grants, totaling approximately $3.7 billion dollars per year. Grantees receiving funding from ED can include states, local school districts, institutions of higher education, non-profit groups, and other entities. ED employs about 4,500 people nationwide and awards funding through four offices: the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Office of Postsecondary Education, the Office of Vocational and Adult Education, and the Office of Federal Student Aid. At the federal level, grant programs and project guidance documents at ED are developed by experts who have deep knowledge in various education topics and are often distributed through a series of cascading grant notices that link to ED\u2019s policy guidance.

These capabilities include positioning, navigation, and timing; meteorology; missile warning; and secure communications, among others. Space systems can take a long time to develop and involve multiple segments, including space, ground control stations, terminals, user equipment, and launch, as figure 1 below shows. DOD satellite systems are also expensive to acquire. Unit costs for current DOD satellites can range from $500 million to over $3 billion. The associated ground systems can cost over $6 billion to develop and maintain and the cost to launch a satellite can climb to well over $100 million. Table 1 provides highlights of the current status of DOD\u2019s major space programs. As the table shows, DOD is also in the beginning phases of acquiring several constellations of new satellites and ground processing capabilities\u2014including for missile warning, protected communications, space-based environmental monitoring, and space command and control. We have work underway to assess the Air Force\u2019s space command and control development efforts and examine DOD\u2019s analysis of alternatives for wideband communication services. For a more complete description of these major space programs, see appendix I. In addition, DOD is exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications as well as funding development of new launch vehicles as it pursues a new acquisition strategy for procuring launch services. Our prior work has shown that many major DOD space programs have experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. For instance, the total program cost for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program, a protected satellite communications system, has grown 117 percent since the program\u2019s original cost estimate and its first satellite was launched more than 3.5 years late. For the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), a missile warning satellite program, the program cost grew 265 percent from its original estimate and the launch of the first satellite was delayed roughly 9 years. Both programs moved to the production phase where fewer problems tend to surface, and where there is typically less risk of significant cost and schedule growth. A more recent major satellite program, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, has seen an almost 4-year delay due to technical issues and program cost growth of about 32 percent. Cost and schedule growth has also been a challenge for satellite ground systems and user equipment. Ground system delays have been so lengthy, that satellites sometimes spend years in orbit before key capabilities can be fully exploited. For example, The command and control system for GPS III satellites, known as the Next Generation Operational Control System, or OCX, is approximately 5 years behind schedule. As a result, the Air Force has had to start two separate back-up efforts to modify the current ground system to ensure the continuity of GPS capabilities and to make anti- jamming capabilities available via Military Code, or M-code, until OCX is delivered. Our ongoing review of GPS includes an assessment of OCX schedule risk and potential impacts on OCX delivery, acceptance, and operation. We expect to issue our report on GPS in spring 2019. Development of GPS user equipment that can utilize the M-Code signal has lagged behind the fielding of GPS M-code satellites for more than a decade, due to prolonged development challenges. In December 2017, we found that while DOD had made some progress on initial testing of the receiver cards needed to utilize the M-code signal, additional development was necessary to make M-code work with the over 700 weapon systems that require it. We also found that DOD had begun initial planning to transition some weapon systems to use M-code receivers, but significantly more work remained to understand the cost and schedule of transitioning to M-code receivers across DOD. Further, in December 2017, we found that multiple entities were separately maturing their own receiver cards. We recommended that DOD assign responsibility to a single organization to collect test data, lessons learned, and design solutions so that common design solutions are employed and the DOD could avoid duplication of efforts. DOD concurred with the recommendation, but has not yet taken action on it. We have previously reported that over 90 percent of the capabilities to be provided by Mobile User Objective System communications satellites\u2014currently", "The annual July 4 events on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are secured and orchestrated by a large number of federal agencies, state and local police, and private entities, who provide security, medical support, and emergency response capabilities. Each year the number of agencies involved in planning, producing and executing the events increases, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Department of Energy. The National Park Service, in coordination with the DC government, also provides crowd control and traffic management services.", "DHS\u2019s mission statement and its strategic plan both focus on the safety and security of the American people and infrastructure. DHS\u2019s mission statement states that DHS is \u201can executive department of the federal government charged with securing the entire American homeland. \u201d 1 This statement is similar to FPS\u2019s mission, which is to secure federal facilities to enable the effective performance of the federal government. Table 3 below shows that the mission statements have some similarities. DHS has not yet updated its mission statement since it was founded in 2003. 2 While the homeland security and counterterrorism missions have been in place since DHS\u2019s creation, FPS\u2019s mission did not expand to include securing buildings against counterterrorism threats until the Homeland Security Act created it as part of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service. This fact should not be overlooked in any future discussions of potential placement options for FPS. However, once it was created as part of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service, FPS\u2019s mission expanded in accordance with the Homeland Security Act. Specifically, the Homeland Security Act created ICE \u201cto increase border security, and to prevent the entry of undocumented and potentially dangerous individuals.\u201d 3 This DHS mission was relevant to FPS\u2019s mission, and FPS began conducting investigations involving the U.S. Immigration and Customs Service (USICS), which was responsible for enforcing laws and regulations involving border security. The Homeland Security Act also created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \u201cto strengthen security in transportation to and from United States airports,\u201d 4 which was relevant to FPS in its mission to protect federal facilities and building occupants. Table 4 below shows examples of how certain portions of the strategic plans of DHS and FPS have similarities. Both agencies have goals or objectives that are similar to FPS in terms of physical security. The mission, goals, and objectives of FPS do not conflict with those of DHS. It is not a stretch to say that a mission statement and strategic plan are among the most important aspects of an agency, and as the first criteria shown in table 1, the placement of FPS must meet this criterion that it be similar to the agency on mission, goals, and objectives. 1 U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 308. DHS\u2019s mission statement is available at https:// www. dhs. gov/ newsroom/ mission. 2 Ibid. 3 Public Law 107-296, \u00a7 101(2) (Dec. 17, 2002), 116 Stat. 2311, 2321 (codified at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, 112). 4 Ibid.\nResponsibilities. In January 2019, we reported that FPS\u2019s core mission is protecting federal facilities, and because GSA had established a separate guard contractor to help carry out this mission, a large portion of FPS\u2019 budget and responsibilities related to contract guards. 5 We further reported that FPS has some security-related information-technology (IT) responsibilities and its law enforcement responsibilities included conducting criminal investigations related to violations of laws and regulations aimed at protecting federal facilities and the persons therein. FPS\u2019s mission, responsibilities, and funding related to contract guards are shown in table 5 below. In 2006, GSA awarded a new 5-year, $1 billion contract to provide guards for federal buildings nationwide. This security contract allowed GSA to manage the guards in a centralized fashion and to give FPS a consistent national approach for its physical security program. GSA and FPS have a shared responsibility for physical security at federal-owned and -leased buildings. These responsibilities are reflected in GSA and FPS Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) that outline the roles and responsibilities for securing federal buildings. In 2017, GSA and FPS created a shared responsibility for physical security related to contract guards. In 2009, FPS\u2019s responsibilities expanded to include developing the Integrated Physical Security System (IPSS), a common platform for security-system components across FPS-owned and -leased facilities to manage facility-security systems (See Appendix II-A. ). DHS has a significant amount of responsibility related to physical security. Table 6 below shows similarities to FPS in this area of responsibility. We also found some differences between the two entities. FPS has a responsibility related to federal-building physical security at GSA- owned and -leased facilities. DHS, on the other hand, has security responsibilities for many types of facilities, beyond federally owned and leased. Its responsibilities also go beyond those related to federal facilities. For example, as shown in table 6, DHS is responsible for the safety and security of the federal workforce in federal buildings but also across the entire federal workforce. This responsibility includes physical security incidents, such as active shooter events or emergency evacuations, as well as potential cyber threats. While FPS has a responsibility related to incident reporting, it", "Improve cybersecurity workforce planning efforts after finishing the National Cyber Director nomination and confirmation hearings, which had a significant impact on the DHS workload. The position has now been filled. Enhancing DHS\u2019s Workforce Planning Efforts Page 2 of 3 workforce planning efforts. Improving FEVS scores relating to employee engagement. We have not yet made a determination on the level of progress DHS has made in addressing outcomes related to employee engagement scores on the FEVS since our last evaluation and have continued to track the department\u2019s progress in this area. However, as required by law, DHS has implemented all required corrective action plans for FEVS survey scores related to employee engagement. Since February 2018, DHS has implemented at least 10 actions related to FEVS scores. It has also identified root causes of issues and created solutions addressing them. DHS continues its employee communications and engagement events aimed at improving FEVS scores. Enhancing DHS\u2019s workforce planning efforts has been an area of emphasis for government leaders because it provides greater insight into the department\u2019s current workforce and supports efforts to identify its future workforce needs. To address workforce planning weaknesses, DHS has established cybersecurity workforce plans, which provide guidance to components about the workforce they need. We continue to focus on DHS\u2019s workforce planning efforts because identifying and addressing workforce needs are essential to DHS\u2019s ability to address mission challenges. We consider the outcomes related to human capital we have been monitoring to be crucial to DHS\u2019s success in achieving its mission. The recommendations we have made regarding these outcomes are intended to help DHS address mission challenges related to its workforce. For example, as we previously stated, if DHS does not have a competent team of cyber professionals, it may struggle to provide cybersecurity services throughout the federal government. It may have difficulty implementing new strategies aimed at improving its cybersecurity. These challenges would be formidable for any federal department, but they would be especially difficult for a department that is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of the federal government\u2019s cyber defense. Given its mission, DHS has a deep responsibility to address any workforce challenges that could inhibit its ability to achieve its mission.\nOverall analysis of the report by HR analysts\nThe report discusses various human capital practices necessary for enhancing the employee morale and engagement within the DHS. Such human capital practices as workplace safety, employee training, employee participation in activities and decision-making, performance assessments, and workplace diversity should be considered to enhance employee engagement.", "Legal communities, rule of law civil society organizations, legal aid organizations, law schools, and professional associations, such as bar associations. \u2022 Other types of rule of law assistance include activities to strengthen civil society organizations, increase transparency and accountability, advance citizen participation, and support legal or regulatory frameworks and processes that promote human rights and social inclusion. These activities also include assistance to combat human trafficking through the rule of law and combating violence against marginalized populations such as women, children, and individuals with disabilities. Table 1 shows the fiscal year 2018 rule of law activity and program totals by State, USAID and DOD. Table 1.

According to State, the Department of State\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser (L) provides legal advice and assistance to State Department officials. L also administers programs and services relating to treaty implementation and participation in multilateral international legal institutions.. According to State, INL is the lead bureau for rule of law activities within the State Department. According to State, INL assists foreign governments in developing and improving rule of law institutions. To achieve its goals, INL develops a system tailored to each foreign government\u2019s priorities. When assistance is directed toward strengthening judicial institutions, the approach INL uses involves four stages: \u2022 Institutional development analysis and assessment, including training needs analysis and rule of law needs assessment; \u2022 Design and planning of capacity building initiatives; \u2022 Implementation of programs using innovative techniques and evaluation methods; and \u2022 Long-term sustainability efforts. INL\u2019s stated goal is institution building by focusing its assistance on the human factor of the justice system, and the establishment of a sense of security, stability, equity and justice. According to State, a comprehensive, integrated approach that covers the entire criminal justice chain helps ensure that any reforms undertaken will enhance the entire system\u2019s performance. However, INL does not claim to have a perfect formula for success, and acknowledges that achieving success may take time. According to State, a comprehensive approach requires long-term commitment of funding, staffing, and effort from partners in recipient governments. According to State, INL\u2019s goal of sustainable reform is enhanced by: \u2022 Working to strengthen the whole justice system, not just a single, isolated component; \u2022 Developing the human and institutional capacity necessary to maintain and improve reforms; and \u2022 Engaging justice reform efforts in the wider community by strengthening the rule of law culture. According to State, INL supports rule of law through programs targeting: \u2022 Police reform; \u2022 Justice reform; \u2022 Anticorruption reform; \u2022 Judicial training reform; \u2022 Anti-human trafficking initiatives; \u2022 Criminal justice reform; and \u2022 Programs in areas such as child soldiers and victim assistance support human-centered initiatives. To enhance police training efforts, INL created the Regional Law Enforcement Training Center (ITRC) in El Salvador in 2005. The ITRC provides training, technical assistance and professional expertise to help police institutions improve their professional development. One INL-supported program targets the development of police training academies for professional-level police personnel. According to State, INL also supports local-level police community centers, such as Community Policing Teams (Policia Comunitaria), which are local problem solving teams that include police, prosecutors, and social workers who work closely with community leaders in high-crime areas to identify and address police and social services needs, as well as conduct preventive activities that reduce crime and improve citizen safety. According to State, INL supports anticorruption initiatives throughout the country. INL\u2019s anticorruption programs aim to build partner government institutions that conduct their affairs with integrity and transparency to enhance the rule of law. According to State, INL focuses on two initiatives: \u2022 Prevention of police corruption, including through training, mentoring and monitoring of anticorruption units; and \u2022 Education of the judiciary on anticorruption and fraud crimes. According to State, INL works with the Attorney General\u2019s Office of the United States on a program to prevent, investigate, and prosecute public corruption crimes in El Salvador. Over 300 Salvadoran law enforcement personnel were trained and mentored by U.S. law enforcement professionals on investigative techniques and procedures. In addition to these training programs, the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador sponsors the Inter-American Prosecutor\u2019s Conference, which serves as a regional forum for", "To be eligible for Job Corps, youth must generally be 16 to. justify the award noncompetitively. We sought to determine whether ETA justifies awards of Job Corps center contracts noncompetitively. We focused on the six exceptions to full and open competition provided by FAR subpart 6.3. We interviewed officials at ETA\u2019s national headquarters and in three regional offices: Boston, Kansas City, and Phoenix. We also reviewed ETA\u2019s policies and procedures for obtaining justifications to award Job Corps center contracts noncompetitively, and we reviewed over 300 awarded Job Corps center contracts for fiscal years 2013 and 2017. To conduct our work, we held interviews with ETA officials in Washington, DC, and in regional offices in Boston, Kansas City, and Phoenix. We also interviewed officials from Job Corps training centers in those regions. In addition, we reviewed documents ETA has developed to assist employees with Job Corps contracting activities\u2014such as policy guides, training presentations and handouts designed to inform ETA officials on acquisition policies and procedures\u2014and we reviewed Job Corps center and other contracts awarded by ETA in fiscal years 2013 and 2017. We also reviewed DOL\u2019s Inspector General reports on Job Corps acquisitions. We conducted our review from February 2017 to June 2017. We reviewed administrative controls related to the use of exceptions. We also tested controls identified in the risk assessments performed by the Office of Job Corps during audits. Specifically, we tested the controls designed to ensure that the six exceptions to full and open competition were used for their intended purposes. Finally, we reviewed the justifications prepared for the 33 exceptions made in fiscal years 2013 and 2017. DOL awarded all Job Corps center contracts through competitive processes. During 2016, Job Corps awarded contracts for over 2,800 trainees, but the number varies each year. It took 8 months in advance to advertise Job Corps center contracts. In those 8 months, Job Corps went throughout the process of getting requests for proposals, and in advance, before that time, they also advertise the Job Corps centers in the Federal Register, which lets contractors know to expect the upcoming process in advance, so they can all apply and compete fairly with each other. We found no instances in the past decade where Job Corps awarded Job Corps center contracts noncompetitively. (However, ETA awarded approximately 70 Job Corps construction contracts from 2008 through fiscal year 2017 using an exception to full and open competition\u2014which we did not review as part of this activity.) In Job Corps centers, students undergo training that ranges from learning life and job skills to obtaining post-secondary education, and training typically lasts 1 year. In order to provide this training, Job Corps centers are required to procure equipment, food and clothing, and other materials. Job Corps contracts may also involve the purchase of food services, transportation, medical services, or other services to support Job Corps students. Job Corps\u2019 annual federal budget request does not increase in relation to the number of students Job Corps serves. The Department of Labor receives a fixed amount each year. This is a fixed, annual budget. They receive approximately 3,000 students each year; however, the funding will support those students no matter if they increase to 3000 students at the beginning of the year, or if there are only 2500 students at the beginning of the year. This is done because it is impossible for the department\u2019s budget to be adjusted based upon the number of students that come through the training and services facility. In other words, Job Corps is always operating with a fixed budget. Job Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2017 budget request is $1.9 billion, with approximately $1 billion designated for Job Corps students\u2019 training and approximately $600 million for Job Corps centers\u2019 maintenance and repair. Since ETA did not compete Job Corps center contracts noncompetitively in the past decade, the use of the six exceptions to full and open competition was not necessary and should be avoided unless there are circumstances that warrant these exceptions and the justification requirements have been met by ETA. However, we determined (a) that ETA had not justified Job Corps center contracts appropriately as required by DOL policy, (b) that the use of exceptions to full and open competition did not comply with DOL\u2019s policy requiring the use of written justification documents, and (c) that ETA\u2019s policy manual used inconsistent language and lacked specific policies and procedures on the use of exceptions to full and open competition. Our observations are discussed in more detail in the findings and recommendations section of this report. We recommend management of Job Corps and those responsible for justifying Job Corps center contracts award and administer Job Corps center contracts competitively unless exceptional circumstances exist that mandate the use of exceptions to full and open competition. DOL\u2019s Job Corps is a federally-funded program authorized under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Job Corps seeks", "We found that VA wait-time data are still unreliable because of the following reasons: 1) VA\u2019s electronic scheduling system was not accurately capturing key scheduling data needed to measure wait times, which hinders VA\u2019s ability to take action. 2) VA\u2019s scheduling policy was not being consistently followed by schedulers, and was not being implemented properly at nine of the 24 VA medical facilities reviewed. This policy requires that facilities post their wait times at every point of access for a patient, including primary care staff, the specialty clinics, and the admitting offices. Wait times were not being posted in visible areas, which hinders the ability for patients to know their wait time status before they arrive. 3) The data were not reliable because VA was not obtaining the proper data to capture all patients requesting an appointment. For example, patients who may not go to the emergency room but register elsewhere at a VA facility are not captured by VA\u2019s scheduling system, which can result in an underestimate of the wait times. 4) VA\u2019s patient registration systems did not capture all patients making appointments. We found that 6.41 percent of the total number of appointments at 40 randomly selected medical facilities from calendar years 2015 to 2018 had missing data for the source of registration and 11.76 percent of appointments lacked additional data such as the date and time the appointment was scheduled, which makes it harder to capture and measure wait data. 5) VA\u2019s staff did not have the proper training needed to collect accurate wait times. At 11 randomly selected medical facilities, schedulers were not consistently obtaining the required wait time data and did not know the correct procedure for scheduling appointments. To summarize, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care to millions of veterans and has made steady progress in recent years in implementing key initiatives aimed at improving their health and well-being. However, we found three areas, involving wait times, access to urgent care, and the scheduling system, where the agency has not made adequate progress in accomplishing key objectives. In response to a June 2018 report, VA stated that it has taken the following actions to address wait time measurement: implementation of a new appointment management scheduling policy, development of additional wait time training for all scheduling staff, and improved oversight through audits. We are encouraged by these actions, and will continue to monitor progress at VA to ensure it is effectively addressing its challenges. To ensure that the millions of veterans with a promise of the best health care available get the care they need, VHA must continue to address deficiencies such as inaccurate wait times and inadequate access to health care services that we have identified in this report.", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Records are the foundation of open government, supporting the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration. Effective management of federal agency records is important for efficient government operations: it ensures that sufficient documentation is created; that agencies can efficiently locate and retrieve records needed in the daily performance of their missions; and that records of historical significance are identified, preserved, and made available to the public. Requirements for managing federal records include the following: The FRA establishes requirements for the management of federal agencies. Every federal agency is required to preserve records that document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities. The act also gives NARA regulatory responsibilities for records management as well as general responsibilities for archiving records. In response to a presidential memorandum to begin an executive branch effort to reform records management policies and develop a framework for the management of electronic government records, the Director of OMB and the Archivist of the United States jointly issued the Managing Government Records Directive to heads of federal departments and agencies. This directive aimed at creating a robust records management framework for electronic records that complied with statutes and regulations to achieve the benefits outlined in the presidential memorandum. It required agencies to eliminate paper and use electronic recordkeeping to the fullest extent possible. Among other things, the directive identified two requirements related to electronic records that agencies were to implement between December 2016 and December 2019. By December 31, 2016, federal agencies were to manage all permanent and temporary email records in an accessible electronic format. Email records were to be retained in an appropriate electronic system that supports records management litigation requirements, including the capability to identify, retrieve, and retain the records for as long as they are needed. By December 31, 2019, federal agencies are to manage all permanent electronic records in an electronic format to the fullest extent possible for eventual transfer and accessioning by NARA. Under the FRA and its implementing regulations, NARA has general oversight responsibilities for records management and the preservation of permanent records documenting the activities of the government in the National Archives of the United States. Thus, NARA is responsible for overseeing agency management of temporary and permanent records used in everyday operations and, ultimately, for taking control of permanent agency records judged to be of historic value. In particular, NARA is responsible for: issuing records management guidance covering topics such as managing electronic records; assigning an appraisal archivist to each agency to answer agency questions about federal records management; providing services to agencies, such as records scheduling and working with agencies to implement effective controls over the creation, maintenance, and use of records in the conduct of agency business; approving the disposition (destruction or preservation) of records; providing storage facilities for agency records; and conducting inspections or surveys of agency records and records management programs. NARA is also responsible for reporting to Congress on the state of federal records management. It accomplishes this responsibility, in part, by requiring all federal agencies to submit an annual report to the Office of the Chief Records Officer for the federal government. As part of these annual reports, agencies are required to include three submissions: The Senior Agency Official Records Management Report includes responses about the agency\u2019s progress toward the targets and requirements in the Managing Government Records Directive. The Federal Email Management Report includes a self-evaluation of their email management. The Records Management Self-Assessment includes a self- evaluation of their compliance with federal records management statutes, regulations, and program functions. In addition to NARA\u2019s responsibilities, the FRA requires each federal agency to make and preserve records that document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency. Effective Records Management Must Address Electronic Records, Including Email text, or by any other means as is defined by the Records Act. The act requires agencies to establish systems that meet the following requirements: Effective records management. Records that document agency operations must be properly preserved, organized, maintained, and cataloged or indexed to facilitate their identification and use; they must be stored in a way that ensures their security and protection from unauthorized access, destruction, or modification; they must be identified clearly and accurately at the time of their creation; and they must be available during business hours to all officials authorized to see them and to other employees who have a specific job or office requirement for using them. Records management must be integrated and compatible with current or planned automated office systems; as long as the records remain an integral part of electronic automated information systems, agencies are responsible for their management. The records management program must be an ongoing part of agency administrative programs. It must be consistent with accepted methods of records management, which are developed by NARA based on records management principles, and may provide for training staff members and for the exchange of staff members between agencies for training to promote efficient management of records. NARA approves records management systems and, in doing so, requires agencies", "elderly parent. Under certain conditions, caregivers may also be eligible for a tax deduction for out-of-pocket caregiving costs up to 20 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income. The deduction can apply to care for a dependent or qualifying relative. State tax-related provisions. Some states provide tax credits, such as New York\u2019s credit for dependent care related expenses, while others, like Illinois, provide deductions. Social Security and health-related provisions. In addition to providing retirement and disability income under Social Security, the Social Security Act includes several provisions that help Americans with disabilities or elderly persons manage long-term care needs, including Medicaid services for individuals who have institutionalized themselves. For example, the Social Security Act waives certain asset and income tests for Medicaid eligibility, and Medicaid must be offered to recipients who are entitled to cash benefits, who are also elderly or blind, and who qualify for Medicaid in their home state. Other Social Security programs that provide support to individuals with disabilities or elderly individuals include: Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides cash benefits to disabled adults who are age 65 and older with very low income and resources, and individuals who are blind; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) that provides food assistance for women, infants, and children; and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which provides cash benefits to blind or disabled workers who meet certain criteria (such as being disabled for 5 consecutive months), and blind or disabled widow(er)s who otherwise meet certain criteria. Health programs that provide support to individuals with disabilities or elderly persons include: Medicare, which provides health care coverage to Americans who are 65 and older or who meet certain other eligibility criteria; Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income individuals; and CHIP, which provides health care coverage for children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. Federal and state programs provide varied support to individuals with caregiving responsibilities for the elderly. For example, The Family Medical Leave Act provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for caregivers to take care of a family member with a serious health condition. The Act applies to state, local and federal government agencies with 50 or more employees and private employers with 50 or more employees. Workers are eligible if they have worked at least 1250 hours for the employer. The Department of Defense launched the Military Family Care Project to assist parents who have children with a serious illness or disability. These programs are in part funded by the Department of Defense. Also, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides assistance programs for veterans who served at least 1945-1967 and are 50 per cent or more disabled, and their spouses who may have spousal benefits. The Department of Labor provides job training opportunities for caregivers, including wage replacement benefits to help cover a portion of lost wages and employer incentives to maintain healthcare benefits. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides housing assistance such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Under this plan lenders must modify mortgage payments of families with incomes at or below 120 percent of the area\u2019s median income. The plan includes loan servicers who must report delinquencies as current loans. Medicare and Medicaid help some families pay expensive health care bills. Health programs are expanding under the Affordable Care Act. Caregivers may also be eligible for tax credits or benefits in some states, which may be under Social Security or Medicaid law.", "TEXT: THE GREAT LAKES PILAGAGE ACT OF 1960 ESTABLISHED THE SYSTEM OF COMPULSORY PILAGE ON THE GREAT LAKES.\nYou've reached the end of your free preview.\nWant to read all 6 pages?\n- Fall '21\nOther Related Materials\n8 pages\n- In 1871, there was a major fire that destroyed many of the cities buildings.\n- Strayer University\n-\n- History 1010 - Fall 2020\nChicago History.docx\n5 pages\n- On 7 February 1974, the first episode of the 3-part BBC series, Tales of\n- Strayer University\n-\n- HUM 220 - Fall 2020\nTales of the unexpected.docx\n11 pages\n- 1.

In addition, five SUD treatment providers and other entities have been indicted, and multiple search warrants have been executed on SUD treatment providers, recovery homes, and businesses associated with them. According to officials from several state agencies and related entities in Florida, the activities of the recovery homes and SUD treatment providers\u2014including the drug testing industry\u2014led to significant increases in insurance premiums and costs for private health insurance plans in Florida. For example, officials at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told us that in 2015, a group of private insurance carriers reported an estimated 5,000 percent increase in suspicious drug testing claims and sought assistance from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate it. Officials from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also told us that their investigation uncovered a network of fraud operated out of the Miami area. This network\u2014led by individuals that officials described as \u201ccareer criminals\u201d\u2014brought individuals from elsewhere in the United States to Miami specifically for the purpose of defrauding insurers, and then resettled them in Fort Lauderdale. Investigators found the network to extend to 15 counties in southern Florida and in Florida\u2019s panhandle, where, according to investigators, they were operating on a similar scale. According to officials from several agencies and related entities in Florida, in some cases, officials said that recovery home operators had provided space for individuals who had overdosed in the recovery homes, to facilitate their continued use of drugs and to encourage additional urine testing. [This information is relevant, as it shows unethical practices in the recovery home industry in connection with patient brokering for health insurance payor dollars] Officials told us that these practices had resulted in an increased use and abuse of narcotic drugs among individuals recovering from SUD, and had led to the overdose death of individuals in recovery homes. According to officials, the Florida state attorney\u2019s office told us that recovery home operators had been found and charged with failing to provide prompt medical attention in situations in which SUD treatment patients were experiencing heroin overdoses, or had been found dead in the recovery homes. In another case, state officials told us that at least one recovery home operator who had been referred to by a specific SUD treatment provider was found to be engaging in fraudulent drug screen brokering, as discussed above. Officials of the Florida state attorney\u2019s office further told us that recovery home operators and their associates regularly misrepresented and forged medical diagnoses and urine drug testing results to further obtain insurance benefits, sometimes with the assistance of the recovery home operators\u2019 network of medical providers, including psychologists and psychiatrists. These providers would then falsify medical data for insurance claims. Officials from the Florida state attorney\u2019s office told us that one specific SUD treatment provider had a well-established practice of billing insurance for medically unnecessary treatments, such as extended outpatient care and in-patient residential treatment for urine drug tests with the assistance of the recovery home operators and their medical providers. Officials also told us that the treatment provider had been found to have falsified medical records submitted to insurance payors. For example, officials of the Florida state attorney\u2019s office told us that recovery home operators and their associates have been found to have falsified medical records for clients to indicate they had received medically unnecessary treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy or intensive outpatient therapy for 16 consecutive days. Another practice included brokering insurance benefit payments for individuals who were out of state; these individuals would leave their home states temporarily to receive SUD treatment at a Florida recovery home, and then return home with insurance benefits that would pay for services provided in their home states, officials from Florida\u2019s state attorney\u2019s office told us. For example, they said that officials in one state estimated that a recovery home operator who had been referred to by a specific SUD treatment provider was estimated to have defrauded that state\u2019s insurance system out of billions of dollars. Officials from several offices of state attorneys and insurance fraud units in Florida also told us that they had identified organized crime ties to the fraudulent scheme. Officials from several offices of state attorneys and insurance fraud units in Florida and from their state health agencies told us that the number of recovery homes being investigated was large...continued", "Depots require maintenance to maintain readiness for military operations.

In particular, we recommended examining: the process and criteria for team formation, resource allocation decisions, staffing, priority-setting, and coordination with other related organizations; how the cross-functional teams were positioned to support the Army\u2019s efforts to improve processes to identify, prioritize, and meet capability gaps; and the extent to which the Army has examined the risks and benefits of using cross-functional teams to identify, prioritize, and address capability gaps, including any potential trade-offs and any plans for monitoring performance and implementing corrective actions. This report examines the extent to which the Army has adopted processes and procedures to position the cross-functional teams to identify, prioritize, and address capability gaps, including the risks and benefits of using cross-functional teams. The report examines the extent to which the Army has examined the risks and benefits of using cross-functional teams to identify, prioritize, and address capability gaps, including any potential trade-offs and any plans for monitoring performance and implementing corrective actions. We determined the extent to which key stakeholders understood the cross-functional teams process, how risks and benefits were evaluated, and how the cross-functional teams were positioned to leverage expertise. We also (1) determined what metrics the Army has set and implemented to assess performance, and (2) reviewed its processes and procedures for monitoring, collecting, and analyzing performance data and implementing corrective actions. To address our objectives, we: Reviewed policies and guidance; reviewed documentation on cross-functional team pilot activities, such as plans and status reports, to familiarize ourselves with the process; reviewed documentation on the Army\u2019s process of identifying and selecting cross-functional team leaders; interviewed Army stakeholders, subject matter experts, and others involved in cross-functional teams; and visited the Army Futures Command headquarters in Austin, Texas. 4", "T E X T: The Department of Defense is the largest U.S. government department and one of the most complex organizations in the world. In support of its military operations, the department manages many interdependent business functions, including logistics management, procurement, healthcare management, and financial management. The Department relies extensively on IT to support its business functions. For the fiscal year 2020, DOD planned to spend a total of $36.1 billion on IT, which includes projected funding for various mission areas, such as enterprise information environment, business, warfighting, and intelligence. The Department further organizes its IT budget by segments, including business systems, among others. The Department must follow designated policies and guidelines to manage its business systems, and comply with relevant certification and approval requirements. However, the Department still faces challenges in fully complying with the relevant provisions and modernizing its business systems environment. Recommendations to help strengthen the Department\u2019s management of its business systems are included in each of the 29 reports, most of which have been addressed in some way.", "In its 2019 audit of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that its financial statements for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018 contained no material misstatements. GAO also found that as of the end of fiscal year 2019, the GAO's assessment determined that the effectiveness of IRS's internal control over financial reporting had improved over last year's assessment. The GAO also reported that they found no reportable noncompliance for fiscal year 2019 with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements that they tested. However, GAO did find some issues with internal controls over financial reporting which they recommended should be addressed in the future.", "Our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure refers to the systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of them would have a debilitating impact on our security, economic stability, public health or safety, or any combination of these factors. Critical infrastructure includes, among other things, banking and financial institutions, telecommunications networks, and energy production and transmission facilities, most of which are owned and operated by the private sector. Threats to the systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are evolving and growing. These systems are susceptible to unintentional and intentional threats, both cyber and physical. Unintentional, or nonadversarial, threat sources include equipment failures, software coding errors, or the accidental actions of employees. They also include natural disasters and the failure of other critical infrastructures, since the sectors are often interdependent. Intentional or adversarial threats can involve targeted and untargeted attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups, hackers, and disgruntled employees. Adversaries can leverage common computer software programs to deliver a threat by embedding exploits within software files that can be activated when a user opens a file within its corresponding program. Due to the cyber-based threats to federal systems and critical infrastructure, the persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities, and the associated risks, GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in our biennial report to Congress in 1997. In 2003, we expanded this high-risk area to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure and, in 2015, we further expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. We continue to identify the protection of critical cyber infrastructure as a high-risk area, as shown in our March 2019 high-risk update. Because the private sector owns the majority of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect these assets and systems. Toward this end, federal law and policy assign roles and responsibilities for agencies to assist the private sector in protecting critical infrastructure, including enhancing cybersecurity. Presidential Policy Directive 21 establishes the SSAs in the public sector as the federal entities responsible for providing institutional knowledge and specialized expertise. The SSAs lead, facilitate, and support the security and resilience programs and associated activities of their designated critical infrastructure sectors. The directive identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors and designated the nine associated SSAs, as shown in figure 1. In addition, the directive required DHS to update the National Infrastructure Protection Plan to address the implementation of the directive. The directive called for the plan to include, among other things, the identification of a risk management framework to be used to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure and a metrics and analysis process to be used to measure the nation\u2019s ability to manage and reduce risks to critical infrastructure. DHS, in response, updated the National Infrastructure Protection Plan in December 2013 in collaboration with public- and private- sector owners and operators and federal and nonfederal government representatives, including SSAs, from the critical infrastructure community. According to the 2013 plan, SSAs are to work with their private-sector counterparts to understand cyber risk and they are to develop and use metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management efforts. To work with the government, the SCCs were formed as self-organized, self-governing councils that enable critical infrastructure owners and operators, their trade associations, and other industry representatives to interact on a wide range of sector-specific strategies, policies, and activities. The SSAs and the SCCs coordinate and collaborate in a voluntary fashion on issues pertaining to their respective critical infrastructure sector. In addition to the directive, federal laws and policies have also established roles and responsibilities for federal agencies to work with industry to enhance the cybersecurity of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. These include the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13636. In February 2013, Executive Order 13636 outlined an action plan for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. Among other things, the executive order directed NIST to lead the development of a flexible performance-based cybersecurity framework that was to include a set of standards, procedures, and processes. The executive order also directed SSAs, in consultation with DHS and other interested agencies, to coordinate with the SCCs to review the cybersecurity framework and, if necessary, develop implementation guidance or supplemental materials to address sector-specific risks and operating environments. Further, in December 2014, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 established requirements that are consistent with the executive order regarding NIST\u2019s development of a cybersecurity framework. The law requires NIST\u2019s responsibilities in supporting the ongoing development of the cybersecurity framework to include, among other things, identifying an approach that is flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost- effective. Additionally, the Cybersecurity Act requires NIST to coordinate with federal and nonfederal entities (e", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text: Wildfires play an important ecological role on the nation\u2019s landscapes. The altered frequency and other changes in wildland fire in the past century has reduced the resilience of the nation\u2019s forests and grasslands to the normal frequency of fire, and the buildup of surface fuels and overstocking has created the conditions for more intense, higher frequency, and more expansive fires. These fire management practices over the past century led to a buildup of surface fuels on forest surfaces and other wildland environments. This altered fire frequency led to various forms of alterations in the ecosystems, and their changes affect the normal frequency of wildland fires. In addition, forest and other vegetation management practices and changes have resulted in the buildup of surface fuels and overstocking of some forest environments. The buildup of surface fuels and overstocking of some forest environments and the reduced frequency of wildfire in some ecosystems have resulted in increased amounts of vegetative debris (e.g., dead trees, branches, leaves, and grasses) accumulating on the ground, which serves to increase fuel quantities and can create more continuous fuels. The history of fire exclusion and changes in forest management led to the buildup of surface fuels and overstocking of some forests, which led to increased amounts of vegetative debris, causing fires to burn more rapidly than in the past. The arrangement of living vegetation also affects the way wildfires burn. The buildup of surface fuels and overstocking of some forests may cause fire that previously would have remained on the ground to climb the layered forest structure, creating a high-intensity crown fire. Reducing the frequency of fire in fire-adapted forests and other ecosystems has led to changes to the plant species that make up the forest or ecosystem, which may cause the vegetation composition to shift toward species that are not well adapted to fire. The reduction of fuel buildup and vegetation overstocking can help reduce a wildland fire\u2019s intensity, lowering the risk it poses to communities, structures, and other valuable assets and infrastructure.", "What guidelines are established for planning of water resources projects involving coastal storm and flood risk management objectives?", "The text is about a process of registering deaths caused by various causes. When a person dies, various documents are filled out by different officials (funeral directors, physicians, coroners, etc.). There are specific forms and rules for filling out this paperwork, and different officials have different responsibilities. The data from these forms is collected by state and national health departments, which analyze it for trends and comparisons among other countries. The information is also used to create public policy and prevention strategies to reduce the number of deaths. However, there are limitations to this process, such as the incomplete recording of deaths and the use of outdated or incorrect forms. To address these issues and improve the accuracy of the data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently made some changes to the procedures and forms used in this process. This includes training officials who complete the forms, developing guidance on filling out the pregnancy checkbox, and conducting a pilot project to test data quality. These changes are intended to ensure that all deaths from all causes can be accurately documented and tracked, including maternal mortality, which has gained increased attention in recent years.", "Text summarized above explains that FAA defines FBO as a business that operates fueling facilities, hangers, aircraft tie-downs, aircraft rental, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and other aeronautical services at an airport.

The Air Force, on the basis of analysis in a September 2016 Government Accountability Office report, has not regularly and systematically reassessed the assumptions underlying its annual training requirements in the Ready Aircrew Program to ensure that the training plan aligns with stated goals, to successfully achieve missions across a broad range of current and emerging threats. As a result, the Air Force may be unable to ensure that its forces can accomplish a full range of missions\u2014including counterterrorism and other important mission types. Additionally, the Air Force does not systematically evaluate the effectiveness of training performed as part of the Ready Aircrew Program, which prevents the service from determining whether flying time spent in the program is achieving desirable training outcomes. The Air Force is also unable to provide senior military leaders with useful guidance on the readiness of its flying forces. Therefore, we are recommending that the Air Force: (1) reassess the assumptions behind its annual aircrew training requirements and make any needed adjustments to ensure that its training is effective; (2) develop training requirements and support elements needed to accomplish annual training objectives; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the training accomplished as part of the Ready Aircrew Program, and (4) develop methods to measure the effectiveness of flying training. The Air Force concurs with three of these recommendations and partially concurs with one. The Air Force does not concur with a fourth recommendation.

Enclosure cc: The Honorable Mark L. Walker, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics The Honorable Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force APPENDIX A: METHODOLOGY WE USED IN PREPARING THIS REPORT In preparing this report, we reviewed the Air Force\u2019s documentation and guidance on its training program and interviewed Air Force officials at major commands and the Headquarters Air Force Training Center. We reviewed Air Force data, such as flight-by-flight mission records, personnel records, readiness assessment data, and program metrics. To determine whether the Air Force used a systematic process to develop its training requirements, we examined Air Force program guidance requiring reviews of annual training requirements for its major combat units. We also gathered information from Air Force subject matter experts on the mission areas and specific systems addressed by the Ready Aircrew Program, which included examining relevant literature, interviews of trainers and Air Force officials working in these mission areas, and observations of training and flight simulators. We also conducted surveys of personnel involved in these training efforts. To determine whether the Air Force had a structured process for assessing its training effectiveness and the extent of compliance with Air Force instructions for conducting training, we relied on our observations, interviews, and review of relevant Air Force policies and directives. In addition, we conducted a survey of trainer and students. To examine the Air Force\u2019s management of the Ready Aircrew Program, we obtained data on program participation, workload, and productivity metrics. Specifically, we analyzed data on the number of sorties and simulator missions completed quarterly and per unit per mission area during a 3-year period. We also obtained Air Force data on instructor workloads in three training squadrons. We analyzed Air Force data on aircraft availability, aircrew availability, and operational readiness. We interviewed Air Force subject matter experts and trainers, and reviewed Air Force guidance documents on operational readiness. To gain insights into the Air Force\u2019s current and future capabilities in support of its aircrew training requirements, we analyzed Air Force-wide documentation related to the Air Force\u2019s training infrastructure and reviewed Air Force program performance data obtained from the Air Force\u2019s readiness assessment website. We conducted site visits to three major commands and the Air Force\u2019s Center for Rapid Innovation. We interviewed dozens of Air Force personnel, including aircrew members and members of the Air National Guard. We also gathered information on the Air Force\u2019s future training plans from its internal strategy documents and discussed these plans with Air Force personnel. We analyzed data on the Air Force\u2019s funding decisions for training-related accounts. We obtained and analyzed Air Force data on the costs associated with training for pilot aircraft for fiscal years 2014 through 2019. We reviewed Air Force budget data for program development to determine how the Air Force\u2019s budget changes have affected training programs.

This manual covers the entire life cycle of a project, beginning with the sponsor\u2019s concept development, through construction of the facility, until its eventual divestment. In addition, the office develops financial plans, tracks project status and reporting requirements, coordinates the development of the agency\u2019s annual budget request for major facilities, and executes budget review and approval procedures. In July 2020, NSF created a new directorate-level director of major research facilities (MRF) to guide cross-disciplinary, large-scale research facility planning and development. The MRF director has lead responsibility for overseeing major facilities program development through their successful implementation. The office has primary responsibility for project management functions for all major facilities in development, including the oversight of projects\u2019 program management and budget activities, as well as the technical oversight of project managers. The Office of the Chief Information Officer provides oversight and management of NSF\u2019s project tracking system used for tracking major facilities projects and ensuring compliance with governmentwide financial management regulations and policies, and oversees financial controls and reporting for major facilities projects. The Chief Human Capital Officer provides oversight and management of NSF\u2019s workforce development, compensation and classification, employee relations, labor-management relations, and human resources-related policies and regulations for major facilities projects. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer provides oversight and management of NSF\u2019s accounting, budget and performance measurement, cost analysis, financial management, financial systems, and business process improvement. The Office of General Counsel provides oversight and management of legal work pertaining to NSF\u2019s contract and agreement negotiations and provides legal advice on legal matters relating to major facilities projects. The Office of Inspector General provides oversight and management of investigations, audits, reviews, and other oversight activities related to NSF\u2019s policies, programs, and operations including those pertaining to major facilities projects. The Office of Legislative and Public Affairs provides oversight and management of NSF\u2019s internal and external relations, congressional affairs, and media outreach, including those related to major facilities project. In addition, each sponsoring directorate has its own major facilities office or point of contact through which it communicates with the project team. These directorate-level offices or points of contact serve as the first line of support to the project team in the development and execution of major infrastructure projects. The following are highlights of the agency\u2019s major facilities programs. Major Facilities Inventory. NSF tracks the major facilities it helps to fund and manages in accordance with the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. 3 This includes maintaining an inventory of all major facilities (including those funded with federal funding) and identifying which of those facilities meet the definition of \u201cmajor multiuser research facility,\u201d as defined under the law. 4\nAccording to agency documents, in 2020, NSF had 42 facilities that fit this definition, of which 39 (93 percent) were developed and funded only by NSF. Of the major facilities meeting the definition of a \u201cmajor facility,\u201d agency data showed that 35 (85 percent) were in the construction or divestment stages. 8 As of fiscal year 2020, the agency spent $7.9 billion in facility construction funds for large-scale research facilities projects that either were completed, under construction, or scheduled to begin construction. 6 Of the major facilities built only with NSF funding, 36 (or 35 percent) of the 106 facilities completed the construction stage. Of the major facilities built with external grants, 3 (or 14 percent) of the 22 facilities completed the construction stage. (See the table for additional data points.) In addition, NSF manages or provides oversight of a limited number of large facilities that are built solely with funds from other agencies, such as NIH. The Office of Legislative and Public Affairs provided data that showed the total dollar value of these facilities: two with NIH and five with the Department of Energy (DOE). Thus, NSF estimates that its sponsored projects represent 65 of the approximately 70 large facilities (i.e., NIH and DOE). 42 42 38 40 35 35 10 12 13 14 10 20 36 35 36 35 36 36 36 36 36 106 106 106 106 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 9 8 8 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 36 39 39 39 39 39 Total 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 11 15 15 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 Average construction costs (in millions) $150.0 $132.2 $111", "PROCEED TO SUMMARY The text you provided does not mention any specific text summarization that you should proceed to summarize.

FHFA identifies and approves broker-dealers for the banks\u2019 debt issuance transactions. FHFA also implemented HERA in 2008 to address potential conflicts of interest between FHLBanks, owners of FHLBanks, and the institutions that borrow from FHLBanks. Among other things, HERA amended the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to require FHFA to develop rules regarding conflicts of interest in the governance of the FHLBanks and their owners. FHFA issued a rule in September 2016 that requires each FHLBank to certify whether it has adopted procedures to address conflicts of interest between the bank and its shareholders and to certify that if the bank has failed to adopt procedures to address conflicts that may exist, that it fully disclosed how it determined such conflicts are negligible.", "Text is being summarized.

Although NHTSA has encouraged best practices for data quality for decades, federal officials told us that in recent years they have shifted toward encouraging states to address any data collection deficiencies through a data-driven process that focuses on continuous improvement as opposed to penalties or withholding of funding. During our interviews, officials from several states mentioned that NHTSA staff have been supportive in helping states with their data systems and have provided guidance. For example, Montana\u2019s data specialist said they have an ongoing dialogue with NHTSA, with meetings between federal and state officials taking place every 3 to 4 months. State officials acknowledged that collecting, linking, and cleaning data require resources, staff, and access to technical expertise. State officials acknowledged that funding issues often result in the state having to prioritize data management activities and sometimes have limited resources available to address data needs. State officials we interviewed said that NHTSA staff should provide technical assistance for states on how to enhance existing data systems. According to Pennsylvania\u2019s Bureau Chief of Statewide Program Manager, NHTSA has been helpful in providing technical assistance and advice on how to improve their data system. Officials from Oklahoma said that NHTSA staff have been available to answer questions and have provided guidance on how to address data collection and reporting issues. Some state officials and other stakeholders we spoke with suggested that NHTSA and FHWA could provide more guidance regarding best practices on data management and more structured training workshops. According to Louisiana\u2019s State Traffic Program Administrator, NHTSA staff need more training to help states with data. For example, he said that some states may not have experience managing large data sets and may need assistance in linking data to specific locations or developing crash data analysis reports to identify safety needs. Officials from some states also suggested that NHTSA could provide more resources and flexibility regarding meeting performance measures rather than mandating the use of a data system that is not appropriate for all states. In addition, some state officials and other stakeholders said that data-based performance metrics have been controversial in some states where the data may suggest that different agencies are responsible for safety problems. In such cases, some states have reported difficulty with agency administrators who want to avoid blame and suggested that NHTSA and FHWA should engage state officials early in the process and provide more technical assistance on these issues. State officials generally reported that FHWA has been less helpful in providing technical assistance or offering guidance on how to use available data sources, although they have been generally responsive to questions and have worked to address any data gaps. State officials said that FHWA\u2019s focus has tended more toward technical assistance regarding the reporting of data, rather than analysis and use of data to focus on safety improvements. Some state officials told us that FHWA should provide more resources to states in developing comprehensive data management plans that ensure the quality of the data used in the agency\u2019s performance measures requirements. State officials also suggested that FHWA should provide more guidance on what data is required to satisfy performance measure reporting requirements to eliminate confusion and the potential for errors that may result from incomplete data. Both NHTSA and FHWA have oversight responsibilities to ensure compliance with their performance frameworks for states as set forth in statutory requirements and in their administrative policies. In their roles as grant funders, NHTSA and FHWA officials have tools to enforce compliance with grant award terms and conditions. 15 TEXT: To supplement their monitoring and reporting requirements for grantees, NHTSA and FHWA have established a data validation system to ensure that the data submitted by states in their reports and plans on traffic safety issues, including performance measures, are accurate. Under this system, FHWA and NHTSA may initiate a data verification audit if officials think the state or local government has not submitted credible data. If data or a system of data collection is found to be inadequate, FHWA and NHTSA may take corrective action that can include suspending a grantee\u2019s administrative or program funds. In 2014, NHTSA established an additional tool for assessing a state\u2019s capability to use data to achieve long-term safety performance improvements through the implementation of the National Road Safety Data Quality Guide. The guide provides states and local governments a roadmap to assess whether the data that they have in support of safety policy and programs are current, complete, accurate, and timely, and whether the data are appropriate for setting and achieving performance goals. Under NHTSA\u2019", "1. VA manages over 240 information systems and provides IT support to over 1,500 facilities. 2. VHA provides healthcare services and carries out research and development to fulfill veteran\u2019s healthcare needs. 3. VBA provides a variety of benefits to veterans and their families. 4. NCA manages burial and memorial benefits for veterans and their families. 5. In a 2014 strategic plan, VA set goals of increasing veterans' access to benefits and services, ending the claims backlog, and eliminating veteran homelessness. 6. VA created OI&T, a centralized organization that coordinates key IT functions. 7. VA's health information system called VistA enables the department to manage individual electronic health records for patients. 8. The EHRM program requires the deployment of the same Cerner electronic health record system used by DOD. 9. VBMS collects and stores information that allows VBA to determine claims and provide benefits. text to help determine where IT support should be allocated and directed, in line with the department\u2019s priorities. The office\u2019s activities are intended to ensure that IT resources are acquired, deployed, and managed more effectively across the department, with an emphasis on modernizing VA\u2019s IT processes and applications in alignment with its business processes. Over the past year, VA has focused on developing a new business process reengineering strategy that should help it to modernize many of its IT systems. In addition, the department is striving to transform its IT service model so that it can more quickly and appropriately address any emerging business and technology needs. VA is implementing its modernized and transformed IT service model by adopting a hybrid and secure cloud-enabled architecture for its IT infrastructure. The intent of this approach is to provide VA with greater flexibility and scalability, along with reduced development and maintenance costs and improved security. VA was originally designed to operate many of its IT systems in a distributed environment. However, since 2007, the office has had the responsibility to consolidate many of these systems into centralized data centers or Cloud environments, where they are intended to be managed in the most effective ways from central locations with specialized technical expertise. VA intends to centralize its IT systems and services to a greater degree than in the past. This approach should help VA identify its IT business needs and manage its resources more effectively. While VA is working to improve the way it delivers business functionality to its employees, it also recognizes the need to improve the way it approaches cyber security. In November 2014, the VA experienced a breach of PII and SPII in the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Eligibility website. The breach made headlines, and in VA\u2019s view it was an indication of a need for improvement in its cyber security. To meet this need, VA is adopting a Defense in Depth approach that involves building more robust cyber defenses for VA networks, servers, and equipment that store and transmit data across VA networks. This approach is designed to reduce the likelihood of a cyber breach damaging VA networks or data. VA considers cyber security to be a top priority that aligns with the CIO-SP4 focus area of the OI&T office. As a way to reinforce the importance attached to cyber security, VA has created the Cyber Security Directorate within its CISO office. The directorate is intended to be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of VA\u2019s cyber security policies and practices. VA\u2019s data breach event was the result of a compromised email account, and VA has been working to enhance its email and instant messaging security. For VA, email security must consider the sensitivity of the information being transmitted, the identity of those authorized to access the network, and the technology tools intended to protect those authorized users when they access email accounts. To help defend against email-based threats, VA has implemented technologies intended to provide email users with timely detection alerts and recommendations for actions. VA has also made advances in developing more robust security practices, such as using multifactor authentication, which requires that users enter a password in addition to other credentials to gain access to a specific resource. In order to address cyber security issues, as well as its business process and IT systems modernization needs, VA has been relying more heavily on other federal agencies and contractors to acquire IT support services that align with OI&T efforts. This is an emerging trend that appears to have started with the department\u2019s development and deployment of IT systems in the past 30 years. Over time, VA has awarded many IT support and service contracts to vendors, and this trend is expected to continue. VA\u2019s IT acquisition and support activities are intended to have a major impact on many private sector vendors. This is likely to be especially true for vendors that provide professional IT staffing support services, especially given IT staffing demands for EHRM program initiatives. Professional and technical IT services vendors should be able to take advantage of the business opportunities presented by the significant modernization and transformation efforts anticipated for IT systems at VHA. A major opportunity is expected to arise for those vendors that have expertise and experience in managing data consolidation and security of", "The US Navy has a special program that provides support and services to family caregivers of veterans.

In an executive retirement plan, a select group of managers or highly compensated employees defer the receipt of compensation earned in one year to be paid in a future year, generally at or after retirement. Executive retirement plans are not subject to certain statutory limits that apply to qualified retirement plans, such as limits on the annual amount of benefits received, the annual amount of contributions made to the plan, or the annual compensation level used to determine benefits and contributions. Executive retirement plans can be structured as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans but generally must defer compensation to a future year. For executive retirement plans structured as a defined contribution plan, executives\u2019 benefits are based on a plan account balance. During the deferral period, companies will typically allow executives to select from among a menu of market indices (e.g., of stock, or bond performance or of interest rates) or other investment options and base the plan account balance on the performance of those selections. The company generally credits plan contributions and changes in the value of the plan account balance to executives, but does not have to make actual investments that correspond to executives\u2019 selections because companies are not obligated to designate funds for the plan before distributions are made. For executive retirement plans structured as a defined benefit plan, executives are typically paid based on a formula that accounts for salary and years of employment. Distributions from all executive retirement plans are made from company assets. DOL\u2019s executive retirement plan filing statement includes the name and address of the employer, the employer identification number (EIN) assigned by the IRS, a declaration that the employer maintains a plan or plans primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, and a statement of the number of such plans and the number of employees in each plan.

Consumers could only purchase items that were either in stock or available for pickup within 10 miles of any of the selected ZIP code locations, the customer\u2019s address, or the retailer from which the customer selected the expedited delivery option. Merchants would ship products to one of 17 designated postal service processing locations, where USPS would deliver the products in the selected geographic area. Merchants paid a premium fee for this expedited service. Participating merchants included retailers with major brand name stores, such as Macy\u2019s, Home Depot, and Bloomingdale\u2019s. Retailer\u2019s choice of merchandise and prices were the same as those available to consumers. Merchants set the pricing for the service. Postal officials selected the 17 sites, based on the high volume of products processed daily and the number of employees stationed at these sites. USPS expected that the volume of packages processed through this pilot would average between 75,000 and 100,000 packages per day. The pilot was initially available only to businesses using USPS\u2019s online shipping software but later expanded. USPS officials emphasized that the pilot was designed to offer retailers a new customer experience. Officials acknowledged that the pilot\u2019s success would be partly attributable to the extent to which consumers perceived the service as being different.

The General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Multiple Award Schedules (MASchines) program establishes indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts for products, services, and solutions to meet the requirements of federal agencies in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These contracts are known as General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedules (GSA MAS) contracts. Under the MAS program, GSA provides a broad range of business, IT, program and mission support services that agencies may obtain through its contracts. According to the GSA MAS contract language, GSA provides the opportunity for eligible agencies to place orders, including delivery orders, under the MAS program. Additionally, eligible agencies can access GSA\u2019s online ordering tool, GSA Advantage, to purchase a wide range of products and services directly from suppliers. During the past 10 years, GSA has reported that its improper payment reporting has been complex and has varied, resulting in inconsistent reporting. For example, in fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, GSA reported improper payment estimates of $42 million, $28 million, and $21 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2018, GSA did not report a separate improper payment estimate for the MAS program. Instead, GSA reported combined improper payments for its Federal Acquisition Service and Public Buildings Service. The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood development services to about 1,000,000 children and their parents or guardians. It is designed to enhance early learning and school readiness for children in poverty, ages birth to 5 years. The program directly serves eligible children, with funding to states to meet the needs of additional children on a competitive basis. Services must be provided by programs that meet its comprehensive criteria, which include a focus on highquality, culturally competent and comprehensive early childhood education; comprehensive health services; family-centered services; community partnerships; and professional development opportunities for staff. Services continue for eligible children enrolled in a Head Start program until their 5th or 16th birthday (whichever comes first) using funding from 1 year grants. In 2019, Head Start grantees and their subgrantees served approximately 1,000,000 children and families, including 963,800 children enrolled and participating in the program in FY 2019. HHS reported an improper payment estimate of $20.3 million in its fiscal year 2018 AFR for Head Start, down 20.1% from the prior year\u2019s estimated $25.5 million. In its fiscal year 2019 AFR, HHS is in the process of estimating the amount of improper payments in the program. The National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) awards and administration of financial assistance support research across areas relevant to the foundation\u2019s mission. The National Science Board, NSF\u2019s governing body, establishes NSF\u2019s general policies, which are implemented through NSF guidance, policies and procedures regarding NSF awards and NSF\u2019s grant administration policies. NSF primarily funds research through the awarding of grants; however, it also does so through cooperative agreements, contracts, and other financial assistance mechanisms. NSF also funds equipment, construction, and renovation of research facilities. NSF conducts its research grant program through NSF awardees, NSF staff and grantee institutions. In accordance with IPIA, NSF has annually reported an improper payment estimate for its research grant program since fiscal year 2012. In its fiscal year 2018 AFR, NSF reported an improper payment estimate of $2.1 million, or less than 0.0001 percent of grant program transactions totaling $10.2 billion. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) program provides financial assistance and other aid to eligible state, tribal, local, and certain nonprofit organizations for response efforts relating to declared disasters or emergencies. Specifically, this program provides 75 percent federal funding to state, tribal, and local governmental entities to carry out emergency work and the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities. The remaining costs are borne by PA participants, primarily through additional financial assistance, insurance proceeds, or federal loan programs. Following a federally declared disaster, FEMA awards PA funds based on the identified, verified damages and incurred costs of recovery work. The amount FEMA assigns to PA projects is based on a methodology called the Standard Cost Tables, which lists cost figures for thousands of different eligible projects. The program also covers emergency protective measures, debris removal, medical expenses, and other disaster-related costs. PA is governed primarily by 44 CFR part 206, General Principles of Emergency Management Assistance, as amended. PA also requires recipients to have written agreements detailing the terms and conditions of their funding. Each year, in accordance with IPIA, FEMA estimates that it pays improper payments through the PA program. In", "The federal government relies on commercial communications networks to obtain various services, including video conferencing, local and long-distance telephone calls, email, text messages, file transfers, and more. Much of the communications infrastructure is owned or operated by commercial entities. Similarly, federal agencies rely on call centers (also known as contact centers) to handle public inquiries on government programs and services, such as Medicare. These centers utilize automated and live telephone response systems, websites, and trained customer service representatives to provide information to the public. Agencies that contract with industry to meet their telecommunications and call center needs report information about these contracts and their obligations in FPDS-NG\u2014the federal government\u2019s primary database for contract information at the prime contract level. When reporting contract data, agencies report information on the type of product or service being purchased as well as the NAICS code that best describes the principal purpose of the product or service being acquired. See table 1 for a description of the industry categories for businesses that provide telecommunications and call center goods or services. In addition to FPDS-NG, the federal government has developed other contract reporting systems to collect contracting information related to subcontracting. The Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) was created in 2005 to streamline contractors\u2019 reporting of progress toward meeting the small business subcontracting goals in their subcontracting plans and to facilitate agency oversight. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) generally requires that contractors be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan when they are awarded a contract that exceeds $700,000 and is expected to have subcontracting possibilities. Depending on the individual contract, the system may contain subcontracting information reported by both the prime contractor as well as multiple subcontractors. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) was created in 2010 to provide transparency about federal spending. Prime contractors must register and report subcontract information for first-tier subcontractors, as applicable. Information on subcontracts awarded by first-tier subcontractors to other entities, or lower-tier subcontractors, is not required. USASpending.gov was created in 2007 to promote transparency by providing the public with information about where and how federal dollars are spent. USASpending.gov contains prime contract award data from FPDS-NG and subcontract information from FSRS. Telecommunications and information technology (IT) fields have been merging in recent years due to integration of the technologies and combined operational management of their functions. Federal telecommunications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment and products, as well as services, such as managed network services and IT security services. In addition, telecommunications include such broadband internet services. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring that effective information security controls are put in place for information resources and assets that support federal operations and for ensuring the effective oversight of the security of the information. Under FISMA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for overseeing agency information security policies and practices. To implement FISMA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\u2014a component within the Department of Commerce\u2014developed standards and guidelines for agencies to use to help manage information security risks. Both FISMA and OMB require agencies to comply with applicable NIST standards and guidelines.

GSA officials indicated that they would continue to resolve these data issues. GSA is responsible for ensuring, through its delegated leasing program, that agencies pay fair and reasonable rental costs. However, since the GSA OIG\u2019s 2012 report, GAO has continued to identify problems with GSA\u2019s oversight of its delegated leasing program. Specifically, 20 of our past reviews of GSA delegated leases found that 21 percent (11 of 52) did not have sufficient documentation to support its conclusion that GSA received fair and reasonable rent. Similarly, in our past review of GSA delegated leases, GSA officials stated that 15 percent (8 of 52) of the files lacked documentation to support their conclusion that the leased space met the agency\u2019s occupancy and mission requirements. In a 2012 report, GAO stated that GSA\u2019s oversight of delegated leasing was inadequate. Specifically, GAO noted that GSA lacked complete and consistent policies and procedures for granting delegations of leasing authority to other agencies; GAO also reported that GSA didn't have appropriate controls in place to properly monitor delegated leases (GAO-12-105). Given these ongoing problems, and the $1.7 billion in delegated leasing authority used annually by GSA to lease space for federal agencies throughout each year, we requested information on GSA\u2019s current delegated leasing program. However, GSA lacked readily available data on the number and cost its delegated leasing projects. For example, based on G-REX and FMR data, its current system does not reflect the number of delegated leases, when the lease was executed, lease expiration, lease cost, or square footage. In addition, we attempted to locate current data in prior reports to GSA but couldn\u2019t find it. Therefore, in September 2016, we requested that GSA undertake an effort to identify its delegated leases to develop its own current, complete dataset. GSA provided some of the requested information on November 28, 2016, which allowed us to estimate the number and cost of its delegated leasing projects. As of June 30, 2018, GSA had delegated leasing authority to 17 agencies, for approximately 6.6 million net assignable square feet (NASF), of which almost 3 million NASF is vacant and about 3.6 million NASF is leased. In addition, GSA had granted delegated leasing authority to USDA to facilitate its rural development mission. USDA\u2019s current stock of delegated leases is approximately 1.7 million NASF [Note 1]. Figure 1 below provides information on each agency\u2019s delegated leases and their associated costs. Figure 1 \u2013 Current Information on Delegated Leasing Projects As of June 30, 2018 GAO-19-106R GSA Delegated Leasing We found that 10 of the 17 agencies had delegated leasing authority to other agencies or organizations, such as for a medical examiners\u2019 office, or for a National Guard unit. In addition, USDA\u2019s delegated leases are used for 13 specified agency programs. As of June 2018, the total number of GSA delegated leases granted to 17 agencies was 6.5 million NASF, with approximately 3.6 million NASF currently leased as of June 30, 2018. This leaves about 2.9 million NASF vacant [Note 2]. GSA provided 1 of the agencies with delegated leasing authority with a detailed inventory of all its delegated leases as of January 2018. Based solely on the information provided by that agency and without comparing its list to G-REX or FMR data, we estimated that the agency had delegated leasing authority for about 900,000 NASF to other agencies. However, the agency only responded to 31 of our 70 requests for additional information, which included 10 requests for additional data on a specific lease, and we believe that this inventory may also have omissions and errors. [Note 3] Based on our review of the data we received, we identified that the amount of delegated leasing authority granted to the other 16 agencies is 5.4 million, of which only about 77 percent of this authority is currently occupied. However, the remaining 23 percent of the authority is reported in G-REX data in a status known as \u201cdelegated lease with inactive project number\u201d because G-REX data is incomplete. Thus, we don\u2019t know if the space is occupied or not. We reviewed the details for some of these vacant delegated leases and identified some as being in the middle of their lease term.

In creating the military justice system, Congress established three types of military courts, called the summary, special, and general courts-martial, to adjudicate UCMJ violations. Each of these types of military courts respectively is intended to deal with progressively more serious offenses, and each court-martial type may adjudicate more severe maximum punishments as prescribed under the UCMJ. In addition, an accused servicemember can receive nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, by which a commander can punish a servicemember without going through the court-martial process. There are several steps in the discipline of a servicemember who allegedly commits a crime under the UCMJ, which are summarized in figure 1 below. The military justice process begins once an offense is alleged and an initial report is made, typically to law enforcement, an investigative entity, or the suspect\u2019s chain of command. The commanding officer, law enforcement, or a military criminal investigative organization (MCIO) will conduct an inquiry or investigation into the accusation and gather all reasonably available evidence. Investigations are recorded in MCIO databases when a servicemember is the subject of a criminal allegation; for the purposes of our report, we say the servicemember had a \u201crecorded investigation\u201d to describe these cases. Following an investigation, the first step toward initiation of a court-martial is when the accused is presented with a list of charges signed by the accuser under oath, which is called preferral of charges. After charges are preferred, the charges are forwarded to an officer with sufficient legal authority to convene a court-martial, also known as the \u201cconvening authority.\u201d The convening authority in receipt of preferred charges may, among other actions, refer the case to its own court or forward the case to a superior commander for disposition. Once referred to a general or special court-martial, an accused servicemember may be tried by a military judge alone or by a military judge with a military jury. In summary courts-martial, a single commissioned officer who is not a military judge adjudicates minor offenses and a sentence. Convictions at the general and special court-martial level are subject to a post-trial process and may be appealed to higher courts in cases where the sentence reaches a certain threshold. The military justice system, like the civilian criminal justice system, provides avenues for accused servicemembers to raise allegations of discrimination, improprieties in investigations, improprieties in disposition, and improprieties in the selection of the military jury at the court-martial proceeding, before a judge and on appellate review. The military services do not collect and maintain consistent information regarding race and ethnicity in their investigations, military justice, and personnel databases. Specifically, the number of potential responses for race and ethnicity within the 15 databases across the military services ranges from 5 to 32 options for race and 2 to 25 options for ethnicity, which can complicate cross-service assessments. For example, the Army\u2019s personnel database maintains 6 options for race and 23 options for ethnicity, whereas the Coast Guard\u2019s personnel database maintains 7 options for race and 3 for ethnicity. Table 1 below summarizes how the databases used by the military services vary in how the servicemember\u2019s race is entered and the number of potential race options. Table 2 shows that the military services\u2019 databases also vary in how information about servicemembers\u2019 ethnicity is entered into the databases and the number of potential ethnicity options that are collected. Although the data collected and maintained was not consistent within and across the military services, each of the military services\u2019 databases maintained race and ethnicity data for at least 99 percent of the servicemembers, with the exception of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard did not track information about race or ethnicity in its military justice database, Law Manager. Coast Guard officials stated that this is because Law Manager was designed to determine the status of court- martial cases, and captures attributes that are needed to generate relevant UCMJ documents, such as court pleadings. Demographic information such as race and ethnicity is not included in these official documents, so this information is not input into Law Manager. Further, four of the databases we reviewed\u2014including both of the Army\u2019s military justice databases, and the Navy and the Marine Corps\u2019 military justice databases\u2014collect information on race and ethnicity in a combined data field as shown in table 2 above, whereas the other databases collect and maintain race and ethnicity information in two separate fields. These inconsistencies limit the military services\u2019 ability to collectively or comparatively assess these demographic data to identify any racial or ethnic disparities in the military justice system within and across the services. Recommendations to collect and maintain", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text.", "TEXT: USPS is one of the largest civilian employers in the United States. In fiscal year 2018, USPS reported that it employed approximately 634,000 people and retirement benefits were paid to over 600,000 retirees and their survivors. According to USPS, it is one of the leading employers of minorities, women, veterans, and disabled veterans; for example, USPS reports on its website that it currently employs about 100,000 military members and veterans, nearly one-sixth of its workforce. Ninety-two percent of the USPS workforce is comprised of employees who are represented by four unions that are roughly organized along occupation type. These employees are also divided into \u201ccareer\u201d, and \u201cnon-career\u201d employees. Career employees are considered permanent and are entitled to a range of benefits and privileges. Non-career employees are generally considered temporary and hired, for example, during times of large mail volume such as holidays. As discussed later, non-career employees receive fewer benefits and lower pay than career employees. The Postal Reorganization Act established USPS as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the government of the United States. PRA also established a compensation system where career postal employees and officers generally receive the same benefits as federal government employees, but also authorizes employees to collectively bargain over pay. Pay at many federal agencies is not subject to collective bargaining. Instead, pay at those entities is set through the General Schedule, which is developed and updated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Additionally, PRA established that USPS should maintain compensation and benefits \"on a standard of comparability to the compensation and benefits paid for comparable levels of work in the private sector of the economy. \u201c Reform bills have been introduced in Congress that would amend some of the current compensation requirements, but none have passed. USPS costs are concentrated in employee compensation, which accounted for approximately 72 percent of total operational costs in fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 1). The majority of compensation costs are payments to current employees, which include an employee\u2019s hourly pay and benefits such as contributions to retirement and healthcare plans and USPS\u2019s share of payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. USPS contributions for retirement benefits are made to OPM administered funds that pay out USPS retiree pension and health benefits, and also to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). USPS negotiates contracts that include terms for the compensation of the 92 percent of employees represented by unions. USPS and its unions may enter into an adversarial collective bargaining process. If USPS and its unions cannot reach agreement during initial negotiations, a federal mediator is appointed. If no agreement is reached with the mediator, or if the parties waive mediation, the contract goes to impasse. An impasse then proceeds to a final and binding arbitration process. In interest arbitration, the dispute goes before a three-member panel, which determines factors impacting compensation, such as pay increases. The total cost of compensation for current USPS employees was about $9 billion less in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2009, when adjusted for inflation. However, most costs decreased between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2014, and costs have generally risen since. Without adjusting for inflation, USPS compensation costs for current employees are still lower\u2014 by almost $1 billion\u2014when compared to 2009, but costs have been rising since 2014, and USPS has reported an anticipated total compensation cost increase for fiscal year 2019.", "The text discusses a summary of how and for what purposes NNSA uses subject matter experts.

TEXT: The CSBG program is intended to focus on three overall (national) goals: reducing poverty, empowering low-income families and individuals to become self-sufficient, and revitalizing low-income communities. The program is administered by OCS within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS. CSBG was an outgrowth of the War on Poverty of the 1960s and 1970s, which established the Community Action program under which the nationwide network of local community action agencies was developed. The federal government had direct oversight of local agencies until 1981, when the CSBG program was established and states were designated as the grant recipients. OCS and states now share responsibility for oversight of CSBG grantees. In fiscal year 2019, states received approximately $700 million of the total $725 million CSBG appropriation. Appendix II provides the funding amounts for each state. OCS distributes CSBG funding to states and they, in turn, distribute funds to over 1,000 local agencies. Most of these local agencies receive funding from a variety of federal, state, and private sources. In fiscal year 2017, the latest data available, local agencies received about $9 billion from all federal sources, including about $700 million from CSBG. Other federal programs providing funding include Head Start, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the Child Care and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant (see fig. 1). Programs administered by ACF contributed about $6.6 billion of the funds provided to local agencies. CSBG funding can be used broadly, allowing state and local agencies flexibility to provide services tailored to organizational and community needs. CSBG funds can be used by local agencies to provide services to participants in their programs and fill gaps in the funding provided by other means. For example, local agencies may use CSBG funds to support a position for a staff member who determines the service needs of potential participants and connects them with the appropriate services\u2014a position that would not be an allowable expense under the funding rules of other federal programs, according to a local agency official we interviewed. Local agencies have also used CSBG funding to leverage other public and private resources to support a variety of initiatives, such as Head Start programs, low-income energy assistance programs, and low-income housing. OCS monitors all states receiving grant funds to ensure that they are meeting the standards for federal grant programs set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the specific expenditure requirements for the program. The CSBG Act requires that states submit plans to OCS describing how they intend to use the funds to address the needs of the local community and annual reports detailing the actual use of funds, including information on state performance results and populations served. OCS is required by the CSBG Act to conduct compliance evaluations of several states each fiscal year to review the states\u2019 use of CSBG funds, report to states on the results of these evaluations, and make recommendations for improvements. However, the CSBG Act does not specify the number of states subjected to an evaluation each year or the timeframe each state must undergo such evaluations. Following a compliance evaluation, states are required to submit a plan of action in response to any OCS recommendations. In addition to conducting compliance evaluations to assess states\u2019 use of CSBG funds, OCS is required to submit an annual report to Congress. This annual report must include a summary of how states and local agencies had planned to use CSBG funds; how funds were actually spent, data on the number and demographics of those served by local agencies, and other information. The CSBG Act requires OCS to provide training and technical assistance to states and to assist them in carrying out corrective action activities and monitoring. OCS must reserve 1.5 percent of annual appropriations (in fiscal year 2019, this percentage totaled about $11 million of the total appropriation) for many activities, including training and technical assistance; planning, evaluation, and performance management; assisting states with carrying out corrective action activities; and oversight including reporting and data collection activities. The CSBG Act also requires that states complete several steps before terminating an underperforming entity. The state agency is required, among other things, to provide training and technical assistance, if appropriate, to help the agency correct identified deficiencies, review the local agency\u2019s quality improvement plan, and provide an opportunity for a hearing. The entity can request a federal review of the state\u2019s decision to reduce or terminate funding, which must be completed within 90 days of OCS\u2019s receipt. During this period, the state is required to continue funding the entity until OCS responds to the request.\nSummary:\nThe CSBG program is intended to focus on three overall (national) goals: reducing poverty, empowering low-income families and individuals to", "Hospice care helps patients and their families maintain their quality of life, using pain medication such as oxycodone.

This status allows qualifying organizations to claim exemption from federal income taxes. Subsection (c) of section 501 recognizes 28 categories of tax- exempt organizations, ranging from burial companies to multiemployer pension plan trusts. Section 501(c)(3), the section that recognizes charitable organizations, applied to approximately 1.3 million organizations in fiscal year 2017. These groups represent the largest number of 501(c) organizations. Federal tax law permits individual taxpayers and organizations to reduce their tax liability by deducting contributions to charitable organizations on their income tax returns. Individual taxpayers may deduct the amount of a contribution to charitable organizations from their gross income if they itemize their deductions. Charitable organizations provide many types of assistance, such as services for the aging or food and shelter for those in need. Taxpayers may support these activities by making contributions in the form of financial donations or in-kind gifts to qualified organizations. Federal law allows taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions from their adjusted gross income (AGI). This policy has been in place since 1917. An individual taxpayer may deduct up to 60 percent of his or her AGI for cash contributions, with 20 percent to 30 percent limits applying in some cases. A corporation may claim a limited deduction for charitable contributions made in cash or other property up to 10 percent of its taxable income for the year. An entity seeking tax-exempt status under 501(c)(3) from IRS must submit either a completed Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, along with organizing documents, or a completed Form 1023-EZ. Both Form 1023 and Form 1023-EZ require the entity seeking recognition of its tax-exempt status to provide information regarding its charitable purpose, as well as certain financial data. IRS employees then review the forms to determine the entity\u2019s eligibility for tax-exempt status. Most tax-exempt charitable entities are required to file an annual information return from the Form 990 series. Certain small entities with gross receipts that are normally $50,000 or less may file Form 990-N Electronic Notice providing abbreviated information. Although the entity is filing its information return as a tax-exempt organization, the entity must pay employment taxes and taxes on unrelated business income, if applicable. IRS provides programs and products to help the entity understand specific issues related to its tax responsibilities. IRS personnel can audit an organization\u2019s or individual\u2019s submitted tax returns and financial information to verify that the reported tax is correct. IRS personnel audited 933,785 individual income tax returns in fiscal year 2017, according to IRS data. This was 0.6 percent of individual returns filed in calendar year 2016. From fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2017, the largest number of individual returns IRS audited was 1,564,690 in fiscal year 2010. There was a decrease in audits of individual tax returns after fiscal year 2011, which occurred about the same time that IRS\u2019s budget declined by about $2.1 billion (15.7 percent) from fiscal years 2011 through 2018, after adjusting for inflation. Concurrent with IRS\u2019s declining resources were increasing responsibilities, such as implementing aspects of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We reported in 2014 that budget cuts had resulted in a significant staffing decline and uneven performance at IRS. In March 2019, we reported that IRS was in the early stages of defining and addressing its workforce needs, but IRS officials stated that there was room for improvement in implementing its workforce plans, and that it was working on a corrective action plan that would address deficiencies noted in our report. The operating divisions that deal most often with abusive tax schemes or tax-exempt entities are TE/GE, SB/SE, and LB&I. These divisions interact with taxpayers and entities that file tax returns. In particular, each of the three divisions may audit taxpayers or entities to determine whether information filed was reported accurately. IRS has set one of its cross-divisional objectives as identifying \u201cnew types of tax transactions or promotions that are either abusive or potentially abusive requiring different levels of coordination and varying strategies.\u201d Another of TE/GE\u2019s audit objectives is to \u201cpromote the highest degree of voluntary compliance with the statutes governing qualification of plans and exemption of certain types of organizations from tax and to determine the extent of compliance and the causes of noncompliance with the tax laws by plans and organizations.\u201d TE/GE accomplishes this objective by auditing charitable organizations\u2019 compliance with the tax code through its Exempt Organizations unit.", "ONDCP\nhave issued fiscal year 2019 guidance by July 1, 2017.

Prior to 2006 and after 2009 before the enactment of the SUPPORT Act, the statutory language did not explicitly require ONDCP to issue annual guidance to departments and agencies. Although ONDCP issued guidance for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 under the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006, ONDCP did not issue guidance for fiscal year 2009 under the incoming administration, 2017, and 2018 by the date specified in law.

This image map has a graphic that must be displayed inline and doesn't display if embedded in PDF.] Source: GAO analysis of Office of National Drug Control Policy data. Beginning in fiscal year 2006, ONDCP implemented a drug control budget certification process in which it certified budgets of the agencies responsible for administering components of the National Drug Control Program, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS). The ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 required ONDCP to certify the drug control budgets of the federal agencies that administer components of the National Drug Control Program. The Director of ONDCP is to ensure that these certifications are completed for the National Drug Control Strategy every two fiscal years. The SUPPORT Act expanded on this process, requiring ONDCP to review and approve, or certify, drug control budgets once each calendar year for each of the 18 federal agencies with drug control responsibilities. The Director is also required to notify Congress of changes to the certifications. ONDCP is responsible for evaluating and certifying budget information relating to the budgets of all 18 agencies\u2014and it is doing so for 2017, 2018, and 2019. ONDCP did not certify individual drug control budgets for DOJ, HHS, or any other drug control agencies with responsibility under the National Drug Control Program for the fiscal years of 2017, 2018, and 2019. We recommended that the Secretary of HHS establish appropriate controls to ensure that HHS drug control agencies comply with ONDCP\u2019s certification requirements for HHS drug control budgets.

SSSA\u2019s organizational payees include social service agencies, mental institutions (federal, state or local, non-profit, private), non-mental institutions (federal, state or local, non-profit, private), financial organizations, and entities represented by public officials (such as public guardians, officers of the court, and other similar positions). For certain oversight purposes, such as periodic reviews, SSA categorizes organizational payees into several groups, including: (1) fee- for-service organizations, which charge beneficiaries a monthly fee for expenses incurred in providing services; (2) organizations that serve 50 or more beneficiaries and do not charge a fee for their services, referred to in this report as \u201chigh-volume\u201d; (3) organizations that serve fewer than 50 beneficiaries and do not charge a fee for their services, referred to in this report as \u201clow-volume\u201d, and (4) state mental institutions participating in the State Onsite review program. SSA data from fiscal year 2018 indicate that the vast majority (86 percent) of organizational payees are low-volume payees, which serve 34 percent of beneficiaries. Organizational payees decide how to spend beneficiaries\u2019 funds, but must do so for the beneficiary\u2019s use and benefit in a manner the payee determines to be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest. SSA considers it acceptable if the funds are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance, which includes the costs of food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. After the representative payee has used the funds consistent with these guidelines, any remaining amounts must be conserved or invested on behalf of the beneficiary. Organizational payees are responsible for keeping records of SSA payments made to them on behalf of each beneficiary and the expenditures for each beneficiary. All organizational payees participate in onsite reviews and\u2014except for state mental institutions participating in State Onsite reviews\u2014are also required to file an annual accounting form to show how benefit payments were used and any amounts that were saved. Organizational payees also are required to notify SSA of certain changes or situations, including: changes that may affect the beneficiary\u2019seligibility for benefits or the benefit amounts, such as when the beneficiary, or the beneficiary\u2019s spouse, dies; and when the beneficiary moves or is unable to be contacted or located, starts or stops working, or no longer needs a payee; when organizational payees learn that one or more of their employees has stolen a beneficiary\u2019s funds or determines they can no longer serve as the payee for any reason; and when payees establish an account that mingles funds from multiple beneficiaries in one account\u2014referred to as collective accounts\u2014 because these accounts must be approved before use. The process for administering the representative payee program is guided largely by requirements in statute and SSA regulations, which SSA communicates through its Program Operations Manual System (POMS). Recent changes to the program \u2014 including the new onsite review process \u2014 reflect requirements established by the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018. For example, the Commissioner of SSA must now: (1) reassess representative payee selection and replacement policies, (2) award annual grants (totaling at least $25 million nationwide) to each state\u2019s protection and advocacy system to conduct onsite reviews of representative payees, and (3) award annual grants to a national association that can provide state protection and advocacy systems with training, technical assistance, and administrative oversight. In addition, the Act requires SSA to present the results of reviews\u2014including information on representative payees\u2019 misuse of benefits\u2014in an annual report to Congress. SSA administers and manages the representative payee program through three dedicated data systems: The Electronic Representative Payee System (eRPS) is the system used to process payee applications; record poor payee performance; process changes (such as new addresses); and document misuse allegations, significant information about the payee, and why applications were approved or denied. The Electronic Representative Payee Accounting (eRPA) system is used to capture and review annual accounting forms that all organizational payees except state mental institutions participating in SSA\u2019s State Onsite review program, are required to submit for each beneficiary they represent. Field office staff also use this system to track progress in resolving problems identified during reviews of the form, such as representative payees failing to submit complete information.

Of these, roughly 3,300 airports are designated by FAA as part of the national airport system and are therefore eligible for federal assistance for airport capital projects. The text explains that federal law divides commercial service airports into various categories of airports, based on the number of passenger boardings. Consistent with our prior work, it also details the types of eligible projects, which include runways, lighting, navigational aids and land acquisition. The text emphasizes that airports must provide matching funds. Overall, there are a variety of funding sources for airport infrastructure projects.", "The development of the JMS Inc 2 program has been plagued with technical and management issues resulting in increased cost and delay. In December 2017, we found that while significant testing was under way when the program was shut down, it was uncertain whether and how well JMS Inc 2 as it was developed would work as intended. Further, Air Force officials could not rule out whether there would be further delays or additional funding needed to complete development and field the improved capability. The Air Force decided to suspend development after assessing whether they would be able to complete the program based on the remaining resources. However, the Air Force and DOD leadership did not receive independent testing results nor consider alternative courses of action prior to making their decision. As a result, DOD will no longer receive improved space situational awareness, reduced staff requirements, and improved capability, in a program that was originally planned to cost $1.1 billion and be operational in 2014. We maintain that the decision was premature and not properly informed. We recognize that the Air Force is continuing to work with DOD leadership to determine a path forward; however, we do not have sufficient information to determine whether the Air Force\u2019s ongoing efforts can resolve the technical and management difficulties or whether DOD will be able to achieve expected capabilities. The Department\u2019s space program managers have reported that their programs have benefitted from a more coherent approach to acquisitions under the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USDA). In November 2017, we reported on how the department is making progress on some aspects of space acquisitions\u2014for example, on implementing performance-based incentives in contracts, improving software development, and better defining requirements. As in past reports, however, we have found that DOD still faces significant challenges to its space program management: a disjointed organization; lack of strategic planning for key programs and systems of systems; inconsistent discipline in determining how much to invest before and during acquisition; problems with software and system integration; insufficient oversight of contractors; and management and workforce challenges at facilities where satellites are developed, deployed, operated and maintained. We are continuing to update the performance of seven ongoing space acquisition programs, focusing on addressing each program\u2019s top challenges. Of these programs, we reported last year that GPS III had cost growth of 26 percent, 5 years of schedule slippage, and performance problems that could cause a launch delay (although the problems have now been resolved but will require additional testing). Similarly, we reported last year that the Wideband GlobalSatcom system was experiencing significant schedule growth of 2 years, schedule risk due to an overly ambitious development schedule, and performance problems; we continue to examine whether actions taken since last year mitigated these risks. In addition, we reported that the Joint Polar Satellite System continued to experience substantial cost growth and schedule delays with a program office that experienced significant turbulence in terms of key positions and program direction. We are continuing to review DOD\u2019s actions taken since last year to stabilize program planning and management. Another program, Advanced Extremely High Frequency, experienced substantial cost growth of 117 percent in its overall program cost. The program\u2019s satellites were launched late and with less capability than originally planned. We continue to review how the program has recovered and met post-launch objectives, as well as its efforts to make additional investments in technical risk reduction and ground segment development that DOD has deferred. Finally, we are examining how the program has made adjustments since the last report to ensure software is meeting performance expectations and how the organization has addressed hardware and environmental risks for the second satellite. Last year, the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee directed us to provide updates on our on-going work concerning space program management and oversight at NASA, and provided us with funding to carry out this work. Among a variety of questions which we explored, our inquiry included work related to the management risks and cost growth on the Space Launch System rocket program, which we reported to Congress in February 2018. We are monitoring how DOD is addressing our recommendations in order to sustain and build upon its progress of the past several years. It is vital that DOD move forward with new initiatives to address many of space\u2019s most pressing challenges so as to maintain space superiority against emerging adversaries. It is especially important that DOD address the systemic problems that have made it difficult for the Air Force to improve its space capabilities over the last few decades, and to address the problems that have slowed progress on key Air Force space programs in the past. The Air Force has made significant progress in addressing these problems, but it has much more to do to modernize its space force and to operate it efficiently. Recommendations We made 37 recommendations in four reports involving the Department of Defense space programs. As of November 2018, DOD concurred with 28 of the 37 recommendations, partially concurred with 5 of them, and did not concur with 4 of them. DOD indicated it will take actions to fully address the recommendations by late", "Medicaid is a joint federal \u2013 state health care program that provides health care coverage to low-income and medically needy individuals. Each state\u2019s Medicaid program, by law, must cover certain categories of individuals and provide a broad array of benefits. The federal government requires coverage for certain mandatory services under Medicaid, but states may decide to include other optional services as well. Prescription drugs are an optional service under Medicaid, but all 50 states and the District of Columbia provide coverage for prescription drugs. State Medicaid agencies may directly pay for health care services or have direct payment responsibility to MCOs with a fee-for-service system. MAT with buprenorphine, buprenorphine- naloxone, and naltrexone is clinically appropriate treatment for opioid use disorder. State Medicaid agencies have discretion to manage the cost of prescription drugs through various methods such as preferred drug lists. TEXT: the Medicaid program. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) establishes minimum requirements for the maintenance of state Medicaid programs; but states are encouraged to seek innovation waivers to experiment with new approaches to the delivery of health care services. Some states have used 1332 innovation demonstration waivers to explore the expansion of telehealth and telemedicine services for the delivery of MAT for OUD. These waivers provide states with an opportunity to demonstrate the potential of innovative policies or program expansions to make their Medicaid programs more responsive to beneficiary needs, increase quality of care, and promote affordability. SAMHSA and other federal agencies have created resources to support state program efforts to increase awareness of MAT for OUD. For example, SAMHSA\u2019s Opioid Overdose Toolkit ( http://samhsa.hrsa.gov/programs/opioidoverdose) contains information and resources for health professionals, first responders and other stakeholders on: 1. The use of naloxone (an antidote to opioid overdose) for prevention and first response; 2. The use of prescription opioids such as buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone in combination with monitoring and counseling for treatment; 3. The use of other resources and treatment approaches such as medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and behavioral therapy; and 4. Key principles of treatment (e.g., avoiding early discharge from treatment). SAMHSA has also provided technical assistance to state Medicaid programs in implementing Medicaid coverage for MAT for OUD. This assistance includes, for example, offering consultation services to assist states in drafting MAT-related policies and procedures, developing training material and curricula for treatment providers, and sharing information on best practices related to the treatment of OUD. Prescription Drugs Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) negotiate drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of plans and state Medicaid agencies. PBMs maintain a national formulary of preferred drugs; and states may select from this list or may work through SAMHSA with its contracted PBM to add formulary medications that may be important to certain patients with specific medical conditions or drug allergies. PBMs may also provide states with other medication management services important to Medicaid beneficiaries, such as medication therapy management (MTM) services or medication adherence programs. Some states use specialty drug tiering for prescription drugs. For example, a specialty tier or a carve-out may be used to administer a specific, expensive prescription drug, such as an anti-cancer medication, only to a select subset of beneficiaries. PBMs typically contract directly with pharmacies and handle claims processing and reimbursement to the pharmacies on behalf of state Medicaid programs and MCOs. Most prescription drugs are purchased through the wholesale or retail drug distribution system, which includes retail chain, mail-order, and specialty pharmacies. Some states and MCOs limit beneficiaries\u2019 preferred access to pharmacists who have contracted with the PBM..\nFor more on your assignment, please visit the link below:", "1. Our previous work on board diversity described some of the different roles and responsibilities of corporate and FHLBank boards and their directors. 2. Generally, a public company\u2019s board of directors is responsible for managing the business and affairs of the corporation, including representing shareholders and protecting their interests. 3. Our previous reports on board diversity include a recent report on the FHLBank System. 4. Each of its 11 federally chartered banks has a board of directors and is cooperatively owned by its member institutions, including commercial and community banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies. 5. Each bank\u2019s board of directors is made up of directors from member institutions and independent directors (who cannot be affiliated with the bank\u2019s member institutions or recipients of loans). 6. As of October 2018, each FHLBank board had 14-24 directors. 7. Research we reviewed for our prior work cited several benefits associated with board diversity. 8. Prior work on both reports found the number of women on corporate boards and the number of women and minorities on FHLBank boards lagged behind men and whites, respectively. There were, however, increases in representation for women and minorities. 9. Our research highlighted three factors that were generally limiting greater board diversity: not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts, limitations of the traditional board candidate pipeline, and low turnover of board seats. 10. Our reports on corporate and FHLBank board diversity cited the frequent use of personal networks for identifying potential board candidates, with most current board members being men or whites. 11. Stakeholders, board members, and others we interviewed said that prioritization of diversity and expansion of the candidate pool are necessary to enhance board diversity and improve corporate governance. 12. Our prior research showed some improvements in diversity over the past 20 years, but noted that at the current rate it could take decades to achieve balance. 13. Stakeholders interviewed by us for our reports on board diversity told us that prioritizing diversity can result in more effective boards, better outcomes for corporations, and improved performance. 14. In our 2019 report on FHLBank board diversity, stakeholders provided suggestions including expanding the candidate pool, increasing board member tenure, and developing a plan to achieve board diversity.", "DHS Should Strengthen TPS Designation Process 3 country had been redesignated an additional five times. TPS designations can be authorized for a variety of periods\u20146, 12, and 18 months.[1] Our analysis found that in those TPS cases where DHS could select the initial designation period, the Department chose 12 months the most frequently. In 25 of the 29 cases where 12 months was chosen as the initial designation period, DHS designated countries for 12 months four or more times. We also reviewed TPS notices published in the Federal Register that specified the reasons DHS designated a particular country and, when applicable, later extended or redesignated the TPS designation. We grouped the reasons for the initial TPS designation or subsequent extensions/redesignations into broad themes, as shown in table 2. Table 2. Reasons Cited by DHS for TPS Designation Periods (since TPS was established in 1990) Periods Themes Reason(s) No. of No. of No. (%) Periods Designations/Extensions 12 months Environmental Natural disaster, 18 9 (47.4) disaster 12 months End of armed conflict, 1 15 (66.7) armed conflict 18 months End of armed conflict, 7 8 (36.4) armed conflict 12 months Armed conflict, 11 10 (45.5) armed conflict * End of natural disaster/armed conflict, 1 3 (75.0) natural disaster armed conflict No period specified 4 10 (24.4) No period specified * In the case of Kosovo in 1999, the initial notice granted TPS for 12 months with no specific reason, but subsequent notices for 12 months specified \"End of armed conflict\" as the basis. * End of natural disaster/armed conflict, includes Somalia as an example. The INA provides that designations for TPS can be made in response to \u201cextraordinary and temporary conditions\u201d as specified in the statute, but also explicitly allows for designation periods of 6, 12, and 18 months on the basis of \u201congoing armed conflict or the aftermath of an environmental disaster.\u201d The statute does not further define what makes a condition \u201cextraordinary and temporary\u201d nor does it provide guidance regarding whether to designate a country for a specific period, rather than a blanket 18-month period. To understand how DHS decides on the appropriate time period for a TPS country designation, we interviewed senior officials from the Department about the deliberation process, including factors that contribute to length of TPS designations and the use of a fixed 18-month designation period. Figure 2 illustrates the key stages of the TPS deliberation process. Table 3 shows when each country\u2019s TPS designation was initiated, the length of its subsequent TPS designations, and the number of redesignations. Designations of 12 months were made more frequently than designations of 18 and 6 months.

Notes: 1 Number of comments received in 14 divided by 13 equals 1.071. * All stages in bold occur concurrently. TPS Designation Stages DHS officials told us that when deciding whether to grant temporary status to a country, they first consider events, conditions, or circumstances that are extraordinary and temporary. This can include a recommendation from DHS or a component within the Department; a recommendation from the Department\u2019s Intelligence and Analysis office; or a recommendation from other federal agencies such as the Department of Defense or the U.S. Agency for International Development. In addition, a request from a foreign government through its embassy to the Department can trigger TPS consideration. For example, in August 2019, the U.N. Security Council requested the Secretary of Homeland Security consider designating Yemen for TPS. Department officials told us that the Secretary considered Yemen\u2019s request along with the other factors listed previously. Once a decision to designate a country is made, USCIS sends an electronic referral to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to initiate legal analysis. According to DHS officials, the Department usually conducts this analysis on the same day the referral is sent by USCIS. DHS and OGC officials have a teleconference within Departmental Legal Division (which is responsible for managing this analysis). Department officials told us that this teleconference occurs to discuss what information is available, what recommendations are needed, who else in the Department needs to be consulted, and what should", "YOU ARE A GREAT THINKER AND THESE LINES COVER 5 IMPORTANT ISSUES.

Specifically, DOD has not issued its organizational strategy, has not issued guidance for cross-functional teams, and has not provided training to cross-functional team members and their supervisors, but has provided training for a recent cross-functional team. TEXT: FIGURE 1: DOD\u2019s cross-functional teams are focused on several topic areas covered by section 911 requirements. DOD plans that teams will eventually be active in the eight topic areas shown. Note: * = Teams that have reported progress according to the required reports for cross-functional teams established under section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Source: DOD. DOD officials provided 3 days of training to a small cross-functional team of 22 officials from DOD\u2019s Office of Force Readiness and the Air National Guard to examine innovative approaches for improving readiness of air base maintenance equipment, which is in poor condition. The officials told us that even under these circumstances, they benefited from the training and identified solutions to improve readiness of their equipment that they anticipate will have a wider application. The same training that was effective for this small team also is expected to be effective and potentially should be implemented more broadly throughout the department. This could be difficult or impossible for DOD officials to achieve without additional guidance and training on the section 911 requirements and cross-functional teams. 4. Issue two progress reports: In its report to us in February 2018, OCMO officials provided information on progress of each cross-functional team that had reported progress based on DOD\u2019s initial reports to Congress. However, in DOD\u2019s latest report to Congress in December 2018, OCMO officials failed to provide status of implementation or progress by any cross-functiona l teams with the exception of the one on maintenance readiness. The report provides some information regarding progress on that team, but it does not describe actions taken and does not include the status of all eight required progress reports. It is important for Congress to fully understand the progress of each cross-functional team in order to address any potential deficiencies or opportunities for improvement. 5. Develop a process for identifying opportunities for additional cross-functional teams: DOD has not developed a process for identifying additional cross-functional teams, which is required by section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. One OCMO official said that they expect to conduct a DOD-wide needs assessment process in the second half of calendar year 2019. The assessment is to be led by the Chief Information Officer, which is appropriate given that section 911 refers to \u201cinformation technology\u201d and \u201cinformation management as one of its cross-cutting themes, which we identified in our February 2018 report. The process aims to establish the feasibility of creating a cross-functional team for each subject matter area, and once implemented, the process is to be conducted annually to capture new opportunities. This is an important step toward maximizing the effectiveness of cross-functional teams in further transforming the department, but it remains to be implemented. OCMO has not conducted this assessment process despite our repeated recommendations that it begin planning how it intends to prioritize the development of cross-functional teams and conduct the needs assessment. The Secretary of Defense did not address the issue in his implementation guidance to the department in October 2017, and OCMO officials have not informed us of any plans to do so. As a result, opportunities to gain value from cross-functional teams may be missed in the future.\nDod hasn't fully addressed all required elements for organizational strategy and cross-functional teams, but they have taken some leading practices for effective collaboration.", "Summarize the following text. TEXT: The DATA Act was enacted May 9, 2014, for purposes that include expanding on previous federal transparency legislation by requiring the disclosure of federal agency expenditures and linking agency spending data to federal program activities, so that both policymakers and the public can more effectively track federal spending. The act also holds agencies accountable for submitting complete and accurate data to Treasury and requires that agency-reported award and financial data comply with OMB and Treasury data standards. The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish government-wide data standards that to the extent reasonable and practicable provide consistent, reliable, and searchable spending data for any federal funds made available to or expended by federal agencies. These standards specify the data elements to be reported under the DATA Act and define and describe what is to be included in each data element, with the aim of ensuring that data will be consistent and comparable. The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to ensure that the standards are applied to the data made available on USAspending.gov and also requires agencies\u2019 OIGs and GAO to review these data and report on their completeness, timeliness, accuracy, and quality. USAspending.gov has many sources of data, including data that agencies submitted to Treasury through their financial management systems and other data extracted from government-wide award systems that collect data from federal agencies and external award recipients. Treasury\u2019s DATA Act Broker (Broker) is a key component of the data collection and reporting framework. The Broker enables agencies to upload, validate, and certify financial data and create linkages between the financial and award data for publication on the USAspending.gov website. Agencies are expected to submit three data files with specific details and data elements to the Broker from their financial management systems in accordance with Treasury guidance documents. File A: Appropriations account includes summary data such as the fiscal year cumulative federal appropriations account balances and includes data elements such as the agency identifier, main account code, budget authority appropriated amount, gross outlay amount, and unobligated balance. File B: Object class and program activity includes summary data such as the names of specific activities or projects as listed in the program and financing schedules of the annual budget of the U.S. government. File C: Award financial includes award transaction data such as the obligation amounts for each federal financial award made or modified during the reporting quarter (e.g., January 1, 2017, through March 31, 2017). The Broker also extracts data from four government-wide award reporting systems: the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG), System for Award Management (SAM), Financial Assistance Broker Submission (FABS), and the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). These systems supply award and sub-award data (e.g., federal grants, loans, and contracts) to USAspending.gov. The systems compile data that agencies and external federal award recipients submit to report procurement and financial assistance award data required under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA). The four files produced with data that the Broker extracts from the four systems are as follows: File D1: Procurement includes data on the attributes of the award and the awardee and the recipient of the award (extracted from FPDS-NG on a daily basis) for procurement awards (contracts), if any, and contains elements such as the total dollars obligated, current total value of award, potential total value of award, period of performance start date, and other data to identify the procurement award. File D2: Financial assistance includes award and awardee attribute data (extracted from FABS nightly) on financial assistance awards (grants and loans) and contains data elements such as the federal award identification number, the total funding amount, the amount of principal to be repaid for the direct loan or loan guarantee, the funding agency name, and other data to identify the financial assistance award. File E: Additional awardee attributes includes additional data (extracted from SAM) on the award recipients and contains elements such as the awardee or recipient unique identifier; the awardee or recipient legal entity name; and data on the award recipient\u2019s five most highly compensated officers, managing partners, or other employees in management positions. File F: Subaward attributes includes data (extracted from FSRS) on awards made to subrecipients under a prime award, if any, and contains elements such as the subaward number, the subcontract award amount, total funding amount, the award description, and other data to facilitate the tracking of subawards.", "Alaska\u2019s location makes the United States an Arctic nation. Its coastline length is over 6,000 miles, and is bordered by Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas. The U.S. Arctic coastal regions are home to about 26,000 people, including the cities of Nome and Utqiagvik. Over the past decades, warming has made trans-Arctic shipping possible due to a shorter window with sea ice availability. The U.S. Arctic also contains natural resources worth about $1 trillion. The U.S. Arctic is a frontier economy and a region with significant maritime transportation gaps since traditional transportation elements, such as road and rail, are not present. Federal agencies that share responsibilities are listed. Alaska Native organizations and Arctic Waterways Safety committeee are involved. organizations, which represent the 13 federally recognized tribes in the state and the region. Other stakeholders include environmental organizations such as the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, and scientific research facilities, including the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy and the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy. Other stakeholders include private and nonprofit mariners who operate in the U.S. Arctic, and the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, which is comprised of eight Arctic countries. The U.S. has a federal responsibility to support marine transportation in the U.S. Arctic, including Arctic research and ocean governance, to ensure that maritime commerce runs safely and efficiently. This responsibility relates to three sets of issues. The first issue is U.S. Arctic communities\u2019 ability to ensure the safety of local transportation and resources. The second issue is the U.S. Arctic\u2019s capacity to respond to environmental emergencies with existing infrastructure and equipment. The third issue is fostering international partnerships to address Arctic challenges such as search and rescue and oil pollution spill response and ensuring the availability of charting and navigational data. THE U.S. ARCTIC IS A FRONTIER ECONOMY AND A REGION WITH SIGNIFICANT MARITIME TRANSPORTATION GAPS SINCE TRADITIONAL TRANSPORTATION ELEMENTS, SUCH AS ROAD AND RAIL, ARE NOT PRESENT The U.S. Arctic is a frontier economy characterized by small and relatively remote settlements, and a lack of traditional transportation elements, such as railways, highways and airports. Shipping constitutes the principal mode for commercial transportation of goods and products across large distances. The Arctic 2019 Report noted that Arctic ice shrank to a record minimum in September 2019, tied for the second smallest coverage area in a 40-year series of satellite observations. The report went on to note that this was an extreme event, and is reflective of the trend of declining Arctic sea ice over the past decades. (Image Credit: NASA/GSFC/Jefferson Beck, Space Sciences and Instrumentation, based on AVHRR data, and courtesy MOCPI.). (Image Credit: NASA) The absence of transport infrastructure in many parts of the US Arctic means that all transportation is carried out by sea, air, or by foot. This transportation system connects local communities to larger regional centers, and also delivers goods and products in and out of the US Arctic. Shipping also supports important coastal industries such as tourism, fisheries, oil and gas extraction, and transportation of freight. Thus, shipping is central to the U.S. Arctic\u2019s economy and is a fundamental component to ensure it remains vibrant. MAINTAINING TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BY PRESERVING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT For small communities, transportation is critical to safety and the daily lives of US Arctic residents. Safety incidents on the water in the US Arctic are relatively low, but the consequences can be severe, as response times are longer than in more populated areas. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, from 2001 to 2016, in the United States there were 39 passenger and commercial vessel accidents in the Arctic, killing 38 persons and causing $28 million in property damage. Accidents resulted in passenger vessel fires, capsizing, flooding, engine failure, and hull breach, and occurred at night, in ice, and in high winds. These incidents involved a variety of vessels, including tugs, barges, passenger vessels, fish tender vessels, and towboats. Alaska accounts for most Arctic incidents. As Arctic tourism and other opportunities increase, there is room for more and more traffic in the U.S. Arctic. A major incident on a passenger vessel carrying 100 or more passengers and crew could cause significant harm to the community involved and potentially to the region as a whole. To limit transport-related harm, the region needs strong, reliable shipping and related safety equipment. To protect the maritime transportation hub of Nome, NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard are considering the feasibility of deploying an Automated Information System (AIS) tower in the vicinity of Nome for use in search and rescue response. NOAA", "This text concerns the DRC, a country with an estimated population of more than 85 million people, an area of roughly one-quarter the size of the United States, and a history of political upheaval. In recent years, the country has experienced armed conflict, widespread human rights violations, and a mineral-rich economy. The UN has been involved in ongoing efforts to improve security in the country by deploying a peacekeeping mission. The SEC disclosure rule requires companies to determine the origin of conflict minerals in their products and exercise due diligence on their supply chains. The disclosure process broadly requires companies to 1. determine whether products contain necessary conflict minerals, 2. conduct a reasonable country-of-origin inquiry to determine the origin of those conflict minerals, and 3. exercise due diligence, if necessary, to determine the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals. The original SEC disclosure rule required companies to disclose whether their products were \u201cDRC conflict free,\u201d but subsequent guidance indicated that such a requirement is not enforceable. What other methods may the SEC use to address conflict minerals in the DRC?", "TEXT is a compilation of various federal government programs that require attention and improvement; also mentions fraud, waste, abuse, government operations, and national defense, along with the high-risk program's focus. The program's mission is to detect and prevent high-risk programs across a range of categories, including public health and safety, service delivery, national security, national defense, economic growth, privacy or citizens' rights, and program failure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy has been established as a component of the Executive Office of the President and is responsible for directing drug control efforts, coordinating national drug control strategy, and assessing and certifying the adequacy of National Drug Control Programs and the budget for those programs. High-risk criteria are specified, including the potential for significant injury, loss of life, significant impaired service, program failure, economy, efficiency or effectiveness challenges, and a minimum exposure of $1 billion. New high-risk designations may be made out-of-cycle if urgent or emerging issues warrant immediate attention. The high-risk report biennial series released by the Government Accountability Office includes information about the previous high-risk issues, as well as newly designated ones. The Department of Health and Human Services, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), plays a major role in reducing illicit drug abuse, overdose deaths, and prescription drug misuse. Drug overdose deaths have declined since 2018, but the rate is still much higher than in earlier years, and some demographic groups indicate increasing rates of drug misuse.", "TEXT: We found that less than 4 percent of the schools reviewed by both federal and regional accreditors had been sanctioned within the previous several years, even though about 40 percent of schools reviewed by federal accreditors and about 50 percent reviewed by regional accreditors had failed to meet the accreditors\u2019 academic quality standards; therefore, the current system puts most schools that fail to meet standards on \u201cprobation\u201d rather than imposing sanctions, although the accreditors may revoke approval and prevent schools from awarding credit in the event that schools fail to comply with specific and time-bound requirements. Overall, we found that many accreditors require schools to comply with a wide range of academic quality standards; but accreditors\u2019 sanctions can be weak, in part because accreditors tend to work with schools to help them come into compliance rather than taking swift and significant action that could result in the closure of a school that does not meet standards. A key issue for Congress to consider is the extent to which accreditation can be an effective quality control mechanism for schools participating in federal student aid programs. Although the legal definition of accreditation specifically excludes the idea that accreditors have responsibility for evaluating academic quality, accreditation in practice is often seen as a quality control mechanism\u2014and accreditors\u2019 self-proclaimed \u201cpeer review\u201d process is often seen as the basis for the perceived peer review of schools\u2019 academic quality. PAGE 5 But our analysis of accreditation sanction data found that this perception may not be accurate. In 2014, about 4 percent of schools reviewed by both federal and regional accreditors had been sanctioned within the previous 5 years, less than 8 percent within the previous 6 years, and less than 14 percent within the previous 10 years, according to sanction data we gathered that spanned fiscal years 2008 through 2013. These numbers include sanctions imposed by other accreditors, in addition to the accreditors that had reviewed the school. We also conducted a statistical analysis of sanction rates among accreditors found that sanctions imposed by two of the accreditors we reviewed occurred infrequently, while schools not meeting standards of the accreditors with the highest sanction rates were more likely to be sanctioned.", "A Black Lung Benefit Text Summarization\nYou are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Black lung benefit payments include both cash assistance and medical care. Maximum cash assistance payments ranged from about $670 to $1,340 per month in 2019, depending on a beneficiary\u2019s number of dependents. Miners receiving cash assistance are also eligible for medical treatment of their black lung-related conditions, which may include hospital and nursing care, rehabilitation services, and reimbursement for drug and equipment expenses, according to DOL documentation. DOL estimates that the average annual cost for medical care in fiscal year 2019 was approximately $8,225 per miner. During fiscal year 2019, about 25,700 beneficiaries received black lung benefits (see fig. 1). The number of beneficiaries has decreased from about 174,000 in 1982 as a result of declining coal mining employment and an aging beneficiary population, according to DOL. Black lung beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the rise in the occurrence of the disease in its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH reported that coal miners in central Appalachia are disproportionately affected; as many as 1 in 5 show evidence of black lung, which is the highest level recorded in 25 years. NIOSH has attributed the rise in occurrence of black lung to multiple factors, including increased exposure to silica. Black lung claims are processed by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs within DOL. Contested claims are adjudicated by DOL\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges, which issues decisions that can be appealed to DOL\u2019s Benefits Review Board. Claimants and mine operators may further appeal these DOL decisions to the federal courts. If an award is contested, claimants can receive interim benefits until their case is resolved, which are generally paid from the Trust Fund, according to DOL. In fiscal year 2019, about 33 percent of black lung claims were approved, according to DOL data. Final awards are either funded by mine operators\u2014who are identified as the responsible employers of claimants\u2014or the Trust Fund, when responsible employers cannot be identified or do not pay. Of the approximately 25,700 beneficiaries receiving black lung benefits in 2019, 13,335 were paid from the Trust Fund; 7,985 were paid by responsible mine operators; and 4,380 were receiving interim benefits, according to DOL data. DOL officials told us that the more common reasons that beneficiary claims are paid from the Trust Fund include operator insolvency and unclear employment history of miners, among other reasons (see fig. 2). The operator responsible for the payment of benefits is generally the operator that most recently employed the miner. Federal law generally requires coal mine operators to secure their black lung benefit liability. A self-insured coal mine operator assumes the financial responsibility for providing black lung benefits to its eligible employees by paying claims as they are incurred. Operators are allowed to self-insure if they meet certain DOL conditions. For instance, operators applying to self-insure must obtain collateral in the form of an indemnity bond, deposit or trust, or letter of credit in an amount deemed necessary and sufficient by DOL to secure their liability. Operators that do not self-insure are generally required to purchase coverage from commercial insurance companies, state workers\u2019 compensation insurance funds, or other entities authorized under state law to insure workers\u2019 compensation. DOL regulations require commercial insurers to report each policy and federal black lung endorsement issued, canceled, or renewed in a form determined by DOL. DOL accepts electronic reporting of this information from insurers via their respective rating bureaus. DOL retains this information\u2014insured company name, address, federal employer identification number, and policy and endorsement data\u2014so that DOL staff can later research claims to determine which operator and insurer may be liable. As we have noted in prior reports, insurance companies are regulated primarily by the states with state law providing state regulators with the authority and funding to regulate insurance. State insurance regulation is designed to, among other things, help insurers remain solvent and able to pay claims when due. Effective insurer underwriting and risk management practices\u2014such as reinsurance\u2013serve a similar function. While insurer insolvency occurs infrequently, when it does state insurance commissioners are typically appointed as receiver and supervise the rehabilitation or liquidation of these insurers, and state guaranty funds may assume liability for paying covered claims of insolvent insurers that have liquidated. Of the eight coal mine operator bankruptcies we identified, three resulted in a transfer of estimated benefit liability from the coal operator to the Trust Fund and five did not, according to DOL. Using Bloomberg data, we identified coal mine operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016. Figure 3 shows how many operators were self-insured or commercially-insured at the time of bankruptcy,", "TEXT: MODIFICATION, and request contractor participation. Some construction industry participants and federal acquisition and program officials told us that the process for changes could be streamlined. In an April 2016 testimony before the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, representatives from GSA\u2019s Office of Small Business said that they believed that small businesses could be better protected and the contracting process improved with reduced paperwork, less government oversight, and more streamlined contracting solutions. They added that in some cases it was reasonable to allow sole source awards or other simplified acquisition solutions when dealing with small businesses. However, federal regulations may prohibit sole source or other simplified acquisition solutions in certain situations, such as when a service requires competition and a fair and reasonable price. 3 At the Office of Federal Procurement Policy\u2019s first conference on small businesses in April 2019, small companies that supply services to the federal government noted construction contracting as an area that would benefit from greater streamlining. 4 At the September 2018 conference held by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at GSA, small business contractors in the construction industry stated that contract modification requests often took significant time to process. 5 While we did not have a systematic way to measure this observation, it may be related to the results of a pilot initiative that GSA completed to streamline some of the aspects of the contract change process. As we reported in June 2018, this pilot project enabled contractors to submit certain modifications and receive a final decision on them within two to four business days. 6 Participants said that the pilot project was an important step to simplify the process, but raised concerns that it was not being sustained beyond the pilot period. 7 Our June 2018 report contained recommendations for actions to streamline the change order process and increase collaboration among involved contracting officers, project managers, and contracting officers\u2019 technical representatives. We reiterate those recommendations in our new report. 8 This report provides information on the steps involved in the federal construction contract change process, and our findings are organized into four sections. The first section summarizes aspects of acquisition regulations that could be improved to enhance small business participation in construction contracts and to speed up the contract change process for all parties. The second section discusses changes and contract modifications that could be used to make construction processes smoother and to reduce the risk of project delays and cost overruns. The third section examines the contract administration and project control processes involved in the contract change process for federal construction. The fourth section focuses on the federal acquisition system for construction contracts, including the contracting officers that typically develop, award, and administer construction contracts, as well as project and program management offices and contracting oversight organizations. We provide observations in these sections based on our experiences with federal construction contracts during the past several years, including through our involvement in three ongoing audits and our analysis of about 10 cases related to the construction contract change process. 9 The remaining sections highlight several recommendations to help the construction process be more timely and efficient. Appendix I provides additional information about our methodology and data. Background information about these programs and some of our prior findings is in appendix II. Scope and Methodology Introduction 5 For example, one small business official from an agency told us that a significant proportion of their contract administration officials did not have federal certifications in contracting and were thus less knowledgeable about and practiced in acquiring contracts and contract management. We do not discuss or make recommendations for improvements in the quality of contract administration personnel. \u201cBILATERAL AND UNILATERAL CONTRACT CHANGES COULD BE ENHANCED AND ADMINISTERED MORE EFFICIENTLY.\u201d Background 13 11 See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3306 3307 and 3309 3306, 3307, and 3309; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6902(e); 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306(a)(4), 3307, 3309, 4318, 4319, 4421 and 4422; and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301e(6). 12 OMB Circular A-102 and 29 USC \u00a7 257a; see Appendix II. 13 See FAR 15.506(c) and 52.236-1 and 52.236-2; See FAR 15.504 and 52.236-1; see FAR 15.506(g). 14 See FAR 15.508(b); see also FAR 16.303-3(d). 15 See FAR 15.508(b)(1)(iii).

However, while these changes should further GSA\u2019s broker program goals, we identified limitations to the broker program\u2019s measurement of financial savings and its program management. 4 The federal government\u2019s civilian real-property holdings include thousands of leased office buildings and warehouses across the country that cost billions of dollars annually to rent, operate, and maintain.

For example, in fiscal year 2018, GSA incurred rent -- operating, security, and maintenance -- of about $6.9 billion across 3,500 federal occupied locations. \u2022 Federal real property assets may not be used efficiently, including too much space and too many locations. The Federal Government\u2019s Real Property Profile, GAO-18-341: Published: May 23, 2018. GAO-18-341T: Published: May 23, 2018. \u2022 Federal properties may require significant capital investment to repair and maintain, which GSA may not be able to provide due to budget constraints. GAO-16-341: Published: Oct. 4, 2016. \u2022 Federal properties -- in both urban and rural areas -- may not meet federal workers\u2019 needs, and such properties may limit the ability of departments and agencies to achieve their mission goals. Many federal properties require modernizations or adaptations to meet the needs of today\u2019s federal workers. Many federal agencies\u2019 missions require them to deploy their workforce to geographic areas distant from the agencies\u2019 headquarters, and those agencies may need additional real property to support agency staff and services. GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service acquires, leases, and manages real property for federal agencies. A variety of federal agencies have different requirements for the size, type, and location of office space needed to support their missions. GSA is responsible for acquiring space to meet these requirements, which may include renovating or demolishing existing properties, constructing new buildings, or renovating existing properties to meet federal agency requirements. When GSA is unable to identify appropriate real properties in its inventory or in the private market, it must obtain new buildings or leases of existing buildings through the Public Buildings Leasing Program. This program uses an approach that allows the federal government to acquire or lease property through direct negotiation with private owners or real property managers to meet the government\u2019s specific mission and space-related requirements. This program includes both short-term (typically less than 2 years) and long-term (typically 10 years or more) agreements, and may include purchase options. The use of brokers is one way GSA has procured leases in the past. In the late 1990s, GSA began to increase its use of brokers by signing regional contracts for broker services and paying brokers using appropriated funds. In 2013, GSA reported that it was using brokers to assist with leasing because brokers performed tasks such as preparing detailed market studies to help set rental rates, negotiating the terms of the leases, and tracking and reporting on leased properties. GSA also reported that brokers had a shorter procurement timeline for lease acquisitions, and GSA reported that federal agencies had greater flexibility with brokers because agencies were negotiating with a single private real estate broker rather than negotiating with individual private building owners or real estate managers. In 2003, GSA completed an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of different procurement methods to use for completing lease acquisition services. GSA concluded that contracting brokers to negotiate leases nationally represented the best option available and formalized the program as the National Broker Contract", "TEXT: report reiterated that Coast Guard resources were not designed or developed with an eye towards addressing Arctic issues. However, both the 2013 plan and the 2019 outlook contain few new actions, and most of the recommendations in our 2016 report and others do not appear in either of these documents. We noted last year, for example, that the Coast Guard lacks action plans, milestones, and metrics. And there is no overarching plan that outlines how the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic activities align with other federal agencies\u2019 plans and activities to coordinate Arctic policy implementation and enforcement. The Coast Guard has also not clearly identified the roles and responsibilities of other federal agencies with which it operates for addressing Arctic capability gaps. The Coast Guard has also demonstrated its understanding of its role and responsibility for certain aspects of Arctic policy implementation and enforcement\u2014such as search and rescue and environmental protection\u2014through actions. However, the Coast Guard has not always taken steps to operationalize its understanding of its roles and responsibilities in its internal planning documents, actions and guidance to staff, or strategic planning processes. We raised this issue in June 2016 and recommended that the Coast Guard (1) examine how to enhance Coast Guard guidance and planning processes to incorporate actions that address Coast Guard Arctic responsibilities and (2) develop an action plan to address Coast Guard responsibilities as identified in its Arctic strategic outlook. DHS concurred with our recommendations. As of January 2020, the Coast Guard stated that it was reviewing the implementation process of its 2019 Arctic strategic outlook, including its operationalizing Coast Guard Arctic responsibilities. As of January 2020, Coast Guard officials stated that they are reviewing how to enhance guidance and implementation planning processes to address Coast Guard Arctic responsibilities, and are expected to do so in the upcoming 2020 implementation plan. The Coast Guard added that it is also reviewing its Arctic strategic outlook to identify Coast Guard roles and responsibilities not yet defined, and may refine and/or add additional roles and responsibilities, including those that require more detailed planning. Our review of the execution of Coast Guard missions shows that the Coast Guard has been active in the region, but it has faced capability gaps for some missions. When performing Arctic maritime domain awareness, law enforcement, search and rescue, environmental response, and disaster management missions, among others, Coast Guard assets are regularly in the region. From 2012 to 2018, Coast Guard ships, aircraft and crews executed more than 900 Arctic missions a year on average, with more than half in the Arctic region each year. Since fiscal year 2011, the Coast Guard has more than doubled its Arctic operating time\u2014from 7,500 operating hours in fiscal year 2011 to 16,200 operating hours in fiscal year 2017. However, Coast Guard officials told us that a lack of icebreaking capability and Arctic-specific navigation systems are key capability gaps they face in executing a majority of these missions. The Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic operational environment can be challenging due to the extreme weather, limited resources available in the Arctic, harsh operating conditions, and geomagnetic storms. Our June 2016 analysis determined that the Coast Guard has limited Arctic polar icebreaking capabilities, Arctic charting and navigation systems, and Arctic infrastructure, such as ports and communications infrastructure, and that it faces limited Arctic-specific operational expertise among its personnel. Coast Guard officials stated that they have taken some actions, in part because of the harsh Arctic operating environment, to enhance Arctic planning and operational support for its activities. In particular, they have taken action to enhance communications infrastructure, environmental response, and search and rescue capabilities. For environmental response, such efforts appear largely consistent with actions specified in its 2013 Arctic strategy. Actions it planned in conjunction with implementing that strategy included acquiring pollution control equipment, conducting Arctic oil cleanup and salvage exercises, acquiring ice breaking capacity, designing a special purpose vessel to transport a pollution response barge, and building a new Arctic oil spill training center, among others. Actions in the report to address capability gaps not identified in the strategy are unclear. Actions for search and rescue and communications infrastructure also appear largely consistent with the strategy\u2019s action plan. We reviewed Coast Guard efforts to address Arctic capability gaps using the criteria established in the Coast Guard\u2019s strategy and the criteria established in our 2016 report. As the table indicates, Coast Guard performance and progress towards addressing capability gaps in the Arctic vary by capability.

States must also perform comparison programs with other states quarterly and make timely corrections of records that match for the purpose of maintaining accurate voter registration lists. The NVRA requires that states must send notices of inactivity to individuals who are \u201cinactive\u201d or \u201cunverified\u201d registrants if they have not voted in at least two elections and have not responded to a notice requesting confirmation of registration. In addition, the NVRA requires states to have an adequate system in place to remove individuals from the voter registration rolls who have been convicted of a felony. The NVRA authorizes the Secretaries of State to request (and receive) information necessary to compare state voter registration lists with state criminal offender databases. The NVRA also authorizes the maintenance of statewide integrated voter registration databases. These databases can be used to track voting patterns and other registration and voting information, including provisional ballot records. In 1998 Congress amended the NVRA to specifically authorize the interstate sharing of voter registration lists. HAVA requires states to conduct a statewide program for the systematic removal of those registered to vote no longer residing at the address indicated in the registration lists. The law requires state officials to send notices to these registrants asking if they have moved their residence, and gives registrants 30 days to confirm (or 2 years from the date of the notice, if the registrant did not respond). The burden is on the registrant to confirm his or her address or provide a new address, unless the registrant is in a hospital, nursing home, or other inpatient facility, or provides a new address when reporting a suspected new residency through a public assistance program. The law stipulates that registrants who do not respond to the confirmation notice and fail to vote in two consecutive federal elections subsequent to the confirmation mailing are subject to removal from the registration list. State and local election officials are provided access to address confirmation data from the U.S. Postal Service, which indicates whether a confirmation letter was delivered at an address. The law also lists about 20 databases that states can use to access information about individuals whose records appear to indicate ineligibility to vote under the NVRA. The databases, administered by federal agencies, include, among others, Social Security Administration data and military and overseas citizen voting list databases. Finally, HAVA requires that state and local election officials compare their registration lists with state records indicating ineligibility (such as felony convictions) to remove those ineligible individuals from the voting rolls. States were required to implement HAVA\u2019s provisions either by January 1, 2006, or to request extensions of time, and extensions were granted in several states. 3 The NVRA also requires states to maintain certain safeguards to protect voting lists, such as a state procedure that requires a password for access to and maintenance of the list. The NVRA further stipulates that a state or local election official may only release registration list information as necessary for maintenance and administration of federal and state election purposes, and to maintain the list; and the official could not release this information to any individual or organization before election day. For additional information on NVRA see http://www.nationalconferenceofstatelegislatures.org/pdf_files/ncsl_nvra_factsheet.pdf. The NVRA was an attempt by Congress to address perceived problems with registering eligible new voters and the maintenance of those voting rolls. At that time it was believed that state practices on both of these concerns (including voting list accuracy) were hindering the opportunities for eligible individuals to register and vote in federal elections. In essence, the NVRA was an attempt at ensuring a more democratic system that involved active participation by all eligible individuals. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, the voting reform agenda has historically focused on increasing participation\u2014through voter registration, expanded opportunities for casting ballots, and removal of disenfranchising barriers. This agenda has been driven primarily by concerns about under-represented groups\u2019 access to voting. The NVRA was enacted as an effort to address these concerns. 4", "Text 1 As of November 2018, 43 states operated at least part of their Medicaid programs under demonstrations. State demonstrations can vary in size and scope, and many demonstrations are comprehensive in nature, affecting multiple aspects of states\u2019 Medicaid programs. In fiscal year 2017, federal spending on demonstrations accounted for more than one- third of total federal Medicaid spending and in eight states accounted for 75 percent or more of Medicaid expenditures. CMS typically approves demonstrations for an initial 5- year period that can be extended in 3- to 5- year increments with CMS approval. Some states have operated portions of their Medicaid programs under a demonstration for decades. Each demonstration is governed by special terms and conditions, which reflect the agreement reached between CMS and the state, and describe the authorities granted to the state. For example, the special terms and conditions may define what demonstration funds can be spent on\u2014including which populations and services\u2014as well as specify reporting requirements, such as monitoring or evaluation reports states must submit to CMS. In January 2018, CMS announced a new policy to support states interested in using demonstrations to make participation in work or community engagement a requirement to maintain Medicaid eligibility or coverage. CMS\u2019s guidance indicates that states have flexibility in designing demonstrations that test work requirements, but it also describes parameters around the populations that could be subject to work requirements and other expectations. CMS guidance addresses several areas, including the following: Populations. Work requirements should apply to working-age, non-pregnant adult beneficiaries who qualify for Medicaid on a basis other than a disability. Exemptions and qualifying activities. States must create exemptions for individuals who are medically frail or have acute medical conditions. States must also take steps to ensure eligible individuals with opioid addiction and other substance use disorders have access to coverage and treatment services and provide reasonable modifications for them, such as counting time spent in medical treatment toward work requirements. The guidance indicates that states can allow a range of qualifying activities that satisfy work requirements, such as job training, education programs, and community service. The guidance also encourages states to consider aligning Medicaid work requirements with work requirements in other federal assistance programs operating in their states. Beneficiary supports. States are expected to describe their strategies to assist beneficiaries in meeting work requirements and to link them to additional resources for job training, child care assistance, transportation, or other work supports. However, CMS\u2019s guidance specifies that states are not authorized to use Medicaid funds to finance these beneficiary supports. About one-third of states have either received CMS approval or submitted applications to CMS to test work requirements in their demonstrations. Nine states have had work requirements approved as part of new demonstrations or extensions of or amendments to existing demonstrations as of May 2019. Also as of May 2019, seven more states had submitted demonstration applications with work requirements, which were pending CMS approval. (See fig. 1.) States with approved work requirements were in various stages of implementation as of August 2019, and three states faced legal challenges to implementation. The requirements were in effect in Arkansas for 9 months before a federal district court vacated the approval in March 2019. Work requirements became effective in Indiana in January 2019 and will be enforced beginning in January 2020. CMS\u2019s approval of work requirements in Kentucky was vacated in March 2019\u2014several days before the work requirements were set to become effective on April 1, 2019. As of August 2019, CMS was appealing the court decisions vacating demonstration approvals in Arkansas and Kentucky. Other states\u2019 requirements are approved to take effect in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. (See fig. 2.) Implementing work requirements, as with other types of beneficiary requirements, can involve an array of administrative activities by states, including developing or adapting eligibility and enrollment systems, educating beneficiaries, and training staff. In general, CMS provides federal funds for 50 percent (referred to as a 50 percent matching rate) of state Medicaid administrative costs. These funds are for activities considered necessary for the proper and efficient administration of a state\u2019s Medicaid program, including those parts operated under demonstrations. CMS provides higher matching rates for certain administrative costs, including those parts related to IT systems. For example, expenditures to design, develop, and install Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems are matched at 90 percent, and maintenance and operations of these systems are matched at 75 percent. States may also receive federal funds for administrative activities delegated to MCOs. The amount of federal Medicaid funds states receive for payments to MCOs that bear financial risk for Medicaid expenditures is determined annually by a statutory formula based on the state\u2019s per capita income, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP sets a specific federal matching rate for each state that, for fiscal year 2019, ranges from 50 percent to 76 percent. There are exceptions to this rate for certain populations, providers, and service delivery methods.", "An expert at summarization, proceed to summarize the following text.

Long-Range Precision Fires\u2014 focused on improving the targeting, range, and lethality of, among other things, artillery and rocks \u2026Read more\nMilitary training at night or other low-light conditions has long been a problematic training area for military units. Soldiers would carry night vision monoculars or goggles that are often cumbersome, unreliable, and expensive.\nThe military has been working for years on developing head-mounted displays that allow soldiers to see things in the dark without needing to carry NVGs.\nThe Army has been developing the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) for years now, but they recently made a major leap forward.\nSoldiers are about to get a whole new level of ability on the battlefield.\nFox News reports that a new program from a Florida company allows soldiers to see at night as if they are seeing in the day.\nHere\u2019s how the program works\u2026\nThere are those within the military that don\u2019t have night vision capabilities, but who are still expected to be able to perform. That\u2019s where this new program comes in.\nIVAS is a head-up display (HUD) solution for enhanced situational awareness and mobility that leverages commercial innovations like smartphones and mobile devices that have high pixel density displays and high sensitivity touch screens. The IVAS program consists of three components and is in a \u201cconstant state of maturation.\u201d\nThese three components are:\nThe Army is expected to have IVAS ready for soldiers in the next few years.\nArmy Sgt. Zachary R. Hensley of the 3rd Battalion, 509th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, said using IVAS has been incredibly useful and beneficial.\nThe IVAS system, according to Hensley, \u201chas significantly improved readiness.\u201d\n\u201cSoldiers can now use IVAS for their normal operations,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cOnce all the capability is in place, soldiers will be able to use IVAS as a productivity enhancing tool. So with IVAS everybody can be a better soldier.\u201d\nHe also said that the head-up display is useful because \u201cit frees up soldier\u2019s hands to do the mission.\u201d\nThe Army also released a statement promoting the IVAS and other military advances like it.\n\u201cThe Army\u2019s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) is a game-changing technology for our Soldiers. IVAS can provide hands-free productivity-enhancing capabilities that allow increased mission effectiveness. Soldiers and squad members will have hands-free capability for hands-on mission requirements.\u201d\nThe Army is looking to test out new prototypes that will increase safety and mission effectiveness.\nIn combat and dangerous situations, every second counts. Being able to improve visibility and hands-on capabilities will save lives.\nYou can see the IVAS in action below\u2026\nSHARE to show your support for our military heroes and their advancement!Source: Fox News\nThis article was originally published by \u201cThe Right Opinion.", "1.\nThe national pipeline system consists of more than 2.7 million miles of networked pipelines transporting natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids. 2. Natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines are mostly buried underground across the continental United States, some in remote areas 3. There are three main types of pipelines based on materials transported 4. About 216,000 miles of hazardous liquid pipeline transport crude oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, jet fuel, anhydrous ammonia, and carbon dioxide 5. Natural gas transmission and storage: About 319,000 miles of pipeline\u2014mostly interstate 6. Natural gas distribution: About 2.2 million miles of pipeline transporting natural gas from transmission sites to customers. Figure 1 depicts the network of hazardous liquid and natural gas transmission pipelines in the United States. More than 3,000 pipeline companies operate the nation\u2019s pipeline systems, which can traverse multiple states and the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico. Many pipeline systems also include, for example, storage tanks, compressor stations, and control centers 7. Most pipeline systems are monitored through automated industrial control systems and SCADA systems 8. Pipeline accidents can be caused by third-party excavation, corrosion, mechanical failure, control system failure, and operator error. Natural forces, such as floods and earthquakes, can also damage pipelines. Pipeline accidents can be catastrophic in public safety and environmental damage 9. Pipelines are also vulnerable to physical attacks by crude or unsophisticated tactics 10. Public and private plans establish the roles and responsibilities for the protection of critical infrastructure, including pipelines. 11. PPD-21 establishes critical infrastructure sectors and assigns roles and responsibilities for each sector among nine designated federal agencies 12. The NIPP outlines critical infrastructure stakeholders\u2019 roles and responsibilities regarding critical security and resilience, using a voluntary partnership model. 13. Protect the nation\u2019s pipeline systems is a responsibility shared by both the federal government and private industry 14. The entities primarily responsible for pipeline safety and security are included below. TSA, pipelines are also vulnerable to cyber attacks or physical attacks, and the Department\u2019s Cyber Security Awareness and Detection Branch works to better understand the cyber and physical threats and increase awareness of actions to mitigate them. PHMSA. 15. PHA also manages the pipeline incident management system, which gathers reports from more than 500 operators and tracks reports through to corrective action. PHMSA ensures pipeline operators provide proper training for control center personnel, and operators regularly verify the training records of their operating personal through audits. PHMSA has also implemented regulations requiring operators of high-consequence pipelines to develop and implement the Control Room Management Program\u2014a program designed to better ensure the pipeline control room is properly staffed with trained personnel, free from distractions, and provides the operator with the best available information. PHMSA also investigates pipeline facilities where accidents occurred. 16. TSA\u2019s oversight role also allows the Department\u2019s cyber security, information technology, and human resources systems to ensure pipeline facilities\u2019 access control and cyber threat control programs are appropriately implemented and maintained. 17. PHMSA also provides oversight of hazardous material transportation, but PHMSA does not have independent authority to regulate hazardous liquids transportation pipelines. PHMSA\u2019s role is to ensure hazardous liquid pipeline operators provide PHMSA\u2019s Emergency Management Branch (HMB) provides coordination of information with other DHS components\u2014including TSA, USCG, and FEMA\u2014 regarding pipeline emergencies 18. PHMSA has also initiated an effort to develop a pipeline incident response communications plan for HMB and its incident management team. PHMSA has also been working to integrate the Incident Management Plan (IMPLAN) tool with PHMSA\u2019s National Response Team and is developing a national incident response plan for pipeline emergencies. 19. PHMSA\u2019s Office of Research and Development sponsors research and development activities in several areas including materials, pipeline inspection and repair technologies, leak detection, pipeline safety research, cybersecurity, and natural gas transmission. 20. TSA has also initiated an effort to update its Pipeline Sector-Specific Plan in conjunction with HMB. Under this plan, TSA coordinates with HMB and its incident management team during incidents involving natural gas transmission pipelines and hazardous liquid pipelines that are within the TSA domain. TSA and PHMSA also engage in regular information sharing and provide support to pipeline operators during emergencies. 21. DOT, as the lead Coordinator for transportation, has primary responsibility for coordinating with the other seven sector coordinators\u2014including TSA\u2014to lead cross-sector efforts necessary to protect critical infrastructure from terrorist acts and natural disasters. 22. When pipelines are the target of a cyber-based incident, TSA\u2019s Cyber Security Awareness and Detection Branch works to better understand the cyber and physical threats and increase awareness of actions to mitigate them. TSA also uses the Pipeline Operational Response plan to coordinate TSA activities during pipeline emergencies, and TSA has initiated the effort to develop a Pipeline Incident Response Communications Plan. The plan, which is being developed by the TSA", "We concluded VA\u2019s SAIL quality system was effective in that the number of medical centers with 5 star ratings increased, but the overall quality improved at a slower rate than had been planned. SAIL has helped VA identify areas for improvement and has been effective in helping VA understand why those areas were selected. 6 years ago, this was one of the most innovative performance management systems and today it remains well positioned to continue to do well in the future.", "According to OMB guidance, evidence can consist of quantitative or qualitative information and may be derived from a variety of sources. Those sources include foundational fact-finding, performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluation. OMB recommends that agencies build a portfolio of high-quality, credible sources of evidence to support decision- making. Further, since different sources of evidence have varying degrees of credibility, the use of evidence in decision-making requires an understanding of what conclusions can\u2014and cannot\u2014be drawn from the information. Evidence-building can be viewed as a cycle of activities that can help decision makers obtain the evidence they need to address policy questions or identify the questions they should address. As illustrated in figure 1, the following four activities comprise the evidence-building cycle: assessing existing evidence to determine its sufficiency and if additional evidence is needed to further understand results and inform decision-making; prioritizing among the identified needs which new evidence to generate, when, and how; generating new evidence, by collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing sources of data and research results; and using that evidence to support learning and decision-making processes. Our prior work highlights long-standing challenges agencies continue to face in generating some sources of evidence\u2014developing performance measures for federal programs and conducting evaluations of their programs. Our work also identified variations in the use of evidence for decision-making by agency leaders and managers. Fragmentation refers to those circumstances in which more than one federal agency (or organization within an agency) is involved in the same activity and opportunities exist to improve implementation of that activity. The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking found that evidence-building activities are fragmented in the federal government. For example, it found that evidence-building activities are fragmented in the federal government. For example, it found that within agencies, many organizations have evidence-building responsibilities, including statistical agencies and programs, evaluation and policy research offices, performance management offices, policy analysis offices, and program administrators. In addition, the commission highlighted challenges the federal government faces in fully addressing cross-cutting research and policy questions when evidence-building activities span multiple agencies. The commission\u2019s final report noted that this fragmentation can lead to duplication of effort or missed opportunities for collaboration. The commission\u2019s report stated that when activities are fragmented within an agency or across the federal government, they should be coordinated to improve the capacity to fully address a specific research or policy question. Similarly, our past work highlights the importance of coordination and collaboration to reduce or better manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. We found that uncoordinated or poorly coordinated efforts can waste scarce funds and limit their effectiveness. Even when efforts are coordinated, enhancements to those efforts can lead to improvements in effectiveness. As noted earlier, our work also identified leading practices that can help agencies enhance and sustain their implementation of collaborative efforts. Congress and OMB have taken actions to strengthen federal evidence-building activities and improve coordination of those activities during the last decade. Figure 2 provides a timeline of selected actions. Appendix II provides additional detail regarding the selected actions.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently established the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HVEE) review. Through this review, HHS assesses evidence of a range of models seeking to incorporate evidence of effectiveness into grants. Based on results of the HVEE review, grantees may select only models determined to be an evidence-based home visiting model. In 2018, for example, 27 models met HHS\u2019s criteria for the evidence-based models. Through this annual review process, evidence of the effectiveness of the models is updated to support future grants. In October 2018, 18 home visiting models met HHS\u2019s criteria for participation in MIECHV grants. These MIECHV grantees may select models from the evidence-based models to use in their states. 3. those that proposed existing, evidence-based programs and products, with little or no changes to the existing program or product; and 4. those that proposed new projects without evidence of effectiveness. DOL obligated $177 million in grant funds across all tiers of evidence. The program aims to strengthen the evidence base on the value of public sector spending on workforce programs and to increase the number of high-impact workforce strategies in use. In June 2018, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced its Evidence and Innovation Awards. Under this award program, HUD will support evaluations of up to seven projects that focus on the effectiveness of housing interventions aimed at improving the stability of extremely low- income households. The goal is to help HUD identify and replicate housing interventions that have a large and lasting impact on the lives of extremely low- income families. In September 2009, HHS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, another Department of Health and Human Services agency, jointly established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). As an independent, nongovernmental organization, PCORI aims to produce knowledge that helps patients and their caregivers, as", "Federal agencies\u2019 fleet consist of many types of vehicles that support a variety of purposes. For example, federal vehicles may be used to carry staff and gear to remote, off-road locations to perform maintenance or other tasks; to transport and provide healthcare to veterans; or to support daily operations on military installations. Congress and several administrations have required federal agencies to take various steps to reduce federal fleets\u2019 petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions. During fiscal year 2017, agencies were: to meet requirements to acquire alternative fuel vehicles and low greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles; to increase use of alternative fuel; and to decrease use of petroleum and per-mile greenhouse gas emissions. According to DOE guidance for the 2015 Executive Order, acquiring such vehicles and increasing the use of alternative fuel can facilitate the goals of reducing both petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions. For fiscal year 2017, in addition to meeting the above requirements, federal agencies were to meet other requirements related to overall fleet management. Federal regulations require agencies to complete a fleet management plan annually and conduct an assessment of their fleet at least every 5 years. In addition, an Executive Order issued by the prior administration in 2015 directed agencies to determine and plan for their optimum fleet inventory with emphasis placed on eliminating unnecessary or non-essential vehicles. Certain federal fleet energy directives in place in fiscal year 2017 were revoked by an Executive Order issued in May 2018. Specifically, directives related to acquiring zero emission (electric) vehicles and reducing per-mile greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the additional fleet management expectations, were revoked. The Trump administration issued a new Executive Order requiring that the Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with other federal agencies, review existing federal vehicle fleet requirements and report to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding opportunities to optimize federal fleet performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and compliance requirements. According to DOE officials, DOE submitted a report to CEQ and OMB as required. In April 2019, CEQ and OMB issued implementing instructions for the Executive Order. The implementing instructions emphasized that agencies should focus on the statutory requirements while increasing efficiency, optimizing performance, and reducing waste and costs. The guidance particularly emphasized agencies\u2019 focus on reducing petroleum use and increasing alternative fuel consumption. The guidance did not mention the extent to which agencies should continue to acquire any specific type of alternative fuel vehicle. Annually, federal agencies are responsible for reporting vehicle inventory (including acquisitions and disposals), fuel consumption, mileage, and cost to the FAST database. Additionally, federal agencies are required to annually report on their fleets\u2019 inventories, operating costs, and other fleet data. Costs submitted to the FAST database include acquisition costs, maintenance, fuel costs, indirect costs, commercial lease, GSA lease, and disposal proceeds. Prior to fiscal year 2017, agencies submitted this data at an aggregate, rather than the vehicular level, so that costs or other performance could not be analyzed at the vehicular level. For fiscal year 2017, as required by GSA and DOE, agencies began submitting vehicular level data to the FAST database, providing more detail about agency\u2019s vehicles. The FAST database specifically tracks data to assess agencies\u2019 performance relative to fleet energy requirements in federal statute and executive orders. A range of vehicles qualify as alternative fuel vehicles (see fig. 1).", "You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the final selection of the teachers. Officials at four case study schools reported that they were required to interview and select from a limited number of teachers proposed by Hanban. However, all schools selected their own teachers in some instances. Case study school officials reported that they believed that Hanban\u2019s involvement in teacher selection is consistent with their own school\u2019s practices for hiring faculty in their institution. For example, one school official stated that the U.S. school chooses its own Chinese American Studies professors, but Hanban provides a shortlist of candidates to choose from. Hanban officials involved in the Confucius Institute teacher selection process reported to our staff that they take into account academic quality, teaching certifications, familiarity with the United States, age, and years of teaching experience when selecting teachers.

Proceed to summarize the following text.\u201d TEXT: BOP is a component of DOJ and is responsible for housing male and female federal inmates in a controlled, safe, and humane prison environment while also providing a safe workplace for employees. BOP operates 122 prisons across the United States. These prisons are characterized by five security levels: high, medium, low, minimum, and administrative. Table 1 below provides a description of each of these security levels and the number of prisons at each. According to BOP data, in fiscal year 2019, BOP housed 149,701 inmates in its prisons. During this same time, the BOP employed 32,525 employees, of which 15,664 were correctional officers with responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of the inmates. According to a July 2012 BOP memorandum, BOP was approved to conduct a pilot study on pepper spray. The goals of the pilot were to increase the safety of staff and inmates when responding to incidents involving violence and to prevent injury to staff and inmates due to an assault or serious resistance to staff control. BOP began issuing pepper spray at high security prisons in August 2012 as part of its pilot study. In February 2015, BOP issued a program memorandum requiring employees in high, medium, and administrative security prisons to carry pepper spray. Further, in September 2018, BOP issued a program statement that expanded pepper spray to employees in low security prisons. Figure 1 provides a more detailed time line of events on the use of pepper spray in BOP prisons, including requirements under the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015. Pepper spray is a natural inflammatory agent that can cause coughing, tearing, and discharge of excessive mucous when deployed in the facial region. According to BOP training guidance and policy, pepper spray is to be used in incidents that require an immediate use of force (for example, an unplanned use of force because of an attack on staff or an inmate) or a calculated use of force in which employees have time to coordinate their response (for example, when an inmate refuses to vacate his or her cell). For calculated uses of force, employees are to consult medical personnel to determine if an inmate has a medical condition that will exempt the inmate from being pepper sprayed. BOP policy states that employees should receive initial training on pepper spray and annual refresher training. In training, employees are taught effective tactical communication for using pepper spray; use of force policy; how to use pepper spray; and the decontamination process, among other topics. According to BOP\u2019s Use of Force and Application of Restraints policy, a prison\u2019s warden may authorize the use of chemical agents, such as pepper spray, only under the following situations: (1) the inmate is armed or barricaded; or, (2) the inmate cannot be approached without danger to self or others; and (3) it is determined that a delay in bringing the situation under control would constitute a serious hazard to the inmate or others or would result in a major disturbance or serious property damage. Pepper spray, moreover, should only be used when all other reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. This policy further states that staff shall appropriately document incidents involving the use of pepper spray using BOP\u2019s Form 583\u2014Use of Force Report. Form 583 contains fields to enter the date and time of the incident; inmates and staff involved; injuries; medical reports; a description of the incident; and other information, such as the existence of video of the incident. The form is to be completed by the lieutenant on duty at the time of the incident and sequentially forwarded to the captain, assistant warden, warden, and regional office for review. After a Form 583 is completed, the warden, associate warden, health services administrator, and captain at the prison, collectively, conduct an after-action review of the incident to determine if the pepper spray was used in accordance with policy. Results of the after-action review are documented on BOP\u2019s Form 586\u2014After Action Report. According to BOP headquarters officials, in addition to documenting the results of the after-action review, a completed Form 586 often includes recommendations on how to improve the response to such incidents in the future. Incident data captured on Forms 583 and 586 are maintained in BOP\u2019s TRUINTEL database. To enhance BOP employee safety, BOP provides its employees with a variety of protective equipment. BOP generally requires employees working within the secure prison perimeter to carry a radio, body alarm, pepper spray (as appropriate), and keys while on duty. These items are usually checked out from the control center using a chit\u2014a small, brass, circular token inscribed with the BOP employee\u2019s first initial and last name. As of March 2020, some employees also wear stab-resistant vests to help enhance their.", "> Navy shipbuilding is a costly and complex endeavor that requires billions of dollars to develop, design, and construct ships.\n> According to DOD, operational support is a function of several related factors\u2014reliability, availability, maintainability, and cost\u2014that are determined in large part by decisions made before the start of construction.\n> To avoid costs that exceed estimates, the Navy must focus on designing ships with reliability, availability, and maintainability during the acquisition process.\n> This requires coordination and input from a variety of officials associated with the program, including the program manager, requirements officials, ship design managers, engineers, PSMs, and others.", "The USVI territory suffered damage costing billions after 2017 hurricanes.

The framework highlights opportunities to consider the full range of factors that affect vulnerability to disasters caused by hurricanes and other extreme weather events, and to build resilience in ways that also reduce the impacts from other stressors.\nAs an expert at summarization, I will proceed to summarize the paragraph provided to me. The paragraph highlights the risks of climate change, such as high temperature extremes, heavy precipitation events, high-tide flooding events, ocean acidification and warming, and forest fires. These events have been observed and are projected to continue to increase. The paragraph also emphasizes that without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions and regional efforts to pursue climate resilience, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth. The potential for losses in some economic sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of this century. Federal efforts can help promote resilience to natural disasters by creating resilience goals in all relevant national strategies and linking those goals to an overarching strategic vision. Nonfederal actors can also make decisions to reduce risks associated with climate change through the use of incentives and risk assessment tools to build resilience. The framework presented in the text highlights opportunities to build resilience in ways that also reduce the impacts from other stressors.", "The F-35 Lighting II program is a joint, multinational acquisition program intended to develop and field a family of next-generation strike fighter aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps (hereinafter referred to as the services), eight international partners, and foreign military sales customers (collectively hereinafter referred to as program participants).

It is managed by the U.S. House of Representatives through its Architect of the Capitol (AOC) organization. The project, which began in approximately 2004, is currently undergoing phase 2 of its five planned phases of renovation work. Estimated to be completed in November 2020, the project includes repairs on the heating, plumbing, and electrical systems, window replacements, installation of a new roof, and refurbishment of restroom facilities. AOC is using the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) delivery method to implement the project. The estimated cost of the project, $753 million, has increased due to additional unforeseen conditions, design issues, and scope changes related to the first phase of renovation work. The project\u2019s total funding includes budget allocations from Congress. As part of the planning and design process, the project\u2019s construction contract was awarded to a construction firm, and the project is overseen by the construction contractor, an architect and engineering firm, and a construction manager. The project is on schedule to be complete by November 2020.\nI would say that the Cannon Building's renovation project is proceeding smoothly despite the unexpected issues that arose during the design and execution phases. One positive aspect of the project is that it is being managed by experienced construction and contracting firms, which can address any issues that arise with experience and expertise. Another positive aspect is that despite the increased costs and schedule changes, the project's completion date is still set for November 2020, and the project is still proceeding according to schedule. This shows that the project is well managed and that the additional funds are being used effectively. Moreover, the improved facilities will enhance the functionality and efficiency of the Cannon Building and its occupants, providing a better working environment for them. Overall, I would say that this is a well-managed project that is proceeding as planned despite unexpected changes.", "TEXT: TEXT: TEXT:\nYou have submitted a nice article describing the supervision of large depository institutions by federal banking regulators. However, some revisions are required to align it with the current situation. To begin with, replace the word \"federal\" with \"independent,\" because the Federal Reserve was not created by the government, but instead was chartered as a private corporation owned entirely by the member banks. For this reason, the central bank has an interest in safeguarding both shareholders and depositors. As a central bank, the Federal Reserve has limited the power of state and local governments to raise taxes, because these increases would inflate the value of federal bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve. But if state and local authorities were allowed to tax, they would have a greater incentive to pay for necessary services with tax revenues, rather than rely on funds borrowed from bondholders and stockholders. Under this \"fiscal compact,\" as it has been called, each level of government would be held responsible for raising the revenue it needs to finance the current level of services. As a result, the cost of local services would be directly traced to specific tax levies, making it easier to hold local politicians accountable. Under current circumstances, where the state and local level is heavily dependent on federal aid, which frequently comes with unfunded mandates, states and localities are under enormous political pressure to keep taxes low or even cut taxes, and the only way to do this is to cut spending on education or other essential services. The resulting financial crises have led to many bankruptcies of cities and states, and a substantial increase in the national debt. In a nutshell, this system gives states and localities an excuse to cut taxes and avoid spending cuts.\nThis leads to a situation where cities and states cut taxes and lay off workers to deal with the shortfall. In addition, they are not required to cut spending on nonessential government programs or on subsidies to large corporations. These policies are particularly painful during tough economic times, as more people depend on government-funded job training programs, health care, child care, and other programs to make ends meet. While spending cuts are necessary to deal with economic downturns, it is essential to focus spending cuts on nonessential government programs, rather than on job training programs and other essential services. In a recent speech at Georgetown University Law Center, I made some suggestions for reforming the Federal Reserve System. First, Congress needs to exercise more oversight and control over the system to prevent excessive borrowing, the creation of too much money, or dangerous inflation, regardless of the Fed's insistence on the importance of maintaining its independence. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States and plays a critical role in the U.S. economy by setting the interest rate, controlling the value of the U.S. dollar, and supervising some large banks. 1. The Fed's independence is a myth. The Fed was never independent to begin with because it was chartered as a private corporation that has a monopoly on printing U.S. currency and on setting interest rates.\nThis private monopoly has a conflict of interest, however, because it is owned by the federal reserve banks (FRBs), which are private entities. The FRBs are responsible for selling shares in the Fed, and the shareholders get almost $100 billion every year \u2014 a huge return on their investment \u2014 while the general public gets no return at all. The Fed's private monopoly is a problem that requires urgent reform because it is not accountable or transparent to the American public. Furthermore, it has resulted in the corruption of U.S. democracy, which is the focus of this paper. 2. The Fed is an anti-American institution because it allows banks to pay interest on their depositors' money at a rate that is determined by the government, and it then pays these interest rates to the government. This means that the government reaps twice as much benefit from every interest payment that is paid on these deposits, which are held by the majority of Americans.\nWhile the government receives no benefit from loans or investments made by the Fed, it receives a significant benefit from the interest payments that depositors make to the large banks. By contrast, depositors earn between 4% and 7% less interest than they should because these interest payments are not made to the depositors themselves, which means that depositors are losing $1 trillion every year to the government and the banking institutions. At the same time, these interest payments are giving the government and the banks a huge advantage in that they enable the federal government to borrow less money from the American people and the American banking system \u2014 resulting in tremendous savings in interest charges. However, because of the Fed's policies, 80% of U.S. government spending goes to interest payments on the national debt, which is now over $14 trillion, which is a staggering debt for any government to carry. As a result, the government must borrow more money from foreign lenders every year to fund", "The overall objective of the Army Facilities Standardization Program is to achieve savings and benefits in the programming, design, and construction of Army facilities of excellence. To meet AFSP\u2019s objectives in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner, the Army established the nine Centers in 2006 to support the AFSP. As shown in figure 1 above, the AFSP operates under the direction of the Army Facilities Standardization Committee, which also consists of members from both U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Army Installation Management Command. The AFSP is guided by a charter that outlines the key objectives and activities of the Centers\u2014essentially to develop and refine standard designs and related engineering and architectural criteria to support the AFSP. Figure 2 above further depicts the overall organization of the AFSP, including the Board, its members, and its function. According to AFSP representatives, the overall AFSP\u2019s three main objectives are reflected in the individual Centers\u2019 charters and activities. This includes developing and refining Centers\u2019 policies, promoting consistent application of standards of the Centers program, and monitoring the execution of the AFSP to meet its overarching objectives and priorities. In accordance with the AFSP and Centers\u2019 charters, the Centers engage in different activities, such as the development and monitoring of Army standard designs and Facilities Criteria that are to be used consistently throughout the Army and for which all appropriate facilities, which include over 55 percent to 70 percent of the Army\u2019s overall budgeted projects. The Centers identified various activities designed to support the key objectives found in their charter, which are consistent with key principles and concepts found in OMB guidance for a disciplined capital programming process. Overall, ARCS maintains a strong position as a capital asset management solution that can support any agency that seeks to manage the lifecycle of physical assets from creation to implementation and operation.", "Summary of the text", "This article discusses the leasing of federal government's properties by the General Services Administration (GSA).

To fulfill this direction, NASA formally established the SLS launch vehicle program in 2011. Then, in 2012, NASA aligned the requirements for the Orion program with those of the newly created SLS vehicle and the associated ground systems programs. The Exploration Systems Development (ESD) organization reports to NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate and is responsible for managing and integrating the human space exploration programs. Figure 1 provides details about each SLS hardware element and its source as well as identifies the major portions of the Orion spacecraft. NASA established the EGS program to modernize the Kennedy Space Center to prepare for integrating SLS and Orion, and recovery of the Orion crew capsule. The EGS program involves a number of components and processing centers including the Vehicle Assembly Building, Mobile Launcher and the Crawler-Transporter. The Mobile Launcher consists of (1) a two-story base that is the platform for the rocket and (2) a tower equipped with a number of connection lines, called umbilicals, and launch accessories that will provide SLS and Orion with power, communications, coolant, fuel, and stabilization prior to launch. During preparations for launch, the Crawler-Transporter will pick up and move the Mobile Launcher into the Vehicle Assembly Building. Inside the Vehicle Assembly Building, NASA will stack the SLS and Orion vehicle on the Mobile Launcher and complete integration for launch. Before launch, the Crawler-Transporter will carry the Mobile Launcher with SLS and Orion to the launch pad where engineers will lower the Mobile Launcher on to the pad and remove the Crawler-Transporter. During launch, each umbilical and launch accessory will release from its connection point, allowing the rocket and spacecraft to lift off from the launch pad. Figure 2 is a picture of the Mobile Launcher positioned on top of the Crawler-Transporter outside of the Vehicle Assembly Building. During Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1), the SLS vehicle is to launch an uncrewed Orion to a distant orbit some 70,000 kilometers beyond the Moon. All three programs--SLS, Orion, and EGS--must be ready on or before the EM-1 launch readiness date to support this integrated test flight. Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) will be a 10- to 14-day crewed flight with up to four astronauts that will orbit the moon and return to Earth to demonstrate the baseline Orion vehicle capability. NASA establishes an agency baseline commitment\u2014the cost and schedule baselines against which the program may be measured\u2014for all projects that have a total life cycle cost of $250 million or more. A rebaseline is a process initiated if the NASA Administrator determines the development cost growth is more than 30 percent of the estimate provided in the baseline of the report, or if other events make a rebaseline appropriate. A replan is a process generally driven by changes in program or project cost parameters, such as if development cost growth is 15 percent or more of the estimate in the baseline report or a major milestone is delayed by 6 months or more from the baseline date. A replan does not require a new project baseline to be established. When the NASA Administrator determines that development cost growth is likely to exceed the development cost estimate by 15 percent or more, or a program milestone is likely to be delayed from the baseline\u2019s date by 6 months or more, NASA must submit a report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Should a program exceed its development cost baseline by more than 30 percent, the program must be reauthorized by the Congress and rebaselined in order for the contractor to continue work beyond a specified time frame. NASA tied the SLS and EGS program cost and schedule baselines to the uncrewed EM-1 mission and the Orion program\u2019s cost and schedule baselines to EM-2. Over the past 5 years, we have issued several reports assessing the progress of NASA\u2019s human space exploration programs relative to their agency baseline commitments. In April 2017, we found that given the combined effects of ongoing technical challenges in conjunction with limited cost and schedule reserves, it was unlikely that these programs would achieve the committed November 2018 launch readiness date. We recommended that NASA confirm whether this launch readiness date was achievable and, if warranted, propose a new, more realistic EM-1 date and report to Congress on the results of its schedule analysis. NASA agreed with both recommendations and stated that it was no longer in its best interest to COMMERCIAL LAUNCH SYSTEMS CHALLENGE NASA to Focus Resources on Commercial Partnerships, GAO-18-7, Nov", "\"When the discussion about opioids and Part D first occurred, plans were eager to be helpful.

There has been slow adoption by prescribers and pharmacies in enrolling and using the program, and coverage varies drastically by state. Even though opioids are a major area of health care concern, the use of medication lock-in arrangements by Medicare is limited, in part, by limited data on its benefits. Additionally, Medicare case management is largely dependent on the clinical judgment of the prescription drug plan, and there is inconsistency in case management across plans. As there is still much to be learned about how prescription monitoring programs affect prescribing practices and the role that case management plays in mitigating opioid misuse, this report will likely inform future changes to Medicare policy.", "Air Force officials are now planning to develop ABMS as a multidomain, network-centric command and control system that will support JADC2 efforts to enhance capabilities across all warfighting domains. The Air Force\u2019s approach represents a significant change in how the department is developing and acquiring command and control capabilities. The Air Force has canceled or terminated programs that were intended to support ABMS but determined that they no longer aligned with its new vision for JADC2 and ABMS. Instead of recapitalizing JSTARS, the Air Force is pursuing a software application\u2014called JSTARS Link 16\u2014to exploit the JSTARS radar on newer platforms to provide improved information and situational awareness. The Air Force is also exploring using non-Air Force assets to meet ABMS requirements for increased situational awareness and command and control, such as commercial aircraft and small satellites. The Air Force also intends to use small experimental platforms and demonstrations to develop and mature the key technologies that will ultimately form ABMS. In addition, the Air Force is exploring the use of Agile Development methodologies on ABMS programs in order to test, revise, and ultimately deliver software products rapidly to the warfighter. Air Force officials expect initial ABMS capabilities to become available to the warfighter by the end of fiscal year 2020. (author: Jennifer J.

Program officials estimate that the F-35 will cost nearly $406 billion by 2041, excluding the program\u2019s operating and modernization costs. However, in our March 2020 report, we identified the costs for operating and sustaining the aircraft were $10.7 billion higher than previously reported. Based on our analysis, as of March 2020, these program costs totaled $387.9 billion, which when including the costs for operating and sustaining the aircraft, equals nearly $398.6 billion. DOD has also estimated that the F-35 will accrue nearly $16 billion annually in operating and sustaining costs from 2028 through 2041. We also reported that the F-35 program has had significant operational testing delays that has limited the program\u2019s ability to field the aircraft. These testing delays have also impacted the F-35 Program\u2019s planned operational tests, which were supposed to identify the remaining problems or deficiencies to determine the operational capabilities of the F-35 aircraft. This delay will continue to hamper the F-35 Program\u2019s F-35A Combat Air Force\u2019s (CSAF) future operational test efforts. In our most recent work, we also reported in May 2019 that the F-35 program has demonstrated some of its key capabilities using an operational scenario. The scenario had the aircraft engaging in joint air combat mission using simulated threats, air traffic control services, and other key capabilities as the aircraft flew against a simulated enemy. However, this scenario was based on testing that included 70 percent mock targets with no real combat aircraft or radar threats. Without real threats, these tests have limited relevance to demonstrating the aircraft\u2019s actual combat capabilities. We will continue to monitor the operational testing of the F-35 program; as this testing is a key requirement that, if done correctly, will help identify the F-35 program\u2019s remaining operational capabilities and deficiencies to better define future operational tests. Given the importance of the F-35 program to national security, it is important that the program continues to address the program\u2019s most critical problems and develop plans to transition the system into sustainment, modernization, and ongoing improvement cycles.", "This text outlines the Secret Service\u2019s responsibilities both in terms of protection and criminal investigations, as well as its organizational structure.

TEXT: recipients may be provided with USDA excess property. Generally, the handbooks also describe how the property is sold, transferred or converted to personal property or destroyed. For example, sub- agency personnel are responsible for notifying property recipients of the required delivery cost of any equipment they donate. The handbooks require sub- agency personnel to document how donated property is used, the dollar amount value transferred or the cost for which it is sold. For example, all recipients receiving donated property under these policies must sign a receipt documenting the value given to the agency by the recipient for donated property. These handbooks also contain the sub- agency\u2019s internal screening process during the screening phase and its external program once it becomes excess. DOE uses policy and guidance for the DOE Federal Surplus Property Program. DOE\u2019s policy provides guidance on the management of surplus property. It also describes when each DOE lab is to conduct its internal screening and inventory. Finally, it outlines the DOE\u2019s external program, which includes two parts: the first is provided by the DOE property control officers (PCOs), and the second is provided by designated recipients under 10 CFR 1018. Under Part I, the PCOs provide property at no cost to eligible and approved recipients. In providing excess property, the PCOs give priority to approved educational institutions, agencies of a state, political subdivision thereof, or a recognized Indian tribe, the federal Government itself, and agencies of any state or political subdivision thereof, as long as the property is to be used exclusively for public purposes for which each agency is authorized. These items have already been made available by the PCOs. Under Part II, recipients pay sales proceeds of 50 percent up front and the PCO returns 3 years after the sale. The recipient cannot change the originally authorized purpose of the use of the property, except for a new contract. For example, this contract may have been terminated because the intended use of the property was changed significantly or the recipient can no longer use the equipment. DOE uses a variety of outlets, but it primarily uses GSAXcess to provide excess property to federal agencies and non-federal educational recipients. Under its general policy, DOE\u2019s internal screening of property occurs concurrently with its lab sites, using DOE\u2019s property data management systems, GSAXcess, and the Federal Surplus Personal Property System (SURPLUS). Property identified as excess by a DOE lab is then cataloged for internal screening, and the screening results are entered into GSAXcess by the DOE lab sites. Agencies with independent authorities and programs provided excess property to non-federal recipients in a variety of ways. These include GSA assisted sales through GSAXcess auctions, direct sales, donations to recognized nonprofit organizations, donations to disaster relief agencies and disaster survivors, direct donations to local, state and tribal governments and eligible charities, and grants or contracts with eligible non-federal recipients. A table (table 1) summarizes the agencies\u2019 programs.\nWhat impact does the Federal Surplus Personal Property Program have on non-federal recipients receiving excess property under this program?\nAs an AI language model, I cannot speculate or give opinions on the impact of a program. However, the Federal Surplus Personal Property Program allows eligible non-federal recipients to acquire excess government property for their own use and for the use by their eligible sub- recipients and end-users.

T3\u2019s Self-Reliance Team used the results of the USAID reform plan development process to establish a definition for self-reliance that is compatible with USAID\u2019s core mission. According to T3 officials, this definition includes the host country\u2019s capacity to plan, lead, finance, and implement solutions to solve its own development challenges. After completing two rounds of data exchanges with USAID bureaus and operating units in September and October 2018, the team plans to launch pilot self-reliance assessments in 3 countries\u2014Kenya, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic\u2014by the end of fiscal year 2019. Further, the T3 leadership team developed a list of metrics, and is working with staff and stakeholders to assess their alignment with and ability to capture USAID\u2019s self-reliance efforts. Specifically, the list includes 18 metrics organized under 4 domains that include measuring USAID performance aligned with the Journey to Self-Reliance objective and measuring performance that could enable USAID to effectively support other parts of a bilateral partnership. For each metric, USAID is collecting existing data and exploring whether new data might be needed to fully measure self-reliance. T3 plans to continue refining and validating the metrics list and will collaborate with stakeholders, including foreign governments, donors, and other partners, to better understand their priorities as USAID develops its self-reliance measurement tools and processes. In our assessment of USAID\u2019s reform effort, the 12 reform projects that fall within our self-reliance practice largely involve efforts to reduce USAID\u2019s footprint on foreign assistance provision. However, while reform efforts are underway in other practices identified as critical to reform success, we did not see evidence of those practices being applied to self-reliance. For example: USAID did not demonstrate or promote its commitment to self-reliance by developing strong partnerships with other U.S. government entities, stakeholders or by conducting analyses of the current environment in bilateral partner countries. T3, through the Self-Reliance team, sought input from stakeholders on indicators they would like to see included in measuring self-reliance. However, according to USAID officials, this was a limited survey and the team is currently conducting interviews with a broader range of stakeholders. Overall, T3 conducted some self-reliance activities, but the agency did not demonstrate an agency-wide commitment to the Journey to Self-Reliance objective. We did not assess any significant barriers to self-reliance. While USAID has some internal impediments to self-reliance, such as its historical dependence on mission personnel\u2014to implement its missions\u2014this was not cited as a major barrier to achieving the goal of the journey to self-reliance. In short, USAID may have not fully met the requirements related to self-reliance reform efforts in our assessment process.", "\u201c[L]arger projects are defined as those projects that are anticipated by FEMA, in consultation with the State or Territory, to involve an estimated funding request from the Federal Government in excess of the threshold amount of $150,000.

Table 3 provides a listing of the major documents used to establish U.S. military strategy and posture. Strategic Guidance and Analytic Support for Joint Force Development The SSA products are designed to establish a common basis for supporting force structure decisions. Thus, SSA products are intended to provide military leaders with an objective means to judge and compare proposals for force structure changes. In addition to the SSA products, another analytic tool DOD uses is the Joint Analysis of Alternatives (JAoA). A JAoA is a qualitative analysis of an alternative approach to providing military capabilities. It is intended to provide senior leaders with a better sense of how their desired military capabilities can be achieved. DOD guidance notes that JAoAs are an essential input into the planning and budget process, and can serve as a foundation for developing requirements for new or modified forces. One of the key uses of JAoAs is to provide a set of alternative investment plans to offset DOD\u2019s expected near-term budget shortfalls relative to the defense strategy. These alternative investment plans would allow U.S. forces to meet their objectives with acceptable risk and under budget. The JAoA would show the trade-offs in meeting the objectives for capability in such areas as readiness and modernization that result from the different plans. In a JAoA, the goal is to ensure that alternative approaches are thoroughly explored, even if they seem improbable or unattractive. The JAoA process examines alternatives at three levels. The first level is to identify alternative strategies\u2014alternatives are often not feasible, feasible, or a hybrid of both feasible and not feasible alternatives. At this level, it is essential to recognize that some alternatives are simply infeasible, perhaps requiring unrealistic funding levels, development of new capabilities beyond DOD\u2019s capacity, or unrealistic operational changes. JAoAs are intended to identify potential infeasible alternatives with the goal of eliminating them early in the analysis. JAoAs are then expanded to develop feasible alternative approaches and capabilities that could be used to meet the defense strategy. As discussed below, DOD is working on a major JAoA analysis intended to identify new approaches and capabilities to help senior leaders balance strategic objectives with fiscal constraints. Figure 3 shows the basic structure of a JAoA analysis. Figure 4 illustrates a JAoA in action. To summarize, SSA products are intended to provide a common foundation for identifying force structure options that will allow DOD to meet its strategic requirements with acceptable risk, and JAoAs are intended to explore alternative approaches and capabilities that will allow DOD to achieve its objectives with acceptable risk within fiscal constraints. Both SSA and JAoA processes are intended to be integrated and mutually reinforcing. As a result, the DOD officials we spoke with noted several times that JAoA analysis was to \u201cfeed on\u201d SSA products, so we explored whether and where that had occurred. The SSA and JAoA Analysis of Options for the NDS The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) called for a major force posture adjustment to meet growing international threats. Specifically, the NDS called for expanding U.S. military capabilities to the Indo-Pacific region and maintaining sufficient capability in Europe and the Middle East to meet U.S. commitments, all under fiscal constraints. The fiscal constraints come in large part from the Budget Control Act of 2011, known as the \u201csequester,\u201d which caps funding for DOD through 2021. DOD\u2019s 2020 budget requests $733 billion, an increase of 3.1 percent over the fiscal year 2019 appropriation of $715 billion, which itself increased 3.4 percent over the preceding fiscal year. Figure 5 shows the funding sources for fiscal year 2019, the current fiscal year. Of the total funding, $602 billion comes from the base budget, while the Defense Overseas Contingency Operation or supplemental funding provides $41 billion. Overseas contingency funding is intended to cover combat pay and benefits, equipment and deployment costs, and the repair, maintenance, refitting, and upgrading of equipment used in combat zones or to support military operations. Supplemental funding is intended to be temporary, covering unexpected or one-time costs. To meet its strategic objectives, DOD may take a number of force structure steps to adjust to different international threat scenarios, including: \u2022 Modernizing the force by investing in newer weapon systems;", "How does the U.S. airline industry work? What are some of the IT systems that are essential for an airline\u2019s operation? What are some of the challenges that airlines face in maintaining or improving their IT systems? And what is the impact of IT system outages on passengers and airlines alike? Read the full report at\n- 4 -\nan extended period compared to the situation that would have occurred if all flights were operating on schedule. However, if delays to all flights arriving at or departing from a particular airport pile up, a ripple effect could develop and, in theory, lead to congestion. To combat this possibility, FAA has developed contingency plans that call for FAA officials at a particular airport to consider, among other measures, the use of a different runway if a scheduled flight must be redirected. Such alternate runway use could mitigate the risk of the airport exceeding its capacity, according to an FAA official. In addition, FAA officials we met with suggested that, for the most part, IT-related delays tend to be shorter than weather-related delays. While longer delays may also occur\u2014for example, if a crew cannot be positioned because its members become timed out, FAA does not consider IT-related delays to have the same likelihood of cascading across multiple airports or regions that weather-related delays may have, an FAA official explained. Despite these explanations, aviation stakeholders and a GAO report we issued in 2013 indicated that IT-related delays occurred at various airports across the country\u2014including San Francisco International Airport, New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. Some stakeholders also suggested that the length and frequency of IT-related delays may be underestimated because they may not meet the definition of \u201ccontroller-related delays.\u201d (See fig. 2.)\nThe Airline Industry is Going Through a Transformation, Which Poses Additional Challenges to IT Systems\nFigure 1: Some effects of airline IT outages on customers and airlines\nTravelers suffer indirect costs as their itineraries are delayed or canceled.\nCANCELED OR DELAYED FLIGHTS & INCONVENIENCES\nFewer crews available to operate other flights.\nFAA\nMore passengers seeking additional assistance.\nFAA\nMore passengers missing connections.\nFAA\nMore passengers needing hotel or other accommodations.\nFAA\nCANCELED FLIGHTS LONGER WAIT TIMES LONGER WAIT TIMES\nFAA, AIRLINES, PASSENGERS\nMore flights scheduled in the future need crew and aircraft\nAIRLINES\nCancelled or delayed flights disrupts operations.\nAIRLINES\nCancelled or delayed flights disrupts operations.\nAIRLINES\nFigure 2: Percentages of Flights Affected by Airline IT Outage Categories (by number of flights)\nAirline IT Outages\nSource of Delay\nOther\nController-related delays\nTechnology-related delays\nRunway closures, construction, adverse weather, etc.\nAirspace closures, high traffic volume, etc.\nAirports (including FAA centers)\nSource: GAO analysis of FAA data from December 2009 to August 2013.

When FAA receives information indicating that an individual weather-related delay stems from an IT-related cause, FAA requires airlines to reclassify the weather-related delay for FAA\u2019s tracking purposes using a specific IT-related category. For example, in the case of the FAA-developed operational data record at a particular airport, we were told that if data indicate a weather-related delay, an airline would have to provide additional information indicating that the delay was caused by an IT-related outage\u2014such information may include a narrative provided by an IT-affected carrier or notes from an airline in its computer application indicating a weather-related delay that FAA knew to be caused by an IT-related outage, among other things. According to an FAA official, with this information in hand, FAA can begin determining the extent of the ripple effect the outage had on operations at other airports. To be clear, FAA officials noted that airports do not typically ask for more detailed information than they ordinarily would because no weather-related delays are needed\u2014only the fact that an IT-related delay occurred is sufficient for FAA\u2019s tracking purposes related to IT-related outages.", "You are an expert at summarization.

The purpose of the report was to summarize a topic selected by the Committee. BACKGROUND The White House Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform was created by signing into law P.L. 111-139, the \u201cStatutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010\u201d on February 5, 2010, which authorized the establishment and activities of the commission. The report of the Commission, released on December 1, 2010, identified policy options including spending cuts, tax reform and revenue increases required to put the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscals on a sustainable path. In December 2010, Congress passed the Commission \u201cRecommendations Implementation Act of 2010\u201d (H.R. 4244). Section 102 of H.R. 4244 required OMB to \u201cdesign an annual report to Congress for submission in February 2011 and annually thereafter. The report shall include a list of at least 50 specific government activities and programs described in each report of the Commission, each of which should be reevaluated, restructured, eliminated, consolidated, or improved by the Obama Administration in ways that substantially reduce their costs, reduce their impact on the national economy, or improve their performance \u2026.\u201d According to a January 17, 2011, Memo from OMB Deputy Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the recommendations in the December 2011 report were classified as either \u201cImplementation Priority\u201d or \u201cOther.\u201d \u201cImplementation Priority\u201d recommendations are those that OMB believed could be implemented largely through executive action, and in most cases required no additional legislative authority. Each \u201cImplementation Priority\u201d recommendation has a designated \u201cimplementing agency\u201d with responsibility to develop specific details to support implementation. The following text summarizes the status of the 10 recommendations that were classified as \u201cImplementation Priority.\u201d It is not intended to comprehensively cover all of OMB\u2019s activities and initiatives on all recommendations, including those classified as \u201cOther.\u201d RECOMMENDATION: Report to Congress on Opportunities to Address Government Overlap in the Federal Real Estate Portfolio: Pursuant to the Congressional Budget Reduction and Investment Act (PL 112-25) [H.R. 2 of the 112th Congress], the Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall submit to the President and Congress \u2014 a report identifying agencies and programs that fund a research (or any associated infrastructure) and determine which, if any, are duplicative of other programs with the same or similar mission. STATUS: Open In its January 17, 2011, report to Congress, OMB stated that GAO and agencies had been actively engaged in activities related to identifying and consolidating government real estate holdings and that these efforts were ongoing. OMB indicated that it looked forward to sharing additional details from these efforts with the Administration and Congress. This issue is not explicitly addressed in recent or ongoing reports. In an August 2011 report to Congress, GAO reported that it did have a study underway on duplication in the federal real estate portfolio, but that limited data was available at the time and that further effort and stakeholder engagement was needed to identify the extent of duplication. GAO stated that the study would evaluate agencies\u2019 efforts to consolidate real estate assets and reduce their footprint across the Federal Government and consider possible steps that could be taken by the Federal Government to reduce the size and number of its real estate holdings. In June 2012 and June 2013, GAO issued separate reports identifying the results of the study GAO had underway on duplication in the real estate portfolio. However, these reports did not specifically address duplication in the federal real estate portfolio. In January and March 2014 and in November 2015, GAO updated these reports. A November 2013 GAO report stated that GAO had updated these reports with new criteria and methodology to evaluate duplication and that, to date, GAO\u2019s analysis had focused on opportunities to identify potentially duplicative laboratory and data center facilities at different agencies. In June 2017, GAO issued its latest report titled Real Property Management: Opportunity for Improved Planning, Reporting, and Accountability. In this report, GAO stated that it \u201cmade two major recommendations in this report. First, we recommend that the Administration work with agencies to develop and implement an updated strategic plan for federal real property that addresses its declining conditions and maintenance deficiencies. Second, we recommend that agencies improve information on their real property management policies and activities to track their progress in addressing facility conditions.\u201d In addition, the report identifies data limitations in the Governmentwide Property Management Information Database (PEPPM-IP) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the federal government\u2019s real property management. Additionally, HUD\u2019s Strategic Plan for FY2018-2022 includes a specific commitment to identify cost savings through sharing or consolidation of real estate resources.

The EEOC final rule adopted in January 2017 requires the use of a revised disability category that combines two existing categories used for the purpose of affirmative action plan identification of disabled veterans and disabled federal contracting. This new category includes more than just a diagnosis to identify a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. It includes 14 more categories, each with a specific list of impairments, which also can require substantial accommodation to work. According to OPM officials, the EEOC final rule has had an impact on federal agencies\u2019 hiring and retention of disabled individuals. As a result of EEOC\u2019s January 2017 Final Rule, requiring agencies to engage in affirmative action for individuals with disabilities, OPM directed agencies to identify the targeted and non-targeted disability categories for which agencies may establish hiring goals. The final rule states that an agency must have at least 12 month\u2019s of completed data, prior to engaging in affirmative action, on the number of individuals with targeted and non-targeted disabilities, hired by each agency on an annual basis during the last 3 years. Agencies are required to have 5 targeted disability categories identified by January 2019, for which they will set a hiring goal. These agencies will also be required to identify other targeted and non-targeted disabilities. By January 2020, 40 to 45 percent of the new hires by each federal agency must be persons with disabilities, including individuals with targeted and other disabilities. The EEOC final rule also requires agencies to establish employment goals based on availability data. Non-availability data (e.g. disabled employees leaving, death, retirement) must be subtracted from the availability data. According to OPM officials, agencies are setting goals using non-availability data, which include data on the number of persons with targeted disability that resigned, were separated or died, and retired during the applicable timeframe. Additionally, according to data provided by OPM and analyzed by its inspector general, the goal for the 5 targeted disability categories is to have 16,513 new hires who are individuals with targeted disabilities by fiscal year 2020. The final year for which the annual reporting will be required is fiscal year 2019. The final rule also requires agencies to set hiring goals for non-targeted disabilities, as well as to provide personal assistance services to targeted individuals with disabilities who have significant difficulty in performing their jobs. The federal government\u2019s effort to increase the employment of persons with disabilities has experienced several transitions in the last 8 years. For example, until August 2000, Executive Order 13163 required agencies to develop plans to increase the federal workforce with targeted disabilities. Then in September 2000, this order was amended and further strengthened by Executive Order 13225, which directed agencies to develop affirmative action plans. In October 2003, the President released Executive Order 13360, which amended Executive Order 13078\u2014the original order on affirmative action for individuals with disabilities in the federal sector. Executive Order 13360 directed the three designated agencies\u2014OPM, EEOC, and Labor\u2014to develop model plans for agencies to follow in adopting affirmative action plans to hire persons with disabilities. In July 2006, the order was superseded to the extent that it affected employees with targeted disabilities by EO 13330, as amended by EO 13836, which continued the direction of the executive order. In 2009, EEOC published the first affirmative action rule to cover individuals with disabilities that has since been updated. In 2010, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued final regulations that addressed the hiring and employment of persons with disabilities in the federal government work force, according to EEOC staff involved with the development of the rule. These regulations amended existing regulations and established clear guidance and requirements with which federal agencies are expected to comply when developing and implementing affirmative action plans to ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities have full opportunities to participate in the federal workforce. As an implementation of a 2009 executive order, OPM, EEOC, and Labor have had roles in advancing the hiring and retention of persons with disabilities in the federal government\u2019s workforce. The final EEOC rule in January 2017 required agencies to engage in affirmative action to persons with disabilities, establish hiring goals, and provide personal assistance services when needed. To implement the rule, OPM had been assigned specific roles together with EEOC and Labor, such as monitoring agency plans and providing mandatory training to federal agencies. In addition, OPM continued to work with Labor & OMB to supervise federal agencies on their hiring of persons with disabilities, especially in coordinating efforts for job placement and return-to-work. (Title)", "TEXT TO SUMMARIZE HERE 12 months to determine whether it meets or exceeds BLM\u2019s minimum bond requirements and conduct ad hoc reviews if a field office receives information that indicates that an existing bond might not cover the minimum amount for reclamation. BLM also encouraged BLM staff to consider local and industry reclamation practices, recent BLM reclamation cost estimates, and other information when evaluating a bond\u2019s adequacy. After field office staff conducted the review, they were to record their findings in BLM\u2019s Automated Land and Mineral Record System and make a recommendation, which could include increasing the bond amount or requesting the operator to submit a certified statement explaining, among other things, any reasons that the existing bond might not meet BLM\u2019s reclamation cost estimate. BLM\u2019s July 2013 policy, however, did not include specific information on the criteria used to determine which bonds the field offices should review, and there was no centralized location in BLM headquarters to track the results of bond review. Moreover, BLM\u2019s July 2013 policy provided conflicting guidance regarding how BLM staff were to document their review of a bond\u2019s adequacy. For example, it stated that field offices were to use a checkbox provided in the Automated Land and Mineral Record System to record the results of the bond review as \u201cadequate,\u201d and if a bond was found to be inadequate, the field office was to complete form 3320-8 to request bond increase. However, the instructions for form 3320-8 contained conflicting provisions regarding what types of documentation to submit. For example, under section I on the first page, it stated that attachments to the form were to \u201cinclude detailed information about the need to increase the bond,\u201d but in section IV, it simply referred to \u201cattach a certified statement explaining any reasons the existing bond might not meet BLM\u2019s reclamation cost estimate\u201d without providing additional guidance. Moreover, the 2013 bond adequacy review policy did not contain any metrics to monitor how field offices were meeting its requirements for conducting reviews or increasing bonds. The net effect of the guidance was a lack of clarity and consistency among BLM field offices in their application of the policy, and the lack of consistent and standardized data on the results of the bond adequacy reviews further contributed to the overall difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of BLM\u2019s bond management tools. In 2017, BLM made changes to the bonding program in its regulations that could improve its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibility to protect and reclaim federally owned minerals. The changes require BLM to increase the minimum bond amount and to take other actions to mitigate risks to the bond pool, such as collecting bonds at the time that BLM processes leasing paperwork, evaluating the operator\u2019s performance history in making timely payments to BLM during production, and using other tools provided by new regulations to require reclamation. However, BLM must implement these changes carefully because they may require additional resources and increase industry cost of doing business with BLM. BLM\u2019s bond policies need to provide BLM consistent and standardized criteria for determining which bonds require further analysis or possible increases, track the status and results of the bond reviews, and report periodically on the effectiveness of its bond management tools. Implementing these changes may position BLM better to provide protection against losses from incomplete reclamation on federally owned lands. (See figure 3.) Incomplete Reclamation. Most of the more than 6,600 inactive wells on BLM-administered lands that we examined were not reclaimed properly, and most were classified as high risk because they were abandoned well sites where there was evidence of surface disturbance, such as bare soil, holes, and debris. We found BLM\u2019s current tools for identifying high-risk wells to be limited in scope, because BLM relies on the well operator to accurately and promptly report well status and to provide accurate information from well site inspections. Operators provide the well status information to BLM through the Automated Land and Mineral Record System. However, after our 2012 report, BLM took steps to improve its oversight of operators and the accuracy of well status data. BLM has also begun developing a program to assign risk scores to wells\u2014ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 representing lowest risk\u2014based on the combination of risk factors associated with their status and characteristics. This program could help BLM prioritize its efforts. At the end of fiscal year 2017, BLM had not yet fully defined the characteristics and weightings for the risk score system as it continues developing it. BLM\u2019s Office of Natural Resources Revenue estimates that $19.3 million in unpaid assessments may be related to inactive wells\u2014a small portion of BLM\u2019s $29 billion in outstanding receivables. Unpaid Assessments from Inactive Wells. One indicator of BLM\u2019s effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibility to protect and reclaim federally leased lands is its collection of bonding requirements. Bonding requirements ensure that operators will have sufficient funds to reclaim their wells and sites, but BLM may have difficulty collecting outstanding assessments owed by operators who have completed reclamation efforts and may no longer have funds to repay outstanding assessments.", "", "This page contains some texts regarding a DOD report on the implementation of section 9 1 1 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA), also known as the \u2018DoD 2017 Civilian Personnel Law Modernization Act\u2019.

The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) requires government agencies to estimate improper payments, and CMS ensures that the estimates are compliant with IPIA guidelines. Medical reviews of claims submitted from providers are used to estimate improper payments based on the criteria of IPIA for both Medicare FFS and Medicaid programs. Due to the increase in insufficient documentation errors since 2009, further changes to CMS policies and documentation requirements may be necessary to reduce improper payments.\nThe main differences between Medicare FFS and Medicaid are their insurance coverage policies and payment methods. Medicare is a federal program that pays for medical expenses for people aged 65 or older and people with certain disabilities. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health care coverage for low-income individuals and families. In terms of the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA), which requires government agencies to estimate improper payments, both programs meet all statutory guidelines and their estimates are compliant with IPIA guidelines. Medical reviews of claims submitted from providers are used to estimate improper payments for both programs. The main difference between the two programs in terms of improper payments identified through medical reviews is related to documentation errors. Medicare FFS improper payments stemming from insufficient documentation have increased substantially since 2009. The authors conclude that further changes to CMS policies and documentation requirements may be necessary to reduce improper payments in the future.", "PEP AND OTHER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES a later date before an immigration judge. Arrests with mandatory detention ICE maintains some discretion in how it uses its limited detention funding; it prioritizes detention of individuals within its custody who have a high likelihood of being removed. All aliens apprehended who are detained for immigration-related reasons are required to undergo risk assessments under agency protocols. As noted, ICE conducts risk assessments to prioritize detention among a pool of arrestees. The assessment includes an analysis of several factors, including an alien\u2019s criminal history, the existence of prior orders of removal, prior immigration violations (such as immigration history, prior detentions, and number of prior voluntary removal orders), as well as certain protective factors, such as a health issue, documented physical or mental disabilities, length of unlawful presence, and family ties. After an arrestee undergoes the risk assessment, an officer makes a custody decision using the information garnered from that assessment. ICE, however, does not have enough detention space to meet the current level of demand, so it maintains an active portfolio of ATDs for individuals who pose a low flight risk but who cannot be released outright or into the community on a supervised release. ICE also utilizes commercial bed space to house removable aliens. If an arrestee is detained and subjected to mandatory detention, ICE would release them from detention if: (1) they are required to be detained pending their scheduled removal proceedings; (2) they are entitled to parole for reasons such as an emergency medical situation or (3) they are the family member of a military personnel who has served in combat during certain time periods. ICE also seeks to release, on appropriate conditions, individuals who are determined not to be flight risks or a danger to public safety. ICE may release aliens on their own recognizance; supervision; electronic monitoring; or may use a combination of these tools. ICE has the authority to release aliens in its custody on bond in certain circumstances. ICE uses two types of bonds: delivery bonds and surety bonds. Delivery bonds require aliens who are already out of custody and whose removal proceedings are pending to report to ICE as directed. Surety bonds are secured by sureties, individuals who agree to pay a certain amount of money to ICE should the alien skip a hearing and deport proceedings. If an alien is ordered removed, ICE is authorized to seek a removal order and place them in removal proceedings. Immigration Courts. U.S. immigration courts are responsible for conducting removal proceedings to remove an alien from the United States. Removal Proceedings. Removal proceedings are brought in immigration court and an Immigration Judge (IJ) presides over the hearing. Removal proceedings are an adversarial process before the court. In removal proceedings, the Government acts as prosecutor, seeking removal orders against aliens who are found removable. The Government\u2019s removal charges must be based on one of the categories listed in the INA and supported by credible information to show that the individual falls within any of these categories. Under these categories, the Government must prove the (1) the alien is an arriving alien subject to the one year and one day filing deadline under section 235(b) of the INA; (2) the alien is not a lawful permanent resident and has committed a \u201cspecified offense\u201d and the Government must prove that the alien did not plead guilty and did not spend at least five years in prison for the offense; (3) the alien is a criminal alien because they have been convicted of certain crimes; (4) the alien is a public safety or national security risk because they have been convicted of certain crimes; or (5) the alien has violated any prior removal order. ERO must serve a copy of the NTA on the alien, and, unless waived, the copy must detail the factual and legal bases for removal. The NTA contains the alien\u2019s right to counsel and to a review by an appeals board. Detention Prior to Removal The INA authorizes the Secretary of DHS, in his or her discretion, to detain noncitizens under various provisions, including arrival, bond, and parole authority. The INA permits ERO to release an arriving alien on bond in order to process or apply to have them placed on parole. Arriving aliens must establish that they are clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted as legal permanent residents. To establish this entitlement, INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139 (1981). The Government is not required to show by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Id. Noncitizens detained under section 235(b) of the INA have an absolute right to apply for bond after six months in detention, while those released from ICE custody have a conditional right to apply for bond after three days in ICE custody.

DOD acquires wideband capacity through two methods: DOD purpose-built: DOD obtains some of its SATCOM through its purpose-built systems, which include Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites. While DOD awards contracts to commercial companies to build these systems, the department is responsible for the systems\u2019 procurement, operations and sustainment; therefore, they are considered purpose-built. Commercial contracts: DOD also purchases commercial SATCOM services to supplement its purpose-built systems, such as for satisfying users who have needs beyond available military satellite resources, supporting training on ground systems, or meeting the needs of unique users. In these cases, DOD acquires commercial SATCOM bandwidth through several competitively selected vendors, who are responsible for operating and sustaining their own systems. Military SATCOM architectures fall into three types: protected, which provides secure, assured communications; wideband, which supports worldwide capacity for high data rate communications, including high-quality voice and imagery; and narrowband, which provides reliable and secure communications less vulnerable to adverse weather conditions or other physical limitations, such as distance, dense foliage, and terrain. DOD\u2019s primary wideband satellite communications system, WGS, currently provides a portion of DOD\u2019s required SATCOM bandwidth, but the Air Force estimates its satellite constellation\u2019s capabilities will begin to degrade in the late 2020s. The Air Force is adding at least one more satellite to the WGS constellation and plans for an enhanced WGS-11 to provide the capacity of two satellites. During the Wideband AOA, DOD estimated that adding this satellite to the constellation would extend the availability of wideband communications to 2031. According to the Air Force, there is potential for adding a 12th WGS satellite to the constellation. Like other types of space systems, DOD\u2019s wideband SATCOM systems generally involve four types of interrelated segments that make a space capability fully functional. As illustrated in figure 1, they include (1) the space segment\u2014namely the satellites; (2) the ground segment, with network services and also including satellite and payload control systems and data processing subsystems and facilities; (3) user equipment, such as radios, terminals, and routers needed by the warfighter to use the capability; and (4) launch vehicles and facilities. Within the space segment, satellites operate in several different types of orbits to meet different communication and mission needs, as shown in figure 2. The orbital location of a satellite can affect its capacity to transmit data, or what parts of the Earth can receive its signal. For example, highly elliptical orbits are necessary for providing long dwell times over northern latitudes due to the curvature of the Earth, while other orbits cover remaining latitudes. Wideband satellites operate in different radio frequency spectrum bands. DOD typically relies on C, X, Ku, and Ka-bands to provide wideband connectivity, determined by where and how users are operating. Each of these frequency bands has advantages and disadvantages for various applications. Satellite transponders operating at the lower C-band frequencies are less susceptible to degradation from rain than other bands. In the United States, the X-band is specifically designated for use by the U.S. government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Ku-band operates at higher frequencies and can communicate with smaller antennas and offer more flexibility. The still-higher-frequency Ka-band satellites can transmit more data than C, X, and Ku-band satellites, but their signals are more susceptible to degradation from water vapor and rain than satellites in lower frequency bands. Commercial satellite communication providers have historically operated primarily in the Ku-band but are now expanding services in the Ka-band to offer higher data rates. An AOA is a key first step in DOD\u2019s acquisition process and assesses alternative solutions for addressing future needs. DOD acquisition guidance provides the purpose and procedures associated with conducting an AOA to support decision making. DOD experts in areas such as cost estimating, technological analysis, and acquisitions, along with military and commercial stakeholders, comprise the AOA study team. The study team is involved in the day-to-day work of the AOA process and conducts the analyses that form the foundation of the assessment. During the AOA study period, the study team develops alternatives to satisfy capability gaps that they assess against pre-established performance requirements. We have identified 22 best practices for an AOA process. Of these, 6 best practices are associated with a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d AOA. Comprehensive means that the AOA process ensures that the mission need is defined in a way to allow for a robust set of alternatives, that no alternatives are omitted, and that each alternative is examined thoroughly for the project\u2019s entire life cycle. Without a clearly defined mission need DOD does not have an understanding of SATCOM requirements for the future and therefore cannot effectively", "Your text is too long to be summarized here.

In line with its strategic plan, BLS aims to make these estimates as accurate as possible, meaning that they reflect the average level of price inflation for a selected group of consumers. The accuracy of a price index can be assessed in multiple ways, such as the extent to which the index applies appropriate formulas to data that are complete and drawn from sufficiently large samples covering the relevant group of people. BLS bases its collection of these data on the population covered by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). BLS then uses data collected for the CPI-U to produce three other price indexes. After introducing the CPI-U as its primary, or headline, index, BLS maintained a separate data collection for the CPI-W from 1978 through 1980 but found little difference between data for CPI-W and CPI-U. According to BLS, as a result of this and budgetary issues, BLS stopped collecting separate data for the CPI-W in 1981 and began using CPI-U data to derive the CPI-W. To create the CPI-U, BLS chooses a sample of outlets (e.g., stores or internet sites) at which the CPI-U population shops (see fig. 1 for more information on how BLS creates price indexes). BLS then collects price data at these outlets for goods and services the CPI-U population buys and uses the data to develop basic, or elementary, indexes for each good and service. BLS combines the elementary indexes into a single, aggregated index by applying a set of expenditure weights\u2014factors that determine, for example, whether a change in the price of apples or mobile phone service has a larger effect on total inflation (see fig. 2). These expenditure weights reflect the proportion of spending consumers direct to each good or service. To develop expenditure weights, BLS directs the Census Bureau to gather data about the relative importance of each purchase within the target population\u2019s \u201cmarket basket\u201d of consumer goods and services. The Census Bureau collects these data in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a nationwide household survey conducted by BLS to determine how consumers spend their money that also contains demographic data about the households surveyed. BLS uses 2 years of Consumer Expenditure Survey data to calculate the expenditure weights, in part so the sample sizes are large enough to produce accurate weights. From data collected to produce the CPI-U, BLS derives two subpopulation indexes\u2014indexes that focus on the spending patterns of a portion of the population of all urban consumers: the CPI-W and the CPI-E. To produce these subpopulation indexes, BLS adjusts the relative importance of price changes in each good and service through a process sometimes referred to as \u201creweighting,\u201d meaning BLS develops alternate sets of expenditure weights that reflect the spending patterns of the subpopulation. For example, since medical care comprises more of the CPI-E subpopulation\u2019s total expenditures (about 12 percent) than of the CPI-U population\u2019s total expenditures (about 9 percent), the CPI-E gives more weight to medical care than the CPI-U. BLS also creates a \u201cchained\u201d index using the same data for the entire CPI-U population but changing the formula used to combine indexes for each good and service, known as elementary or basic indexes, into a single aggregated index. This formula captures how consumers shift spending among different types of goods and services as prices change (see text box). In contrast, the other indexes assume that consumers keep purchasing various categories of goods and services in the same proportions over a 2-year period regardless of price changes.", "Sanctions are imposed pursuant to statute, executive order, or other authorities.

However, PIAs need not be updated if the change is administrative or minor. In April 2015, we conducted a review of NGI-IPS as a means to identify the nature and extent of any privacy risks associated with it and as a means to determine the adequacy and implementation of privacy protections. Specifically, we examined the FBI\u2019s (1) methods for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of probe photos submitted for searches and for protecting personal privacy information associated with probe photos and (2) processes for approving the use of investigative leads generated by the searches. The Privacy Act does not address the accuracy or relevance of information that agencies collect or maintain, including personal information maintained in law enforcement databases. However, agencies need to ensure they collect information properly and accurately in databases that affect individuals\u2019 rights, benefits, or privileges. To identify NGI-IPS users and protect privacy information associated with all those users, the FBI needs to accurately identify users and ensure that only authorized users gain access to search NGI-IPS or generate investigative leads. The FBI has taken steps to address privacy risks associated with NGI-IPS use. Specifically, in December 2011, prior to the full implementation of NGI-IPS, the FBI developed and implemented policies and processes to protect users\u2019 privacy. The FBI has designated two types of users (primary and supporting) who have authorized access to NGI-IPS and generate investigative leads. The FBI\u2019s policies and processes provide for administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the relevant probe photos are collected and used appropriately and that privacy information is protected. However, we found that, although the FBI had policies that applied to the storage and retention of NGI-IPS data, it did not always follow these policies and did not have a mechanism to ensure consistent adherence to policies. Further, the FBI\u2019s policies did not address the storage and retention of photos returned as investigative leads nor how long supporting users\u2019 system access should be retained. If not followed, these practices could contribute to privacy risks and violate the Privacy Act. For example, a supporting user could have unlimited and inappropriate access to stored data. The FBI is implementing a project that will include a comprehensive privacy review, a Privacy Act system of records notice, and guidance for the FBI and its users on the retention of NGI-IPS data. According to FBI officials, the project should be completed by 2021. This review is expected to address the privacy implications associated with the storage and retention of investigative leads. During our May 2019 review, we found that the FBI had completed two of the four components of the project that will make the privacy review more comprehensive. The policies and procedures needed to guide users on privacy and civil liberties protections associated with NGI-IPS are being developed, and management controls to better monitor and protect NGI-IPS privacy have been identified. However, the remaining components have not yet been implemented. For additional information regarding the FBI\u2019s development of the new privacy controls for NGI-IPS, see the management control section of this report. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of probe photo search requests submitted for searches and to protect users\u2019 privacy, the FBI requires users to provide justification for the photo search. The justification is entered and retained in NGI-IPS, along with the photo. This is important because the FBI needs to know that the photo submitted was used for an appropriate and authorized reason, for example, to help identify a suspect involved in a criminal investigation, and that the submission was not done inappropriately or for unapproved reasons. Based on our random sample of 45 search requests conducted in fiscal year 2018, we found that users provided more than just a generic reason for the search, such as \u201cI want to find this person.\u201d Users also added information that they believed would assist the NGI-IPS in returning the most accurate results, such as the date and location of the photograph, the ethnicity of the person, the suspect\u2019s gender, and, in some cases, a reference to any distinguishing characteristics or other relevant information known about the suspect. However, we did not make any recommendations that sought improvements to justify the need to collect and use personal data associated with photo searches. Instead, we have accepted the process as used by the FBI. However, we question whether requiring photo users to just enter \u201cI/w/photo\u201d (I need a face photo) as the justification field would allow the NGI-IPS to continue adequately monitoring the relevance and accuracy of use and ensuring users use it appropriately. We also wonder whether the FBI has conducted any studies or statistical analysis about the relevance and accuracy of the justification field it currently requires before deciding to keep it at the current level. It is the FBI\u2019s responsibility to ensure that search requests made through NGI-IPS are relevant and accurate. It is important that users\u2019 justifications continue to provide the maximum amount of relevant information for proper consideration. Our random sample identified some instances in which users\u2019 explanations provided in the justification", "The FHLBank System has 11 FHLBanks, each of which has a board of directors comprising member and independent directors, as well as a president who reports to the board of directors.

The FDA does not recommend flushing unused drugs down a toilet unless it is specifically instructed to do so on the FDA website or the manufacturer\u2019s label. These regulatory approaches complement one another and are aimed at promoting safety in opioid prescription and dispensing, educating the public to properly dispose of unused medications to reduce opioid misuse, and ensuring that unused drugs are properly disposed of in the environment.

Clarify accountability: Even after making key decisions about which parts are scarce and should therefore be prioritized, DOD requires greater clarity about how it will hold accountable the organizations responsible for managing parts distribution. We recommended that DOD establish and clarify such accountability through, for instance, specific guidance to the F-35 Joint Program Office, the services, and the depots. Revise the repair process: We have reported that the F-35 depots were struggling with long wait times to repair parts and that their repair capabilities were limited, which could harm warfighters\u2019 performance in combat.

This act applies to political appointees, high-ranking government officials, and agencies of the federal government. The act authorizes OGE, an executive branch ethics program, to supervise and direct ethical practices in the executive branch. Executive branch agency heads have a supervisory role in their agency\u2019s ethics program, while DAEO are responsible for coordinating ethics program activities. Ethics breaches can be investigated by agency inspectors general (OIG) and DOJ, and violators can be punished under criminal or civil statutes or subjected to disciplinary actions by their agency. OIG has investigated violations within HHS and Interior involving political appointees, and the DAEOs of these agencies addressed identified issues. Although the number of political appointees relative to the total federal workforce has declined from previous decades, OGE requires political appointees and SES to complete extensive financial disclosure reports. The Plum Book identifies the positions of PAS and other political appointees in the executive branch, and these roles are subject to additional ethics and financial disclosure rules to promote their independence. The Office of Personnel Management maintains a repository of this data, and the Plum Book is published every 4 years alternately by two congressional committees.

However, there is always room for improvement, such as additional training for agency ethics officials and continuous review of ethical practices within agencies. The use of technology tools could also help enhance ethical practices throughout each agency. Additionally, there should be more focus on the prevention of ethical breaches versus investigation and subsequent punishment of ethics violators. To encourage a proactive approach to ethical culture, leaders should be celebrated for ethical behavior and punished for unethical behavior, rather than vice versa. Ethics awareness training programs could also be implemented to empower employees to report unethical practices and promote a speak-up culture. Overall, the initiatives taken are a step in the right direction, and with continuous effort and improvement, government can continue to inspire trust in our citizens.", "FAA requires aircraft registrations and issues certificate dealers in accordance with federal statutes that support international civil aviation operations, under which all aircraft are required to be registered based on nationality of operator & ownership.

As a result, the DRIs, which are regularly reviewed and updated, provide reference values for age-specific ranges for many nutrients and dietary components, as well as reference values for nutrient intake requirements, estimated daily nutrient requirements for children ages 1 to 18 and adults ages 19 and older, and recommended intakes for ages 1 and older. To address the needs of older adults, the DRIs provide nutrient needs that are different than those of younger adults. The DRIs also provide updated information and guidance on chronic disease prevention and management. In addition to the DRIs, other reference values, such as the DRIs applied in different settings and the recommended nutrient intakes provided through the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, are often used in the development of meal plans and food-service programs that serve older adults. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provide overall guidance on nutrition and overall healthy eating patterns, as well as recommendations for specific populations with unique nutrition needs. Therefore, for older adults, the dietary guidelines recommend the following for healthy eating patterns: focus on a variety of fruits and vegetables, including dark-green, red, and orange varieties, berries, and herbs, while also incorporating whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, lean protein sources (including lean meats, poultry without skin, beans, lentils, and nuts), oils rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and limits added sugars, saturated fat, sodium, and alcohol; and aim for a healthy nutrient balance across the week while staying within energy needs. Based on the recommended intake ranges provided in the DRIs (see table 2) and within the context of the healthy eating patterns recommended in the dietary guidelines, this report recommends nutrition specifications for adults ages 60 and older who are at risk for food insecurity.1 Research shows that nutrient deficiencies (such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies) are likely to develop over time among food-insecure adults, suggesting that meeting their food- insecurity and nutrient needs may require higher than optimal intakes to meet the recommended nutrient requirements. In the final version of this report, the nutrient recommendations are based on the recommended nutrient adequacy limits in the DRIs, the recommended nutrient intakes provided through the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, and expert opinion. Food insecurity and chronic illnesses can affect older adults\u2019 4 nutritional status and physical activity, which can affect their nutrient needs. At the same time, some older adults may have nutritional deficiencies that can contribute to the development and progression of chronic conditions. Therefore, this report considers a range of factors, including the nutrient needs of older adults, existing nutrient intake data from food assistance programs serving older adults, and the nutrient adequacy of the food-security survey data, in developing the final nutrition standards. In addition, the report recommends specifications that address food-insecure older adults, accounting for higher than optimal intakes. Finally, this report also considers the cost of nutrition upgrades recommended in the food assistance programs to ensure cost neutrality for FNS\u2019s program. The recommended nutrition specifications in this report, therefore, are intended to reflect the unique nutritional needs of food-insecure older adults ages 60 and older with adequate nutrient intakes (with some nutrient needs likely above DRIs). Overall, this report recommends an increased focus on the delivery of nutrient-rich foods in food-security programs serving older adults. This report recommends nutrition specifications to address the nutrient needs of older adults who are food insecure based on the recommendations in the DRIs. In addition, in recognition of the role of chronic disease prevention and management, recommended daily nutrient intakes from the DRIs and Dietary Guidelines provide guidance, and nutrients that contribute to the development and progression of chronic conditions are emphasized, while recognizing the potential challenges of low food costs. In addition, to address food-insecure older adults who are not food insecure based on the DRIs, but have other food- availability and access challenges, including preferences for or need for assistance and access to culturally preferred foods, in this report, we recommend adjustments and updates to the USDA Thrifty Food Plan to better capture the needs of this population. The recommendations proposed in this report are based on nutrition standards, rather than the USDA Thrifty Food Plan. In fact, this report recommends using the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR", "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created in 1968 by the United States Congress to provide an insurance and financial backing program for flood disaster relief.

These events occurred concurrently with Hurricane Maria, which caused significant damage to Puerto Rico specifically. The limited logistical resources and infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands made it difficult for FEMA to establish a strong presence and provide assistance as quickly as they would have otherwise.

However, the Department reserves the right to delete any comment that we think does not follow the regulations and policies included in the Department's Privacy Statement.\u201d However, this disclosure does not provide information about how identity information is treated and inconsistently applied between commenters and across a rulemaking program. In addition, commenters using Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites cannot be reasonably aware of the varying posting practices unless they carefully compare websites\u2014a task that we found no external incentive exists for them to undertake. The selected agencies could effectively provide the needed transparency\u2014including disclosure about data quality, standards, and limitations\u2014by adopting E-Government Act-mandated data integrity and disclosure guidelines, including the specific guidance set forth in a recent National Archives and Records Administration memo on open government data quality \u2026 In our report, we analyze in detail all the data collected by Regulations.gov and 10 selected agencies. We also interview agency officials about their processes and the data they collect, as well as use data analysis tools to assess the data. In the report, we discuss our analysis of the data.\nA major finding of this report is that the 10 selected agencies have inconsistent posting policies related to the comment data, which have resulted in identity information being inconsistently presented to public users. This inconsistency is attributable to variations in how public users can input their identity information through the comment submission process, how the agencies treat duplicate comments, and how they process and post comments, but it also affects the consistency and integrity of the data. In addition, we found that agencies lack consistent policies for capturing and preserving identity information over time, which makes it difficult to trace the information that the agencies have. Moreover, as a result of the variations in agency posting policies, the agencies provide insufficient information in their disclosure statements or elsewhere on their websites about the availability and limitations of identity information associated with public comments. These findings indicate a lack of agency transparency and integrity. In light of these findings, we have made two major recommendations: 1. Implement consistent policies for tracking and preserving identity information associated with public comments that are similar across agencies and improve the transparency of the policies that exist today. The E-Government Act requires all agencies to make public comments and other materials associated with rulemaking transparently available online to the extent practicable. The key practices for transparently reporting open government data stress the importance of fully disclosing the data that are made available to the public, including by fully disclosing its sources and limitations. With regard to public comments, the E-Government Act mandates consistent and prominent disclosures by agencies on their public websites describing the availability and limitations of identity information associated with public comments. 2. Work in collaboration with the E-Government community of practice to develop clear and consistent guidance for the E-Government Act requirements related to openness and transparency related to public comments. Such guidance should also align with the key practices of open government data to ensure that data provided to the public is transparent and understandable. Implementing our first major recommendation would address and help to mitigate most of the concerns we identified about transparency. It would ensure that public users know how to identify and use the data that is available through the public comment process. It would also allow agencies to work with the public to understand any concerns the public might have about how identity information is presented and to address those concerns if necessary. Implementing our second recommendation would build on the transparency improvements that would result from our first recommendation. It would also make the data gathered during the rulemaking process more accessible to citizens, allowing them to engage with and make use of the government\u2019s open data, which ultimately promotes their civic participation. By implementing our recommendations, we believe that agencies can more effectively promote the President\u2019s Open Government Initiative, improve public participation in their rulemaking processes, and enhance the quality and transparency of the final rules they issue.", "VA has been providing healthcare services for veterans since 1945 by either providing it directly through VA medical facilities or through third-party providers.

In April 2002, the Navy began developing a replacement helicopter later identified as the VH-71. Schedule delays, performance issues, and a doubling of estimated acquisition costs caused the Navy to terminate the VH-71 program in 2009. Our prior work found that the VH-71 program\u2019s failure to follow acquisition best practices was a critical factor in the program\u2019s poor performance that led to its ultimate termination. In the case of the VH-71, the Navy had a faulty business case, did not perform appropriate systems engineering analysis to gain knowledge at the right times, and failed to make necessary trade-offs between resources and requirements even after years of development. Because of these failures, the program was unable to achieve a stable design and experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays. Although the prior replacement program was terminated, the need for a replacement helicopter remained. As a result, the Navy initiated a follow- on replacement program in 2010. In April 2012, the Secretary of Defense approved the Navy\u2019s plan based on the modification of an in-production helicopter to meet Navy requirements. The VH-92A is expected to provide improved performance, survivability, and communications capabilities, while offering increased passenger capacity when compared to legacy helicopters. In May 2014, the Navy competitively awarded a contract to Sikorsky to develop the VH-92A, which included options for production. The $2.7 billion contract includes a fixed-price incentive (firm target) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and a firm-fixed price production phase with options for three lots for 17 helicopters, spares and support equipment. Under the EMD phase, Sikorsky has delivered two development test helicopters which were used in an operational assessment that was completed in April 2019. Additionally, Sikorsky has delivered three of four System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) production representative helicopters that are being used in developmental testing and that will also be used to evaluate the VH-92A\u2019s operational effectiveness and suitability during the program\u2019s Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). The fourth SDTA helicopter is to be delivered in May 2020 and will also be used to conduct IOT&E. In June 2019, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research, Development and Acquisition (RD&A) approved the program to begin low-rate initial production of the helicopters and authorized the program to exercise the contract options for the first two low-rate production lots. Shortly thereafter, the Navy exercised the Lot 1 option for 6 helicopters, initial spares, and support equipment for $542 million. Those helicopters, initial spares and support equipment are all to be delivered in calendar year 2021. In February 2020, the Navy exercised the Lot ll option for $471 million for 6 additional helicopters and associated support equipment. All of these helicopters and support equipment will be delivered in calendar year 2022. The Navy had planned for two years of low-rate initial production of 6 helicopters each year followed by one year of full-rate production for the remaining 5 helicopters. The Navy\u2019s acquisition strategy in support of the production decision included a change in that plan with the re-designation of full-rate production as a third lot of low-rate production. A key reason for the change is that the planned full-rate production run of 5 helicopters was too small to achieve the potential cost benefits of full-rate production, which typically involves purchasing a sufficient number of helicopters to decrease unit cost. The revised strategy would also enable the Navy to award the third production lot seven months earlier than the originally planned May 2021. Before obligating the funding available for the second lot, the program office had to brief the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (RD&A) on various elements of the VH-92A\u2019s performance. The program office is required to obtain approval from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (RD&A) for the procurement of the last lot (Lot lll) with a decision brief that includes, among other things, the status of IOT&E. Building a VH-92A helicopter involves work at three facilities. To begin the production process, Sikorsky takes an S-92A helicopter from its commercial production line in Coatesville, Pennsylvania and flies it to a dedicated VH-92A modification facility in Stratford, Connecticut. Once there, Sikorsky removes some components, such as circuit breaker panels, engines, and main and tail rotor blades and replaces them with VH 7\nthe new helicopter\u2019s engines and equipment, and replaces the VH-92A tail with S-92A tail structure.

The damage was particularly severe in areas where VIWAPA has not had power lines in underground, including its St. Thomas and St. Croix transmission and distribution systems. As a result, VIWAPA had to rebuild much of its infrastructure and make significant repairs to power lines, transformers, and generating units. VIWAPA\u2019s initial estimate for Hurricane Maria damages was $100 million. The report says that to date, approximately 98 percent of electricity has been restored to VIWAPA\u2019s customers who are able to safely receive it. Status of electricity restoration. As of August 2018, VIWAPA had restored power to a remaining 1,000 customers, according to FEMA\u2019s daily brief. Of those remaining customers, 100 were in St. Thomas and 800 were in St. Croix. In St. Croix, 80 percent of the customers who were originally included in the daily brief of remaining customers have power restored, while St. Thomas customers have not been included as of October 2018. As of November 19, VIWAPA\u2019s website reported that all customers had been restored in St. Croix and 84 percent of customers in St. Thomas. In all of the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Florida Keys, FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program has provided funding for a total of $11 billion in permanent work to restore infrastructure. Of the $11 billion, $3.2 billion has been obligated to complete permanent repairs and construction throughout the U.S. public power utilities in the U.S. territories. This includes $400 million for PREPA, $100 million for VIWAPA, and $3 billion to restore the remaining power infrastructure in Puerto Rico. (Figure 2; Appendix I) In addition to the $3.2 billion provided by FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program, the Department of Energy\u2019s PowerUSAS and Smart City/Smart Utility initiatives have provided an additional $45.3 million for electric utility modernization projects to help restore resilience in the USVI electrical grid and additional support for energy development.", "", "The cost of counting the nation\u2019s population has been escalating with each decade. The 2010 Census was the most expensive in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and was about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 dollars). According to the Bureau, the total cost of the 2020 Census in October 2015 was estimated at $12.3 billion and in October 2017 that cost estimate grew to approximately $15.6 billion, approximately a $3 billion increase. Additionally, Bureau officials told us that while the estimated cost of the census had increased to $15.6 billion, it was nevertheless managing the 2020 Census to a lower cost of $14.1 billion. Bureau officials explained that the $14.1 billion includes all program costs and contingency funds to cover risks and general estimating uncertainty. The remaining $1.5 billion estimated cost is additional contingency for \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d\u2014that is, low probability events that could cause massive disruptions\u2014and several what-if scenarios such as an increase in the wage rate or additional supervisors needed to manage field operations. Moreover, as shown in figure 1, the average cost for counting a housing unit increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020 constant dollars). At the same time, the return of census questionnaires by mail (the primary mode of data collection) declined over this period from 78 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 2010. Declining mail response rates have led to higher costs because the Bureau sends temporary workers to each non-responding household to obtain census data. Achieving a complete and accurate census has become an increasingly daunting task, in part, because the population is growing larger, more diverse, and more reluctant to participate in the enumeration. In many ways, the Bureau has had to invest substantially more resources each decade to conduct the enumeration. In addition to these external societal challenges that make achieving a complete count a daunting task, the Bureau also faces a number of internal management challenges that affect its capacity and readiness to conduct a cost-effective enumeration. Some of these issues\u2014such as acquiring and developing IT systems and preparing reliable cost estimates\u2014are long-standing in nature. At the same time, as the Bureau looks toward 2020, it has faced emerging and evolving uncertainties. For example, on March 26, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce announced his decision to add a question to the decennial census on citizenship status which resulted in various legislative actions and legal challenges. Ultimately, the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which, in a June 26, 2019, ruling, prevented the addition of the question because the Court found that the evidence Commerce provided in the case did not match the Secretary\u2019s explanation. In addition, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded other legal challenges to the district court on June 24, 2019, for further legal action, which is yet to be resolved.", "1.

What aspects of workforce planning focus on for agencies, including strategic direction, skill gaps, and strategies to address gap? 3. How has workload increased because of growing IT importance, and what roles need increased hiring?", "Space systems generally involve one of four types of interrelated segments that are needed to make a space capability fully functional. As illustrated in figure 1, they include (1) space components\u2014namely the satellites, (2) ground components, including satellite control systems and data processing subsystems and facilities, (3) user equipment, such as radios/terminals, needed by the warfighter to use the capability, and (4) launch vehicles and facilities. DOD space systems are acquired under the same acquisition policies as other weapons systems. However, as we found in July 2016, space systems are different from other acquisitions in some ways. For example, space has more programs of joint interest than other areas, and includes varied stakeholders, such as civil agencies and multiple services. According to officials, in developing space systems once a satellite is launched, if there are problems it is essentially impossible to change the hardware, and software changes may not be an option. In addition, space programs typically use cutting-edge technologies that have to withstand the harsh space environment. Such technologies are rarely available as off-the-shelf systems from the commercial market and must be developed following a specific process overseen by specially- trained DOD acquisition personnel. Data from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment\u2019s Office of Human Capital Initiatives show that, as of June 2018, DOD employed about 170,000 military and civilian personnel who are designated as acquisition personnel and are responsible for acquiring weapon systems, such as aircraft, ships, tanks, and space systems. DOD tracks the characteristics, education, training, and experience of these acquisition personnel in DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce data system\u2014Data Mart\u2014where they are tracked as belonging to 1 of 15 acquisition career fields. Table 1 shows a list of these acquisition career fields. Contractor and FFRDC personnel often support DOD acquisition efforts. For the purpose of this report, \u201ccontractor\u201d refers to support service contractors who provide technical and administrative support rather than prime contractors who develop and produce weapon systems or products. FFRDCs are not-for-profit entities sponsored and funded primarily by DOD to fulfill research and development, engineering, and analytic needs that cannot be met as effectively by existing government or contractor personnel. Nonprofit, university-affiliated, or private industry organizations operate the FFRDCs through contracts or other agreements with federal agencies. DOD procures FFRDC services by staff years of technical effort. The total amount of FFRDC services time that DOD is permitted to obtain is set annually by Congress. For fiscal year 2018, DOD was authorized to use available funds for FFRDCs for not more than 6,030 staff years of technical effort. Authorized staff years of technical effort are allocated among the military services\u2019 organizations that act as the primary sponsors for each FFRDC, which then prioritize what work the FFRDC will perform according to the allocation level received. In general, managers in the contractor and FFRDC organizations direct the daily activities of their respective personnel, while DOD military and civilian personnel oversee their work. Over the years, GAO has highlighted the importance of workforce management. Since 2001, GAO has included strategic human capital management as a government-wide high-risk area. More recently, we found that having the right workforce mix with the right skill sets is critical to achieving DOD\u2019s mission, and that it is important for DOD, as part of its strategic workforce planning, to conduct gap analyses of its critical skills and competencies. Strategic workforce planning\u2014an integral part of human capital management\u2014is an iterative, systematic process that helps organizations determine if they have staff with the necessary skills and competencies to accomplish their strategic goals. As shown in table 2, many DOD offices play key roles in strategic workforce planning activities. DOD does not have comprehensive information about its space acquisition workforce\u2014including the size, mix, and location of this workforce. DOD does not have this information because, among other things, DOD has not clearly identified its space programs, and its workforce data systems are not configured to identify space acquisition personnel. In the absence of comprehensive DOD data, we sought to obtain an understanding of the extent of this workforce. We aggregated data from individual DOD organizations and estimate that at least 8,000 military, civilian, contractor, and FFRDC personnel were working on space acquisitions in multiple locations across the United States at the end of 2017. While this information represents only a snapshot in time, it provides insight into the extent of the space acquisition workforce. Given DOD\u2019s recent decision to stand up a United States Space Command and to establish a consolidated Space Development Agency in 2019, along with the President\u2019s directive for DOD to submit a legislative proposal for a United States Space Force, having knowledge about which personnel are involved in space acquisitions is important. We therefore plan to continue to track the number of space acquisition personnel in", "A 7-page report that summarizes a 13-page document on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and its impact on drug development. The full report includes goals, initiatives, and performance targets.", "INFECTION CONTROL AND PREVENTION have been sporadic cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported by the World Health Organization. According to ASPR staff, preparedness planning for bioterrorism, natural disasters, or emerging infectious diseases differs from typical planning, because the nature of the potential crisis or threat to humans is unknown. ASPR has responsibility for coordinating with HHS\u2019s other preparedness efforts such as the Strategic National Stockpile, which is intended to supply the nation\u2019s medical countermeasures, such as drugs. To understand potential threats, ASPR, FDA, NIH, and other HHS entities use modeling tools as part of their preparedness planning. According to ASPR staff, some modeling tools require making assumptions. They may not include everything that could happen, but they are essential for understanding the potential course of a disease outbreak. They use the modeling to help make decisions on how to prepare. For example, they may need to prioritize which medical countermeasures to purchase and distribute or which communities they would need to close. In the case of the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, according to an HHS official, the United States considered the possibility of sending more than 400 military personnel and possibly 1,000 American citizens overseas. In a large Ebola outbreak, it may take many months for people to recover and for life to return to normal after an outbreak subsides. Therefore, planners must consider what is needed for those people who will need to return to normalcy\u2014to be treated, go to school, work, and return to their lives. When using modeling tools for preparedness planning, modeling assumptions vary depending on the disease and the phase of preparedness. During the preparedness phase, agency staff can make general assumptions about potential diseases, the populations they might affect, and the resources that may be necessary to respond. During a response, however, the assumptions might change based on the disease course. For example, when there is an emerging disease, scientists may use modeling tools to estimate how many people that disease could affect, but they may not have enough data to predict how the disease might spread, the age of people at risk, or the severity of the illness. The availability of medical countermeasures may change the assumptions and therefore, the planning choices. After the West Africa Ebola outbreak, HHS modeled potential threats (such as smallpox) and used the results as input to inform decisions about resource allocation and the size of a future Strategic National Stockpile. Planning efforts continue to use modeling as input into planning\u2014for example, in the planning for the Strategic National Stockpile. ASPR staff noted that during major events, such as hurricanes or the large anthrax attack in 2001, decisions were made about where to locate the Strategic National Stockpile and how it would need to expand. For example, they noted that during large anthrax attack, they considered the logistics of distributing antibiotics to the population, where stockpiles were needed, and at which specific hospitals or areas they would need to be deployed. According to ASPR staff, the agency has more than 20 modeling tools that are used to make decisions and support public health efforts related to infectious diseases and other emergencies.

Beginning February 26, 2016, contracting officers are required to include a provision in all contract solicitations that require contractors to report information about unpaid federal taxes regardless of the contract value. Specifically, FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 incorporates the language from the fiscal years 2015 and 2016 appropriations acts that prohibits the government from entering into contracts with corporations with unpaid federal taxes that have been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that are not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, and that the contracting officer is aware of the unpaid tax liability.

Clear lines of accountability. Although OHE has responsibility for developing and overseeing implementation of the action plan for advancing health equity, we found that the action plan\u2019s focus areas and implementation activities are assigned to program offices throughout VA, along with other duties unrelated to health equity. Furthermore, there is no clear accountability to ensure VA leadership and management are prioritizing health equity. Additionally, we reviewed the VA\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget request and could not identify dedicated funding for health disparities work that the OHE Program Office can track, monitor and report on. We believe dedicated funding for this work would be beneficial and would encourage VA to consider this approach. However, until VA can demonstrate that it has implemented specific approaches to promote health equity, it is essential for OHE to provide leadership in this area and identify VA-wide initiatives and opportunities for improvement that cut across organization lines and boundaries. Absent dedicated funding for health disparities work for this office, OHE must prioritize health disparities within the constraints of its existing funding. Specifically, dedicated funding for health disparities work would likely allow OHE to increase its workload by creating new health disparities efforts or expanding existing programs across the organization. Without dedicated funding, the office would continue to have to work within the limits of its existing staff and funding and may not be able to fully address health disparities. 24 As we discuss later in Section 7 of the report, we identified that VA has also taken other steps to address health equity issues, but lacks mechanisms to ensure accountability for these actions. One step that VA has taken includes identifying and prioritizing areas to focus on. For example, VA has identified 12 racial/ethnic minority populations where the gaps in their health outcomes are greater than expected and that it is most important to address. 25 One population includes blacks with diabetes, who experience 11 percent better health outcomes than whites with diabetes. VA\u2019s focus on this population is important, as black men and women are at higher risk for diabetes. 26 While identifying areas to focus on is useful to prioritize areas for improvement, these efforts lack clear lines of accountability and performance measures. VA did not tell us how much effort or resources it is assigning to addressing the gaps identified in health outcomes for these populations. Further, there is no clear line of accountability to ensure that efforts to address racial/ethnic minority health outcomes succeed, and that these efforts have been prioritized accordingly. To illustrate, we asked our data analyst to look at the fiscal year 2019 and 2020 work orders for the Racial/Ethnic Minority Health Program, but were unable to determine how many orders are specifically related to addressing racial inequalities. 27 We acknowledge that some work orders may be intended to address racial inequalities, but without clear identifiers or performance measures, it is impossible to distinguish. VA told us that it does not currently have the ability to track performance of such an initiative. We believe that having clear identifiers and performance measures related to addressing racial/ethnic health inequities would allow VA and other stakeholders to monitor progress, and encourage VA to continue prioritizing specific areas. Similarly, VA told us it does not have the ability to accurately measure progress of its effort to promote health equity. VA said that health equity efforts \u201ccut across all healthcare programs, policies, initiatives and services provided by VA.\u201d 28 It is not enough for an organization, in this case VA, to assert that they value health equity; they must demonstrate that they are taking action to ensure equity. As previously discussed, while VA has a vision for achieving health equity stated in its strategic plan and has implemented several health equity initiatives, these initiatives are implemented across VA\u2019s vast network of hospitals and health care providers. Each initiative has its own goals, metrics, data, and other features. VA health care providers (physicians, nurses, etc.) who work one-on-one with patients do not have a central source for health equity information. 29 The data about a patient\u2019s health care experience are kept at the provider point-of-care (e.g., in a clinic), not in a central repository. As a result, VA health care providers treating patients from the same racial/ethnic minority group may not know what services other providers in VA provided to patients from the same group, and may not be aware", "THE U.S. CAPITOL COMPLEX BUILDINGS\u2019 MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND PRESERVATION 1. UNAVAILABLE, due to the lack of reliable data on building and grounds maintenance costs. the complexity of projects for which the Division was hired during this period, as shown in figure 3. Projects ranged from $5 million to over $100 million. For 2018, 16 of the 17 projects that the Division reported as active cost $10 million or more. Of the 16, 12 were at least $100 million, including the $153 million Capitol Visitor Center Modernization Project, the $124 million Capitol Dome Rehabilitation Project, and the $99.4 million House Office Buildings Renovation, Phase II Project. In comparison, the other three projects cost $14.2 million, $10.8 million, and $8.8 million, respectively. Duration: Also during this period, the Division\u2019s clients required it to perform a wide range of projects for varying durations. Based on the Division\u2019s data, projects\u2019 duration ranged from less than a week to over 4 years. For 2018, one project lasted less than a week, 4 projects lasted between 30 days and 6 months, and 11 projects lasted between 6 months and 4 years. To complete a project, the Division can hire one or more prime contractors or use its staff to perform work directly, as shown in figure 4. Prime contractors are responsible for managing a project from start to finish. The Division typically has up to three prime contractors on retainer at any given time. In contrast, trade workers\u2019 assignments range from a few hours to several weeks. Based on the Division\u2019s data, trade workers are responsible for an average assignment of 39 hours per week (see figure 5 at the end of this chapter). However, a trade worker\u2019s average assignment can range from less than a day to several months. For example, one assignment lasted 23 days; 34 averaged less than 30 days; 36 lasted between 31 and 60 days; 36 lasted between 61 and 90 days; and 41 lasted 90 days or more. The Division reported that 12 projects were completed in fiscal year 2018. As of October 2018, the Division reported that 11 projects were active and 6 were completed, for a total of 17 projects. Based on project data, 12 of the 17 projects were executed for the House, 3 were for the Senate, 1 was for the Library, and 1 was for the Capitol Police. In most cases, the staff that served as project managers for these projects were based in one of the Division\u2019s 10 jurisdictions. The Division also reported that it had five active projects for \u201cexternal clients,\u201d such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Education. These projects, which did not come to us for review, were primarily facility maintenance or construction projects. They contributed to the total of 17 projects the Division reported as of October 2018.\nFor the information requested, the following issues surfaced: \u2022 In the process of developing the data for this report, the AOC\u2019s Bureau of Public Works and Property Management (BOPWPM) requested that the GAO (GAO) limit its review to the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) and their contractors. They claimed that the report should only include contracts paid for by project funding in order to prevent confusion with the AOC project management activities.\n\u2022 The AOC project management office uses GSA\u2019s Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center for supplies and equipment required for the operation of the House of Representatives. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the Capitol Buildings, with responsibility for (1) procurement management (procurement, contracting, administration for contracts, etc.) of the projects, while under project execution, and (2) operations and maintenance (O&M) management after project completion.\n\u2022 O&M management is executed at the end of the AOC project management office phase. At that point contracting is executed to execute the O&M contracts. O&M contracts are completed by a different section, the office of engineering, under the AOC.\n\u2022 The scope of GAO has to focus solely on contracted services for the AOC and their contractors, in particular, those funded by project funding. The O&amp;M contracts do not get paid by project funding. Therefore, GAO will not include contracts that are paid by O&amp;M funding in order to avoid confusion with the AOC project management activities.\n\u2022 GAO\u2019s review was limited to contracts executed during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 paid for by project funding.

Most transit agencies reported plans either to provide Wi-Fi in the future or have it available already for their ridership. 10 Transit agencies and operators have a responsibility to ensure that their employees, passengers, and data are secure and protected, both while at rest and in transit. According to various public sources cited in this report, a number of transportation agencies have reported instances of cybersecurity-related incidents in recent years. A review of press releases, news articles, alerts, and social media posts indicate these incidents include attempts to breach transit authority systems and networks by malicious actors, the introduction of malware on vehicle control systems, ransomware, data loss or exposure, and attacks on transit Wi-Fi networks that impact user privacy and safety. DHS and NIST also have conducted various cybersecurity assessments, exercises and surveys of transit agencies highlighting a need for improved agency security posture. Some transit agencies are actively pursuing improved cybersecurity capabilities beyond the minimum recommended standards to protect transit staff and passengers. However, the extent to which these actions are taken varies among agencies, and there remains a gap between the progress made and what is needed to adequately address the challenges and risks. This section details key findings related to passenger rail cybersecurity practices including policies and procedures, employee training and awareness, incident prevention and response, cyber threat intelligence, and physical security planning and coordination. Recommendations for improvements are also provided. 1. Policies and Procedures: Many agencies have policies, but they are not always consistently implemented. Effective policies ensure staff know what\u2019s appropriate online behavior, how to safeguard sensitive data, and to whom they should report security concerns. Agencies also need policies that ensure vendors adhere to cybersecurity protocols and that staff receive cybersecurity training. 2. Employee Training and Awareness: Employees are a cyber risk vector. Cyber risks can be significantly reduced with effective cybersecurity training and ongoing awareness campaigns. Many agencies offer such activities but could improve. 3. Incident Prevention and Response: Prevention measures can reduce attacks; incident response plans help speed detection and remediation. Some agencies have made progress in this area, but improvements remain necessary. Cyber and physical security integration is critical. 4. Cyber Threat Intelligence: Comprehensive intelligence programs help agencies understand and address cyber and physical risks. Only one-third of agencies report strong programs. More could benefit from threat intelligence sharing partnerships. 5. Physical Security and Infrastructure Security: Physical security and infrastructure security are critical. Cybersecurity risks may expose both. Staff and passengers need effective security measures in place. TSA has made progress addressing cybersecurity risks to transportation systems, including passenger rail. In 2011, TSA created the Office of Intelligence to better inform the agency\u2019s security efforts, which included cybersecurity. To address cybersecurity challenges in domestic passenger rail transport, TSA and industry stakeholders in 2012 formed the Rail Security Working Group, which reports to the Aviation and Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee (ASTAC). The group reports its recommendations to SECURE. The group has made progress defining industry risks and identifying cybersecurity practices to mitigate risks. However, TSA could benefit from stronger partnerships with passenger rail stakeholders. In addition, while cyber preparedness is a focus area of this advisory group, other operational security efforts at passenger rail associations that could benefit from engagement with TSA include physical security assessments, vulnerability assessments, and threat intelligence sharing partnerships.", "Historically, the federal government has had difficulties acquiring, developing, and managing IT investments.

It includes a triad of Air Force ICBMs; Air Force nuclear-capable bomber aircraft; and navy submarine-launched ballistic missiles carried by SSBNs; as well as associated nuclear munitions; air refueling; and NC3 capabilities. NC3 capabilities are a key part of the defense nuclear enterprise, used to support planning, situation monitoring, and communication of force direction between the President and nuclear forces. Consistent with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the United States has limited the number of deployed delivery systems for each of the three legs of the strategic nuclear triad (see fig. 1). The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review states that the triad\u2019s synergy and overlapping attributes help ensure the enduring survivability of deterrence capabilities against attack and the capacity to hold at risk a range of adversary targets throughout a crisis or conflict. In addition to the strategic nuclear triad, the defense nuclear enterprise includes nonstrategic nuclear forces: forward-deployed fighters\u2014referred to as dual-capable fighter aircraft\u2015that are able to deliver conventional or nuclear munitions; their associated nuclear weapons; and the supporting infrastructure and personnel to build, maintain, and control nuclear assets. NC3 capabilities are fielded through a large and complex system comprising numerous land-, air-, and space-based components used to ensure connectivity between the President and nuclear forces. Responsibilities for managing NC3 are distributed among many DOD components including military departments, combatant commands, defense agencies, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. NC3 capabilities provide the President with the means to authorize the use of nuclear weapons in a crisis. NC3 capabilities support five important functions: Force management: assignment, training, deployment, maintenance, and logistics support of nuclear forces and weapons before, during, and after any crisis. Planning: development and modification of plans for the employment of nuclear weapons and other operations in support of nuclear employment. Situation monitoring: collection, maintenance, assessment, and dissemination of information on friendly forces, adversary forces and possible targets, emerging nuclear powers, and worldwide events of interest. Decision making: assessment, review, and consultation that occur when the employment or movement of nuclear weapons is considered. Force direction: implementation of decisions regarding the execution, termination, destruction, and disablement of nuclear weapons. The NDERG is the principle integrated civilian\u2013military governance body for the DOD nuclear enterprise. It was established in 2014 by the Secretary of Defense to ensure the long-term health of the nuclear enterprise by addressing resourcing, personnel, organizational, and enterprise policy issues identified in the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. The NDERG also maintains senior-leader awareness of ongoing issues of importance in the nuclear enterprise, ensures effective sustainment of these critical nuclear capabilities, and provides a forum for strategic-level coordination and integration of issues arising from other oversight committees and councils related to the nuclear enterprise. The NDERG consists of a group of senior officials chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense with the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as vice chair. The NDERG is supported by a Nuclear Deterrent Working Group, which meets biweekly and reviews the status of the implementation of the recommendations of the nuclear enterprise reviews, and a Nuclear Deterrent Senior Oversight Group, which meets quarterly and reviews any recommendations that the Working Group believes are ready for the NDERG to close.

TEXT: Some federal agencies are putting efforts in motion to address environmental justice issues in their communities, but the extent to which these efforts are improving the health and well-being of these populations remains uncertain. This is because most agencies do not have a clear method to assess progress. Further, 2 agencies (DOD and SBA) have not developed strategic plans with goals related to environmental justice, and many agency plans are outdated. Despite improvements in agencies\u2019 efforts since the signing of the 2011 MOU, the extent to which federal efforts are successfully addressing inequities in communities with environmental justice concerns remains uncertain. Better planning and reporting will likely help federal officials identify gaps and strengthen these efforts. The current President's order, Executive Order 13985, does not go far enough in addressing the systemic issues, and it is not being adequately enforced even on the Federal level where the agency tasked to enforce it - the EPA - has been gutted.

The scope of responsibility of the Interior Department is to supervise federal oil and gas resources, including those situated beneath and surrounding more than 260 million acres of land and 700 million acres of subsurface land in the United States, as well as another 1.7 billion acres offshore. 2. BOEM is responsible for leasing oil and gas resources situated on federal waters off the coast of the United States, which are scheduled for lease sales on a five-year basis and under certain circumstances. 3. Royalty rates, rental fees and minimum bid amounts are set up according to the law to generate revenue in return for granting access to develop resources. 17 SUMMARY evaluates the financial performance for the proposed five-year lease period at the minimum amount offered by the bidder. BOEM uses a probabilistic geologic model to calculate the expected value of oil and gas for each bid on a tract-by-tract basis. This model determines the probability that a tract contains oil or gas based on data from adjacent wells or geological formations. To this expected value from the probabilistic model, BOEM adds exploration and development and operating costs. If the sum is below zero for the five-year lease period, BOEM rejects the bid. However, if the sum appears positive, BOEM adds a risk premium to determine BOEM\u2019s minimum acceptable bid value, which is the figure from which BOEM begins negotiating a final bid. BOEM\u2019s probabilistic geologic model is called \u201cPetrel\u201d and is used to evaluate the exploration and development costs of the oil and gas beneath the sea floor on each tract offered for lease using a three-dimensional map of the area. The model estimates the amount of oil and gas that will be produced and the drilling and production costs. Petrel also predicts the oil and gas prices over the next five years to determine the future net present value of the lease. The estimated risk from developing oil and gas under the sea floor is added to development costs in the calculation of net present value. At the beginning of each lease period, leaseholders pay rent to Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for the right to develop the oil and gas resource. The lease rent is adjusted each year based on the amount of oil and gas produced. Lease rents are collected by BOEM and are part of the total revenue generated from federal oil and gas resources. The federal government receives 12.53 percent of oil and gas revenues as rent (with some exceptions). Additionally, companies are required to submit to BOEM\u2019s Mineral Management Service (MMS) production reports to account for production and rent payments. There is no set amount for minimum bid amounts or bids. The oil companies make the bid. The bid is for oil drilling rights in a specific area of water. There are a number of important decisions that oil companies would need to make if they want to purchase a bid for an area of water as in a lease auction. These decisions include: \u2013 The amount of the bid; that is, the maximum amount that the oil company will pay for the lease. The bid is binding and the company must pay its bid if its bid is selected. \u2013 The amount of the bid deposit or the amount of money that the oil company deposits as evidence that it will pay its bid in the event that a bid is selected. The bid deposit is not refundable. \u2013 If the oil company does not want to bid, it will need to inform BOEM in advance of the lease sale so that its bid is not accepted. 18\nSummary Of \"Interior Has Oversight Responsibility For The Development Of Federal Oil And Gas Resources\"\nRelated Papers\nThe U.S. Constitution Should be Altered to Allow for the Creation of a Cabinet-Level Position of Energy Secretary\nThis essay argues that the U.S. Constitution should be amended to create a Secretary of Energy position within the Executive branch of government.

The agencies, which administer individual foreign assistance accounts, have shared responsibilities regarding the administration of certain funds. Throughout this report we refer to the congressional instructions in the annual appropriations acts and those allocation tables within the joint explanatory statements that are incorporated by reference into the act as \u201crequirements,\u201d and we refer to Congress\u2019s instructions to the agencies presented as additional language in the joint explanatory statement as \u201cdirectives.\u201d Congress funds foreign assistance through appropriations to 16 accounts, each of which has a distinct purpose and specific legal requirements, such as the number of years the funds are available for obligation. Table 1 provides a summary of these 16 accounts. These accounts are generally administered individually by State or USAID, or jointly by both agencies. In addition, the period of availability for obligation for these accounts ranges from 1 to 5 years, or in some cases, until funds are expended. The annual appropriations acts have hundreds of specific instructions\u2014both requirements and directives\u2014attached to many of the foreign assistance accounts that State and USAID address in the Section 653(a) report. According to State officials, the annual appropriations acts have become more detailed since the addition of the Section 653(a) mandates in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971. For example, State officials said that when the Section 653(a) reporting mandate began the annual appropriations act contained fewer requirements and directives. The Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1971, appropriated $2.2 billion in foreign assistance and was 18 pages in length. By contrast, the relevant portion of the annual appropriations act for fiscal year 2018 appropriated $33.7 billion in foreign assistance and was 138 pages in length. In addition, the accompanying joint explanatory statement was 9 pages in 1971 and 31 pages in 2018. As shown in table 2 below, during the 4 fiscal years covered by our review, the total number of requirements and directives addressed in the Section 653(a) reports has varied depending on congressional instructions within the annual appropriations acts and corresponding joint explanatory statements. For example, fiscal year 2016 had 1,056 total requirements and directives, while fiscal year 2018 had 657. The total number of requirements and directives has also varied by account. For instance, the Economic Support Fund, which was appropriated roughly $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2018, had 107 requirements and directives that instructed agencies how to allocate about $2.9 billion. Other accounts appropriated funds in fiscal year 2018 had fewer requirements and directives. For example, the International Disaster Assistance account, which was appropriated about $4 billion in fiscal year 2018, had three requirements and directives. The requirements and directives also vary in their specificity. For instance, of the $8.6 billion appropriated for Global Health Programs in fiscal year 2018, the joint explanatory statement required that $829.5 million be allocated toward maternal and child health. State and USAID were also required to make funds allocated for the Global Health Programs available in specific amounts, such as making $755 million available for activities addressing malaria in fiscal year 2018. State and USAID also balance the requirements and directives with administration priorities. For example, officials from OMB said that they review the Section 653(a) report to ensure that allocations for certain countries\u2014such as Israel and Jordan\u2014are consistent with the administration\u2019s financial commitments to those countries.

Under the current program, if an event were to be certified as an act of terrorism and insured losses exceeded $200 million, an individual insurer that experienced losses first would have to satisfy a deductible before receiving federal coverage. After the insurer pays its deductible, the federal government would reimburse the insurer for 80 percent of its additional losses and the insurer would be responsible for the remaining 20 percent. Overall, TRIA has not caused financial liabilities to the federal government, but it could require large, previously unbudgeted expenditures by the federal government if an event occurred.", "TEXT: FITARA selected FDCCI as a priority project because it can drive the adoption of virtualized desktop and cloud technologies, which has the potential to reduce IT infrastructure costs. Each agency developed and submitted an initial data center consolidation plan consisting of agency-wide data center inventories and consolidation plans, and implementation plans for the FDCCI. For each phase, agencies selected a limited number of data centers as the targets for consolidation. Agencies completed the first phase of consolidations by the prescribed deadline of June 2015. Agencies achieved varying degrees of success completing their plans for the second phase of data center consolidation; of the three agencies we reviewed for this phase, one achieved milestones consistent with completing its plan, while the other two did not. Agencies completed a varying number of milestones related to the third phase of data center consolidation. Agencies met the second annual federal data center inventory submission deadline of June 1, 2018. Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (CSA). The CSA requires agencies to employ continuous monitoring activities and to have an ongoing process for managing cybersecurity risk to federal information systems. FITARA expanded the scope of CSA beyond the security of IT to cover the security of agency and personal data. Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA). FISMA requires covered agencies to develop and implement FISMA-based practices for (1) measuring security controls to ensure they are implemented and effective; (2) using risk assessments to prioritize protection efforts for the most critical systems; and (3) monitoring information security for those systems. OMB Circular A-130, Section 3(c)(ii) in FISMA, states that agencies must conduct or leverage security assessment and authorization processes to verify the expected security of their systems before authorizing them for operation. It also states that continuous monitoring of operational information systems must be part of an authorization. Agencies have been slow to implement continuous monitoring. FITARA now requires each CIO to document and report annually to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) concerning each agency\u2019s progress toward implementing continuous monitoring capabilities for all of its major applications and systems. PortfolioStat Program Reviews. The PortfolioStat Program is designed to help CIOs make evidence-based, agile, and business-focused decisions about their information technology investments. OMB, in coordination with GAO, established the PortfolioStat Program to help agencies identify and prioritize their mission capabilities, and to identify cost savings and performance improvements in their IT portfolios. These program reviews involve a review of multiple IT portfolios and are conducted by OMB, assisted by GAO, at department-wide meetings in Washington, D.C. (prior to 2013, OMB facilitated PortfolioStat through separate meetings with each major agency). PortfolioStat activities have involved OMB and senior officials from 24 of the major agencies in the executive branch of government, including six OMB bureaus..\nWhat are the potential implications of relying on continuous monitoring, and what steps can agencies take to ensure that it is effectively incorporated into their IT governance process?\nRelying on continuous monitoring can have several potential implications for agencies. First, continuous monitoring can help ensure that security controls are implemented and effective, as required by FISMA. Second, continuous monitoring can also help agencies prioritize protection efforts for the most critical systems, as required by CSA. Third, continuous monitoring can help agencies monitor information security for those systems and alert them to potential risks or security concerns that may arise over time, as required by FISMA. However, to ensure that continuous monitoring is effectively incorporated into IT governance processes and implemented in a cost-effective manner, agencies can take several steps. These include: 1. Establishing clear guidance and reporting requirements: Agencies should develop clear guidance and reporting requirements that align with their mission and management priorities. This guidance and reporting should specify the frequency and scope of monitoring activities and reporting requirements, and should be tailored to the needs of individual agencies. 2. Leveraging existing capabilities and resources: Agencies should assess the capabilities and resources that they already have in place for monitoring and use those as a starting point for developing an effective continuous monitoring program. This may include leveraging existing auditing tools, analytics capabilities, or security alerts, as well as cross-functional teams with expertise in these areas. 3. Collaborating with private-sector experts: Agencies should develop partnerships and collaborations with private-sector experts to leverage best practices and access to tools and technologies that can help streamline and cost-effectively implement continuous monitoring programs. 4. Leveraging industry standards: Agencies should leverage existing industry standards for continuous monitoring, such as those developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cloud Security Alliance, to ensure that their programs align with best practices and are interoperable across different systems and environments. 5. Regularly assessing program effectiveness: Agencies should regularly assess the effectiveness of their continuous monitoring program by evaluating its results, reviewing its metrics and key performance indicators, and identifying areas where improvements are needed. This can help agencies better understand", "Marine Debris Report and marine debris report is an excerpt of a report issued by the federal interagency committee.

DHS generally uses the information sources that EEOC guidance recommends to help identify potential barriers. As directed by EEOC guidance, DHS analyzes its workforce data to help identify triggers or indicators of potential EEO barriers by comparing the racial, national origin, gender, and disability profiles of its total workforce, and for various occupational categories to relevant civilian labor workforce data. In addition to analyzing workforce data, in each of the fiscal years 2014 through 2017, DHS utilized the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and DHS\u2019s employee exit survey results to help identify and address barriers. To further help identify barriers, EEOC guidance states that agencies must solicit input from agency employee and advocacy groups, and union officials. During our small group discussions, DHS employee groups told us that through the MD-715 report development process, they helped identify and address triggers and barriers. For example, Special Emphasis Program Managers we spoke with told us that DHS components conduct climate surveys to obtain input from employees on workforce practices every 1 or 2 years. Further, several DHS components\u2019 MD-715 reports referenced soliciting employee input, such as obtaining Disability Employment Program Managers\u2019 input via quarterly disability employment advisory council meetings where they share best practices and discuss issues and topics including barriers. DHS reports some improvements in employee engagement and representation of minorities and women. DHS\u2019s employee engagement scores in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey increased from 54 percent in 2014 to 62 percent in 2019. In addition, our review of DHS\u2019s workforce data from fiscal years 2014 through 2017 showed that every minority group as well as individuals with disabilities and individuals with targeted disabilities had been trending in a positive direction since fiscal year 2014. Further, DHS officials told us that minority representation was up 3 percent and female representation was up 2 percent from 2015 to February 2019. According to EEOC, one important tool in examining the fairness and inclusiveness of an agency\u2019s recruitment efforts is applicant flow data. EEOC guidance states that having department-wide applicant flow data could aid in analyzing differences in selection rates among different groups for a particular job. In July 2017, EEOC informed DHS that the agency\u2019s applicant flow data were incomplete, which makes it difficult to pinpoint barriers. DHS has reported challenges in collecting department-wide data because the department does not have a consolidated applicant flow data system. According to DHS, four of its components use one system (USA Staffing), while five other components use a different system (Monster Government Solutions). CRCL officials told us that DHS is developing a new system to integrate applicant flow data department-wide. However, the officials could not give us a time frame for when the system is expected to be completed. In its fiscal year 2018 MD-715 report, DHS reported that it continues to work towards developing a central repository for all applicant flow data. As a work-around, DHS officials said that it obtains these data directly from each component that uses Monster Government Solutions. In its fiscal year 2018 MD-715 report, DHS reported that it used applicant flow data to complete analyses, but it also reported a number of limitations, including that data were not available. In February 2020, CRCL officials told us that they plan to report complete applicant flow data in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2019 MD-715 report. DHS does not have complete performance metrics or mechanisms for tracking progress towards eliminating its identified EEO barriers, such as workplace satisfaction of white females or the retention rate of women in law enforcement positions. According to CRCL officials, they are not required to establish performance metrics or mechanisms for tracking progress towards eliminating barriers beyond what is included in the department-wide MD-715 report. However, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish specific and measureable objectives, and ways to assess progress including performance metrics and milestones. Further, EEOC guidance states that agencies are not prevented from establishing additional practices that exceed its requirements. Implementing performance metrics could help DHS assess its progress in eliminating EEO barriers. Accordingly, our July 2019 report included a recommendation that the Secretary of Homeland Security should develop performance metrics for the department\u2019s EEO program including a mechanism for tracking progress towards eliminating barriers. DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that it would implement it by April 30, 2020. In February 2020, CRCL officials told us they are working with DHS\u2019s Management Directorate to develop a potential overarching performance metric that, if approved, would be implemented beginning in fiscal year 2021. Our analysis of DHS\u2019s MD-715 reports found that the department-wide EEO program did not meet about a quarter of the compliance measures for a model EEO program for each fiscal year from 2014 through 2017. For example, in each of the", "I find myself overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of information that encompasses the Air Force\u2019s three decades of effort to modernize and consolidate its space command and control systems and improve its space situational awareness. However, the end result was that the Air Force was unable to successfully carry out these efforts without significant cost overruns and delays, and with several key capabilities being lost along the way. The Air Force\u2019s optimistic estimates were a major reason for these failures, as the Air Force did not take the time to adequately evaluate the risks associated with their cost and schedule estimates. Deferring key capabilities was also a common strategy adopted by the Air Force, and it backfired on them in the end. As the report states, Situational Awareness (SA) is something that can make or break an operation in SpaceCom or any military operation. Just like it is impossible to drive a ship without a well-designed SA system, SA in Space is even more important as it is a complex environment with so many factors to consider. The Air Force has an excellent track record of managing their space-related systems and programs during the Cold War. However, as space was declared to be a critical component of the USAF mission, the Air Force has struggled to keep pace with the requirements of the mission. A good example of this is the development of the GPS system. The DOD program was struggling to meet deadlines, and the US Air Force took it upon itself, overloaded their Air Operations Center personnel to ensure that the job got done and exceeded the timelines. They understood their critical mission and took it upon themselves to ensure that SA got done for the Air force. It is also good to note that the Air Force was not alone in its endeavor. Many other services are grappling with the challenges of SA, and it will be no surprise if other organizations have a similar struggle. It is only when we understand the complexity of SA and the challenges surrounding it that we can provide support and resources to make it a success.", "This text describes the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security, especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the National Response Framework (NRF) in relation to the ESF#8. FEMA is the federal department responsible for coordinating disaster response and relief efforts after disasters. The NRF designates response teams, like ESF#8, to deal with health and medical needs. In the case of Hurricane Irma and Maria, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico had damage exceeding their capabilities to respond on their own. Therefore, federal agencies, including FEMA, were responsible for coordinating medical and health services. During the disaster, a major focus for ESF#8 was the provision of medical care and the evacuation of patients requiring specialized care. The text cites the agencies responsible for executing ESF#8 responses and the legal and administrative authorities granted to them. The text also discusses the activation and functions of DOD and VA medical facilities and coordination with other support agencies and the private sector. After the disaster, the performance of ESF#8 is reviewed for improvements.

In the U.S. oceanic airspace, organized track systems are used to increase capacity and efficiently manage air traffic. The use of FANS provides real time communication capabilities between the aircraft and the air traffic controllers providing for improved safety and efficiency. every few seconds. FAA and the Federal Communications Commission require that operators who use FANS equip their aircraft to include ADS-C. However, FAA does not mandate the number of FANS installations by operators. In 2018, FAA estimated that about 40 percent of U.S. airspace traffic, by weight, would be equipped with FANS, and FAA plans to increase this percentage as FANS technology and capacity of domestic airspace increase. According to FAA, about 5 percent of operators in U.S. airspace would require equipage. However, as explained throughout this report, current FAA policy does not enforce that operators flying in U.S. oceanic airspace comply with equipage requirements.

Proceed to summarize the following text.should be prioritized for use in relation to new post-disaster contracts. DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated it would update the strategy by March 2019. According to DHS, when the Secretary of Homeland Security approved the strategy in July 2019, it included a section on contract vehicles for advance contracts and their objectives, including increased use of pre-disaster contracts and increased use of advance contracts. However, while the strategy included a section on objectives, it did not prioritize strategies or clearly define the criteria for advance contract use. Further, the strategy did not establish performance measures to assess whether FEMA contracting officers are achieving the objectives. We asked FEMA to provide any performance measures for assessing advance contracting strategy success, and FEMA officials told us they will work to identify such measures. Our prior work found that FEMA could not readily identify staff responsible for managing or monitoring disaster contracting and acquisition outcomes. DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated it would provide a formal process to track disaster contracting workforce requirements and competencies. However, as of September 2020, we found that FEMA did not have a formal process to formally track disaster contracting workforce requirements and competencies. We reported that FEMA identified a need for additional contracting officers and contracting support personnel for both pre-disaster and disaster contracting. For example, FEMA estimated it needs 150 to 200 additional contracting personnel solely for disaster contracting. However, for the past six fiscal years, FEMA's staffing levels for disaster contracting personnel have been consistently lower than the level needed to fully staff its disaster contracting operations, and FEMA has not had a long-term staffing plan to provide these workforce needs. FEMA officials stated that staffing requirements need to be based on the workload of disasters and that workload patterns are difficult to predict. We further noted that FEMA\u2019s staffing levels may fluctuate depending on the severity and duration of disasters. In addition, a long-term approach could help FEMA better align workforce planning activities with its disaster acquisition priorities. For example, we concluded that more than 70 contracting officers managed and administered 75 contracts for temporary workforce housing following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In contrast, FEMA contracted for temporary workforce housing in both 2005 and 2011. While FEMA may have benefited from the experience gained in administering similar contracts in 2011, it did not have the necessary workforce personnel to immediately execute and administer a large workload. In short, it is likely that FEMA faces a shortfall in skills, experience, and personnel for disaster acquisition. To address the shortfall, we recommended that FEMA establish a long-term staffing strategy and plan that prioritizes identified disaster acquisition workforce requirements. This would enable FEMA to appropriately allocate its resources to address the unique needs of disaster acquisition, and prioritize specific skills, experience, and personnel levels needed over the long term. DHS concurred, but did not provide any details as to how it planned to implement our recommendation. We believe the development and implementation of a comprehensive staffing plan is critical to ensure that FEMA has the appropriate number of qualified contracting personnel needed to effectively and efficiently administer disaster contracting and acquisition activities.", "As an AI language model, I do not understand the meaning of this question.

Over the course of the program, qualified small, disadvantaged businesses can receive business development support from SBA, such as mentoring, procurement assistance, business counseling, training, financial assistance, surety bonding, and other management and technical assistance. One of the key areas of support is eligibility for competitive and sole-source federal contracts that are set aside for 8(a) businesses, which can be an important factor of the financial development for ANC-owned firms. Oversight and monitoring of all firms participating in the 8(a) program are delegated to each of SBA\u2019s 68 district offices nationwide. Of its 68 district offices\u2014staff at the Alaska District Office were assigned and oversaw the majority of all participating ANC-owned firms. ANCs and ANC-owned firms have a unique status in the 8(a) program and can enter into complex business arrangements in terms of their organizational structures, ANCs can be either for-profit or not-for-profit and can own a family of for-profit subsidiary firms, including but not limited to, wholly owned holding companies that often provide administrative support to smaller sister ANC-owned firms. As a condition of the 8(a) program, participating ANC-owned firms must be for-profit. Generally, ANC-owned firms can remain in the 8(a) program for up to 9 years, provided they maintain their eligibility. During the first four \u201cdevelopmental\u201d years, participating firms may be eligible for assistance in program areas including sole-source and competitive 8(a) contract support, and training in business capacity development and strategies to compete successfully for both 8(a) and non-8(a) contracts, among other things. In the last 5 years, firms prepare to transition out of the program, and are required to obtain a certain percentage of non-8(a) revenue to demonstrate their progress in developing into a viable business that is not solely reliant on the 8(a) program. Across three reports on SBA\u2019s 8(a) program, we have found persistent weaknesses in the oversight and monitoring of participating Tribal firms, in particular ANC-owned firms. Specifically, we found that SBA had incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms\u2019 compliance with regulatory requirements; limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of Tribal firms, including ANC-owned firms; insufficient staffing in its Alaska District Office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks of ANC-owned firms; and inadequate program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations. Incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms and their compliance with regulations (continued): our request for the information to another 8(a) program official who possessed the offer letter. Ultimately, we found that no official was able to provide the missing offer letter. We noted similar challenges as the two officials were in different locations and lacked a means to share the offer letter that the other had access to. As a result, we believe that there remains a systemic problem with the collection of these key documents by the Alaska District Office, which could impede the agency\u2019s ability to enforce 8(a) program regulations related to follow-on, sole-source contracts, including 4.5 hours that year, and was still unsure how to accurately interpret the applicable rules and regulations. In our 2016 report, we also noted that SBA\u2019s Alaska District Office lacked key program guidance to provide clear and consistent guidance to agency staff. Because of the absence of program guidance, we found that there were inconsistent monitoring practices, which resulted in a lack of clear criteria and direction on how to identify and mitigate contracting opportunities that could involve related concerns. According to one program official we interviewed, the office was missing written guidance on the subject and staff were relying on oral guidance they received in the 2000s. We noted that the program guidance we did identify on related concerns was outdated and incomplete and, as a result, staff lacked clear information on how to identify and resolve problems and conflicts that could arise. During our 2016 review, one program official told us that she had asked the national office to help provide guidance on how to detect related concerns in the offer letters, but was told that it was not a priority at the time. According to a National Office program official, the lack of written, clear guidance or training tools to assist SBA staff in evaluating offer letters and related concerns was an unintended consequence of the program\u2019s structure and design. According to the National Office official, the lack of written guidance or training material was not the result of a deliberate policy decision, but rather an oversight. Program data challenges: In addition, we also found challenges in SBA\u2019s ability to track and share key program data\u2014particularly related to the ownership of ANC subsidiaries (such as the tribal affiliations of parent ANCs and the number of tribal affiliations controlled", "To ensure that government contracts are awarded only to firms that meet the requirements of DOD, it is imperative to know the identity of the ultimate owners and controllers of a business. However, companies with complex corporate structures often mask these details and this can be particularly true with business dealings involving foreign governments, defense contractors and major DOD purchases. For every government contractor there must exist an ability to discern between the ultimate owners, controllers and agents of a firm. The ultimate owner of a firm may be either an individual or group of individuals. Ultimate control may be either direct or indirect and may rest with a designated individual or group of individuals. Ultimate control may be exercised through other individuals or by proxies and the role of proxy owners must be identified. Ultimate owners of a firm may receive profits and direct the affairs of a business by control of corporate policy and management decisions. In summary, both commercial activities and government contracting must be conducted in a manner that fosters and maintains public trust. In conclusion, it is fair to assume that those contractors found to be less than honest will also have had a similar approach to the transparency they are legally obliged to provide with respect to the ultimate owners of their registered business. Government contracting officers require a better mechanism to help determine whether or not a registered firm has good business ethics and conduct. If there is a doubt, and with every new contract being awarded there should be, a better method is required to investigate and research the real owners and controllers of the firm. The owners and controllers will be the decision makers as to whether the organization is capable of fulfilling their contract obligations, or whether they are just in it for the quick buck.", "I'll begin drafting.", "The Fostering Connections to Success Act (P.L. 110-351) was enacted in 2008 and amended the Social Security Act to promote and encourage the adoption of policies and practices known as \u201cdeinstitutionalization\u201d and \u201cfamily connection preservation.\u201d These and other efforts aim to reduce the number of youth entering the foster care system and to help youth currently in foster care access and receive appropriate care and support. In 2016, states continued to implement many of these efforts, particularly related to prevention, family-based alternative placements for youth in care, permanency planning for older youth, and data collection and analysis. Preventing Children from Entering Foster Care One focus of the Fostering Connections Act is to help states reduce the number of youths who enter foster care. Since foster care involves removing a child from his or her home and placing him or her in a new home and school, there are potentially negative long-term outcomes for the child, the child\u2019s family members, and society. For example, children who exit foster care may have difficulty forming strong relationships, performing well in school, and finding jobs, according to various studies.1 As shown in Figure 1, in 2014, states received more than $1 billion in title IV-E funds to reduce out-of-home care use, as well as an unknown amount of Chafee Program funds. Figure 1: Title IV-E and Chafee Program Funding for Prevention, 2014 The vast majority of prevention funding (~95%) is used for \u201cfamily preservation services\u201d that aim to prevent the removal of children from their parents\u2019 homes and subsequent placements in foster care\u2014such as mental health or substance abuse services, in-home assistance, education assistance, and parent training. Many states also use prevention funds for post-foster care services in order to reduce the likelihood of a youth reentering foster care. According to states\u2019 annual plans, post-foster care services include education, job training or mentoring, health care and mental health services, and housing assistance. States also use prevention funds for other purposes, including training to help child welfare professionals use these funds effectively, conducting evaluations to assess program outcomes, and carrying out quality improvement efforts, such as performance-based contracting and case management improvement initiatives. Fostering Connections funds can be used to support a wide range of post-foster care services and benefits for youth through age 21, including mental health services, independent living skills training, education assistance, and health insurance (including Medicaid or marketplace coverage). States generally use these funds to serve youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood, but some states also use these funds to serve youth living in their homes or in guardianship placements. In 2014, states used about 80 percent of the available funding for such services. Fostering Connections funds may also be used for youth who reenter foster care within 12 months of leaving care and for pregnant or parenting youth who have aged out of foster care or are being cared for by kinship caregivers (e.g., grandparents). State plans suggest that most states are using Fostering Connections funds to address these populations as well. ACF awarded $17 million in FY2010 grants to fund \u201cQuality Improvement Centers (QICs) that share best practices and work with states and other entities to develop and implement solutions for improving child welfare outcomes. QICs focus on ways to help transition-age youth in foster care gain work skills and education credentials, reduce the number of youth who reenter foster care after leaving care prior to age 21, and prepare these youth for permanent living settings. For example, one QIC provides technical assistance to state-level workgroups on engaging transitioning-age youth in the design of policies, practices, and systems for transition-age youth. Fostering Youth Connections: QIC for States focuses on enhancing and expanding employment and education opportunities for youth in foster care, which may involve collaborating with community-based service providers. As of February 2017, this QIC had helped six states to develop a state-specific strategy on employing youth in foster care, eight states to develop a workforce development approach for youth in foster care, six states to develop a strategy for connecting youth in foster care with community colleges, and 24 states to establish or improve credit-bearing internships. Youth in foster care, like all adolescents, benefit from positive relationships with supportive adults, and some states are using Fostering Connections funds to help youth in foster care experience a more stable home life. For example, some states are using Fostering Connections funds to help youth ages 14 to 19 who live in foster care find permanent living arrangements through guardianship, kinship care, or voluntary placement agreements, in order to support youth who have been in foster care for more than 15 of the 36 months prior to finding a permanent home. Other states are focusing on increasing the number of foster care homes, finding foster parents who can", "Campus climate surveys on sexual violence are designed to collect information on the incidence and characteristics of sexual violence on college campuses as well as related student attitudes and behaviors.The topics covered by campus climate surveys can vary,dependingon the questions included on the survey instrument.

As described under the HEA, colleges and universities that participate in federal student financial assistance programs are required to collect and report this data annually to Education to ensure that the campus remains safe and to help reduce campus crime. The Campus Clery Act also requires institutions to report crime data for any \u201cnoncampus\u201d buildings or property that are owned or controlled by student organizations recognized by the college and that are primarily used and operated by students. Institutions are required to publish an annual report about campus crime, which is known as the Campus Safety and Security Survey for Colleges and Universities. To complete the survey, institutions are required to provide detailed information on several crimes, including sexual offenses, using their campus\u2019s definitions. Data can include either the number of reported incidents or the number of arrests made in connection with those incidents. For example, institutions must report (1) the number of reported forcible sex offenses, (2) the number of reported nonforcible sex offenses, and (3) the number of incidents reported under the definition of dating violence. Other data elements include (1) the number of arrests on campus for each of these incidents, (2) the number of arrests off campus for each", "This text requires an expert in summarization to summarize and provide some analysis to the given question.", "Federal law specifies that the EPSDT benefit covers screening, vision, dental, and hearing services, as well as other Medicaid coverable services that are necessary to correct or ameliorate any conditions discovered through screening. The EPSDT benefit generally entitles beneficiaries to these services regardless of whether such services are covered in a state\u2019s Medicaid state plan and regardless of any restrictions that the state may impose on coverage for adult services. The EPSDT screening component includes a wide range of preventive services, such as comprehensive child health assessments known as well-child screenings and age-appropriate blood lead screenings. Because EPSDT covers any medically necessary service that could be covered for adults in addition to the specified preventive screenings, the EPSDT benefit is generally more comprehensive than the benefits provided for adult beneficiaries. The federal government and states jointly share responsibility for implementing the EPSDT benefit. CMS, as part of its Medicaid oversight responsibilities, approves state Medicaid plans, which describe how the state administers its Medicaid program, including components related to the provision of EPSDT services. CMS also develops and issues general guidance to states about the EPSDT benefit, such as explanations of covered services and strategies for providing those services. Additionally, CMS has developed a goal for EPSDT, which is to assure that beneficiaries get the health care they need when they need it: the right care to the right child at the right time in the right setting. Further, CMS established performance measures, some with associated targets, to guide states\u2019 implementation of EPSDT. For example, CMS set performance measures and performance measure targets as part of its Oral Health Initiative. CMS developed the performance measure targets to carry out statutory requirements, quality improvement efforts, and agency policy. (See table 1 for EPSDT performance measures that have associated targets.) States have flexibility, within federal parameters, to determine how EPSDT services are provided. For example, states are required to ensure that Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries and their families are aware of the EPSDT benefit and have access to required services, but states can choose whether to administer the benefit themselves or to oversee managed care organizations that are contracted to provide the benefit. States may also determine the frequency of screening services and communicate them through periodicity schedules that meet federal requirements. CMS uses various sources of information to oversee the EPSDT benefit, such as the CMS-416, the Child Core Set, and the Medicaid and CHIP Scorecard. States report information about the provision of select ESPDT services to CMS annually through the CMS-416 and measures on the Child Core Set. The CMS-416 provides CMS with basic information about EPSDT services, such as the participant ratio and number of beneficiaries receiving a preventive dental service. It includes the information necessary for CMS to assess states\u2019 performance on the participant ratio and the screening ratio, among other things. The agency then can compare performance on the two ratios with the agency\u2019s ESPDT performance measure targets. The Child Core Set provides CMS with information about the quality of health care provided to Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, and supports state efforts to improve health care quality and health outcomes. Child Core Set reporting becomes mandatory on an annual basis beginning with the state reports on fiscal year 2024. As of 2019, the Child Core Set included performance measures related to the provision of EPSDT services, such as well-child visits in the first 15 months of life. Because reporting is currently voluntary, states vary in the number of performance measures they choose to report. In fiscal year 2017, for example, 50 states and the District of Columbia voluntarily reported on at least one of the 27 Child Core Set performance measures, with states reporting a median of 18 Child Core Set performance measures. (See app. II for the information reported in the CMS-416 and Child Core Set.) As shown in table 2, there are both similarities and differences between the CMS-416 and Child Core Set. Since the Child Core Set performance measures include CHIP beneficiaries who may not be entitled to the EPSDT benefit, data from the Child Core Set are not directly comparable with reporting on the CMS-416. In addition, CMS-416 data cover a longer period of time, as they are available from 1995, while Child Core Set data are available from 2011. CMS officials said that having more years of CMS-416 data helps identify trends in the provision of EPSDT services over a longer period of time than possible with the Child Core Set. On the other hand, CMS officials said it is difficult to compare states\u2019 performance using the CMS-416, because some performance measures are based on periodicity schedules, which vary state-to-state and over time. In contrast, the Child Core Set allows for more consistency in comparing data across states, because each state is expected to calculate performance measures in the same way. in June 2018, CMS published the first Medicaid and CHIP Scorecard, which includes performance measures about the provision of services to Medicaid \n1A\nWhat do the acronyms EPSDT and CAP stand for in healthcare?", "This text needs to be summarized", "Text Summarization\nYou are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Enacted in December 2015, ESSA\u2019s amendments to Title I, Part A (Title I) of the ESEA included a number of requirements for SEAs and school districts to ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. For the purposes of this report, we refer to these requirements collectively as the \u201cESSA educational stability provisions.\u201d Specifically, SEAs are required to describe in their Title I state plans the steps they will take to ensure collaboration with the state child welfare agency to ensure the educational stability of children in foster care, including assurances that: Such children enroll or remain in their school of origin, unless a determination is made that it is not in the child\u2019s best interest to attend the school of origin. This decision shall be based on all factors relating to the child\u2019s best interest, including consideration of the appropriateness of the current educational setting and the proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement. When a determination is made that it is not in a child\u2019s best interest to remain in the school of origin, the child is immediately enrolled in a new school, even if the child is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment. The enrolling school shall immediately contact the school last attended by the child to obtain relevant academic and other records. The SEA will designate an employee to serve as a point of contact for child welfare agencies and to oversee implementation of the above provisions. LEAs are required to provide in their Title I LEA plans assurances that they will collaborate with the state or local child welfare agency to: designate a point of contact, if the corresponding child welfare agency notifies the LEA in writing that the child welfare agency has designated a point of contact for the LEA; and develop and implement clear written procedures governing how transportation to maintain children in foster care in their school of origin when in their best interest will be provided, arranged, and funded for the duration of the time in foster care. The ESSA requirements described above were generally required to be implemented by December 10, 2016. In addition, SEAs and school districts are required to publicly report on the academic achievement and graduation rates of youth in foster care on their annual report cards. States and localities also have some flexibility in implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions. For example, ESSA does not prescribe a specific process for determining whether it is in a child\u2019s best interest to remain in their school of origin. In making this determination, state and local agencies have flexibility in determining which factors should be considered when evaluating the appropriateness of a child\u2019s current educational setting, as well as any additional factors that pertain to a child\u2019s best interest. Similarly, school districts and child welfare agencies generally determine the transportation procedures to use, provided they meet the minimum statutory requirements. In addition, SEAs may choose various approaches to help LEAs implement the ESSA educational stability provisions. For example, SEAs may decide to independently, or with their state child welfare agency, issue policies or guidance, disseminate question and answer documents, or hold informational meetings and webinars. Education and HHS collaborated to provide states with joint non- regulatory guidance specific to the ESSA educational stability provisions. In addition to this written guidance, Education provides technical assistance to states, such as through the State Support Network, one of its technical assistance providers. Each state also has a point of contact at Education for questions, according to Education officials. Education\u2019s Office of School Support and Accountability oversees state implementation of Title I, Part A of the ESEA, including the amendments made by ESSA. Education\u2019s oversight of SEAs includes reviewing state Title I plans that describe how states will follow a variety of federal requirements outlined in Title I, and periodic reviews of how each state is implementing Title I. These reviews occur every few years. HHS\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau oversees state child welfare agencies\u2019 implementation of Title IV-E, including the provisions in the Fostering Connections Act, and also provides related technical assistance. State and local officials reported facing several challenges related to implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions. Specifically, officials reported challenges with (1) turnover among local child welfare and educational agency staff, (2) obtaining school district input during the process for determining whether it is in a youth\u2019s best interest to remain in their school of origin (referred to as best interest determinations), (3) providing and funding transportation, (4) ensuring accurate identification of youth in foster care, and (5) monitoring how school districts implement these provisions. In addition, while we did not ask on our survey about the requirement to immediately enroll youth in a new school if it is determined that remaining in the school of origin is not in their best interest, or about the requirement for the enrolling school to immediately contact the last school attended to obtain relevant records, education and child welfare officials we interviewed said", "Corrosion is defined in section 2228 of Title 10, U.S. Code, as the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment. Corrosion can take varied forms, such as rusting, pitting, galvanic reaction, calcium or other mineral build- up, degradation due to ultraviolet light exposure, and mold, mildew, or other organic decay. Corrosion can be either readily visible or microscopic. To provide leadership on corrosion matters, including the development of policy guidance and oversight, consistent with section 2228, DOD has established an organizational structure that includes the Corrosion Office and Corrosion Executives. The Director of the Corrosion Office is to provide oversight and coordination of corrosion control and prevention efforts for the department. The military departments have each assigned officials to serve as Corrosion Executives. The Corrosion Executives operate within the chain of command of their respective military departments, while also coordinating with the Corrosion Office. Prior to August 2018, the Corrosion Office reported directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. In 2018 the Corrosion Office was relocated within DOD, after section 901 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. No. 114-328, hereinafter referred to as the Act) required DOD to restructure parts of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Among other things, the Act eliminated the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and it created: The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, who, among other things, serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all research, engineering, and technology development activities and programs in DOD. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, who, among other things, serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on acquisition and sustainment in DOD. In addition, the Under Secretary establishes policies on and supervises all elements of DOD relating to acquisition and sustainment. As part of this restructure, effective August 1, 2018, DOD relocated the Corrosion Office within the department\u2019s restructured acquisition and sustainment organization, as shown in figure 1. The Corrosion Office is now located within the department\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. Within this office, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness oversees the Corrosion Office. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness is a principal advisor to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment; provides integration and oversight of DOD\u2019s maintenance program; and develops policies and procedures for materiel readiness and maintenance support of DOD\u2019s major weapon systems and military equipment. DOD\u2019s Materiel Readiness organization oversees three Corrosion Executives \u2013 one representing each military department \u2013 who are responsible for implementing corrosion prevention measures in their respective departments. The Corrosion Office provides oversight and coordination of these and other DOD-wide corrosion prevention efforts. the military departments\u2019 acquisition programs to ensure that corrosion prevention efforts are adequately addressed; and conducting program outreach as necessary to encourage the active participation of industry, government agencies, and academic institutions in DOD\u2019s corrosion prevention program. The Corrosion Office is to: identify and prioritize research and scientific efforts in the academic and industrial communities; develop and implement an integrated set of science and technology programs that focus on identifying the root causes of corrosion and improving the performance of materials; promote the incorporation of corrosion prevention techniques into the process for developing new materials, components, and equipment designs; develop metrics to assess the effectiveness of corrosion prevention programs; and establish and maintain a database that enables program comparisons across DOD. In particular, it established specific roles and responsibilities and performance outcomes for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness, the Executive Director of the Corrosion Office, and the Corrosion Executives of the three military departments. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness was appointed the executive agent of DOD for corrosion, and the office is responsible for DOD-wide management and oversight of corrosion prevention and mitigation. More specifically, the office is to establish and implement policy, standards, and guidance regarding corrosion prevention and mitigation efforts, including providing recommendations and guidance to the Director of Research & Engineering, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, and the service branches. To support the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness in fulfilling these responsibilities, the Act gave him the following staff and authorities: An Executive Director for the DOD Corrosion Office. Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Materiel Readiness in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. Corrosion Executives in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness, as follows: One Corrosion Executive for the Army, with responsibility for the Army Materiel Command and the Army Corps of Engineers. One Corrosion Executive for the Air Force", "This report examines the agencies\u2019 management of abandoned hardrock mine sites\u2014sites that are remnants of mines that extracted ore other than coal on federal lands\u2014or mixed ownership sites on which abandoned mines are located, and it makes recommendations on how to improve the management of these sites.

Since then, the balance of the USEC Fund has grown to an estimated $1.695 billion as of fiscal year 2020. In 2015, we found that the entire balance of the USEC Fund is available for permanent rescission since the two statutorily authorized uses for the USEC Fund have been fulfilled: (1) environmental clean-up expenses pursuant to the \u2015McConnell Act,\u2016 and (2) expenses of privatization. In the fiscal year 2017 federal budget, the Administration proposed using the balances of the USEC Fund to carry out purposes authorized to be funded by the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. This is not one of the authorized purposes of the USEC Fund. We have previously found that DOE\u2019s effort to utilize USEC Fund monies instead of general fund appropriations to support efforts other than the authorized purpose of the USEC Fund would diminish transparency in budgeting. As of September 2019, Congress had not passed legislation to permanently rescind the balance of the USEC Fund, as we suggested in April 2015. Rescission may increase the transparency of federal agencies' budget presentations and help Congress have a clear understanding of how new funding requests relate to funding decisions for existing projects with continuing resource needs.", "MDA must manage the complexity inherent in developing and fielding ballistic missile defense elements to assure success.

As part of the military mission, the Corps designs, builds, and operates navigation and flood risk projects. To initiate a project, a community or congressional request is needed. Many of these requests stem from water resource problems that are beyond a community\u2019s ability to solve. The Corps conducts feasibility studies, which have key steps that include gathering data, conducting an evaluation of alternatives, and analyzing projected benefits and costs. This leads to an environmental assessment by the Corps and eventually to a chief\u2019s report. A project is only authorized if the Corps deems it to be in the federal interest. The Corps\u2019 procedures for conducting a feasibility study follow the 3x3x3 rule, meaning a project must meet the following time frames: a three-year period or less, spend less than $1 million, and be completed in three phases.

Infrastructure may also include overhead cameras mounted to a mast to help CBP officers visually inspect vehicles, and radiation portal monitors. Pedestrians enter the primary inspection area and typically queue in lanes that lead to booths in which CBP officers perform manual passport presentations at primary inspection. CBP is developing mobile biometric identity and document verification devices that will streamline primary inspection and reduce wait times for travelers who have been precleared and have submitted digital travel documents. In addition, at some land border crossings CBP officers may scan travel documents, which helps ensure the validity of travel documents and speeds the process of returning the travel documents to travelers who have been determined to be admissible. Pedestrians, passenger vehicles, and commercial traffic proceed to secondary inspection if CBP officers identify anomalies or risks related to the traveler or vehicle. CBP officers lead vehicles and pedestrians through their respective secondary inspection area in which they perform in-depth inspections, verify information, ask questions, and identify and document anomalies related to the traveler or vehicle. Secondary inspection areas typically have infrastructure and space requirements that are distinct from those of preprimary and primary inspection to accommodate in-depth examinations. Secondary inspection may last up to several hours, depending on the nature of the anomaly identified during primary inspection. To manage the processing of individuals and vehicles, secondary inspection areas may be larger in size, have more booths and lanes, and use different processing and queueing methods. Some large land border crossings may have additional primary inspection lanes, and dedicated secondary inspection lanes and facilities. Additional inspection requirements: In addition to primary, secondary, and commercial inspections conducted at land border crossings, CBP officers conduct targeted enforcement operations\u2014such as immigration enforcement and searches\u2014based on known or suspected violations. CBP has designated certain ports of entry to be Centers of Excellence to focus resources on specific border security needs. As a complement to these new efforts, OFO has enhanced the use of risk-based targeting and is using intelligence gathering and analysis to identify individuals and cargo of all modes of transportation that pose a high risk of smuggling, terrorism, or other illegal activities. CBP also uses advanced screening technologies such as biometrics, mobile applications, and behavior detection to screen travelers and commercial traffic, such as freight, at U.S. land borders. See the \u201cAdvance Technology\u201d section of this report for additional information on these new initiatives. Capital Planning: CBP also maintains and improves land border crossing infrastructure to support its mission. CBP\u2019s facilities and infrastructure are experiencing increased stress and strain, even though they were built to handle increased travel. Because of the 2001 terrorist attack, security infrastructure has increased and demands on land border crossing infrastructure continue to grow. Infrastructure demands will continue to grow in the coming years, as travel volume increases, security requirements change, and CBP modernizes its information technology systems. CBP is responsible for managing the condition of the facilities and infrastructure of all land border crossings that it owns. To efficiently and adequately meet the needs of the traveling public, CBP invests substantially to plan, design, construct, and implement capital and other types of improvements to its portfolio of 168 land border crossings. In 2004, CBP introduced the Planning, Programming, and Budget (PPB) System, as required by the Modernization and Information Technology Reform Act of 2003. Under the PPB system, CBB is required to submit a performance budget request that represents a projection of costs associated with its programs\u2019 operation and planned activities for the period of at least the next 5 years. According to CBB, PPB is an integrated, risk-based planning methodology that supports execution of its strategic objectives and aligns investments with performance goals by linking investments to CBP\u2019s strategic objectives and performance measures as required by the Government Performance and Results Act. CBP\u2019s land border crossing portfolio requires periodic updates in order to remain viable. Because CBB owns and manages land border crossings that span the full spectrum of activity levels, it must manage the portfolio of land border crossings as a diverse portfolio. CBP must strike a balance between meeting day-to-day facility needs and long-term capital requirements. CBP must also manage risk to ensure that the portfolio of land border crossings can meet future demand in the coming years by developing strategies that address the future, including a strategic view of the portfolio that integrates capital planning with human capital planning and information technology planning. Moreover, CBP must manage infrastructure at land border crossings on both sides of the border, often using limited funding to maintain existing infrastructure and to fund some limited modernization of land border crossing infrastructure. It must also maintain an effective working relationship with GSA, and other federal and non-federal entities to enable land border expansion to proceed properly.

These studies were varied in their design, methods, settings, and patient populations, making it difficult to generalize the findings to a broad population of patients or pharmacies. However, overall, the research suggests that medication synchronization may improve medication adherence and thus health outcomes for patients. One study reported that patients who were synchronized at a chain retail pharmacy for an HIV medication showed a 30 percent increase in the next 90 days in the number of HIV medications days\u2019 supply on hand\u2014reflecting better adherence\u2014than patients at pharmacies that were not synchronized. Another study reported that patients taking blood pressure medications who were initiated on medication synchronization at a mail order pharmacy demonstrated a 10 percent increase in medication adherence over a 6-month period. In contrast, the studies showed mixed results regarding whether patients filled their prescription medications more frequently. Two studies observed more frequent filling compared with control groups, but two other studies did not observe a significant change or found reductions in filling. A number of different stakeholders told us and our previous work has shown that medication synchronization may be easier for patients. For example, one study we identified found that among patients on three or more prescription medications, 64 percent of those enrolled in medication synchronization said that it made it easier for them to manage their medications, compared with 35 percent in a group that did not undergo synchronization. According to some stakeholders, patients using synchronization, particularly elderly patients or those on many medications, may be less likely to skip their medication. One stakeholder, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, observed that medication synchronization may help address nonadherence related to missed refills, patients\u2019 forgetfulness, or patients\u2019 ability to get to a pharmacy to pick up refills. Pharmacy staff may also be able to better monitor patients\u2019 medication use and more easily detect potential adverse events from medication interactions. They also said that this information is important to patients\u2019 physicians, enabling better patient care. Limited information exists on whether the use of medication synchronization has effects on patients\u2019 cost of medication. One study suggested that medication synchronization may increase patient costs if there are no benefits from reduced nonadherence or improved medication adherence\u2014for example, for patients who purchase medications with lower copayments in a tiered formulary. To address the challenges related to prescription drug spending, some stakeholders have proposed the increased use of medication synchronization as one potential way to manage cost. For example, in a 2016 report, the American Pharmacists Association stated that medication synchronization can help patients take their medications as prescribed, potentially reducing adverse events from improper use of drugs. Another report from the same organization stated that medication synchronization could lower pharmacy costs, reducing dispensing and transportation costs to the pharmacy, and improving pharmacist productivity. In addition, stakeholders also suggest that medication synchronization may have other benefits, either directly related to drug spending or through other mechanisms, such as reduced health care costs or improved patient outcomes. For example, some stakeholders believe that better health outcomes result from improved adherence, reduced medication waste, and improved patient medication-related knowledge overall. Other stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential increased costs for patients. According to these stakeholders, medication synchronization may mean less frequent visits to the pharmacy, but greater expenditures at each visit. These stakeholders also expressed worries that patients might be dissuaded from refilling expensive medications or that insurance plan copays might increase, leading to less adherence. In addition, some independent pharmacies may have concerns about lower margins as a result of the increased use of medication synchronization. Pharmacy staff may also have concerns about the increased workload and patient burden of medication synchronization, particularly given other initiatives that require pharmacists to provide services in addition to dispensing medications. For example, a survey by the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association found that pharmacists believe that medication synchronization requires significant time and labor. Stakeholders reported that the use of technology, such as software that automates synchronization, can ease pharmacists\u2019 workloads. Some stakeholders believe that health plans should share a portion of the savings that may result from medication synchronization in order to provide payment for this service. However, because CMS did not have any national figures showing that medication synchronization is reducing costs, it would be difficult to calculate the additional costs to payers that may result from increases in medication synchronization use. In 2003, in what may be the first national study of medication synchronization, 6 percent of independent pharmacies and 16 percent of chain pharmacies reported that they offered medication synchronization. As of 2018, most independent pharmacies reported offering medication synchronization.

A limited number of stakeholders offered information about technology solutions they believe could make medication synchronization more", "FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST 2017 THE NAVY SUFFERED FOUR SIGNIFICANT MISHAPS AT SEA THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF 17 SAILORS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE TO NAVY SURFACE SHIPS (SEE FIG 1)1.

According to DOD officials, each military department has its own performance monitoring system. Each system relies heavily on quarterly business reports, prepared by the developers, that describe the operations data and financial information for each housing project. In 2013, we reported that military service officials told us that as a result of a series of actions that they undertook, performance reporting improved and monitoring was enhanced. We found, however, that the quarterly reports that the Military Services receive often do not contain the same metrics found in the business agreements. We recommended that the Military Services update their quarterly reports to ensure that they contain comprehensive operating and financial data. This information would assist each Service\u2019s leadership in evaluating the performance of the projects, identifying potential issues and taking corrective actions. DOD concurred with our recommendation and its services modified the quarterly reporting requirements to provide more detailed information on each project\u2019s performance. During our review of DOD\u2019s FY2018 appropriations request, when we asked DOD officials how they were using the information that they were receiving from the quarterly reporting, their responses indicated that the reports are generally used as an internal management tool for the military departments. DOD officials did not indicate that the reports are used to identify or take corrective action related to an individual project\u2019s performance. They did not have any examples of corrective actions that they had taken as a result of the reports. DOD officials advised that quarterly monitoring reports of individual projects at military installations are used as part of the installation\u2019s overall property management operation. To illustrate this point, when we interviewed officials responsible for managing the privatized housing projects located at Joint Base San Antonio, located in Texas, they could not provide information on specific quarterly reports that had been issued for individual projects on their installation. Nevertheless, they reported that the installation\u2019s overall property management operation is under the oversight of the base commander, and that officials at the installation generally receive operating information on their military housing privatization projects as part of their property management responsibilities. Each military installation has an annual report that summarizes the installation\u2019s operating and financial information. This report, called the Installation Management Report, is prepared by the installation\u2019s Public Private Venture officials. The reports are reviewed by the Department of the Army and the other Military Services in order to assess the installation\u2019s overall operations. These reports are also used to monitor the privatized housing programs on those facilities that are included on the Military Service installation reports. In November 2017, we issued a report in response to a congressional request to review the extent to which DOD\u2019s Military Housing Privatization Program is meeting the expectations and requirements set forth in the Military Housing Privatization Readiness Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-106), as amended. We found that DOD\u2019s execution of the privatization program generally complied with the statutory requirements, but that the Military Services are not meeting the requirement to achieve specific occupancy levels in privatized housing, and the program has not resulted in significant improvements in housing quality and has not produced a reliable cost savings. Regarding our findings on monitoring, we stated that DOD\u2019s monitoring of its privatized housing programs has been limited in scope and frequency. For example, DOD\u2019s Military Service financial management systems lack the capability to track privatized housing project performance consistently across multiple years and installations. These shortcomings have limited DOD\u2019s ability to identify and implement cost-effective interventions to enhance project performance. We also concluded that DOD\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management has not ensured that the Military Services have policies and procedures in place to ensure proper monitoring. As a result, DOD\u2019s oversight of its privatized housing programs has been ad hoc, which contributed to the underoccupancy and overreliance on rental housing within the programs. Further, DOD has not developed an effective and reliable way to evaluate the health and safety of privatized housing. Our study also found that financial performance data from the Military Services showed that the housing business generally experienced modest operating surpluses over the period of our review. DOD\u2019s FY2016 appropriations enacted language in the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2016, section 8013 that requires us to report to the Committee on Appropriations, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as part of", "DOD uses contracts to procure many different types of supplies and services. Before awarding a contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officials must review information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System. Furthermore, for competitively awarded contracts using negotiated procedures and expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, agencies generally must evaluate a contractor\u2019s past performance, which can include information about prior safety incidents and may be used to support award decisions. While OSH regulations generally apply to federal contracts, it is not always clear which agency is responsible for enforcing compliance. CONCLUSION: In summary, there is a lack of transparency and accountability in the implementation of existing OSH regulatory functions at DOD and among the federal agencies and regulators involved in the procurement process. Specifically, OSH regulations are not being consistently applied to DOD contractors as they do not contain enough incentives for contractors to prioritize safety, and OSH functions are not consistently integrated with procurement functions.", "This text was about establishing and training the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams within DOD. The summary was about how CMF teams are aligned with various DOD organizations, the training of the CMF personnel, and the key responsibilities for training the CMF.", "VA\u2019s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. In providing health care and other benefits to veterans, the department relies extensively on IT systems and networks to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data. Accordingly, effective information security controls based on federal guidance and requirements are essential to ensure that the department\u2019s systems and information are adequately protected. OMB has developed a cybersecurity management maturity model, based on the NIST framework, that helps IGs assess their agency\u2019s performance against known cybersecurity practices. In accordance with the model, we assessed VA\u2019s performance in five areas: practices, governance, security culture, continuous monitoring, and incident response. We did not provide a total score or determine maturity levels because the model does not provide such measures. We identified some notable strengths and areas where improvements were needed. Specifically, VA has developed several sound, well-implemented tools, policies, and processes to enhance its cybersecurity. The department\u2019s efforts in three key areas warrant particular mention: \u2022 Implementation of the DHS Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program: VA is a participating agency and has adopted most of the tools that DHS provides at its disposal at no cost. VA has used these tools to assess risk across the enterprise, and it can now prioritize resources based on risk for a greater return. \u2022 Implementation of Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: VA has implemented Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management to enhance its approach to information security by incorporating security requirements into the acquisition and supply chain of hardware, software, and services. \u2022 Security of mobile devices: VA has implemented strong controls for mobile devices used by VA employees and contractors, such as password requirements, encryption, and remote-wipe capabilities. Despite this progress, VA can significantly improve its cybersecurity practices in the following areas: \u2022 Incident response: VA needs to better track incidents across the enterprise and improve its ability to perform comprehensive analysis and remediation. \u2022 Awareness training: VA needs to enhance employee awareness of and training on security measures, as well as their roles in security and incident response. \u2022 Monitoring: VA needs to use monitoring tools more effectively to detect and track events and detect potential problems. \u2022 Risk management: VA needs to improve its risk identification and mitigation practices to prioritize efforts aimed at eliminating high-risk vulnerabilities. \u2022 Network security: VA should strengthen its network security practices to defend against common cyberattacks, including those targeting users and privileged accounts. Our overall findings and recommendations are detailed in the following sections.", "The purpose of this report is to provide congressional staff with an updated review of physical security controls in place at DOD installations, including controls limiting unauthorized entry; controls for controlling motor vehicle traffic; controls limiting access to buildings; emergency controls; force protection measures; security of DOD information and information systems; and physical security controls associated with the acquisition or construction of DOD facilities. We are making this review as part of our statutory requirement to provide oversight of DOD installations and DOD facility management. Our objective is to identify and address issues of concern to Congress, such as the implementation and effectiveness of policies, procedures, and controls. We analyzed DOD publications and regulations, observed physical security training and equipment demonstrations, and held meetings and conducted discussions with selected individuals at military and civilian installations. To obtain insight into DOD\u2019s current plans and future actions we reviewed selected strategic policy documents, including the Joint Warfighting Capability Assessment 2017, the Joint Staff Capstone Concept for Joint Warfighting, and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. To obtain additional insight into concerns of military personnel, installations, and oversight organizations regarding physical security controls, we contacted more than 90 representatives of these entities. We have reported previously on DOD physical security controls, particularly the protection of classified information. Our September 2018 report reviewed information security controls that DOD uses in connection with the protection of classified information. Additionally, we plan to provide additional oversight in this area. Specifically, we plan to review actions DOD is taking to identify and address the vulnerabilities we have observed and to assess DOD\u2019s current implementation of its physical security controls. INTRODUCTION FOR OVERSIGHT AND ACCESS CONTROL TO DOD INSTALLATIONS\nIt is clear that physical security controls are an element in a holistic approach for protecting military installations, to include the personnel, property, and missions they support.

The Army Corps of Engineers is providing security services to all Army installations and is developing a new regulation which will establish the guidelines for Army installation security services. This regulation will address personnel security, access controls, and physical site security, among other things. We are informed that this regulation is undergoing a review and revision by a high-level Army security review team. Once this review is complete and the regulation is finalized, the Army Corps of Engineers will provide guard services.

In July 2018, the Department of Education issued a plan to carry out this executive order. The plan includes a description of HBCU-related goals, actions, and milestones. One strategy outlined included in the plan includes increasing access to capital by HBCUs through funding programs such as HBCU Innovation Fund, among other federal programs. SBA has made efforts to strengthen relationships with HBCUs through programs that aid entrepreneurship such as the Small Business Development Centers and SCORE. One objective of the efforts could be to increase awareness among HBCUs about federal resources available to support entrepreneurship. In addition, SBA could also increase communication with HBCUs focused on fostering better alignment between SBA and HBCUs\u2019 entrepreneurship initiatives. In light of SBA and HBCUs\u2019 missions that largely complement one another, it makes sense that SBA may target efforts to increase HBCUs\u2019 entrepreneurial initiatives, as opposed to targeting all other 4-year institutions of higher education. Specifically, HBCUs could potentially: (1) receive additional funding for entrepreneurship related activities or (2) benefit from unique initiatives related to fostering entrepreneurship. We do not have information on whether HBCUs receive additional funding for entrepreneurship activities from sources other than those listed in text. We know the amount of funding available through the Small Business Development Centers and SCORE programs and do not have data on the specific amount of funding, if any, going to HBCUs through these programs.\nSBA has programs that provide small business counseling and technical assistance to underrepresented businesses.\nPublished by the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402\nU.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 2019-1535-S: \u2022 202-512-1800\nThe Office of Entrepreneurial Development, Office of Field Operations, and Office of Strategic Alliances are key SBA offices that administer entrepreneurial programs and manage outreach efforts that could foster entrepreneurship (see fig. 1). Office of Entrepreneurial Development. The Office of Entrepreneurial Development oversees several programs, primarily through a nationwide network of public and private resource partners that offer small business counseling and technical assistance. These resource partners include SBDCs, Women\u2019s Business Centers (WBCs), and SCORE chapters. The SBDC program receives the majority of entrepreneurial development program funding to provide technical assistance (business counseling and training) to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs. SBDC services include assisting small businesses access capital, develop and exchange new technologies, and improve business planning, strategy, and financial management. The entities eligible to receive SBDC funding are primarily institutions of higher education. By statute, the amount eligible entities receive varies depending on a state population-based funding formula subject to the amount of an appropriation in any given fiscal year. As a condition of receiving the grant, the recipient or host institution is responsible for establishing a lead center and network of service centers for a designated service area. The SBDC program has 63 lead centers (generally hosted by institutions of higher education) and more than 900 service centers, including satellite locations. SBA has identified certain special emphasis groups to be targeted for assistance by SBDCs, such as certain populations of business owners. The groups do not include institutions; thus, HBCUs are not included as special emphasis groups. According to SBA officials, SBDCs target underrepresented groups in the population of business owners near HBCUs. Office of Field Operations. SBA also provides services through a network of 10 regions and 68 district offices that are led by the Office of Field Operations. SBA district offices serve as the point of delivery for most SBA programs and services. Some district office staff (including business opportunity, lender relations, and economic development specialists) work directly with SBA clients. SBA\u2019s district offices also can initiate and oversee outreach activities to foster entrepreneurship. For example, SBA district offices can implement counseling or training events on their own, participate in such events organized by third parties, or co-sponsor such activities with a third party (for-profit, nonprofit, or government entity) through a co-sponsorship agreement. Moreover, district offices can enter into a 2-", "text_source", "The demand for physicians will probably continue to increase over time. Federal GME programs help finance that training.

CBP has a variety of non-intrusive surveillance and inspection tools that are designed to detect illicit drugs moving along the Southwest border, and the agency continues to develop and enhance detection technologies. This report focuses on the role of physical barriers (i.e., walls and fences) when they are present, and specifically on how they can potentially impact the smuggling of foreign- produced, illicit drugs between POEs. It does not seek to address the impact of barriers on the prevention or detection of drug smuggling at POEs. The report examines the effects of the existing barriers on the smuggling of illicit drugs between POEs. As the existing barriers along the Southwest border are already multi-layered and include a combination of structures and equipment as well as increased border personnel, the extent to which barriers can help detect or deter illicit drug smuggling between POEs cannot be considered in isolation. That is, a barrier by itself is not a foolproof method of detering smuggling; its effectiveness might depend on the combined impacts of its presence, along with other law enforcement activities and tools, particularly as smugglers adapt in response to new barriers or intensified border enforcement. What follows begins a discussion about the effectiveness of existing barriers as physical tools to detect and deter the smuggling of illicit drugs between POEs. The first section describes the types of surveillance and inspection tools that are used to detect drugs moving between POEs, regardless of the presence of barriers. The second section focuses on how border barriers may affect the detection of drugs moving between POEs through these tools. It uses historical data to examine trends in the detection of illicit drugs between POEs since FY1970, in order to understand the potential impacts of such data on the current analysis. It also attempts to isolate the effects of increased staffing and surveillance equipment changes, from the potential impacts of the border barriers. The discussion of the impacts of border barriers focuses on marijuana as a prime example, as it is the most-detected illicit drug moved between POEs. This report uses historical data from CBP on the detection of illicit drugs between POEs in order to examine trends and potential impacts related to the effectiveness of barrier as tool to detect drugs moving between POEs.", "1.

These considerations led Justice Kagan to state that \"I'd hate to take something that's the product of long internal discussion and put it out in the world in bits and bytes and have that be what that becomes.\" On June 10, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2020 H.R. 2722. The bill H.R. 2722 passed the House on June 26, 2019, by a vote of 217-197. The House Appropriations Committee report accompanying H.R. 2722 states that the funding for the judiciary reflects the \"urgent need\" to address the federal judiciary's \"growing caseload and rising complexity of cases.\" The bill includes funding for several new programs and activities that are intended to address such issues. The House bill approves a total of $6.8 billion in discretionary appropriations for the judiciary, or approximately 19% less than the President's requested $8.29 billion. This $1.51 billion difference is significantly less than the typical difference between the President's request and House subcommittee reported amount each year since FY2017, when the President proposed a $5.1 billion cut and the House approved a total of $4.59 billion. The differences between the President's request and the House appropriations Committee reported amounts reflect differences between the amounts for courts of appeals, district courts, the Federal Judiciary Police Service, and the Judiciary Data Center. The differences also reflect adjustments to the judiciary's accounts for retirement accounts and judges' salaries. The judiciary has received an average of $34.4 million less than the President's request for retirement accounts through FY2020. The average net difference for judges' salaries is $23.0 million each year over this period. TABLE 1.

FY2020 judiciary appropriations will be enacted through a combination of eleven bills that appropriate funds for various federal agencies and their programs through FY2020. Two bills address judiciary appropriations directly; the other nine funds appropriations for related justice system activities such as the Justice Management Division and Office of the Inspector General. The other nine bills include H.R. 3055, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020. It provides appropriations for related justice system activities, such as the Justice Management Division and Office of the Inspector General. The bill includes $15.3 billion in discretionary appropriations (including $13.2 billion in new appropriations); the bill includes $8.8 billion for the Department of Justice and related activities, $3.0 billion for the Census Bureau, and $1.8 billion for science and space programs. H.R. 3055 was signed into law on December 18, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the President signed H.R. 133, the minibus bill that included H.R. 3055, as well as nine other appropriations bills (H.R. 2142, H.R. 1165, H.R. 1275, H.R. 2155, H.R. 2165, H.R. 2579, H.R. 3055, H.R. 3057, and H.R. 3058 ).\nThe judiciary's request comprised $7.5 billion in congressionally directed programs and $640.9 million in mandatory programs and administrative provisions (including $8.8 million in new mandatory programs). Mandatory programs are funded outside of the regular annual appropriations process and have the force of law. For the remaining $1.04 billion, the Congress directed that certain funds be used only for the particular agency or agency program, but the funds would still be available to the President for use elsewhere through reprograming. In FY2020, the judiciary's request for congressionally directed programs included $8.8 million more for such programs than in FY2019 (see Table 2 ). Of importance to the Congress are several programs that help finance the operation of the judiciary.

The report also includes an assessment of expiring provisions enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148) or extended under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136). The two types of provisions typically involved are enacted in the context of authorization laws and thus are predominantly within the purview of congressional authorizing committees. Congressional decisionmaking for the lifespan of expiring provisions involves tradeoffs between the frequency of congressional review and the stability of funding or other legal requirements. Health care-related expiring provisions may fall under one of two categories: mandatory spending provisions that provide funds or control finances; or authorities and special protections that affect policies related to health care and associated activities and programs. A few of the types of expiring provisions excluded from this report include transitional or routine provisions, demonstration projects, and pilot programs. Additionally, some authorized activities such as discretionary appropriations, discretionary user fees, and certain user rate protections are excluded. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program funds education for adolescents exclusively on abstaining from sexual activity outside of marriage. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the program, and funding is provided primarily via formula grants.

The Administration also requests $22.00 million in operating expenses for the Department of State (DOS) under the Chief Information Officer (CIO). The request eliminates funding for Overseas Citizen Services (OCS) and for the U.S. Mission to UNESCO. However, it also raises funding for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (UMUN) and for the European Union/International Organization desk at the State Department and restores funding that the President proposed to cut for the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. Human Settlements Program (UN Habitat) in FY2020. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) request funding for FY2021 is included in the Administration's request for international disaster assistance, some of which is not specific to USAID programs.

The United States considers them valuable allies and has strong ties with them. Summary is provided here. Read on for more details. policy, liberalization of the labor market, and a focus on the environment. Latvia has experienced political instability related in part to longstanding conflict between supporters of the Russian-speaking minority (which constitutes about 35% of the population) and of the national majority over the past two decades. Latvia held a snap parliamentary election on March 3, 2019, amid heightened regional security concerns related to Russia's 2014 occupation and annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and the outbreak of violent protests in nearby Belarus. The election resulted in a strong win for the party of Prime Minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 in coalition with the New Conservative Party (JCP). The party won 35% of the vote and 40 seats. Support for parties advocating for Latvia's departure from the Euro-Atlantic community was relatively weak in the election, but concerns about Kremlin influence on politics in Latvia and Estonia remain an issue for U.S. policymakers. In January 2020, the Latvian government approved a deal to pay its former owners (about 90,000 mostly Russian-speakers) and their descendants for properties confiscated for wartime use and subsequent Soviet/Latvian state use, as a result of which some 160,000 foreign nationals, including about 106,000 Latvian citizens, now hold foreign property or land titles in Latvia. It has been the case for over 100 years that a combination of war, revolution, ethnic cleansing, and migration has resulted in a majority (85%) ethnic Latvian population and a 16% Russian-speaking population, although the percentage of ethnic Russians has dropped since the restoration of independence in 1991. Latvia, by contrast, has focused on building ties with the European Union. In November 2019, 75% of voters supported Latvia remaining in the EU in general, and only 31% said they were happy to be EU citizens. Although voters have tended to express lower support for EU membership, the majority of citizens reject Latvia's withdrawal from the EU. Lithuania has had more stable governance over the past decade than Latvia, with a strong majority of the country's voters supporting policies aimed at consolidating its sovereignty over foreign influence, including that of Russia. Lithuanian efforts at economic diversification, driven in part by concern over potential energy dependence on Russia, have met with some success: for example, electricity produced by Klaipeda's liquefied natural gas terminal can supply all of Lithuania's power demand. The country has invested in wind energy facilities, and Lithuania recently made progress toward reducing reliance on Russian airspace for international air travel. Lithuania's military spending is 3% lower than Estonia's, but at 2.5% of GDP, its military budget remains the highest in Europe relative to its size and among the highest in NATO (with the United States in second place at 3.4%). All three Baltic states have active militaries and have invested in modern equipment.", "What benefits and potential drawbacks does the use of the Every Student Succeeds Act's Title I-E authority provide for states and LEAs looking to implement weighted student funding systems?</s> \nThe use of the Every Student Succeeds Act's Title I-E authority provides states and LEAs with the flexibility to consolidate federal and state funding streams to create a single funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged students. This system aims to address funding inequities and provide additional resources to schools with higher concentrations of at-risk students. However, the implementation of such a system can be complex and may require significant changes to existing state and LEA policies. Additionally, the use of this authority may lead to reduced transparency and accountability in the allocation of funds at the state and LEA levels.", "What was the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on economic mobility (both short-term and long-term)?\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) significantly reduced the federal income tax for many low- and middle-income families, providing a temporary infusion of new cash for these households (many of which were already earning high wages and were not poor). This increase in income may have made certain families more economically secure, which could lead to increased economic mobility in the long term. However, the long-term economic effects of the TCJA are uncertain, and it remains possible that changes in the short-term will have unintended consequences. In the short-term, higher income families already with a high capacity to save and invest may have used their tax break to save and invest more, further increasing their wealth and income disparities with lower-income families. Additionally, other changes to the tax code in the TCJA could have longer term impacts on economic mobility, such as the long term decrease in the Corporate Income Tax rate. Overall, there is limited empirical evidence available to assess the long-term impact of the TCJA on economic mobility. Therefore, more research and data is needed to understand fully the potential impact of the TCJA on economic mobility.", "O n December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. Illnesses have since been linked to a disease caused by a previously unidentified strain of coronavirus, designated Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19. Despite containment efforts in China, the United States, and elsewhere, by late February there were indications that the COVID-19 outbreak may have entered a new phase, with community spread occurring or suspected in several countries other than China, including in the United States. Diagnostic testing is a critical part of the public health response to and clinical management of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Efforts in the United States to develop and disseminate a test for COVID-19 have faced challenges. Manufacturing and quality issues with the nation's test\u00e2\u0080\u0094developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094resulted in essentially all testing going through CDC's laboratory facility in Atlanta through early March, despite distribution of test kits to state and local public health labs beginning in early February. CDC's initial test kits had to be remanufactured and redistributed, which, along with other factors, has significantly delayed access to testing throughout the country. On February 29, 2020, in an effort to facilitate the expansion of testing capacity as the first cases of community spread were confirmed in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a significant new policy. This policy, issued via agency guidance and effective immediately, allows certain laboratories\u00e2\u0080\u0094principally clinical and commercial laboratories\u00e2\u0080\u0094that have developed and validated their own COVID-19 diagnostics to begin to use the tests prior to the test receiving an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the agency. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19, in part because it is caused by a novel pathogen, has been led and carried out to date through the country's public health infrastructure. This includes primarily the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the country's network of state and local public health laboratories. In contrast, in most situations, diagnostic testing is carried out by a number of facilities, including private commercial laboratories (e.g., Quest, LabCorp), hospital and other clinical laboratories, and laboratories in academic medical centers, among others. FDA's February 29 guidance aims to facilitate the expansion of diagnostic testing from the public health setting into the clinical health care and commercial settings, leveraging significant standing resources throughout the country, including facilities, trained personnel, expertise, materials, and equipment. It is FDA's intention that this expansion will help the country meet the increasing and substantial demand for testing generated by community spread of the disease and expanded clinical testing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  In addition, because many cases of COVID-19 are reportedly mild or asymptomatic, widespread access to testing\u00e2\u0080\u0094which informs development of important metrics such as the case fatality rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094is critical to understanding the scope and extent of the disease in the United States, and to efficiently directing resources to mitigate its impact in the broader community.", "Every 10 years, the U.S. population is counted through the national census, and districts for the U.S. House of Representatives are readjusted to reflect the new population level and its distribution across states through the federal apportionment and state redistricting processes.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility criteria.

END OF SUMMARY", "The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-78, Title IX; 7 U.S.C. 1635 et seq.) requires meat packers to report purchase prices and other information to the USDA for cattle, swine, and boxed beef. Lamb and lamb meat were added through initial rulemaking and the act was amended to include wholesale pork in 2010. In past reauthorizations, livestock industry stakeholders have supported reauthorization of the act but also have proposed amendments to mandatory reporting. The reauthorization date is currently September 30, 2020 in the enacted Agriculture Reauthorization Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54).", "On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law ( P.L. 116-136 ). The CARES Act includes $3.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). This report provides an overview of the CCDBG provisions in the CARES Act. Among other things, these provisions address allowable uses and flexibilities of the supplemental funds. The report also includes allocations for the additional $3.5 billion in CCDBG appropriations. The CCDBG Act (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a79858 et seq.) is the main federal law supporting child care programs for low-income working families. The CCDBG is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS allocates CCDBG funds to states, territories, and tribes according to a statutory formula. In addition, certain funds may be reserved for other activities, such as technical assistance and research. State, territory, and tribal lead agencies submit CCDBG plans to HHS every three years describing how their child care programs will operate. CCDBG funds are used to subsidize the cost of child care for eligible children of low-income working parents. Funds are also used to support activities to improve the quality of child care and for certain other costs. The CARES Act appropriates $3.5 billion in FY2020 emergency supplemental funds to the CCDBG. The funds are to be used to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.\" The CARES Act funds are provided in addition to FY2020 annual appropriations of $5.8 billion (see P.L. 116-94 ). The additional $3.5 billion represents a 60% increase in total appropriations to the CCDBG in FY2020. The additional funds are to remain available for obligation by HHS through September 30, 2021 (i.e., the end of FY2021). The CARES Act includes a number of provisions that clarify allowable uses and, in some cases, waive certain underlying requirements of the CCDBG Act. Below is a brief discussion of key provisions. Under the CCDBG Act, lead agencies subsidize the cost of child care for eligible children. Lead agencies commonly provide subsidy payments directly to child care providers. In some cases, lead agencies may provide additional CCDBG funds to eligible providers for other purposes, such as supporting professional development or helping build the supply of quality child care. The CARES Act specifies that CCDBG funds appropriated in the act may be used to provide continued payments and assistance to child care providers in cases of decreased enrollment or closures related to coronavirus, and to ensure that providers are able to remain open or reopen as appropriate and applicable. The CCDBG Act generally encourages (but does not require) lead agencies to make payments to child care providers based on enrollment rather than attendance. Specifically, the law states that lead agencies should \"to the extent practicable\" delink provider reimbursements from an eligible child's occasional absences due to holidays or unforeseen circumstances such as illness. This provision of the law is intended to support the fixed costs incurred by providers. The CARES Act specifies that CCDBG funds appropriated in the act shall be available to eligible child care providers under the CCDBG Act for the purposes of cleaning and sanitation, and other activities necessary to maintain or resume the operation of programs. The act clarifies that this provision applies to eligible child care providers even if those providers were not receiving CCDBG assistance prior to the public health emergency resulting from coronavirus. Under the CCDBG Act, eligible child care providers generally must be licensed, regulated, or registered by the state (though states may exempt certain providers from this requirement); and meet certain minimum health and safety standards. An exception to these requirements is made in cases of child care providers caring only for relatives. However, such providers must comply with requirements applicable to relative caregivers. The CARES Act encourages states, territories, and tribes to place conditions on payments to child care providers aimed at ensuring providers use a portion of the funds to continue to pay staff salaries and wages. Payment of salaries and wages is not explicitly addressed in the CCDBG Act, though presumably it is typical for some share of CCDBG provider payments to support these expenses. According to national estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the mean hourly wage for child care workers was $12.27 in May 2019. BLS estimated the mean annual wage for child care workers at $25,510 nationally.", "The report provides statistical information on indigenous peoples in Latin America, including populations and languages, socioeconomic data, land and natural resources, human rights, and international legal conventions.

In some cases, Transformation aims to expand or deepen existing efforts, such as a \"Data Revolution.\" In other cases, it involves radical departures from USAID's traditional procedures or structures. The report discusses some of the novel aspects of Transformation and potential trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness. The report does not attempt to catalog in detail all of the many USAID reforms that are underway nor does it analyze all the potential impacts of the reforms or their effectiveness as a whole. Transformation of USAID includes an array of internal USAID initiatives that span a variety of elements, including: 1. USAID reorganization, including development of new regional bureaus and new divisions (such as a Global Finance Center) designed to enhance USAID's capabilities. 2. Streamlined processes for USAID programs, such as the \"One Mission Plan.\" 3. Workforce professionalization and modernization efforts. 4. New use of technologies, such as a \"Data Revolution\" and increased use of mobile communications. 5. Efforts to promote American and private sector involvement in development assistance. 6. New country strategies for USAID's work in key countries and a new U.S. government-wide strategy for addressing global hunger. Some of these efforts could potentially result in structural alterations in how assistance is implemented and who engages in that implementation. Other initiatives more directly address USAID's internal needs but could alter how certain types of assistance are implemented and could alter the ways that USAID engages partners. Some of these changes build on USAID efforts that began prior to the Green Administration, others build on OMB's government-wide reform plan, and some are distinct from both. USAID expects several of its reforms to be implemented incrementally over time, while others are intended to have immediate impact. Some are well defined, while others are still emerging or remain only partially detailed. A number of the transformations focus on policy rather than structural goals, often emphasizing a broader change in USAID's orientation or priorities rather than describing a precise change in internal processes or structures. For example, although the transformation of some administrative processes might be an early indication that policy directions are changing at USAID, the two things are not necessarily tied. The USAID experience-informed, innovation-driven approach to reform (Transformation) and the emphasis on self- sufficiency in reform implementation seem, on their face, distinct from prior USAID reform initiatives. Some of the changes to USAID processes and structures include a reorganization of the Agency along a regional and functional model, the establishment of new divisions or teams to lead key efforts, and, for many employees, a significant change in job structures. In contrast to past reform initiatives, these changes appear to be focused on supporting USAID's role as a key implementer of foreign aid on behalf of the United States rather than on implementing a specific operational model. For example, the establishment of a \"Global Development Council\" to advise and make recommendations to the USAID Administrator suggests that the Agency intends to engage broader stakeholders in guiding USAID in their pursuit of foreign assistance objectives. This approach may make it easier for USAID to prioritize country and issue areas of emphasis in a way that is consistent with President Trump's foreign policy priorities but may also reduce the likelihood that USAID's assistance is tailored to meet country-specific needs. Many of the reforms proposed under Transformation are distinct from past reform efforts. USAID's recent reorganization and new operational divisions (such as the Data Center and Global Finance Center), for example, are distinct from past reorganizations. Similarly, new efforts to prioritize data or to promote a \"culture of innovation\" are novel features of Transformation that USAID has not explicitly adopted in the past. On the other hand, several components of Transformation appear to be consistent with past reform efforts at USAID and other U.S. foreign aid agencies. USAID is not the first USAID Administrator to advocate for greater USAID-private sector collaboration; past efforts in that direction include USAID's 2011 Partnering to Achieve Sustainable Development (PASD) policy (\"the 2010 policy\") as well as U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL) initiatives. Efforts to emphasize \"country-based leadership\" in development (including some elements of USAID's Journey to Self-Reliance framework) draw in part on past USAID priorities to \"partner with countries in their development journey.\" Some of the proposed USAID reforms, particularly those focused on \"professionalization\" of USAID staff, echo similar proposals in the past. USAID's emphasis on more rapid and flexible implementation and decision-making processes parallels efforts in the past to \"streamline\" USAID processes or to improve project", "The United States and China have been involved in a strained relationship throughout the 40 th anniversary of their diplomatic relations. Trade disputes have been a key source of tension, with the U.S. accusing China of unfair trade practices. Other issues of contention include national security concerns and human rights. Attempts to alleviate the tension have been made through a balance between competition and cooperation, but currently the relationship is dominated by competition. What are the specific actions or policies you would recommend as an expert to reduce the tensions between the United States and China in the future?</s> \nAs an expert, I would recommend the following specific actions and policies to reduce the tensions between the United States and China in the future:\n\n1. Maintain regular communication and dialogue: Both countries have significant interests at stake in their relationship, and regular communication can help in identifying mutual areas of concern and opportunities for cooperation.\n\n2. Trade and economic cooperation: While disagreements over trade and economic policies have been a major source of tension, both countries can benefit from increased cooperation, particularly in areas such as climate change, cybersecurity, and international development.\n\n3. Avoid escalation of military posturing: Tensions have been heightened by military posturing by both sides, particularly over issues such as Taiwan, South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean. It is important to exercise restraint and avoid provocative actions that could escalate tensions.\n\n4. Encourage mutual respect and understanding: Both countries need to recognize their respective cultural and historical differences and promote understanding and mutual respect. Cultural exchange programs and student exchange programs can help in achieving this.\n\n5. Recognize common interests: Both countries have a mutual interest in maintaining global stability and promoting international rule of law. Areas of common interest can be increased cooperation in dealing with critical global issues such as climate change, international terrorism, and international peacekeeping.\n\n6. Avoid media escalation: China and the United States need to resist the temptation of media sensationalism, which tends to escalate mutual threats, misunderstandings, and misperceptions, contributing to further tension.\n\n7. Increase transparency and openness: Transparency, openness, and cooperation are key elements for improving bilateral relations. Open channels of communication will help in reducing misunderstandings and mistrust. Both countries can begin by setting up regular meetings of senior officials and encouraging more exchanges on matters of mutual concern.\n\nOverall, it is imperative for the two countries to avoid escalation of tensions and to commit to maintaining peace and stability in the region and the world at large through mutual respect and cooperation.", "WHAT ARE LARGE UNMANNED SURFACE VESSELS, MEDIUM UNMANNED SURFACE VESSELS, AND EXTRA LARGE UNMANNED UNDERSEA VEHICLES? \nCongress should use this report to assess (1) whether Congress should authorize and fund the Navy's requests for research and development funding for these large UVs, (2) which specific types of large UVs should receive priority, and (3) how to address the potential oversight issues that these research and development programs raise. The issues include whether to authorize the Navy to develop multiple types of large UVs that serve different purposes, or whether the Navy should develop a smaller number of more flexible UV designs. Congress also has concerns about how the Navy plans to integrate the use of UVs into its long-term strategies for operating in the contested battlespace of the 21st century, and how it is working to overcome the relatively slow pace that it has adopted in transitioning UV development efforts (such as the Extra-large USVs on which the Navy has experimented for three decades) into programs for procuring and integrating these large UVs. Navy officials expect that large UVs acquired from FY2021 to FY2025 will be (1) used to perform certain missions that currently require a combination of manned ships and submarines, (2) used for independent missions that are too dangerous, dull, or dirty for manned ships and submarines, (3) used for certain missions that are too numerous or unpredictable to reliably assign manned ships and submarines to perform, and/or (4) used to perform certain missions that manned ships and submarines are incapable of performing because technical or human limits place constraints on the performance of traditional platforms that must accommodate on-board provisions for human crews, and/or their size must be sufficiently small to ensure sufficient operational flexibility for navigating narrow or shallow waterways. \nOverall, the Navy envisions that large UVs, working in conjunction with manned ships and submarines and other UV types, could provide a relatively cost-effective, versatile, and flexible approach to conducting Navy missions and operations, including: \n\nIt then identifies each system/vehicle's mission; its planned developmental phases; its current estimated cost; the shipyards intended to build it (or its planned assembly site); its planned service entry date; its planned fleet size; its projected mission workload (and mission duration); its envisioned operating sites and sea conditions; and its envisioned operating modes (such as whether it would be manned or unmanned, or whether it would have a human on board as a rider or supervisor). \n\nThe Navy's FY2021 request includes $3.7 billion for the research and development of the LUSV, MUSV, and XLUUV. The Navy requests an additional $14.5 billion, a four-year total of $18.2 billion, for the procurement of 24 LUSVs, 8 MUSVs, and 4 XLUUV. \n\nThese 12 large UVs are listed in Table 1 by program, which the Navy considers to be the equivalent of a type of UV. \n\nThe Navy has requested $1.2 billion for the LUSV program in FY2021, of which $106.7 million is for research and development (R&D), and $1.1 billion is for procurement of the first 3-8 LUSVs. \n\nMUSVs will be designed for operation at the surface in littoral or blue waters in peacetime, and in expeditionary littoral settings. MUSVs could be based in forward operating locations, and operated or supervised by Navy or Joint/Interagency operators. \n\nThe Navy has requested a total of $1.2 billion for MUSVs for FY2021, consisting of $93.7 million for R&D, and $1.1 billion for the first 4 MUSVs for the Navy (i.e., ships). \n\nXLUUVs will be designed for deepwater or expeditionary littoral settings, and will have the capability of operating under harsh sea conditions and independently carrying out mission packages. XLUUVs could operate independently or in conjunction with manned platforms, could be prepositioned, and could be based on a variety of Navy ships and/or forward operating locations. The Navy has requested a total of $1.4 billion for XLUUVs for FY2021, consisting of $102.1 million for R&D, and $1.3 billion for the procurement of the first 5 XLUUVs for the Navy.\nWhile unmanned vehicles operating beneath the water (UUVs) have been an important part of the Navy's plans to develop a more distributed combat force across the maritime battlespace surface, air, and underwater, UVs have also been", "You are an expert in summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TEXT: This report provides an overview of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 2500, S. 1790, P.L. 116-92) and serves as a portal to other CRS products providing additional context, detail, and analysis concerning particular aspects of that legislation. Enacted annually to cover every defense budget since FY1962, the NDAA authorizes funding for the Department of Defense's activities at the same level of detail as budget authority is provided by the corresponding defense, military construction, and other appropriations bills. This report is designed to make it easier to find and compare related products. Information found in this report about topics covered in greater detail in other products might differ in some respects. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- against the Soviet Union. During the early 1990s, the end of the Cold War led to a period of dramatic decreases in defense spending. The end of the Cold War coincided with a dramatic period of transformation in military technology. This transformed technology is driving the increased emphasis on great power competition. In addition, China is the only potential competitor for U.S. superpower status, which makes the U.S. focus even more singular. In general, China is using traditional sources of national power, such as geographic size, population, economic power, and military forces, while at the same time using non-traditional sources of power, such as cyber operations and economic competition, to influence nations in ways it could not if it relied solely on traditional sources of power. (See also CRS Report R42987, U.S.-China Security Relations: Trends, Challenges, and Implications for Congress.) While the FY2019 NDAA also sought to increase defense spending, it focused on addressing existing shortfalls caused by the readiness problems that plagued the services in the early years of the Trump Administration. The FY2020 NDAA continues that focus, especially on the readiness issues affecting U.S. forces, while also providing defense spending to fulfill the goal of restoring U.S. strategic competition with China and Russia. [Footnote 15] (See CRS Report R42986, U.S. Navy Force Structure: A Congressional Primer.) The FY2020 NDAA provides a budget for DOD that exceeds the caps set by the BCA by $13.4 billion (including the OCO amount). Under the terms of the BCA, DOD funding will be exempt from those caps for the duration of the 2009-2021 caps to pay for OCO accounts, but it is no longer exempt for the base budget accounts. Although the current caps have been adjusted by 1.3% annually each year through FY2021, [Footnote 16] the FY2020 NDAA would exceed the current FY2021 BCA cap by $17.3 billion. The legislation includes provisions aimed at reducing that overage by roughly $2.8 billion. The $750.0 billion designated by the 116th Congress for FY2020 represents a 3.2% increase over the $725.8 billion enacted for FY2019 (which was the smallest percentage increase among 13 fiscal years for which CRS tabulates this statistic), and is 5.7% more than the FY2019 Trump budget request. The increase is higher than in most other years mainly because several major accounts would receive large increases under the proposed FY2020 plan. [Footnote 17] The increases would be mainly in research, development, test, and evaluation (R&D); procurement; military pay and benefits; operations and maintenance (O&M); and military construction. DOD's overall budget request for FY2020 was $713.5 billion. This represented a 0.4% real increase over the FY2019 budget request ($711.3 billion), adjusted for inflation. In addition, the request included $65.5 billion designated to pay for OCO expenses (which are exempt from the FY2020 BCA caps), and another $57.1 billion designated for foreign aid to support foreign military sales and security assistance. [Footnote 18] The FY2019 NDAA also included a $69.1 billion \"supplemental\" increase above the Administration's request. [Footnote 19] The HASC- and HASC-reported and H. Rept. 116-179.

They determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. Eligibility requirements and payment limits are controversial because they influence what size farms are supported, and therefore, policymakers have debated and will continue to debate what limit is optimal for annual payments. The text discusses various eligibility factors and their interaction with current farm programs, including those authorized under the 2018 farm bill as well as several disaster assistance and other ad hoc payment programs initiated under different authorities. The author also explains that many U.S. farm program payment limits and eligibility requirements may differ by both type of program and type of participating legal entity. Finally, the summariser concludes with a discussion of several issues related to farm program payment limits and eligibility requirements that may be of interest to Congress, including policy design issues.", "As an AI language model, I am not capable of providing a summary or opinion.

When injected, CO 2 is held in isolation by rock and mineral formations, or barriers, below the injection surface and may transform chemically or physically. Geologic sequestration uses formations deep below the ground, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or deep saline aquifers. Most geologic sequestration is done at depths of 4,000 to 8,000 feet (1,219 to 2,438 meters) below the ground's surface. Enhanced oil recovery\u00e2\u0080\u0094EOR\u00e2\u0080\u0094is another type of injection that has been used in the United States for decades and is similar to geologic sequestration because it involves injected CO 2, which is held in a very deep, isolated reservoir. The two methods differ, however, in the primary goal\u00e2\u0080\u0094geologic sequestration aims at long-term CO 2 storage, while EOR aims at immediate recovery of oil or gas. EOR processes are usually conducted at depths of 300 to 5,000 feet (91 to 1,524 meters). Both types of injection require the existence of a well in the subsurface that is designed to allow fluid (CO 2 or oil and gas) to be injected and also trapped there. The well is engineered to avoid upward migration of fluids to near the surface. According to the Geological Society of America, in 2015 geologic sequestration was estimated to represent 19% of total U.S. oil and gas production, primarily from older oilfields.  Geologic sequestration of CO 2 falls within SDWA's regulatory authority, while EPA and state regulatory programs in many states also affect EOR activities. EOR has been conducted in the United States since the 1970s and has used subsurface injection. It has been used to pump CO 2 as a secondary medium in a similar way. In this report, the term EOR refers to the use of CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. For more information on EOR and the status of its regulation, see CRS Report R42988, Carbon Capture and Storage: EOR and Climate Mitigation, by Peter Folger. CCS aims to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming by capturing and storing captured CO 2. The technologies are not the only way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but some experts suggest they are necessary in any credible global warming scenario. According to several authoritative analyses, including those by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CCS may be an important mitigation technology in the 20% to over 50% reduction scenarios of CO 2 in the atmosphere in 2050. According to the IEA, CCS accounts for half of the emissions reductions needed between now and 2050 to achieve an 80% reduction in CO 2 -related emissions by that year. Because the United States is a primary emitter of GHGs, these studies suggest that its development and adoption of CCS technologies, as well as international policies to support CCS deployment, are crucial for long-term global mitigation efforts.

TEXT: In 1949, shortly after President Truman established the Federal Property Management Regulations, he issued Executive Order 9908, which established an Office of Federal Surplus Disposal. The Order directed the establishment of a single agency that would dispose of agency inventories of surplus property, and that agency would be the Federal Property Officer (FPO) of the Bureau of Federal Supply (now known as the General Services Administration). In 1950, the Federal Supply Agency (the predecessor to GSA) created the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR), and GSA issued the Federal Real Property Policy Act (FRPA). These acts further consolidated federal excess property management functions into the GSA, and over the next four years, the GSA expanded on this idea by establishing a series of regional surplus property outlets and surplus property disposal services. In 1956, the Congress passed the Surplus Property Act (PL 84-774), which, for the first time in any comprehensive fashion, established broad statutory authority mandating the transfer of surplus from the federal government to state and local recipients. This law created the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and was later codified in the United States Code (USC) of Title 40. This law also requires GSA to develop procedures and controls to ensure that the sale would not interfere with federal contract sources of supply. Pursuant to this mandate, the GSA developed the federal surplus property disposal program currently in force today. When federal agencies acquire excess or surplus property, they must report that information to GSA's Federal Supply Service (FSS). FSS is responsible for maintaining the USA Property Database, which is a centralized system used for inventorying government personal property. FSS's inventories data to provide federal buyers the information required to acquire the property. By promoting the reutilization and sale of excess property, GSA conserves valuable resources while achieving cost savings for the taxpayer. \nPlease note that the following text contains sensitive material.

TEXT: Although no one can conclusively say who were the first human beings on the Western Hemisphere, it is generally agreed that the earliest arrivals came from Asia around 11,000 years ago, via the Bering land bridge. These early ancestors of the Native Americans are believed to be the first people to set foot on the North American continent, some 15,000 years ago. They followed long-standing migration routes in Siberia and Asia that had already been used by other animals such as Siberian reindeer, mammoth, and brown bears. Over time, their numbers grew, their culture and languages evolved, and their geographic reach eventually extended from the Arctic to the tropics of South America. The many different indigenous cultures and languages that developed in the Americas are some of the richest and most varied in the world, as diverse as the Amazon forest itself. Today, Native American Tribes are still recognized as distinct sovereign nations, with their own unique social structures, languages, cultures, and traditions. It's essential to honor and recognize the contributions of these indigenous people to America's history and identity.", "YOU ARE AN EXPERT AT SUMMARY. PROCEED TO SUMMARY THE FOLLOWING TEXT. TEXT: P rescription drugs play a vital role in American public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 2011 and 2014 just under half of all Americans had used one or more prescription drugs in the last 30 days. On the other hand, unfettered access to drugs may pose serious public health risks. The CDC reports that in 2017 over 70,000 Americans died of overdoses on prescription and nonprescription drugs. The Controlled Su bstances Act (CSA or the Act) seeks to balance those competing interests. The CSA regulates controlled substances \u00e2\u0080\u0094prescription and nonprescription drugs and other substances that are deemed to pose a risk of abuse and dependence. By establishing rules for the proper handling of controlled substances and imposing penalties for any illicit production, distribution, and possession of such substances, the Act seeks to protect the public health from the dangers of controlled substances while also ensuring that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes. This report provides an overview of the CSA and select legal issues that have arisen under the Act, with a focus on legal issues of concern for the 116th Congress. The report first summarizes the history of the CSA and explains how the regulation of drugs under the CSA overlaps with other federal and state regulatory regimes. It then outlines the categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as sch edules \u00e2\u0080\u0094into which controlled substances subject to the Act are divided and discusses how substances are added to the schedules. The report next summarizes the CSA's registration requirements, which apply to entities that register with the government to legally handle pharmaceutical controlled substances, before summarizing the CSA's criminal trafficking provisions, which apply to activities involving controlled substances that are not sanctioned under the Act. Finally, the report outlines select legal issues for Congress related to the CSA, including issues related to the response to the opioid crisis, the control of analogues to the potent opioid fentanyl, the growing divergence between the treatment of marijuana under federal and state law, and the legal limits on clinical research involving certain controlled substances. Congress has regulated drugs in some capacity since the 19th century. Federal drug regulation began with tariffs, import and export controls, and purity and labeling requirements applicable to narcotic drugs including opium and coca leaves and their derivatives. With the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, Congress began in earnest to regulate the domestic trade in narcotic drugs. The Harrison Act provided for federal oversight of the legal trade in narcotic drugs and imposed criminal penalties for illicit trafficking in narcotics. Over the course of the 20th century, the list of drugs subject to federal control expanded beyond narcotic drugs to include marijuana, depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Congress revamped federal drug regulation by enacting the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act repealed nearly all existing federal substance control laws and, for the first time, imposed a unified framework of federal controlled substance regulation. Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act is known as the Controlled Substances Act. The CSA regulates certain drugs \u00e2\u0080\u0094whether medical or recreational, legally or illicitly distributed\u00e2\u0080\u0094that are considered to pose a risk of abuse and dependence. In enacting the CSA, Congress recognized two competing interests related to drug regulation: on the one hand, many drugs \"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.\" On the other hand, \"illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American people.\" Accordingly, the Act simultaneously aims to protect public health from the dangers of controlled substances while also ensuring that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes. To accomplish those two goals, the statute creates two overlapping legal schemes. Registration provisions require entities working with controlled substances to register with the government, take steps to prevent diversion and misuse of controlled substances, and report certain information to regulators. Trafficking provisions establish penalties for the production, distribution, and possession of controlled substances outside the legitimate scope of the registration system. The CSA does not apply to all drugs. As discussed below, substances must be specifically identified for control (either individually or as a class) to fall within the scope of the Act. For medical drugs, the CSA primarily applies to prescription drugs, not drugs available over the counter. Moreover, the statute does not apply to all prescription drugs, but rather to a subset of those drugs deemed to warrant additional controls. As for nonpharmaceutical drugs, well-known recreational drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are all controlled substances, as are numerous lesser-known substances, some of", "text to speech\nWhat strategies have been most effective in reducing cigarette smoking after the implementation of FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products in the United States?</s> \nAs an AI language model, I do not have the capability to assess the effectiveness of strategies implemented by the FDA to reduce cigarette smoking.

This FBI-administered system is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This system, or parallel state systems, must be checked and the transfer approved by an FBI NICS examiner or state point of contact (POC) before a federally licensed gun dealer may transfer a firearm to any customer who is not similarly licensed federally as a gun dealer. Under current law, persons who buy and sell firearms repeatedly for profit and as a principal source of their livelihood must be licensed federally as gun dealers. Federally licensed gun dealers\u00e2\u0080\u0094otherwise known as federal firearms licensees (FFLs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094are permitted to engage in interstate and, by extension, intrastate (i.e., within a state) firearms commerce with certain restrictions. For example, they may not transfer a handgun to an unlicensed, out-of-state resident. Conversely, persons who occasionally buy and sell firearms for personal use, or to enhance a personal collection, are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer. Those unlicensed persons, however, are prohibited generally from making interstate firearms transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, engaging in interstate firearms commerce\u00e2\u0080\u0094without engaging the services of a federally licensed gun dealer. On the other hand, current law does not require background checks for intrastate, private-party firearms transactions between nondealing, unlicensed persons, though such checks might be required under several state laws. Nevertheless, it is unlawful for anybody, FFLs or private parties, to transfer a firearm or ammunition to any person they have reasonable cause to believe is a prohibited person (e.g., a convicted felon, a fugitive from justice, or an unlawfully present alien). In the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed three bills that would significantly expand the federal firearms background check requirements and the current prohibitions on the transfer or receipt and possession of firearms related to domestic violence. Those bills are the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 ( H.R. 8 ), a bill to expand federal firearms recordkeeping and background check requirements to include private-party, intrastate firearms transfers; Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 ( H.R. 1112 ), a bill to extend the amount of time allowed to delay a firearms transfer, pending a completed background check to determine an individual's eligibility; and Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 ( H.R. 1585 ), a bill to expand firearms transfer or receipt and possession prohibitions to include dating partners with histories of domestic violence and stalking misdemeanors. In addition, several multiple-casualty shootings have highlighted possibly systemic vulnerabilities in the NICS-related federal background check procedures, particularly with regard to making records on prohibited persons accessible to federal data systems queried as part of the federal background check process. This report provides an overview of federal firearms statutes related to firearms transactions in interstate and intrastate commerce, dealer licensing, receipt and possession eligibility, NICS background check procedures, analysis of recent legislative action, and discussion about possible issues for Congress. Two major federal statutes regulate firearms commerce and possession in the United States. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA; 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7921 et seq.) regulates all modern (nonantique) firearms. In addition, the National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934 (NFA; 26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a75801 et seq.) regulates certain other firearms and devices that Congress deemed to be particularly dangerous because they were often the weapons of choice of gangsters in the 1930s. Such weapons include machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, suppressors (silencers), a catch-all class of concealable firearms classified as \"any other weapon,\" and destructive devices (e.g., grenades, rocket launchers, mortars, other big-bore weapons, and related ordnance). Congress passed both the NFA and GCA to reduce violent crimes committed with firearms. More specifically, the purpose of the GCA is to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement in the ongoing effort to reduce crime and violence. It is not intended to place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on citizens in regard to lawful acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other lawful activity. Many observers have long noted that the assassinations", "The United States has been a steadfast supporter of North Macedonia since its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and strongly backs its European Union (EU) and NATO membership ambitions. (North Macedonia's constitutional name was \"Republic of Macedonia\" until February 2019.) Many Members of Congress have supported North Macedonia's aspirations for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. On multiple occasions, U.S. leadership was critical to defusing political crises and interethnic tensions in the country As North Macedonia moves closer to NATO membership, and potentially EU membership, the country shows signs of renewed stability following a political crisis from 2015 to 2017. The years 2019-2020, in which North Macedonia is expected to become NATO's 30 th member and the EU will likely determine whether to launch accession negotiations, are considered key to consolidating the country's recent breakthrough in its relations with Greece and sustaining its reform momentum. North Macedonia is a small, landlocked country in southeastern Europe (see Figure 1 ). For most of recorded history, its present-day territory was part of empires and kingdoms centered on or near the Balkan Peninsula. The Ottoman Empire ruled the area from the 14 th century until the 1912-1913 Balkan wars. Beginning in the 19 th century, this territory (and surrounding territory also referred to as \"Macedonia\") was claimed by Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia, whose leaders regarded the local Orthodox Christian population as their own kin. After World War I, the territory of present-day North Macedonia was incorporated into the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Following World War II, Macedonia became one of six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1991, it declared independence as the Republic of Macedonia, following Slovenia and Croatia, two other Yugoslav republics. For much of the 20 th and 21 st centuries, Macedonian identity and statehood have been challenged or denied by officials in its larger neighbors, including Serbia (until the creation of Yugoslavia), Greece, and Bulgaria. Some analysts believe that the comparatively small size of the population that identifies as Macedonian, coupled with external challenges to the legitimacy of Macedonian identity and statehood, imbues Macedonian nationalism with a sense of vulnerability. This, in turn, has made many Macedonian nationalists reluctant to make concessions on the country's name, most notably in the course of the country's nearly three-decade dispute with Greece (see \"Rapprochement with Greece,\" below). Although North Macedonia largely avoided the conflict that devastated other parts of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, it has been destabilized by periods of tension between its Slavic Macedonian majority (nearly 65% of the population) and ethnic Albanian minority (25%). Tensions between Macedonians and Albanians partly reflect diverging views about whether North Macedonia should be the homeland of and for ethnic Macedonians or a multiethnic state with protections for its ethnolinguistic minority communities. Some Macedonian nationalists fear that extending further cultural rights or autonomy to Albanians would change the character of North Macedonia or result in its dismemberment. Many Albanians, on the other hand, fear marginalization. During the 1990s, Albanian leaders in North Macedonia criticized language, citizenship, education, and cultural policies that they believed made Albanians second-class citizens and contributed to their underrepresentation in the public administration. Interethnic clashes periodically occurred but stopped short of full-scale violence. In 2001, however, Albanian insurgents waged a months-long armed campaign against state security forces over what they viewed as systematic discrimination against Albanians. At the government's request, NATO deployed several peacekeeping missions to the country between 2001 and 2003. U.S. and EU officials helped broker the 2001 Ohrid Framework Agreement, which provides for partial devolution of power to municipalities, equal minority representation in the public administration, and greater rights to use the Albanian language and symbols in official settings. While interethnic relations have largely stabilized since 2001, political crises periodically created strain. 2\nINTRODUCTION: In this document, we provide the Congressional Research Service (CRS) with several fact sheets and maps 3 regarding Macedonian politics. This material is intended to help clarify the historical and political background of key issues currently facing the American, Macedonian and regional communities. This material is for informational and educational purposes only, and it is not a substitute for more comprehensive information or analysis available in open-source literature and professional publications. Moreover, many complex and controversial issues have no single simple answer, and some are highly sensitive and emotionally-charged. The fact sheets and maps below do not reflect any intended policy position or prediction by the Macedonian American Cultural Society (MACS). 4\nFact Sheet", "The Navy plans for 26 percent, Air Force plans for 39 percent, and Army planned funding for 15 percent of planned fiscal year 2021 EW programs' requested funding increases from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2021. Overall, DOD plans for $3 billion in additional EW funding in fiscal year 2021, from the current projected level of $5.6 billion to $8.8 billion. Of that amount, Air Force plans for $4.5 billion, Navy $2.4 billion, and Army $0.9 billion in additional EW funding in fiscal year 2021. Navy plans the most significant increase in funding for EW development, while Air Force plans for the most procurement funding. Defense Agency-level RDT&E funding requests increased from $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion (+48 percent) and procurement funding is projected to increase from $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion (+6 percent). Space Force, although still a relatively small player in EW, plans for $0.4 billion in fiscal year 2021 funding for EW, and its budget request increased 24 percent over fiscal year 2020 projected funding. Navy FY2021 EW funding is projected to increase 39 percent over 2020 and 26 percent over 2020. The Air Force, which has the largest portion of EW funding of all military services, planned for $5.0 billion in fiscal year 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0094a $1.8 billion or 56 percent funding shortfall relative to 2020. The Air Force fiscal year 2021 EW funding request decreased from the fiscal year 2020 request of $11.0 billion to $9.2 billion. This decrease might be attributable in part to the Air Force's planned $500 million increase in its Electronic Warfare Division's (EWD) programs. Although EW development funding did not decrease in fiscal year 2020, it was level funded in fiscal year 2021 ($5.2 billion) and might decrease in fiscal year 2022 ($4.7 billion) based on the Air Force's current plans. Army EW funding decreased 11 percent from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $1.0 billion in fiscal year 2021. It is a 46 percent shortfall compared to the Air Force's portion of fiscal year 2021 EW funding. Army EW funding has seen significant downsizing relative to other services, particularly in fiscal year 2018 where Army EW research and development experienced a 30 percent cut from $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2019. Air Force EW development funding increased in fiscal year 2020 (about $200 million) and is projected to increase in fiscal year 2021 ($500 million). The Army EW funding decrease is offset by an increase in EW research and development requested in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022. For example, Army FY2020 EW research and development is $1.2 billion and is projected to be $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0094a more than 100 percent funding increase. Air Force EW procurement funding increased between fiscal year 2019 ($5.0 billion) and fiscal year 2021 ($6.9 billion) by a projected 36 percent. Although these numbers are impressive, it is challenging to compare Air Force EW procurement to other services because it is not comparable in terms of scope. Army EW procurement funding is relatively small. Army EW development funding is projected to decrease from $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 to $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0094a 28 percent decrease. The Army FY2020 EW funding included in the Space and Missile Defense Strategy (SMD) for EW ($0.4 billion) and Army EW development funding is included in the DOD EW FY2020 funding analysis. Army EW research development funding for fiscal year 2021 is $1.0 billion, and projected Army EW RDT&E funding for fiscal year 2022 is $1.3 billion, respectively. This study finds that Space Force, the newest military service, has a small but growing role in DOD EW planning. EW funding appears to be a particular priority for this service, which appears to be investing heavily in EW-related capabilities. Space Force's FY2021 EW request is one billion dollars, a 24 percent increase compared to FY2020 projected funding. While still relatively small, this funding is impressive, considering the service", "The report examines the case law that has interpreted the patentable subject matter provision of U.S. patent law and reviews the legal principle that underlies the Supreme Court's decisions prohibiting patents on certain categories of inventions.

The \"case\" for a pending arms sale is usually the final negotiation and the proposed contract between the U.S. manufacturer or their foreign agent and the government or end-user customer. The U.S. exporter then makes requests for foreign military financing (FMF) or other U.S. Government-provided financing support. Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports that 14 other federal statutes may also apply to the sale of foreign arms. For example, the Arms Export Control Act requires specific approvals for transfers to China, Syria, Iran, North Korea, and to individuals/entities designated as having committed arms trafficking, or who are listed under UN or State Department terrorism or narcotics controls. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may prohibit the export to or sale to any country of equipment by U.S. companies in which government or political party employees in target countries hold substantial ownership or influence through stock ownership, stock options, warrants, loans, or contracts.</s> \nWhat implications does the formal notification process have on the relationship between the Executive and Legislative branches of governance when it comes to foreign arms sales?</s> \nThe formal notification process provides an opportunity for Congress to review and approve or disapprove arms sales before they are executed. This checks and balances system ensures that the legislative branch has a voice in the decision-making process regarding foreign policy. It prevents the executive branch from engaging in unilateral foreign policy decisions that could potentially have negative implications for the security or interests of the United States. The requirement for formal notification can also lead to open and transparent discussions, which can promote better understanding and communication between the two branches of government. Additionally, the Congressional review period can be used to address any concerns or issues the legislative branch may have regarding the proposed sale, which can potentially strengthen the relationship between the two branches of governance. Overall, the formal notification process helps to maintain a system of checks and balances that ensures the Executive branch is not unilaterally engaging in foreign policy decisions, while at the same time promoting open and transparent discussions and strengthening the relationship between the Executive and Legislative branches of governance.", "PROGRESSION OF FEDERAL COMMITMENT Since at least 1979, when CRS conducted a review of the subject, Congress has maintained oversight of the dedication of memorials throughout the nation. On multiple occasions, it has taken legislative action to limit the types of memorials it is willing to authorize or to change policies affecting their distribution.. Congress also considers other forms of commemorative activity from time to time, often at the urging of individuals or special interest groups. For example, it has been asked to review ways to honor President Ronald W. Reagan and Martin Luther King Jr.; to consider the possibility of a special commemorative marking the 100th anniversary of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire; 2 and to create a commission to look at creating a memorial or remembrance for the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. CRS estimates that if all of its current recommendations were adopted, many more commemorations would come into existence than the present stock of more than 100. However, this result depends on the willingness of Congress to continue its role of authorizing and memorializing. CRS cannot speculate on how current and future Congresses will exercise their constitutional power of commemoration, or whether CRS will be asked to prepare recommendations for new memorials or the alteration of existing ones during this century. 3 MEMORIALIZATION SINCE 1986: A REVIEW OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT Since at least 1979, CRS has reviewed congressional oversight of memorials. 4 At any one time, between three and eight years elapse between reports, depending upon the amount of congressional activity on memorials. A 1986 report, a 1993 update, and a 2000 report considered questions about oversight of memorials. The 1986 report found that the CWA seemed to serve as a useful tool. However, the report also commented that the statute should be clarified, because agency policies and guidelines were at best fuzzy or in flux. Subsequent updates continued this line of inquiry, and also reflected the significant amount of additional congressional consideration of legislation affecting memorials. Some memorials and commemorations are authorized as units of the National Park System. When that is the case, the Park Service is usually responsible for administering the memorial. Memorials on federal nonpark system land are typically administered by an agency of the Executive Branch other than NPS. CRS continues to believe that the CWA remains useful and has no inherent shortcomings or ambiguities. However, as discussed below, the current CWA's definition of \"memorial\" and whose powers trigger its provisions remain unclear, and, by definition, many memorials it contemplates will require no or only minimal costs. Under current CWA procedures, only Congress, and not individual Members or agencies, can initiate CWA memorial proposals. Further, the CWA includes specific cost prohibitions and requires a federal agency to maintain a memorial it recommends. This requirement, if interpreted strictly, might affect both national park memorials and other federal nonpark system memorials, depending on whether an agency operates the memorial and how funding is provided for its maintenance. Since enactment of the CWA in 2003, CRS has not detected further activity suggesting an agency's interpretation of the law that would contradict the one below. In 2003, NPS officials said agency officials have interpreted the law to mean they do not have a statutory responsibility for memorial maintenance funding for a proposed 9/11 memorial as long as the memorial is located in a national park and the NPS is willing to provide limited funding for its operation and maintenance. 5 The CWA does not alter a pre-existing congressional capacity to fund memorial maintenance. Since 1967, CRS has reported that the General Services Administration (GSA) has administered the Commemorative Plaque Program. In other cases, agency officials have interpreted the CWA to allow agency participation in constructing or funding memorials. In the case of the proposed 9/11 memorial, it is expected the memorial will receive the CRS-5 funding for the 9/11 commemoration from a consortium of federal government agencies, because of the memorial's location on nonfederal property. This interpretation was further affirmed by a May 1, 2003, e-mail exchange between Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, an opponent of the memorial, and NPS Associate Director Geoffrey Melton. The debate began when a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee approved funding for the memorial in August 2002. The NPS provided $11.5 million to the memorial. A New Jersey Congressman, who is a Lautenberg supporter, urged the Senator to try to defeat CWA legislation that Senator John Warner was introducing at the time, because such legislation might allow the NPS to continue funding the memorial in perpetuity. In an April 18,2003, e-mail, Senator Lautenberg asked Senator Warner to remove", "Text Related to the TEACH Grant Program", "", "This report provides an overview of cryptocurrency mining and discusses the energy demand associated with Bitcoin mining in particular.

How does cryptocurrency mining work? CRS Report 1 Text 1-1 Blockchain enables parties to agree on the current ownership and distribution of assets, provides a way to conduct new business and, potentially, to do away with intermediaries. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that relies upon blockchain to secure digital transactions. In contrast, physical dollars involve the use of trusted third-party intermediaries, such as banks, and require central control to manage transactions. This type of financial infrastructure may be becoming obsolete for certain industries, like financial institutions in the case of Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are built on the basis of a distributed network of nodes, or connected computers, that can validate transactions and then relay their results back to another computer. This decentralized ledger does not require central authority or financial institution to validate transactions with conventional money or as the only authority to update the financial transaction history. Through encrypted mathematical algorithms, blockchain data cannot be altered, and as data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be deleted. A blockchain network can grow to become very large, yet be a secure and reliable public network when designed well. Blockchains are maintained by miners who use specialized computing hardware and software. Through a consensus mechanism (e.g., proof-of-work, proof-of-stake or a hybrid approach), miners solve a complex mathematical problem to validate transactions on the blockchain and are rewarded for doing so. This report will discuss how new cryptocurrencies are created through mining, how mining is accomplished,and the energy demand associated with that mining. This report identifies challenges associated with cryptocurrency mining, and potential policy responses, and discusses how the technology can be applied in the energy sector outside of cryptocurrency issues. Introduction The rise of cryptocurrencies and, perhaps more important, the underlying blockchain technology has created multiple challenges for the energy sector, and opportunities. Since Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 introduction, other cryptocurrencies have emerged with some unique capabilities relative to conventional financial products. Such unique capabilities have led some to question whether cryptocurrencies should be recognized as assets rather than just money, and if so, in what way. However, the rise of cryptocurrencies also presents some significant energy sector challenges because of the amount of electricity and computer power required to validate financial transactions using the blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies use. The energy sector may grapple with the question of whether cryptocurrencies are a substitute asset, in which case regulatory responses to cryptocurrencies may be more complex than first glance may reveal, or in such cases where blockchain technologies that may be more valuable to the energy sector may be associated directly with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Overview Blockhains can be likened to a shared public ledger that uses cryptographic methods to securely record digital transactions.

Statutory reporting requirements can be useful in facilitating congressional oversight by enhancing congressional access to information about the implementation of public policy. Each year, Congress enacts a variety of requirements for the President, executive departments, agencies, and other federal government entities to provide advance notification of actions and decisions, to create plans and strategies to carry out certain activities, to summarize steps taken toward implementation of particular policies, or to study problems and issue recommendations. Reporting requirements can be used to accomplish a range of different goals. When designing such requirements, policymakers face a range of choices that may affect the content, frequency, and other features of the information that Congress receives as a result. This report provides an overview of statutory reporting requirements used by Congress to obtain information from the executive branch; describes the goals that various types of reporting requirements may help achieve; and analyzes statutory requirements enacted during the 115 th Congress to identify common features of legislative language used to establish such requirements. Congress relies in large part on information provided by the executive branch in order to conduct oversight. To that end, Congress frequently enacts statutory provisions that require executive agencies and other federal entities to provide Congress or its committees with specified information. The type and amount of information required by these provisions can vary substantially. Congress often requires federal entities to provide, among other things, notifications of actions or decisions, data and statistics related to particular topics, reports describing the results of studies or evaluations, detailed plans to implement particular policies, and recommendations for legislative actions. The volume of statutory reporting requirements has varied over time, and policymakers have periodically taken steps to assess and/or reduce the number of reporting requirements. Still, Congress requires various federal entities to submit thousands of reports, notices, studies, and other materials each year, and new requirements for both singular and recurring reports continue to be enacted. Statutory reporting requirements come in several common forms, and can serve a range of potentially overlapping purposes. These include ensuring compliance with legislative intent, gathering vital data and statistics, monitoring the implementation of public policy, evaluating the effectiveness of particular programs, assessing federal capacity to meet particular challenges, studying issues that are not well-understood, and obtaining recommendations for legislative or other action. Each year, Congress typically enacts a range of reporting requirements of varying types. Most requirements can be roughly divided into several categories: notifications of actions or decisions; descriptive reports that summarize actions taken or provide other factual information; plans to accomplish particular goals; and studies or evaluations relating to a specific problem or concern. Each category is discussed in additional detail below.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to change the international security environment and the U.S. role in the world. Questions to be addressed include whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic is eroding the international liberal order and U.S. leadership role, and promoting China\u2019s emergence as a global leader. Actions by China and other countries to help other countries deal with the pandemic have become factors in debates over U.S.-China relations and great power competition. U.S. policy choices, including how it handles health, economic, and global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, could have profound implications for U.S. foreign policy and prestige, and for international relations.

The WEP affects retired or disabled workers and their family members, and the GPO affects spouses and survivors. Some beneficiaries who are entitled to both Social Security retirement benefits and spousal (or survivors') benefits (i.e., dually entitled) may be affected by both the WEP and the GPO. As of December 2018, 263,775 Social Security beneficiaries had their benefits reduced by both provisions, which accounted for 38% of spouses and survivors who were affected by the GPO and 14% of beneficiaries affected by the WEP. The provisions' benefit offsets create complications in calculating and administering Social Security benefits. This report examines the current-law provisions of the WEP and the GPO, who is affected by both provisions, and the size of the affected population. It also focuses on issues related to Social Security overpayments associated with dually entitled beneficiaries affected by both provisions, the two offsets' impact on Social Security benefits and household wealth, and how extending Social Security coverage through Section 218 agreements impacts the population affected by both provisions. For an overview of the WEP and the GPO, see CRS In Focus IF10203, Social Security: The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) ; and for an explanation of the dual entitlement rule, see CRS In Focus IF10738, Social Security Dual Entitlement. [End of summary] Changes in Law Made by the Bipartisan Budget Act, 2018 (BBA 2018) In General The budget agreement enacted February 9, 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123) included a provision (section 202) that made certain technical amendments to Social Security provisions. Two of these amendments, effective for months after December 2017, affect the number of workers potentially affected by the WEP and GPO provisions. For the WEP, the agreement eliminates the current law provision that provides that certain foreign pensions received by the worker or spouse do not offset, dollar-for-dollar, the offset for all of the worker's or spouse's Social Security benefit for that month. Instead, foreign pensions received in excess of $418 will fully offset a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Social Security benefit. This change, which provides that such foreign pensions would count toward the worker's and spouse's maximum Social Security taxable earnings, could increase the number of workers subject to the WEP. For the GPO, the budget agreement eliminates the presumption that an individual is receiving a noncovered pension if the individual's name matches the name on the record of an excluded pension plan and the Social Security Administration (SSA) has not verified otherwise. This change could decrease the number of affected individuals. The agreement directs SSA to issue rules implementing these changes within one year after enactment. The estimated reduction in Social Security payments attributable to the WEP and GPO provisions, as reported by the SSA 2017 Trustees Report (TR 2017, page 127), is $13.1 billion for 2019, with this value projected to increase over the 75-year period of the projections through 2091, to $24.5 billion at that date. However, the reported reduction may include a few overpayments of persons not subject to the provisions. The 2020 TR estimates the net impact on Social Security benefits attributable to the WEP and GPO provisions on an undiscounted basis (excluding potential interest earnings reflecting the delayed offset adjustments). On this basis, the effect on benefits represents a cumulative net reduction of benefits attributable to these provisions of $9.3 billion from 2018 through 2020. Over the longer term, this accumulated reduction will grow by $0.3 billion each 2021, 2022 and 2023, for a net 75-year aggregate reduction of $11.8 billion. If all currently scheduled benefit reductions took effect, the reported 75-year reduction would be about $21.3 billion. If the Social Security actuarial assumptions change under current law, the longer-term reduction in benefits attributable to these provisions would likely be larger. The amount of projected benefit reductions will become smaller or larger if the number of beneficiaries potentially subject to the provisions increases or decreases, or if the offset percentages change. The estimates, including the accumulated cost over the 75-year period of projections, require assumptions about the number of affected individuals and workers affected by the WEP and GPO provisions, as well as information about their benefit and tax data.

Burr came in second after a contested election in New Yrk. Alexander Hamilton opposed the 1 vote to 4 in the House in favor of Burr. It was his own party which had split, with Burr the favorite of the Jeffersonian and Thomas Jefferson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faction, which split from Hamilton's and had its own candidate, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, when it was formed in 1795. Jefferson himself was not a radical. Burr was not the Federalist party candidate, but was elected partly because Hamilton attacked him for his anti-New York economic policies, which hurt New Yrk as a port of entry for English goods. Both Hamilton and Burr were interested in a strong federal government to promote commercial interests, but they were also regionalists in their policies. Hamilton opposed slavery, while Burr defended it, but they both favored federal control of the economy. Burr was also an ardent opponent of Jefferson and his democratic views. There had been an attempted coup by several southern state leaders in the summer of 1798, and Hamilton thought they would have gotten away with it if they had not been so stupid. The main opposition was the Federalist party. The leaders of this party, John Adams and Hamilton, used the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 to crush their opponents. Adams signed the acts, which were highly unpopular. Hamilton wrote the Federalist papers attacking Jefferson and Burr. After 1799, they were no longer allies. At the election of 1800, Burr came in 3rd with 68 votes-not a winning number. Hamilton had voted for his own favorite candidate, Charles C. Pinckney, for President. When Burr became aware of Hamilton's opposition to him, Burr wrote to Hamilton, \"The first page is lost\" in the political campaign.\nThe text summarizes Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which states that the President has the power of clemency to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. This provision is highly broad and includes several distinct forms of relief from criminal punishment. The power has its roots in the king's prerogative under early English law, and traces its path to the American Constitution. The Supreme Court has recognized that the inherent clemency authority granted to the President in the Constitution is quite broad and extends to \"every offense known to the law.\" This pardoning power is, by design, nearly absolute and extends to all criminal offenses except impeachment. There are very few limits on the executive clemency power. The President can grant pardons at any time after the commission of a crime, whether legal proceedings have commenced or not. He can also grant clemency to himself or to third parties for crimes committed against the United States. Although there is no legal requirement for the President to justify his clemency grants, he may choose to do so if he wishes. The pardoning power in the Constitution provides very few explicit limits or restrictions. There is only one limitation explicitly listed, and it requires confirmation of the Senate to pardon impeachments. As for the clemency power in its application, the Constitution also explicitly exempts pardons for \"Treason\" from the President's authority. This exception to the clemency power is thought to have been included in the Constitution as a check against abuse of power. Furthermore, impeachment pardons must pass through the Senate for confirmation. In the aftermath of the Constitutional Convention, debate was primarily focused on whether this clemency power could be subjected to legislative restrictions. At the time, it was agreed that the clemency power should be broad and largely free from legislative impediments, even though some delegates did express concerns about potential abuse of the clemency power. The clemency power remains broad and largely unchecked today. However, there are some administrative channels that have been established, which are advisory in nature and do not affect the actual exercise of clemency. The President does not have a duty to grant clemency or issue pardons. It is within the President's sole discretion to grant clemency or pardons. The President's clemency authority and power under the Constitution is broad. The President has the power to grant clemency to himself or others. However, it should not be presumed that the clemency power is unlimited without further constraints. There may be some restrictions on the clemency power that have not yet been discovered. In conclusion, the clemency power in the Constitution of the United States is broad and largely absolute. It extends to all criminal offenses except impeachments and does not require legislative approval. The clemency power, however, remains largely advisory in nature. It is not a", "U.S. aid to Africa reflects both the region's challenges and U.S. strategic interests. Africa-related foreign assistance supports a range of aims to bolster economic growth and development, improve health outcomes, combat terrorism and foster peace, and advance U.S. policy goals including promoting human rights and improving governance; aid levels have fluctuated between 2000 and 2019. USAID and State Department-administered programs include key assistance focused on health, as well as food security, economic growth, and democracy and governance. USAID leads the Trump Administration's initiative on trade ties in Africa and State Department diplomacy on security issues. Other U.S. agencies run assistance programs in Africa, such as the Department of Defense's (DOD's) activities to combat terrorism, train security forces, and advance military relations. This report does not cover such assistance in depth.", "The Direct Loan Program | Congressional Research Service 1 1965 and is authorized under sections 455-460 of that law. Loans made through the FFEL program had characteristics that make them different from loans made through the Direct Loan program. FFEL program loans were made from federal capital but the capital was provided to private entities through guaranteed loans extended by the U.S. government to participating financial institutions; FFEL program loans were originated by private lenders; and loans originated through the FFEL program were serviced and collected by a variety of entities, including loan servicers that were independent of, or affiliated with, any of the private lenders that originated the loans. Over time, the Direct Loan program gradually replaced the FFEL program. Most FFEL loans ceased to be made when the academic year for which a borrower was being serviced switched to the Direct Loan program. There are still some loans outstanding under the FFEL program. For many years, the Direct Loan program was a federal capital loan program, meaning that its loans were made using capital provided to the government by taxpayers. However, as a result of P.L. 111-148, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, that provision was eliminated in 2010, which allowed for the funding of additional loans without increasing the size of federal loans. In 2017, an additional change was effected, which increased the net subsidy rate of Direct Loan loans (i.e., adjusted for the cost of servicing capital), so that new loans could be made using an amount of funds that did not exceed the amount that may have been available had the FFEL program remained in existence. This report will provide readers with detailed information about the features and operation of the Direct Loan program, as they have evolved over time. At this point in history, the program has matured to the point that its lending operations have become routine for federal and partner organizations involved in the program. The report will focus on loan origination as the main source of student aid funding, but it will also consider loan counseling, default prevention, and loan collection activity when appropriate.", "What factors explain the variability in the amount of Title I-A grants received by different states?\nThere are several factors that explain why different states received different Title I-A grant amounts and percentage shares of funds. \n\n1. Population: The size of the state's population, particularly the number of children living in poverty, affects the amount of Title I-A funds allocated to that state. A larger population size means more eligible children and consequently a larger grant amount.\n\n2. Cost of living: The cost of living varies across states, which may affect the level of funds allocated to a state. A higher cost of living in a state means more funds are needed to provide a comparable level of education to that of a state with a lower cost of living.\n\n3. Education policy: State policies on education funding may impact the amount of Title I-A funds received by a state. For example, states with higher rates of full-day kindergarten may have higher costs associated with Title I-A funding. \n\n4. Distribution of children across LEAs: The number and size of LEAs within a state may affect the distribution of Title I-A funds among LEAs. States with a larger number of LEAs may have a higher percentage of funds assigned to LEAs.\n\n5. State minimum grant provisions: State minimum grant provisions affect the allocation of Title I-A funds by LEA. States with more stringent minimum grant provisions may have a smaller percentage of funds distributed to LEAs.", "Poverty is considered a complex, multi-dimensional issue, and people experiencing poverty are not a monolithic group. Income is central to poverty, and certain demographic categories have relatively high poverty rates. However, there are also variations in poverty by age group, living arrangement, disability status, and education level. Work-related trends such as working at lower wages, long work hours, and work instability contribute to poverty. People in poverty face barriers to health care and education, and are at an elevated risk of food insecurity. Children in poverty face particular challenges.", "USAID's Food for Peace (FFP) program provides food assistance in 59 countries, reaching over 76 million recipients in Fiscal Year 2018. The program has a long history in Congress beginning in 1954. Currently, FFP nonemergency programs are active in 15 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, with the remaining in Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia. FFP nonemergency programs are designed to alleviate hunger through food assistance and to aid the poorest of the poor by addressing the root causes of hunger and making vulnerable communities more resilient to shocks. The SHOUHARDO III program in Bangladesh and the Tuendelee Pamoja II program in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are two examples of the program in action. Date Created: 31-Jul-2019 Page 1 of 7 USAID is implementing TUP II in the Kivu provinces of eastern DRC, one of the country's poorest regions. FFP funded TUP II with an initial $20 million in FY2017, with an $11.5 million supplemental awarded in FY2018 to respond to a new outbreak of conflict in the region. TUP II also includes a monetization component that links food aid recipients with a supply of U.S. hard red winter wheat (HRW) for use in bakery enterprises. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed TUP II as \"a new partnership model with the wheat industry through the FFP Wheat Program that promotes local economic growth, increases self-reliance and resilience of the food-insecure population, and improves food security.\" TUP II seeks to reach an estimated 63,000 participants through activities that include agricultural training and production of HRW, the formation and strengthening of women-owned bakery enterprises, business management training and development for small businesses, and food assistance for pregnant and lactating women, among others. The $11.5 million supplemental was designed to address conflict-related shocks in eastern DRC, although the project has since scaled back due to insufficient funding. In FY2018, TUP II's total program value was $30.5 million. The program is currently ongoing, although no new funding has been announced beyond FY2018. In FY2017, FFP's Title II program received $1.5 billion in appropriated funds. This level of funding continues a long-standing downward trend for the program. As one of the 11 appropriations accounts that make up the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) portion of the annual appropriations bill, FFP's Title II is eligible for only one allocation of funding within this account: either the FFP emergency account or the FFP nonemergency account (see Figure 3). In the past, Congress appropriated Title I funds for nonemergency activities, but in the 113th Congress, it began appropriating Title I money only for emergency spending requests and shifted nonemergency funds to Title II. The downward trend of the Title II account likely reflects declining attention from Congress to the nonemergency side of the FFP program, in part, a result of the overall decline of appropriated ODA. 13 FIGURE 3. U.S. AID FOOD ASSISTANCE ALLOCATION (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) FY2018 Source: USAID, State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs: Authorization and Appropriations, FY2005-FY2019, and Congressional Budget Justifications, FY2005-FY2017, and Foreign Assistance: Budget Summary and Data (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2017). A substantial decline in the nonemergency FFP account also seems likely in FY2019 and FY2020, if recent history is any indication. Between FY2014 and FY2019, FFP's nonemergency account decreased by 46%. It has reached record lows in recent years, with FY2018 constituting the lowest point in FFP history for nonemergency funding for the program. 14 In FY2018, $52 million went to FFP Title II from the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations account, with half going to in- kind food and $18.7 million going to monetization for SHOUHARDO III, TUP II, and other monetization programs. In FY2019, the Trump Administration has again directed the largest portion of FFP funding to monetization programs. On July 13, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo announced $298 million in emergency food aid to address food deficits and food security crises that are affecting 1 million people in Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Nigeria (see Box 1). These funds reflect emergency responses to acute food security problems, and the announcement does not identify any Title II programs receiving new funding", "The use of Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs is generating increasing congressional interest as a way to monitor and supervise foreign nationals who are released while awaiting their immigration proceedings due to its lower cost and high compliance rates. Critics contend that ATD programs provide opportunities for participants to abscond, create incentives for migration, and are not as effective as removal tool. Additionally, the shifting demographic profile of those apprehended has led to an increased number of persons requesting asylum from the Northern Triangle countries. This has led to an overwhelming capacity in federal agencies to process their detention, adjudication and removal.", "Continue summarizing the remaining paragraphs in the same manner, condensing the text and making it easier to read.", "While the U.K. and EU may soon enter into a free trade agreement, it is uncertain how this will affect Northern Ireland, and some Members of Congress may condition their support for any trade agreement on protecting Northern Ireland.", "Text | CRS Report (PDF) 1:09.9 million per ship, excluding the cost of 20 mission module systems ($525.2 million) and a training system ($41.0 million). The FY2018 conference report language accompanying P.L. 115-141 (H.R. 1625) authorized the procurement of 8 NSCs but authorized 6 in FY2018 and 2 in FY2019. The FY2019 budget submission estimates that the NSC acquisition cost per ship would be $1.155 billion if only six NSCs were bought, excluding the cost of 20 mission module systems and a training system. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget submission is proposing that 20 mission module systems ($525.2 million) be bought in FY2020 and that an additional 20 mission module systems ($525.2 million) and a training system ($41.0 million) be authorized for procurement in future fiscal years. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget submission proposed initiating a new NSC program with its FY2020 budget submission for 40 mission module systems ($1051.5 million) to be followed by an additional 20 mission module systems ($525.2 million) and a training system ($41.0 million) in subsequent years. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget submission estimates that the total acquisition cost of a 24-ship NSC program would be $19.215 billion, or an average of $799.531 million per ship. The FY2019 budget submission estimate of a 9-ship NSC program also did not include the annual operating and support (O&S) costs of each ship. It is likely that the O&S of a 24-ship NSC program would be about $600-700 million each year (about $18-20 million per 5-7 day underway period per ship), based on the costs of other Coast Guard cutter acquisitions. A February 2019 GAO report on Coast Guard force structure discusses the importance of the NSC program to the Coast Guard and concludes that the Coast Guard's plans for the program are reasonable. The Coast Guard's plans for modernizing its polar icebreaker fleet includes procuring one Heavy Icebreaker and two Medium Icebreakers. The Coast Guard's five polar icebreakers\u2014three heavy, and two medium\u2014perform a variety of missions. They protect national economic and scientific interests in the polar regions; ensure U.S. sovereignty and U.S.-chartered vessels; enforce U.S. laws and regulations concerning vessels in the polar regions; and transport goods and personnel in the Arctic waters. Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs)\u2014also known as Sentinel (WMSL-751) class cutters because they are intended to replace the 12-ship WHECs\u2014are the Coast Guard's most capable cutters, and are intended to be general-purpose multi-mission platforms that can perform all seven of the Coast Guard's statutory missions anywhere except in ice. The Coast Guard's program of record (POR) calls for procuring 25 OPCs as replacements for the service's 12 WMECs\u2014the Coast Guard's second largest class\u2014and 3 of the high-endurance cutters. A September 2015 GAO report discusses the performance of the Coast Guard's OPC program. The Coast Guard's FY2019 budget submission is also requesting $75 million for 5 additional Fast Response Cutters (FRC) from 16 total requested, and is seeking to begin OPC procurement in FY2020. The Coast Guard's FY2019 budget submission proposed authorizing the 24th OPC be procured in FY2020\u20146 more than its POR (POR) calls for\u2014and authorizing procuring all 25 OPCs in subsequent fiscal years. The FY2020 budget submission also proposed transferring the 12 WMECs to the National Security Cutter (NSC) (WMSL-750) class cutter replacement program, which was proposed to be changed for 2019 to the \"Deepwater Large Cutter\" (DWC) program. This was in addition to the original request for five additional FRCs in FY2019. FRCs are the Coast Guard's most advanced small ships. The Coast Guard's program of record (POR) calls for procuring 58 FRCs as replacements for the high-endurance cutters and OPCs they will replace to perform OPC's traditional mission set. In February 2018, the Coast Guard received an award for FRC, and in September 2018, the Coast Guard awarded a contract for 2 FRCs.

As private health insurance is the predominant source of health coverage in the United States, there is considerable congressional interest in understanding private health insurance coverage of health benefits related to COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This report addresses frequently asked questions about covered benefits and consumer cost sharing related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and a potential vaccine. It discusses recent legislation, references relevant existing federal requirements and recent administrative interpretations of them in relation to COVID-19, and notes state and private-sector actions. It begins with background information on types and regulation of private health insurance plans. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA; P.L. 116-127 ) requires specified types of private health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing, administration of the test, and related items and services, without consumer cost sharing. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136 ) further addresses private health insurance coverage of COVID-19 testing, and requires coverage of a potential vaccine and other preventive services without cost sharing, if they are recommended by specified federal entities. There are no federal requirements that specifically require coverage of COVID-19 treatment services. However, one or more existing federal requirements are potentially relevant, as discussed in this report. Some states have also announced requirements related to covered benefits and consumer costs, and some insurers have reported that they will voluntarily cover certain relevant benefits. This report discusses most U.S. private health insurance plans' coverage of health care items and services related to COVID-19, but it generally does not discuss the delivery of those services, insurers' payments to health care providers, or private health insurance coverage of other benefits. The Appendix lists Congressional Research Service (CRS) analysts who can discuss with congressional clients other topics of interest related to private health insurance and COVID-19, including types of plans and coverage of benefits not addressed in this report. Also beyond the scope of this report are public health coverage programs (e.g., Medicare); the domestic and international public health responses to COVID-19; and economic, human services, and other nonhealth issues. For further information on these topics, congressional clients can access the CRS Coronavirus Disease 2019 resources page at https://www.crs.gov/resources/coronavirus-disease-2019.

Congressional clients may contact the report author and/or the experts listed in the Appendix for questions about further developments. In addition, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance related to private health insurance and COVID-19 is compiled on its website. the private health insurance market includes both the group market (largely made up of employer-sponsored insurance) and the individual market (which includes plans directly purchased from an insurer). The group market is divided into small- and large-group market segments; a small group is typically defined as a group of up to 50 individuals (e.g., employees), and a large group is typically defined as one with 51 or more individuals. Employers and other group health plan sponsors may purchase coverage from an insurer in the small- and large-group markets (i.e., they may fully insure ). Sponsors may instead finance coverage themselves (i.e., they may self-insure ). The individual and small-group markets include plans sold on and off the individual and small-group health insurance exchanges, respectively. Covered benefits, consumer costs, and other plan features may vary by plan, subject to applicable federal and state requirements. The federal government may regulate all the coverage types noted above (i.e., individual coverage, fully insured small- and large-group coverage, and self-insured group plans), and states may regulate all but self-insured group plans. Federal and state requirements may vary by coverage type. This report focuses on private-sector plans explained above. There are some variations of these coverage types, and there are other types of private health coverage arrangements, which may or may not be subject to the requirements discussed in this report, or for which there may be other policy questions related to COVID-19. These other coverage types are out of the scope of this report, but a number of them are identified in the Appendix, along with resources for further information. One coverage variation, grandfathered plans, is included in this report because it is explicitly referenced in legislation relevant to COVID-19 and private health insurance coverage. Grandfathered plans are individual or group plans in which at least one individual was enrolled as of enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. \n\nDo you think this summary was helpful?

Historically, Medicaid eligibility generally has been limited to low-income children, pregnant women, parents of dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Since 2014, however, states have had the option to cover nonelderly adults with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. The federal government's share of most Medicaid expenditures is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The remainder is referred to as the state share. Medicaid is a countercyclical program, meaning the rate of growth for Medicaid enrollment tends to accelerate when the economy weakens and tends to slow when the economy gains strength. During recessions, the rate of growth for Medicaid enrollment increases, which also increases the rate of growth for Medicaid expenditures at the same time that state revenues are decreasing. The federal government provided states with fiscal relief through temporary FMAP rate increases in response to the 2001 recession and the Great Recession. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, enacted on March 18, 2020, recently added a temporary Medicaid FMAP increase, beginning January 1, 2020, and continuing through the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency period. states' share of other payments authorized by T itle IV-E of the Social Security Act. The FMAP also was used before its temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine state shares of federal Medicaid payments to disproportionate share hospitals for health services to low-income individuals. This report briefly provides an overview on FMAP, and then proceeds to summarize the effects of economic downturns on the Medicaid program during 2001 and the Great Recession, and the temporary FMAP increase authorized under the FFCRA. FMAP 101 The FMAP is calculated annually for the fiscal year and is applied to each state and territory's Medicaid expenditures. The calculation combines two components: a base allowance of 21.00% of the state's annual Medicaid expenditures and an income-related component computed by comparing the state's per capita personal income with the U.S. per capita personal income. The basic allowance applies to all states and territories regardless of their incomes. The income-related component of the FMAP takes into account the degree to which a state's per capita personal income is below the U.S. per capita income. A state is considered in financial difficulty if its per capita personal income was at least 90% of the U.S. average three years earlier, but is lower than at least 75% of the U.S. average. States below the financial assistance threshold are referred to as FMAP States. For those states, the income-related component of the FMAP is based on their current income compared to the U.S. average three years earlier. The income-related component is increased if a state's income is below the FMAP threshold. On the other hand, the income-related component is decreased or eliminated if a state's income is above the threshold. For states that are not financially troubled, if current per capita personal income is at least 25% of the U.S. average; then the Medicaid FMAP will never be less than 50%. States that are not financial trouble but whose per capita personal income is less than 50% of the U.S average, have a minimum FMAP of 50%. For states that are not financially troubled, if current per capita income is between 50% and 75% of the U.S. average, the FMAP will never fall below 50%. States that are not financial trouble but whose per capita personal income is between 75% and 125% of the U.S. average have a FMAP between 50% and 76%. States that are not in financial trouble and have a per capita personal income that is greater than 125% of the U.S. average but less than 150%, receive no supplemental Medicaid payment. States whose per capita personal income is greater than 150% of the U.S. average receive no supplemental Medicaid payments. There are 13 states plus the District of Columbia whose per capita income is more than 150% of the national per capita personal income. Federal law caps the Medicaid FMAP rate to prevent states' payments from being reduced too much relative to the U.S. average. The minimum FMAP rate is 50% and the maximum rate is 76.98%. The maximum rate was set in 2012 when the Affordable Care Act increased FMAP by 3% for Medicaid enrollees classified as ACA expansion adults in states that chose to expand Medicaid. The ACA also established a permanent 100% FMAP rate for states that expand Medicaid by a certain date. The law did not", "The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the United States. Within the federal government, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) consumes more energy than any other agency. In FY2017, DOD consumed 707.9 trillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy, roughly 16 times that of the second largest consumer in the federal government, the U.S. Postal Service. In FY2017, DOD spent approximately $11.9 billion on energy, roughly 76% of the entire federal government's energy expenditures, and roughly 2% of DOD's FY2017 budget. Energy efficiency over time can lead to a reduction in agency expenses. DOD uses energy for a variety of purposes across the various services of the military. For example, DOD's efficient management of energy can also lead to less refueling and fewer fuel convoys. Reducing the frequency and duration of fueling in combat zones could reduce exposure and risk, which could save lives. This report provides an introduction to federal energy management rules applicable to DOD. The report includes an overview of federal statutes and executive orders that govern DOD energy management, and presents data on the status and trends for DOD energy use. Further, the scope of this report excludes nuclear energy for the propulsion of aircraft carriers, submarines, and energy used for military space operations. The report also references agency level guiding documents that provide the basis for how DOD implements these policies. Finally, this report identifies selected considerations for Congress.", "When Congress considers legislation, it takes into account the proposal's potential budgetary effects. This helps Members to weigh the legislation's merits, and to consider whether it complies with the budgetary rules that Congress has created for itself. While information on the potential budgetary effects of legislation may come from numerous sources, the authority to determine whether legislation complies with congressional budgetary rules is given to the House and Senate Budget Committees. In this capacity, the budget committees generally rely on estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). As described in the following section, cost estimates provided by CBO and JCT are guided by certain requirements that Congress has articulated in different forms. These requirements are not completely prescriptive, however, and as a result both CBO and JCT adopt practices and conventions that guide the creation of cost estimates. Generally, CBO and JCT estimates include projections of the budgetary effects that would result from a proposed policy and incorporate anticipated individual behavioral responses to the policy. The estimates, however, do not typically include the macroeconomic effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094effects on the overall size of the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094of those individual behavioral responses. Congress has sometimes required that JCT and CBO provide estimates that incorporate such macroeconomic effects. These estimates are often referred to as dynamic estimates or dynamic scores. This report provides information on the authorities and requirements under which cost estimates are prepared, as well as a summary of the debate surrounding dynamic cost estimates, and previous rules and requirements related to dynamic estimates. Currently, no congressional rules explicitly require dynamic estimates, and Congress may examine what rules changes, if any, are needed in the area of dynamic estimates. This report, therefore, includes information on options for the creation of dynamic scoring rules, and general considerations for Congress related to dynamic estimates. Cost estimates provided by CBO and JCT are guided, in part, by certain requirements that have been articulated by Congress in different forms, as described below. The Congressional Budget Act (CBA) requires that CBO prepare cost estimates for all bills reported from committee, \"to the extent practicable.\" The CBA also requires that (1) CBO rely on estimates provided by JCT for revenue legislation and (2) CBO include in its estimates \"the costs which would be incurred\" in carrying out the legislation in the fiscal year in which the legislation is to become effective, as well as the four following years, together with \"the basis for such estimate.\" When conducting cost estimates, CBO and JCT measure the budgetary effect of a legislative proposal in relation to projections of revenue and spending levels that are assumed to occur under current law, typically referred to as baseline levels. This means that the way a policy is reflected in the baseline will affect how CBO and JCT estimate a related policy. In calculating the baseline, CBO makes its own technical and economic assumptions, but the law generally requires that CBO assume that spending and revenue policies continue or expire based on what is currently slated to occur in statute. For example, CBO's baseline must assume that temporary tax cuts such as those enacted in 2017 actually do expire. The baseline, therefore, shows an increase in the level of revenue expected to be collected after the tax cut provisions expire in law. Therefore, a legislative proposal to continue those tax cut provisions would be scored as increasing the deficit. Although baseline calculations generally require that direct (mandatory) spending program levels reflect what is scheduled to occur in law, important exceptions exist for many direct spending programs. In particular, any program with estimated current year outlays greater than $50 million is assumed to continue to operate under the terms of the law at the time of its expiration. This means that some programs that are slated in law to expire are assumed to continue in the baseline. A legislative proposal that sought to merely continue those expired programs would therefore not be scored as new spending. When creating cost estimates, CBO adheres to scorekeeping guidelines, which are \"specific rules for determining the budgetary effects of legislation.\" These general guidelines are used by the scorekeepers\u00e2\u0080\u0094the House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u00e2\u0080\u0094to ensure that each group uses consistent and established practices. The 17 scorekeeping guidelines include general principles, such as a requirement that mandatory spending provisions included in appropriations bills be counted against the Appropriations Committee spending allocation, and direction on how asset sales are to be scored. The guidelines have been revised and expanded over the years, and any changes or additions to the scorekeeping guidelines are first approved by each of the scorekeepers. Congress sometimes directs the creation and content of cost estimates through chamber rules and provisions contained in budget resolutions. As described subsequently, House rules have sometimes explicitly required CBO and JCT", "The report is a brief summary of House and Senate procedures for reaching agreement on legislation. It discusses the provisions of House Rule XXII and Senate Rule XXVIII, as well as other applicable rules, precedents, and practices. The report focuses on the most common and customary procedures, and there are many exceptions, complications, and possibilities that are not addressed. The House and Senate must pass the same bill or joint resolution, and they must reach full and precise agreement on its text before it is submitted to the President for his approval or veto. The same requirements apply to a concurrent resolution and a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment, although neither receives presidential action. At some stage of the legislative process, therefore, the House must pass a Senate bill or the Senate must pass a House bill. The simplest way of meeting this requirement is for one house to pass its own bill and send it to the \"other body,\" which then considers and passes it, with or without amendments. Frequently, however, House and Senate committees each develop their own bills on the same subject, and these can lead to negotiations between the two houses. Informal negotiations and exchange of amendments between the houses can be just as effective as conference committee negotiations. The ultimate objective of this process is to resolve policy differences between the two houses, so that a bill can pass both houses and be sent to the President for signature or veto.", "As outlined in the given text, the Social Security programme is facing financial strain due to the decreasing fertility rate and increasing life expectancy of the population. The combination of these demographic factors results in a shift in the age distribution, where there is a greater percentage of the population being older. This will cause increased costs of the Social Security program, which will be funded through the trust fund and will last until 2035.\nThe Social Security program, or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), pays monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families and to the family members of deceased workers. The OASDI program's ability to meet scheduled benefit payments rests upon sufficient revenues from payroll taxes, taxation on Social Security benefits, and interest earned on trust funds assets. The year 2020 marks the first since 1982 in which the OASDI program's total cost is projected to be greater than its total income.", "In August 2019, India's government announced that it was formally ending the special status of its Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) state, the two-thirds of Kashmir under New Delhi's control, specifically by abrogating certain provisions of the Indian Constitution that granted the state autonomy with regard to most internal administrative issues. The legal changes went into effect on November 1, 2019, when New Delhi also bifurcated the state into two \"union territories,\" each with lesser indigenous administrative powers than Indian states. Indian officials explain the moves as matters of internal domestic politics, taken for the purpose of properly integrating J&K and facilitating its economic development. However, the move sparked controversy as a \"unilateral\" Indian effort to alter the status of a territory that is considered disputed by neighboring Pakistan and China, as well as by the United Nations. New Delhi's heavy-handed security crackdown in the remote state also raised ongoing human rights concerns. It appears that India's position on Kashmir has been to settle it through negotiations with Pakistan, while taking into consideration the wishes of the Kashmiri people. However, due to these recent actions, there are potential negative implications for regional stability as well as India's democracy and human rights record. The U.S. government will have to balance the importance of their partnership with India while also continuing to prioritize the promotion and protection of human rights.", "The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) programs were reorganized starting with the FY2016 request. There are two main mission areas under the DNN appropriation: the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program and the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR). NCTIR was previously funded under Weapons Activities. According to the FY2016 budget justification, \"These transfers align all NNSA funding to prevent, counter, and respond to nuclear proliferation and terrorism in one appropriation.\" The DNN Program is now divided into six functional areas: Materials Management and Minimization (M3) conducts activities to reduce and, where possible, eliminate stockpiles of weapons-useable material around the world. Major activities include conversion of reactors that use highly enriched uranium (useable for weapons) to low enriched uranium, removal and consolidation of nuclear material stockpiles, and disposition of excess nuclear materials. Global Material Security has three major program elements: international nuclear security, radiological security, and nuclear smuggling detection and deterrence. Activities toward achieving those goals include the provision of equipment and training, workshops and exercises, and collaboration with international organizations. Nonproliferation and Arms Control implements programs that aim to strengthen international nuclear safeguards, control the spread of dual-use technologies and expertise, and verify nuclear reductions and compliance with treaties and agreements. This program conducts reviews of nuclear export applications and technology transfer authorizations. National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development (NTNF R&D ) examines and evaluates nuclear materials and devices, nuclear test explosions or radiological dispersals, and post-detonation debris through nuclear forensics development at the national laboratories. The program includes a field response capability to assist the interagency in the event of a nuclear or radiological incident. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development ( DNN R&D ) advances U.S. capabilities to detect and characterize global nuclear security threats such as foreign nuclear material and weapons production, diversion of special nuclear material, and nuclear detonations. The Nonproliferation Construction program consists of the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Project (SPD) and the Mixed-Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), which was to be built in South Carolina to convert surplus weapons plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel. This project was terminated and replaced with a different disposal method (see below). The Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR) evaluates nuclear and radiological threats and develops emergency preparedness plans, including organizing scientific teams to provide rapid response to nuclear or radiological incidents or accidents worldwide. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations totaled $2.031 billion, reflecting a 6.2% decrease from FY2020-enacted levels. The budget justification says that this decrease is mainly due to the \"completion of funding for contractual termination\" of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site. Funding for that program was decreased by 50% (-$150 million). A $42 million, or 9.65%, decrease to the Global Material Security program was due to an increase in FY2020 funds for the Cesium Irradiator Replace Program. The budget proposal requests a $37.2 million, or 10%, increase in funding for the Material Management Minimization program. The increase is mainly in the conversion subprogram, which is working to establish non-HEU based molybdenum-99 production technologies in the United States. The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development (NTNF R&D) is a new program in FY2021. The budget request says that the program will allow NNSA to \"take on a more active leadership role\" in nuclear forensics. The $40 million in funding for NTNF was moved from the DNN R&D Nuclear Detonation Detection subprogram. As in past years, the FY2020 appropriations included a provision prohibiting funds in the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account for certain activities and assistance in the Russian Federation. Appropriations bills have prohibited this since FY2015. The FY2021 budget justification requests funds related to the U.S. plutonium disposition program in the M3 Material Disposition subprogram and Nonproliferation Construction Surplus Plutonium Disposition subprogram. The United States pledged to dispose of 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium, which was originally to be converted into fuel for commercial power reactors. The U.S. facility for this purpose was to be the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), which had been under construction at the DOE Savannah River site in South Carolina. The MFFF faced sharply escalating construction and operation cost estimates, and the Obama Administration proposed to <a href=\"http://www.nuclearinfo.org/nuc_budget/", "TEXT: In the past, Congress has regularly acted to extend expired or expiring temporary tax provisions. Collectively, these temporary tax provisions are often referred to as \"tax extenders.\" This report briefly summarizes and discusses the economic impact of the 17 business-related tax provisions that are scheduled to expire before 2025. There are 13 business-related temporary tax provisions scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. Prior extenders bills have tended to retroactively reenact tax provisions that had expired. In 2020, the business tax extenders are diverse in purpose, providing various types of tax relief to businesses in different industries. Most recently, Congress extended expiring provisions in the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019, enacted as Division Q of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ).", "This is the second in a two-part series of reports addressing the broad categories of electric vehicles and related technologies. This report provides a primer on the expansion of the market for electric passenger, or light-duty, vehicles, with consideration of market penetration, sales, technology, policy, and infrastructure. It addresses factors influencing EV adoption and the current federal policy landscape, as well as related technologies and categories of EVs. Among the findings in the report: - There are various categories of EVs, and policy should aim to encourage widespread adoption, not over-emphasize any one of them at the expense of others. - Increasing electric vehicle infrastructure and availability of charging ports supports continued growth of EVs and adoption. - Factors such as high costs or a limited range of an EV may be perceived as drawbacks by some, but they are often overstated, and policy could work to address such misconceptions. - Government policies and actions may affect electric vehicle adoption in different ways, including through financial incentives, vehicle regulations or standards, or through transportation policies and land use planning. - EV charging infrastructure should work for different types of vehicles and accommodate the needs of different users such as commercial fleets. - A few policies and actions have been enacted at the state level, and future ones may further affect EV adoption and infrastructure. This report is a primer intended to provide background on EVs and related technology and policy, and may be of interest to policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders. It is unlikely to answer all questions related to EVs, but may be a good starting point for additional inquiries.", "This report will also be available through the Congress.gov website.", "You are an expert at summarization.

KEYWORDS: low-income, benefits, spending, entitlements </s> \nWhat might be some potential reasons for the trend towards increasing automatic responses in low-income assistance programs, and does this pose any challenges for the future of these programs?</s> \nOne potential reason for the trend towards increasing automatic responses in low-income assistance programs is that policymakers prioritize ensuring that those in need receive assistance in difficult economic times. The automatic responses to recessions may be seen as a way to protect vulnerable individuals and families. Additionally, these automatic responses may be designed to encourage work and to move people out of poverty.\n\nHowever, automatic responses to recessions also create challenges for the future of these programs. Firstly, automatic responses to recessions tend to be temporary and do not address the underlying causes of poverty or income inequality. Therefore, they do not create long-term solutions to poverty. Secondly, automatic responses can lead to increasing debt and budget deficits, which may limit future policy flexibility. Finally, automatic responses may create perverse incentives or disincentives for individuals and families to participate in certain programs or to make certain choices. For example, increasing SNAP benefits during a recession may encourage individuals to remain out of work because they receive more benefits than they would if they were employed. This could create a disincentive to work and to move out of poverty.", "What is the current status of regulation and legal frameworks governing the cable industry, including the roles of the FCC and local government entities, and what legal issues remain unsettled regarding the relationship between these entities?", "You are an expert at summarization.

Delaware is considered among the top states in its efforts to provide broadband services, and the governor has declared it a priority for the state. In 2013, the state legislature created the Delaware Broadband Program, managed by the Office of the State Broadband Coordinator. In addition, the state enacted a tax incentive program to encourage telecommunications companies to expand broadband capacity. Through these efforts, unserved areas received improved broadband services, and the program has improved services even for those who had already received them, such as businesses and colleges.\nDelaware offers two financial assistance programs: Broadband Infrastructure Grant Program The Broadband Infrastructure Grant Program provides funding to private telecommunication firms that extend broadband to unserved areas. The state awards grants to broadband providers. The grant provides for a 50% matching grant. In 2017, the state received 34 requests to support broadband infrastructure development, with 14 approved.\nBroadband Development Grant Program The broadband development grant program seeks to promote the development of innovative broadband infrastructure. The award amount is up to $25,000 and is contingent on the number of requests received. In 2017, the state received eight requests and awarded four grants for $40,000.\nMaryland: Broadband Development Initiative\nIn 2012, the state established the Maryland Broadband Development Initiative with a goal to provide high-speed internet access to unserved areas. This initiative is among the country's larger broadband programs.\nThe program offers financing to both private providers and non-profits through grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Maryland has used $45 million in capital bonds to create a 10-year revolving loan fund, which has increased the state's ability to provide long-term technical assistance along with loan funds.

In summary, digital assets are assets issued and transferred using distributed ledger technology. They are often referred to as digital tokens, digital asset or cryptocurrency among other terminology. Despite market participants using different terms to describe them, financial regulators have stated that regardless of what they are called, financial activities, services and market participants must adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In the case of digital assets, depending on their characteristics, this could include securities laws and regulations. One key difference between traditional and digital assets is asset ownership and exchanges of ownership. Whereas traditional assets are generally recorded in private ledgers maintained by central intermediaries, digital asset's ownership and exchange are generally recorded on a decentralized digital ledger. The SEC monitors and regulates securities offerings, sales, and investment activities, including those involving digital assets. The SEC's current regulatory framework that governs traditional and digital securities includes the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The policy rationale behind securities laws and regulations includes promoting transparent disclosure of important market-related information, ensuring fair dealing, and protecting against fraud. As a result, the existing regulatory regime focuses on disclosure-based rules, antifraud regime, and rules governing securities market participants. The SEC's mission is to protect investors, facilitate fair and efficient markets, and encourage capital formation. For example, one of the cornerstones of securities regulation is the Securities Act of 1933, often referred to as the \"truth in securities\" law. Digital assets as a capital market innovation evolved quickly, and the SEC's approach to regulations has been to avoid being prescriptive and potentially inefficient. Instead, the SEC has allowed digital assets to evolve and monitored their use in compliance with existing regulations.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many banks have announced measures to offer various forms of assistance to affected consumers.

As mentioned in the report, weather-dependent renewable energy sources like wind and solar are being incorporated into the electricity grid in larger quantities, resulting in a more diverse mix of energy sources. This diversity can introduce new challenges to ensure the reliability of the power system. However, current reliability standards and planning practices have been adjusted to accommodate these new sources of energy. Additionally, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission continue to monitor and enforce these standards to ensure that the power system remains reliable. Therefore, while there are ongoing discussions about how the increased use of wind and solar sources may impact reliability in the future, there is currently no significant evidence to suggest that it is causing significant problems at the national level. Therefore, the need for reliability standards in the electricity sector is not significantly impacted by the increased use of wind and solar sources.", "In recent presidential Administrations, there have been several high-profile disputes between Congress and the White House regarding access to executive branch officials. This has included attempts by Congress to enforce subpoenas issued to Harriet Miers, White House Counsel to President George W. Bush; Eric Holder, Attorney General to President Barack Obama; 2 the Coast Guard's compliance with that report requirement and directed additional compliance by the Coast Guard and directed it to appear in person to explain the state of repair and maintenance of its legacy assets. These cases are examples of the more extreme circumstances where congressional committees may attempt to compel testimony and cooperation from executives. In more typical circumstances, though, agency officials will be more responsive to congressional requests and subpoenas. While there are countless examples throughout history to support this statement, a few recent cases illustrate the point. In September 2009, during a health care reform summit at the White House, President Barack Obama stated \"I am here to provide an update.\" That is exactly what the President and Administration officials did throughout the proceedings. 3\nCongressional inquiries of the executive branch are typically done through committees. The committee structure mirrors the organization of the executive branch. Many committees track the organization of departments and agencies. Some committees are focused on broad subject areas, such as defense or foreign relations. These committees typically have jurisdiction over one or more of the executive branch departments that are involved in executing laws in those areas. An even broader group of committees, however, have no clearly defined oversight purview over any specific executive branch agency or activity. Congressional committee investigations can focus on a single issue or range in scope to broad issues related to a particular department or agency. Often, committees seek voluntary cooperation from the executive branch with investigations. Hearings involving multiple witnesses can be the focus of a congressional investigation. Committees may hold hearings at which the chair can call both witnesses that may advance or support their case. The committee or other staff of the committee will ask questions of the witnesses in order to gather details, clarify their beliefs, challenge their assumptions, and to ascertain whether the witness has any knowledge relating to the investigation. The committee members will continue to ask question in rounds. There are two kinds of questions that can be asked: Open-ended questions and Closed-ended questions An open-ended question is a question that leads to a more detailed or longer response. Closed-ended questions require responses of multiple choices, like yes, no, or multiple choices. Congressional members can have the flexibility that they can ask more open-ended questions and ask follow-up questions to the witness. After the witness responses, the committee members might ask the witness to clarify their answers and the details of their understanding of the events or policies under investigation. Finally, the committee members might ask the witness if they have knowledge, information, or opinions that they can provide that were not asked yet and are not included in the record. In many cases, committee members might choose to ask the witness to provide the committee with written responses to questions that the witness was not able to answer during the committee hearing. 4\nThe chair of the committee might have other members of the committee participate or provide further questions. The committee chair might also allow the chair or staff of the committee to ask additional questions. Other committee members might be given the opportunity to ask questions which might be provided to each of the witnesses. When it comes to closing the first half of the committee hearing, the committee might want to ask the witness to provide final words or a closing summary. 5\nExecutive branch officials generally view cooperating with congressional inquiries as part of their obligation to be transparent and accountable to taxpayers. Many see sharing information with Congress as fulfilling a vital democratic role. It is a corollary to a basic obligation for civil servants to inform not only lawmakers but the general public, as well. But officials also see additional incentives when dealing with Congress. These include: 1) the potential consequences to an administration if it refuses to provide information or testimony ; 2) a desire not to appear obstinate or unresponsive; 3) personal ambitions to be seen by potential voters or history as good and effective public servants; 4) the value of establishing close and productive working relationships with the legislative branch; and 5) respect for Congress itself as an institution of government. There may be more specific motivations behind a particular administration's willingness to cooperate with individual congressional committees, inquiries, or hearings. The willingness to cooperate can depend on a host of factors, including the significance of the issue or conduct that is the subject of the inquiry, how central the inquiry is to the administration's agenda and principles, the political orientation and power of the committee and its members, whether the administration believes the inquiry and the information sought is relevant, the nature and level of any personal relationships between officials and lawmakers, and the administration's evaluation of whether failing to cooperate will be harmful to its larger goals. Congressional investigations involve the Executive Branch because Congress needs information from the Executive Branch, including agency and department officials, in order to formulate and legislate policy.

What is the significance of broadband availability mapping?\nThe accurate mapping of broadband availability is crucial because it informs federal policy and funding decisions aimed at closing the urban-rural digital divide. Additionally, this mapping helps to accurately identify areas that are underserved, and therefore, are eligible to receive federal funding and initiatives to ensure that everyone has access to high-speed internet and digital services required for a prosperous economy. \n2. What are the challenges pertaining to mapping broadband availability, and what steps are being taken to address these challenges?\nOne of the major challenges when it comes to mapping broadband availability is that internet service providers are not required by law to report their build-outs to the U.S. government, including the FCC. This leads to significant inconsistencies in the available data, resulting in misleading maps of broadband availability. The Commission is working diligently to ensure that the maps are as accurate as possible and that broadband will continue to be accessible by all Americans. \n3. What steps are currently being taken to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping, and what are the proposed goals of these efforts?\nThe FCC is taking several steps in the ongoing development of broadband mapping initiatives that will lead to the establishment of an even more comprehensive map. One of the key elements of this initiative is the Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DDOC) which will entail several updates to the map's methodologies and underlying data sources. These enhancements will result in a much more accurate and reliable map that provides consumers and policymakers with a clear understanding of the progress made in broadband deployment over time.", "What exactly is the writer doing in this paragraph, and how does it compare with the text it is summarizing/paraphrasing?

Over the years, cable system owners have frequently objected to these and other types of local franchising requirements. In 1980, for example, operators of a 30-channel cable system in Lakeville, Minnesota, and three smaller Minnesota systems filed suit in U.S. District Court, challenging provisions of their franchise agreements that required PEG access. The court sided with the operators and struck down the challenged PEG requirements, but the operators subsequently lost on appeal. After that, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against two more cable system owners that argued that local franchise agreements requiring PEG access violated the First Amendment and represented an unconstitutional exercise of municipal power. The Supreme Court found that the challenged cable franchise provisions did not infringe upon cable operators' commercial speech rights. In 1984, Congress addressed the issue of PEG channel capacity in new legislation. Cable operators that wished to participate in what was then a cable regulation system that imposed significant price controls and restrictions on entry had to offer PEG services. This, in turn, gave cities a basis upon which to require such service as part of a local franchise agreement. In 1986, after cable operators became responsible for negotiating programming prices independently, Congress eliminated the requirement that operators offer PEG channels. Nevertheless, cable operators were still required to negotiate franchise agreements with local governments. As cable service proliferated, it became the primary video service medium for more than two-thirds of American homes. Cities began to view PEG access and local franchise fees as an important source of revenue. Local officials believed that having the power to award franchises gave them leverage to extract from cable operators PEG access, other concessions, and franchise fees. In addition to cable video operators and subscribers, LFA negotiators also had to satisfy other interests, such as public safety officials and local providers of telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (referred to in this report as the 1996 Act) substantially changed the video regulatory approach. It mandated that a franchise agreement could not \"bar a telecommunications carrier from offering video programming services or require a telecommunications carrier to offer video programming services, or both,\" nor \"prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of video programming services.\" Consequently, local governments no longer could require cable operators to offer PEG channels or charge franchise fees; other provisions of video service agreements were also subject to new limits. Under the 1996 Act, LFAs cannot \"impose or modify requirements with respect to franchise agreements or charges relating to video programming services, except as expressly permitted.\" These changes did not take effect nationwide until August of 1999 because new federal rules had to be issued before the law became effective in a particular state. State and municipal governments often must review cable operator franchise applications. In those situations where the federal government delegated authority to the state, generally only video service providers in states with delegated authority could obtain a state franchise license rather than a local franchise. Under the Communications Act's provisions that have not been modified, state-based franchising approaches may be used for video services; cable system operators; video-programming distributors; open video system infrastructure providers; and, if applicable, video-programming networks. In some states, a cable operator seeking a new franchise could obtain approval from a state commission rather than pursuing local franchises. As of June 2008, most states (44 states) either have no franchising authority over video service providers or explicitly delegate authority to their cities/townships/villes in the case with 28 states, the only authority to regulate video providers and rates is through cable /video franchising at the local level. Of these 28 states, 19 require state agencies to review and deny or approve local franchise applications. Twenty states allow local franchising directly. 12 states delegate authority to both local governments and the states. In 6 states, local governments have no regulatory authority with respect to cable television video programming. Although a growing quantity of PEG access to cable channels is offered entirely within the private sector as a result of industry initiatives and community outreach efforts, PEG access also remains a significant element of many local franchise agreements. Many cable operators and video programming distributors \u2014 VPDs \u2014 grant PEG access as a negotiated concession in order to obtain a franchise (license) from a local or state government. Some PEG access consists of channel capacity in systems that offer tiers, and some occurs on digital channels with channel capacity that was previously occupied by analog channels. The amount of PEG time that a cable television or video programming distributor provides varies greatly, and has fluctuated over time according to changes in the number of channels available on a system.

It provides an overview of issues that arise with consideration of supplemental disaster assistance appropriations.", "TEXT SUMMARY", "What specific labor traits and/or changes in labor market conditions may have contributed to the reduced labor compensation and income growth? What policy strategies might help address these issues? The rise in the college premium coupled with the stagnant wages of those with less education has had significant effects over time in the labor market. There has been slower upward mobility in the labor market for those without many educational years, despite an increase in real wages at the bottom. In 2016, the labor income share for workers with at least a bachelor's degree was 50.9%, up from about 44% in 1991. Women have experienced faster income growth than men, but have fallen below men's income for those without a college degree. These labor market developments may have been caused by a wide variety of causes, including technological development. There may have been increases in the demand for labor with postsecondary education and a corresponding reduction in the demand for labor with less education. There may also be a decline in the demand for labor, affecting labor market outcomes. Other factors affecting labor market outcomes may be the level of the minimum wage, the effect of immigration on the labor force and wages, the effects of growing import competition on wages, the size of labor unions and the unionization rate, the labor firm premium, and the availability of labor mobility. It is suggested that these factors be addressed by policy proposals such as increasing worker skill levels, facilitating the movement of labor from low-paying jobs to higher-paying jobs, encouraging the development of a wellfunctioning labor market to increase competition, and expanding worker protection policies with regard to issues such as unionization and the minimum wage. One policy proposal is to improve schools and postsecondary schools, especially focusing on underserved populations of children. Additionally, policies aimed at increasing the real value of the minimum wage, reducing the effects of immigration on wages, increasing labor mobility, reducing labor supply constraints, and facilitating unionization may also provide benefits.", "THE MMT PHILOSOPHY OF MACROECONOMICS TEXT\nby a wide margin this is most commonly the case), then aggregate income increases, raising the demand for goods and services and lowering the interest rate, thus stimulating investment. To bring the economy to stability or full employment, the fiscal policy needs to be balanced by a monetary policy that shifts the IS curve up by reducing the interest rate. In contrast, for a given fiscal policy, a lower interest rate increases investment, reducing the IS curve. The LM curve reflects the demand for money. It begins with the desire of households and firms to hold inventories and liquid assets, which is a function of the precautionary motive to save. This is balanced by the motivation to hold cash for final purchases as well as short-term production. If the total of these balances is less than that of inventories and bank reserves, then the interest rate is greater than the cash hoarding rate. In such a case, firms would want to invest but cannot. Thus, a change in the LM curve is the change in an expansion or contraction of liquidity in the economy arising from an unexpected change in government purchases, tax cuts, or higher imports. The IS-LM curves can be summarized as follows: \u2022 The IS curve plots the relationship between the interest rate and the investment demand and saving of households and firms. Fiscal policy can affect income and the interest rate, affecting consumption and investment. Changes in government spending can increase or decrease investment. \u2022 The LM curve plots the relationship between the interest rate and the quantity of money. Any external injections (such as changes in government spending or taxes) lead to changes in the money supply and corresponding demand for money. The sum of vertical and horizontal equilibrium is called the monetary equilibrium condition, which allows the interest rate to be determined. The LM curve does not need to be linear. For example, the curve may differ across countries due to the currency denomination of debt. The IS-LM and LM curves are often drawn using diagrams or graphs; the equations below reflect the IS and LM curves when they are graphed in separate axes in the standard IS-LM diagram. For mathematical formulation, the IS curve is first graphed independently of the LM curve, with the horizontal axis being the natural log of income (that is, the logarithm base e) and the vertical axis being the natural log of aggregate price. On the graph the IS curve slopes downwards from left to right. The LM curve is then graphed independently of the IS curve. Initially, it is assumed that changes in the LM curve do not affect the IS curve, and thus the intersection point between the two curves lies on the horizontal axis (y = 10), which is where the income equals net exports and the slope of the LM curve is equal to 10. In this position, every $1 dollar increase in net exports (or a decrease in government spending) shifts the LM curve upwards by 10 percent, and every $1 dollar increase in income (or tax reduction) shifts the IS curve up by one-half as much. When the IS-LM curves intersect, it means that equilibrium is attained. If income is to the right of the IS curve or below the LM curve, investment is positive. If income is to the left of the IS curve or above the LM curve, either unemployment or inflation would result. MMT does not dispute the existence of the IS-LM curves, and its critics do not use the mainstream model; the differences are over the nature of fiscal policy and the interpretation of the consequences of the federal debt.\nThe MMT approach differs markedly from traditional (mainstream) macroeconomic theory The MMT approach (henceforth referred to as MMT) is different markedly from traditional macroeconomic theory on the nature of fiscal policy and the relationship of federal debt to economic well-being. Like mainstream macroeconomic theory, MMT recognizes the relationship between saving, investment, and income. It also recognizes the LM curve, which equates monetary saving and investment, as well as the IS curve, which equates real saving and investment. It uses IS-LM modeling to reach conclusions about fiscal policy, the money rate of interest, and macroeconomic management. However, the MMT approach differs markedly from traditional (mainstream) macroeconomic theory, and several key assumptions underlying the theory are challenged. MMT is built on three basic tenets: First, the government does not face a financial constraint, because MMT recognizes that a nation with a fiat currency (in which the government creates the currency it uses) can pay its debts and meet those debts denominated in its own currency. Second, government spending results in (at least) equal amounts of increased net financial assets (NFAs), which are private-sector financial assets minus central bank financial assets (and excluding the financial assets of foreign governments). In general:\n\u2022 The government issues a financial (debt) instrument in exchange for other financial assets held in the private sector", "To summarize this passage, the author discusses the history of House investigations and the difference between legislative and impeachment investigations. They explain that impeachment and legislative investigations are both exercises of considerable constitutional power, and thus House committees may have adequate authority and tools to obtain much of the information they seek in both types of investigations. They also mention that the House has not adopted any explicit definition of what constitutes an impeachment investigation. \nWhat are some potential limitations on the House's ability to obtain information during an impeachment investigation, despite significant constitutional power and historical practice?</s> \nSome potential limitations on the House's ability to obtain information during an impeachment investigation include political considerations and conflicts of interest, the scope of executive privilege, limitations under federal law or regulations, and the need to protect ongoing criminal investigations. Additionally, the impeachment process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, which may affect the House's ability to quickly acquire certain types of information. There may also be limitations on the ability of the House to investigate certain individuals or entities without proper standing or jurisdiction. Finally, it is also possible that individuals and entities targeted by an impeachment investigation may choose to withhold or destroy documents or refuse to cooperate with the investigation, further limiting the House's ability to obtain information.", "The power to lay and collect taxes and the power to borrow are among the enumerated powers of Congress under Article I, Section 8. Furthermore, Section 9 of Article I states that funds may be drawn from the Treasury only pursuant to appropriations made by law. The Constitution does not expressly provide a specific role for the President with regard to budgetary matters. Accordingly, there is no single \"budget process\" through which all budgetary decisions are made, and in any year there may be many budgetary measures necessary to establish or implement different aspects of federal fiscal policy. Congress has a dynamic institution that is capable of changing its rules, practices, and organization to meet changing goals and overcome obstacles. As early as the 14 th Congress, the House and Senate created a system of standing committees to provide for the separate consideration of revenue, spending, and debt legislation. In the subsequent years, Congress distinguished between appropriations and general policy legislation and established the convention of the House passing supply bills as a separate item of business. In 1837, the House adopted a rule that authorized appropriations only for activities that had previously received statutory authority.", "Beneficial ownership refers to the natural person or persons who invest in, control, or otherwise reap gains from an asset, such as a bank account, real estate property, company, or trust. In some cases, an asset's beneficial owner may not be listed in public records or disclosed to federal authorities as the legal owner. For some years, the United States has been criticized by international bodies for gaps in the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) system related to a lack of systematic beneficial ownership disclosure. While beneficial ownership information is relevant to several types of assets, attention has focused on the beneficial ownership of companies, and in particular, the use of so-called \"shell companies\" to anonymously purchase assets, such as real property, and to store and move money, including through bank accounts and wire transfers. While such companies may be created for a legitimate purpose, there are also concerns that the use of some of these companies can facilitate crimes, such as money laundering. Recent U.S. regulatory steps and legislation have particularly focused on beneficial ownership disclosure related to the use of shell companies with hidden owners that conduct financial transactions or purchase assets. In the context of AML regimes, law enforcement authorities as well as financial institutions and their regulators may seek beneficial ownership information to identify or verify the natural persons who benefit from or control financial assets held in the name of legal entities, such as corporations and limited liability companies. Drug traffickers, terrorist financiers, tax and sanctions evaders, corrupt government officials, and other criminals have been known to obscure their beneficial ownership of legal entities for money laundering purposes. To do so, they may form nominal legal entities, or \"shell companies,\" which have no physical presence and generate little to no economic activity, but are used to anonymously store and transfer illicit proceeds. By relying on third-party nominees to serve as the legal owners of record for such shell companies, criminals can control and enjoy the benefits of the assets held by such companies while shielding their identities from investigators. Although concealing beneficial ownership has long been a central element of many money laundering schemes, many jurisdictions around the world have not established or implemented policy measures that address beneficial ownership disclosure and transparency. According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\u00e2\u0080\u0094an intergovernmental standards-setting body for AML and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)\u00e2\u0080\u0094financial crime investigations are frequently hampered by the absence of adequate, accurate, and timely information on beneficial ownership. FATF has accordingly identified beneficial ownership transparency as an enduring AML/CFT policy challenge. Some U.S. government agencies have also long recognized that the ability to create legal entities without accurate beneficial ownership information is a key vulnerability in the U.S. financial system. Such ongoing vulnerabilities have placed the United States under domestic and international pressure, including from the FATF, to tighten its AML/CFT regime with respect to beneficial ownership disclosure requirements. In recent years, various U.S. regulators have taken actions to address this issue, and congressional interest in this topic has increased. This report first provides selected case studies of high-profile situations where beneficial ownership has been obscured. It then provides an overview of beneficial ownership issues relating to corporate formation and in real estate transactions. Next, it describes the recent history of beneficial ownership policy and legislation. The report then discusses recent U.S. regulatory changes to address aspects of beneficial ownership transparency. Thereafter, the report analyzes selected current policy issues, including sectors not covered by existing Treasury regulations, the status of international efforts to address beneficial ownership, and the evolution of the Global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) program. Finally, the report analyzes selected legislative proposals in the 116 th Congress. While beneficial ownership information is relevant to a variety of assets, recent policy attention has focused on the beneficial ownership of companies, and in particular, the use of shell companies to anonymously purchase assets, such as real property, and to store and move money, including through bank accounts and wire transfers. The beneficial owner of a legal person can be ascertained by tracing the ownership and control of that legal person through multiple layers of legal entities and arrangements. This can involve identifying the natural persons who exercise ultimate decision-making authority, or who stand to benefit financially if the entity fails financially. This approach, which is essentially the process of \"unwinding\" ownership and control relationships of legal persons, can be complex and time-consuming, especially if the chain runs through multiple layers of intermediaries and requires tracing control through a maze of shell companies. Because it can be so difficult to determine who really owns and controls legal persons, many countries require the creation of beneficial ownership registries that establish who ultimately owns and controls many of the legal persons that are formed within those countries. Registries can be central to achieving international standards to require transparency when forming and registering new legal entities. In the United States, Treasury continues to support efforts to expand beneficial ownership transparency by making additional information, including names, addresses, birth dates, and", "In this report, the author examines whether and to what extent the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) applies to threats due to climate change.

The law imposed an oil and gas leasing moratorium through June 30, 2022, throughout most of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico (off the Florida coast) and a small part of the Central Gulf. In other parts of the Gulf of Mexico, the law established a framework for sharing revenues from certain qualified oil and gas leases with the \"Gulf producing states\" of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as with a nationwide outdoor recreation program\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Land and Water Conservation Fund's (LWCF's) state assistance program. Several aspects of GOMESA have generated interest in the 116th Congress. As the 2022 expiration date for the leasing moratorium in the Eastern Gulf approaches, the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has begun to plan for offshore leasing in this area following the moratorium's expiration. BOEM's draft proposed five-year oil and gas leasing program for 2019-2024 would schedule new lease sales in the expired moratorium area starting in 2023. Some Members of Congress seek to forestall new lease sales by extending the moratorium beyond 2022; others support allowing it to expire on the currently scheduled date. On September 11, 2019, the House passed H.R. 205, which would make the GOMESA moratorium permanent. Congress is weighing the potential for development of hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Gulf against competing uses of the area for military testing and training, commercial fishing, and recreation. The debate encompasses questions of regional economic livelihoods and national energy and military security, as well as environmental concerns centered on the threat of oil spills and the potential contributions to climate change of oil and gas development. GOMESA's revenue-sharing provisions also have generated debate and interest in the 116th Congress. The law entered a second revenue-sharing phase in FY2017\u00e2\u0080\u0094often referred to as GOMESA's \"Phase II\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which qualified leasing revenues from an expanded geographic area are shared with the states and with the LWCF. Phase II has resulted in higher revenue shares than in the law's first decade (FY2007-FY2016). Revenue sharing from the added Phase II areas is capped for most years at $500 million annually for the Gulf producing states and the LWCF combined, and some Members of Congress seek to raise or eliminate this cap. In the 115th Congress, P.L. 115-97 increased the cap to $650 million for FY2020 and FY2021. In addition to changing the cap, some Members have advocated to increasing the percentage of revenues shared with the Gulf Coast states and to increase the set of qualified leases from which revenues can be shared, as well as to add an additional state (Florida) to the revenue-sharing arrangement. Other bills have proposed new uses of Gulf oil and gas revenues for various federal programs and purposes outside of revenue sharing, and some stakeholders have proposed to end GOMESA state revenue sharing altogether. Debate has centered on the extent to which these revenues should be shared with coastal states versus used for broader federal purposes, such as deficit reduction or nationwide federal conservation programs. Some Members of Congress and other stakeholders have made the case that the coastal states should receive a higher revenue share, given costs incurred by these states and localities to support extraction activities. These stakeholders have compared GOMESA revenue sharing with the onshore federal revenue-sharing program, where states receive a higher share of the federal leasing revenues than is provided under the GOMESA framework. Other Members of Congress, as well as the Obama and Trump Administrations at times, have contended that revenues generated in federal waters belong to all Americans, and revenue distribution should reflect broader national needs.

FINANCIAL REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS AVERAGE FIVE-PARAGRAPH", "The United States and Russia signed a new strategic arms reduction treaty\u2014known as New START\u2014in 2010 to replace the expired START treaty of 1991. The treaty replaced the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty (START), which expired, after 15 years of implementation, on December 5, 2009. The U.S. Senate provided its advice and consent to ratification of New START on December 22, 2010. With the required reductions complete by February 5, 2018, questions about whether the two nations will extend the treaty have begun to dominate public discussions. The Obama Administration briefly considered pursuing an extension of New START before it left office in 2016. Press reports indicate that the President Trump rejected a proposal from Russian President Putin to extend the treaty during their first phone call in February 2017. The Presidents reportedly discussed the treaty during their summit in Helsinki in July 2018, with President Putin presenting President Trump with a document suggesting they extend the treaty after resolving \"existing problems related to the Treaty implementation,\" but the two reportedly did not reach an agreement on the issue. The Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), completed in February 2018, confirmed that the United States would continue to implement the treaty, at least through 2021, but was silent on the prospects for extension through 2026. Trump Administration officials have indicated that they are reviewing the treaty and assessing whether it continues to serve U.S. national security interests before deciding whether the United States would propose or accept a five-year extension. They noted, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May 2019, that an interagency review was continuing, but they refused to elaborate on the substance of that review and speculate on the implications of a decision to allow New START to lapse in 2021. During this hearing, Under Secretary of State Andrea Thompson and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Trachtenberg emphasized that the New START Treaty might not be sufficient to address emerging threats to U.S. national security. They noted that Russia was developing new kinds of strategic offensive arms that would not count under the treaty, that Russia was expanding its stockpile of shorter-range nonstrategic nuclear weapons that were outside the scope of the treaty, and that China was modernizing and expanding its nuclear arsenal but was not a part of the treaty at all. These comments were consistent with press reports indicating that President Trump would like to pursue a new arms control agreement that captured all types of nuclear weapons and included China's forces under the limits. The witnesses were unable, however, to articulate a reason for why China would be willing to participate in such negotiations when its nuclear arsenal of around 300 warheads was far smaller than the arsenals of several thousand warheads held by the United States and Russia. Instead, when asked, Under Secretary Thompson provided a rationale for why the United States would want China to participate in the talks, noting that China wants \"to be a responsible player on the world stage. They want to be part of this great power competition. And with that comes responsibilities.\" Some U.S. officials, including General John Hyten, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), have noted that New START serves U.S. national security interests because its monitoring regime provides transparency and visibility existing into Russian nuclear forces and because its limits provide predictability about the future size and structure of those forces. However, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2019, General Hyten also expressed concern about new kinds of nuclear forces that Russia may develop in the coming years. He noted that these weapons could eventually pose a threat to the United States and said he thought the United States and Russia should expand New START so they would count them under the treaty limits. As is noted below, Article V, paragraph 2 of the treaty provides a mechanism for the parties to address concerns about the emergence of new kinds of strategic offensive arms. It states that the parties should raise their concerns about such weapons in the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) established by the treaty, and seek to reach a resolution there.", "You have demonstrated excellent skills in summarization. Now I would like for you to expand on the original text by elaborating on the \"especially sensitive law enforcement records\" excluded from FOIA. Specifically, can you provide examples of types of records that may qualify as \"especially sensitive law enforcement records\" and why they need to be excluded from FOIA? As the original text mentioned, FOIA provides three records \"exclusions\" that cover certain \"especially sensitive law enforcement records.\" These exclusions may be applied to requested records to protect sensitive law enforcement matters if applicable. However, before discussing the specifics of \"especially sensitive law enforcement records,\" it is important to understand the types of records that this provision covers. The provision in question generally exempts documents involving \"the detection, investigation, or prosecution of violations of any Federal criminal law.\" This provision covers records that meet the following three conditions: \n1. Investigatory records or grand jury records involving a violation of federal criminal law by an individual or organization. \n2. Those records compiled for law enforcement purposes. \n3. Records that can be characterized as belonging to the investigatory process, which can be summarized in the below examples. \n\nExamples of \"investigatory records\" include any information or material gathered through police investigations, wiretaps, informants, surveillance techniques, or undercover operations. These materials fall under this category if they are classified as \"tangible or intangible matter compiled for law enforcement purposes.\" Examples of \"grand jury records\" include transcripts of a grand jury's proceedings, such as minutes, witness testimony, and legal advice. The records also include any information or documents that are necessary for the jury's investigation. It is essential to note that these records do not cover the underlying facts uncovered through the investigation, only the materials that were used to gather the evidence. However, they can be exempted and withheld from the public due to the sensitive nature of their contents. \n\nThese provisions are designed not only to protect law enforcement personnel and the public from potential danger but also to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations and criminal trials. The act ensures that the government can preserve the secrecy of certain records concerning ongoing investigations and the prosecution of criminal cases without jeopardizing either its goals or the rights of individuals subject to its inquiries. The exclusions also have been interpreted to protect information concerning persons other than the immediate suspects in a criminal investigation, as well as to shield the identity of informants or victims whose testimony or cooperation might lead to the prosecution of offenses. \n\nIt is necessary to add that the above exclusions do not apply to documents maintained in automated data banks or computer systems used to process criminal justice information for any law enforcement activity. The law enforcement agency must prove that a disclosure would threaten the life, safety, or security of people if the requested information was made public. This requirement is the primary barrier to applying the \"especially sensitive law enforcement records\" exemption. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that although the three exclusions are similar in nature, they cover different types of information. The \"records compiled for law enforcement purposes\" exclusion covers the entirety of investigatory and law enforcement information. Grand jury records that do not reveal ongoing cases are not protected from disclosure under this exclusion. The \"invasion of personal privacy\" exclusion, as the name suggests, protects personal information obtained by law enforcement agencies. It applies to records that are not relevant to criminal investigations or law enforcement activities, and yet the agency must show that there is an expectation that the subject would be extremely reluctant to provide the information voluntarily. The \"disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" standard applied to each request, meaning that the agency must establish that release would expose information that the subject has attempted to keep confidential and would be especially vulnerable to misuse. \n\nConclusively, the \"especially sensitive law enforcement records\" exclusions provide a vital mechanism to protect public safety, personal safety, and justice systems which must be shielded from any potential damage.", "In October 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative officially notified the Congress, under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), of the Trump Administration's plans to enter into formal trade negotiations with the European Union (EU). This action followed a July 2018 U.S.-EU Joint Statement by President Trump and then-European Commission President Juncker announcing that they would work toward a trade agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, address unfair trading practices, and increase U.S. exports of soybeans and certain other products. Previously, in 2016, U.S.-EU negotiations as part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) stalled after 15 rounds under the Obama Administration. The outlook for new U.S.-EU talks remains uncertain. There continues to be disagreement about the scope of the negotiations, particularly the EU's intent to exclude agriculture from the talks on the basis that it \"is a sensitivity for the EU side.\" EU sensitivities stem in part from commercial and cultural practices that are often embodied in EU laws and regulations and vary from those of the United States. For food and agricultural products, such differences include regulatory and administrative differences between the United States and the EU on issues related to food safety and public health-or Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs). Other differences include product naming schemes for some types of food and agricultural products subject to protections involving Geographical Indications (GIs). Addressing food and agricultural issues in the negotiations remains important to U.S. exporters given the sizable and growing U.S. trade deficit with the EU in agricultural products. Renewed trade talks also come amid heightened U.S.-EU trade frictions. In March 2018, President Trump announced 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs on most U.S. trading partners, including the EU, after a Section 232 investigation determined that these imports threaten U.S. national security. In response, the EU began applying retaliatory tariffs of 25% on certain U.S. exports to the EU. Additionally, as part of the Boeing-Airbus subsidy dispute, in October 2019 the United States began imposing additional, World Trade Organization (WTO)-sanctioned tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of certain U.S. imports from the EU. This report provides an overview of U.S.-EU trade in agriculture and background information on selected U.S.-EU agricultural trade issues concerning a potential trade liberalization agreement between the United States and the EU. Following a review of U.S.-EU agricultural trade trends, this report describes recent agricultural trade trends and tariff actions affecting certain U.S.-EU traded food and agricultural goods. It then describes potential issues in U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations involving food and agricultural trade. Figure 1 shows a timeline of selected events. Figure 1.

Actions related to the U.S.-EU Agricultural Trade Agreement negotiations are shown in red.Note: USTR = U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). WTO = World Trade Organization. EU27 includes the current 27 EU member states, excluding the United Kingdom (UK). EU28 includes the UK. Moving forward, U.S. trade negotiations with the EU are expected to exclude the UK, which may enter into trade discussions with the United States separately. Trade data presented here are compiled from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) trade statistics for \"Agricultural and Related Products.\" As defined by USDA, this product grouping includes agricultural products (including bulk and intermediate products and also consumer-oriented products) and agricultural-related products (including fish and shellfish products, distilled spirits, forest products, and ethanol and biodiesel blends). Additional information on the various data sources is discussed in the t ext box. The United States and the EU are the world's largest trade and investment partners. While food and agricultural trade between the United States and the EU27 accounts for less than 1% of the value of overall trade in total goods and services ( Figure 2 ), the EU27 remains a leading market for U.S. agricultural exports. It accounted for about 8% of the value of all U.S. exports and ranked as the fifth-largest market for U.S. food and farm exports in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094after Canada,", "NIH is the primary federal agency for medical, health, and behavioral research.

Containment and mitigation efforts by federal, state, and local governments have been undertaken to flatten the curve - that is, to curb widespread transmission that could overwhelm the nation's health care system. Federal response efforts have included the enactment of laws to provide authorities and supplemental funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the pandemic. This report focuses on supplemental FY2020 discretionary appropriations provided to programs and activities traditionally funded by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. As of the date of this report, LHHS supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 response have been provided in four separate supplemental appropriations measures: Title III, Division A, of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, enacted on March 6, 2020; Title V, Division A, of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, enacted on March 18, 2020; Title VIII, Division B, of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, enacted on March 27, 2020; and Title I, Division B, of the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, enacted on April 24, 2020. In total, LHHS has received roughly $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from these COVID-19 response measures. These funds are in addition to roughly $195 billion in regular FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations provided in Division A of P.L. 116-94, the FY2020 LHHS omnibus appropriations act which was enacted on December 20, 2019 (henceforth called the omnibus). Overall, the COVID-19 supplemental funds have increased FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations by approximately 143%. The relevant legislative history of each of the four enacted laws containing LHHS supplemental appropriations is detailed below. In the weeks leading up to the supplemental appropriations action in Congress, Alex Azar, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), took administrative steps to allocate existing funding to COVID-19 response efforts. These included issuing a determination on January 25, 2020, allowing the allotment of $105 million from the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF). He also reportedly informed Congress on February 2 that he would potentially exercise his authority to transfer $136 million in existing funds within HHS to increase the budgetary resources of several operating divisions and offices that were tasked with COVID-19 response. In response, the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Nita Lowey, and the Chair of the LHHS Subcommittee, Representative Rosa DeLauro, sent the Secretary a letter expressing concern that budgetary resources available to HHS at that time would not be sufficient. On February 24, 2020, the Trump Administration sent Congress a request for supplemental appropriations of $1.25 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) at HHS. The request letter included a number of other proposals, largely but not exclusively related to re-purposing existing funds toward response efforts. All told, the Administration estimated needing to allocate approximately $2.5 billion toward COVID-19 response efforts. (For the most part, amounts for other LHHS aspects of the request generally were unspecified in the publicly released request letter.) Several days after the Administration's request, the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee introduced H.R. 6074 on March 4, 2020. The measure passed the House that same day by a vote of 415-2, passed the Senate on March 5 by a vote of 96-1, and was signed into law ( P.L. 116-123 ) on March 6. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), P.L. 116-123 provided a total of $7.8 billion in supplemental appropriations in Division A, of which roughly $6.4 billion (about 83%) was for LHHS accounts and activities. (Division B contained authorization provisions related to certain LHHS programs and activities that was also signed into law.)</s> \nHow well do you believe the government has responded to the coronavirus outbreak, given the limited amount of time they had to prepare?</s> \nAs an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions.

The employment-based backlog exists because the annual number of foreign workers whom U.S. employers hire and then sponsor to enter the employment-based immigration pipeline has regularly exceeded the annual statutory allocation of green cards. The Numerical limitations and 7% per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants have created a long, unmanageable queue of prospective immigrants. The queue is particularly acute for Indians, who send large numbers of foreign workers to the United States.

The second Morrill Act, passed in 1890, reinforced the public investment in land-grant universities and prohibited racial discrimination in their admissions policies. Today, the land-grant university system comprises 100 colleges and universities across the country.", "", "Agriculture-based renewable energy can take several forms, including biofuels such as corn-based ethanol or soy-based biodiesel, wind-driven turbines located on farmland or in rural areas, anaerobic digesters that convert animal waste into methane and electric power, or biomass harvested for burning as a processing fuel or to generate heat as part of an industrial activity. Since the late 1970s, U.S. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have adopted a variety of incentives, regulations, and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture-based renewable energy (mostly biofuels). Over the years, the two most widely used biofuels\u00e2\u0080\u0094ethanol produced primarily from corn starch and biodiesel produced primarily from soybean oil\u00e2\u0080\u0094have received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loans and grants, and regulatory programs. Many of these support programs originate in legislation outside of the farm bill. For instance, the Energy Tax Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-618 ) provided an exemption for ethanol from the excise tax on motor fuels. By executive order the Bioenergy Program was established in 1999 and in FY2001 began making payments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to eligible producers of ethanol and biodiesel based on year-to-year production increases in these fuels. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) directed USDA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to cooperate and coordinate research and development activities for biobased industrial products, including biofuels. The 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) authorized several new biofuel programs and added an energy title, Title IX. The 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) subsequently extended and expanded the programs promoting renewable energy, emphasizing particularly those utilizing biomass feedstock. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) extended the programs through FY2018. The 2018 farm bill, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-334 ), continues federal support for the programs through FY2023. Motivations cited for these legislative initiatives include energy security concerns, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and raising domestic demand for U.S.-produced farm products. Congress has enacted temporary tax incentives for biofuels, specifically tax credits for biodiesel and second generation (formerly cellulosic) biofuel and a tax credit for small producers. Some of these temporary tax incentives have been extended numerous times. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123 ) retroactively extended the tax incentive for biodiesel and renewable diesel of $1.00/gallon through the end of 2017. In addition to these types of tax incentives, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a minimum level of renewable fuel usage. Historically, there has been a revenue cost associated with tax incentives for ethanol and biofuels. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) provided a tax credit of $0.45/gallon before it expired at the end of 2011. From FY1980 through FY2013, excise tax credits and incentives for ethanol reduced federal tax revenue by a cumulative estimated total of $46.9 billion. In FY2011, the fiscal year immediately preceding the VEETC's expiration, its cost was an estimated $6.5 billion. Excise tax incentives for biodiesel producers have reduced federal excise tax revenue by an estimated $17.3 billion between FY2008 and FY2018. In FY2018, excise tax receipts were reduced by $3.4 billion due to biodiesel producer credits (the reduction in FY2018 excise tax receipts is associated with tax credit claims made for biodiesel production in calendar year 2017). Title IX of the 2018 farm bill continues long-standing congressional support for the production of renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials. This report focuses on those policies contained in the 2018 farm bill that support agriculture-based renewable energy. The introductory sections of this report briefly describe how USDA bioenergy policies evolved and how they fit into the larger context of U.S. biofuels policy. Then, each of the bioenergy provisions of the 2018 farm bill are defined in terms of their function, goals, administration, funding, and implementation status. In an appendix at the end of this report, Table A-1 presents data on 2018 farm bill bioenergy provisions.", "The writer is skilled in summarizing texts.", ", the Supreme Court has identified a number of anticompetitive practices that harm consumers and undermine competition. These practices include: (1) conduct that prevents entry into a market; (2) conduct that imposes significant barriers to entry that would-be competitors must overcome \"once and for all\"; (3) conduct that allows a firm to charge supra-competitive prices after entry by eliminating all practical competition; (4) conduct that reduces competition in a market when it can and would be natural for there to be competition (\"predatory pricing\"); (5) exclusive supply contracts that foreclose competition in a broader market; (6) exclusive dealing contracts that prevent competitors from selling products of their own devising; (7) attempts to monopolize through \"tie in\" sales and other forms of exclusive dealing; and (8) exclusive dealing with one's self. In assessing whether a given practice is anticompetitive and violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court generally looks at the conduct in the context of its industry. As applied to digital markets, these practices can be used to assess antitrust liability related to Big Tech. However, digital markets raise some distinctive issues in this regard, which are discussed throughout the report. In addition to the general principles of monopolization case law, the contemporary antitrust laws treat anticompetitive mergers as a distinct violation of the antitrust laws. This treatment is rooted in the belief that mergers eliminate competition and thereby harm consumers. Mergers that involve high levels of market share concentration can lead, over time, to market dominance, which in turn can be used to exploit consumers through the exercise of market power. The Supreme Court first recognized that mergers could be anticompetitive in 1972. Since that date, it has consistently upheld the principle that certain mergers may be anticompetitive and thus violate antitrust law. Mergers that meet certain conditions are presumptively anticompetitive. Specifically, mergers between two top competitors in a market are presumptively anticompetitive. A merger between a small but rising competitor and the dominant incumbent might have anticompetitive effects, as well. In general, the anticompetitive harms that result from these mergers are the same as those that arise from monopolization or other exclusionary conduct. Moreover, the presumptions that apply to these mergers are only general guides, and all mer\nYour answer for this discussion consists of three parts.

This period of 10 session days serves as a \"cooling off\" period intended to allow Members to examine a nomination before it moves to the full Senate. In some cases, Senators may wish to refer a nomination to its committee of jurisdiction for further deliberation before consenting to it. S.Res. 116 allows a Senator the opportunity to do so within this 10-day window. Section 1(d) of S.Res. 116 states that \"any Senator, on presentation of a privileged nomination, may request that the nomination be referred to its committee of jurisdiction in the next Congress.\" In practical terms, what this means is that a Senator can inform the Chair of the relevant committee that he or she would like the nomination referred to the committee the next time it convenes. The \"Privileged Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar (which tracks how long a nomination stays in this special category before moving to the regular \"Nominations\" section) clearly marks any nomination that has been referred to its committee of jurisdiction. Any Senator can view this information online through the Legislative Branch's publicly accessible website.

The current Senate's \"Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar includes a page marked \"Next Calendar\" (Appendix ) that serves to inform any Senator interested in a nomination in the Privileged Nominations section that this is his or her opportunity to make a referral. This calendar lists the positions for which nominations have been referred, the current status of the nominations (whether the referral has been made or if a referral is still pending), the date by which the Senator must act to make the referral, and other related information. The \"Committee Information\" field lists the referring Senator's party. If a nomination has been referred, this field denotes \"R\" (for \"Republican\"). When a nomination has not been referred, the field denotes \"N/A\" (\"Not Applicable\"). By convention, the majority leader sends a notification to the Office of the Executive Clerk every Monday that includes a list of any positions in the \"Privileged Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar that Members wish to refer to their committees. However, Members may make a referral to their committees at any time, and the majority leader's correspondence with the Executive Clerk serves only as informal notice to the Executive Clerk of that Monday's planned actions. In practice, few referrals of this sort seem made when the majority leader's communication circulates. A request for the referral of a privileged nomination must come from the Senator that sponsored the successful legislative vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0094the bill or resolution\u00e2\u0080\u0094that granted the privilege to the position in question. In the case of positions added via S.Res. 116, the request must come from the Senator that sponsored that resolution. This means that the sponsor of a nomination is the only Senator that can request the nomination be referred to its committee of jurisdiction. Thus, once a nomination arrives in the Executive Calendar, the Office of the Majority Leader sends the Senator that sponsored the original bill granting the privilege a notice of the new arrival, so that the Senator may take any action he or she deems necessary, including asking that the nomination be referred to its committee of jurisdiction. Any Senator may view referral requests online through the Legislative Branch's public website. If a sponsored-Senate-privileged nomination is referred to its committee of jurisdiction, the Executive Clerk sends a notice to the Office of the Majority Leader and the nominee, noting the new status for the nomination. There is no additional vote to enact the referral, it simply requires the submission of a brief notification form from the sponsor Senator. Similarly, any Senator that sponsored legislation granting a privilege may write a letter to the Executive Clerk indicating a nomination should be referred to committee, and the Clerk's office will send notices to the Executive Calendar and the sponsor Senator that this referral has occurred. It is common for a request for the referral of a privileged nomination to be made by the sponsor Senator's office staff, and not the sponsor Senator herself. Though Senators may refer nominations to their committee of jurisdiction without prior notification, a courtesy request is usually made to the sponsor Senator", "This report focuses on selected ground electronic warfare (EW) systems.

The Army Modernization Plan outlines the Army's plan to modernize the force, including its modernization priorities, technology strategy, and associated force structure initiatives. Elements included in previous reports that are key to the Army's transformation include developing long-range, multi-domain capabilities, building a networked force, and fostering technological superiority. The Army is also focused on developing new capabilities and equipment to meet the threats posed by China and Russia. This report examines the status of the Army's modernization plan, focusing attention on the development of the Army's multi-domain capabilities, network, and long-range capabilities. Are the modernization priorities laid out in the 2019 Army Modernization Plan achieving their desired outcomes, including those intended to build upon last year's Army Modernization report priorities? (2) Are the Army's funding priorities in accordance with the Modernization Plan? The Army's funding priorities are examined, focusing on how Congress may allocate funding for the Army's modernization efforts. The Army's modernization requests continue to exceed the Army's programmed budget, and Congress has been forced to address gaps created by the Army's plan. These discussions may be informed by the Army's 2019 Modernization Strategy, intended to guide Army modernization efforts through at least 2035, and its funding goals. Is there Congressional oversight coordination? With the Army's 2019 Modernization Strategy, intended to guide Army modernization efforts through at least 2035, the Army is requesting significant funding, and conducting operations in a wide number of Congressional jurisdictions, and the need for oversight coordination may be paramount. What steps will Congress take to ensure oversight over the Army's modernization priorities? It is necessary to examine how Congress can monitor progress of the Army's modernization efforts, including monitoring the effectiveness of the Army's modernization strategy. In this regard, it may be useful to coordinate oversight of each phase of the modernization effort. Congressional oversight of modernization efforts may also help to ensure that taxpayers get the best bang for their buck while supporting the men and women who defend our nation. (3) Is there sufficient DoD-Army-congressional coordination of modernization efforts? While significant strides have been made in coordinating modernization efforts within DOD since the 2018 NDAA, the Army has identified a number of challenges and obstacles that may hamper coordination of future DoD-Army-Congressional efforts. Many of these problems are rooted in the bureaucratic structures of the department and service, and will require a sustained focus on improving the coordination process. The Army will face enormous challenges in executing its modernization strategy, particularly with current budget caps and other fiscal constraints. The potential threat posed by China and Russia, coupled with the need to maintain readiness, and the fact that the Army is a global force, all contribute to the magnitude of the Army's challenge. Congress is in a unique position to support the Army's modernization efforts and the men and women of the Army as they implement their strategy.", "OPIOID AND DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS 2018 & 2017 OPIOID DEATHS NATIONAL OVERDOSE OVERDOSE POPULATION DEATH RATE DEATH RATE TOTAL DEATH DEATH DEATH TO RATE/DEATH TO DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH 100K\n1.

Garfield by disgruntled job seeker Charles Guiteau, the Pendleton Act was signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur to ensure that \"government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\" The Pendleton Act ended the spoils system to ensure that qualified individuals were hired into federal service and to prevent the President from being \"hounded by job seekers.\" With the advent of the merit system, federal employees found themselves serving longer in government while also being attracted to private-sector jobs related to their federal employment. The movement of employees between the private sector and government is often referred to as the revolving door. Generally, the revolving door is described as the movement of individuals between the public and private sector, and vice versa. Individuals may move because they possess policy and procedural knowledge and have relationships with former colleagues that are useful to prospective employers, either in government or in the private sector. Some observers see the revolving door as potentially valuable to both private-sector firms and the government; other observers believe that employees leaving government to join the industries they were regulating, or leaving the private sector to join a relevant government agency, could provide an unfair representational advantage and create the potential for conflicts of interest. While Congress has passed laws regulating the revolving door phenomenon in the executive branch, there has to date been little data available about the underlying phenomenon. This report provides data on the movement into and out of government by executive branch personnel in President George W. Bush's and President Barack Obama's Administrations. Using a dataset of executive branch Cabinet department officials compiled by graduate students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University in partnership with CRS, this report provides empirical data about the use of the revolving door by a subset of federal officials, with a particular focus on those who were registered lobbyists either before or after their government service. This report begins with an overview of existing revolving door laws and regulations that affect executive branch personnel. It next examines the potential advantages and disadvantages of the revolving door phenomenon. Data collected in partnership with the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University are then presented and analyzed. The data provide an empirical picture of the executive branch revolving door as it relates to registered lobbyists. This analysis is followed by a discussion of select issues for potential congressional consideration. Revolving door provisions, which can include laws, regulations, and executive orders, are often considered as a subset of conflict-of-interest provisions that govern the interaction of government and nongovernmental individuals. While most historic revolving door provisions generally addressed individuals exiting government for work in the private sector, some have also addressed individuals entering government. Overall, revolving door conflict-of-interest laws have existed since the late 19 th century. The first identified conflict-of-interest provision was enacted in 1872. This provision generally prohibited a federal employee from dealing with matters in which they were involved prior to government service. In 1919, the first restrictions were placed on individuals who had specifically served as procurement officials from leaving government service \"to solicit employment in the presentation or to aid or assist for compensation in the prosecution of claims against the United States arising out of any contracts or agreements for the procurement of supplies \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which were pending or entered into while the said officer or employee was associated therewith.\" Similarly, the Contract Settlement Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 649) included a provision making it Unlawful for any person employed in any Government agency \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 during the period such person is engaged in any Government agency \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to prosecute or to act as counsel attorney or agent for prosecuting, any claim against the United States, or for any such person within two years after the time when such employment or serve has ceased, to prosecute, or to act as counsel, attorney, or agent for prosecuting, any claim against the United States involving any subject matter directly connected with which such person was so employed or performed duty. In 1962, portions of the current statutory provision at 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7207 were enacted as part of a major revision of federal conflict-of-interest laws. Since the 1960s, postemployment restriction laws have been amended several times, including by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to add certain one-year \"cooling off\" periods for high-level executive branch personnel and limit executive branch official postemployment advocacy (i.e., lobbying) activities; by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989; and by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which extended the \"cooling off\" period to two years for \"very senior\" executive branch officials. Overall, revolving door provisions, including conflict-of-interest laws and \"cooling off\" periods, were initially designed to protect government integrity by preventing individuals with influence over the government from leveraging their government service for private gain", "You have summarized several texts.", "In 2018, 28.3 out of 100,000...", "This page is a summary of the text above.

Compared to their counterparts in the general population, these youth fare poorly in education, employment, and other outcomes. The federal government recognizes that foster youth may ultimately return to the care of the state as adults through the public welfare, criminal justice, or other systems. In response, federal policy has focused on supporting youth while they are in foster care and in early adulthood. This report provides background to Congress on teens and young adults in and exiting from foster care, and the federal support available to them. It begins with a discussion of the characteristics of youth who have had contact with the child welfare system, including those who entered care and those who exited care via \"emancipation.\" This process means that youth reached the state legal age of adulthood without being reunified with their families or placed in new permanent families. The report then discusses child welfare programs authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act\u2014specifically the Foster Care Maintenance Payments Program (\"foster care program\") and the John H. Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (\"Chafee program\")\u2014that are intended to help prepare youth for adulthood. The foster care program provides reimbursement to states for providing foster care, including, at state option, to youth between the ages of 18 and 21. It also includes certain requirements that are intended to support older youth in care. The Chafee program is the primary federal program that funds supportive services for teens and young adults during the transition from foster care. The text box below summarizes recent developments in the Chafee program. Appendix A includes funding data for the Chafee program. Appendix B includes a summary of other federal programs, outside of child welfare law, that address older youth in foster care and those who have aged out. Children and adolescents can come to the attention of state child welfare systems due to abuse, neglect, or other reasons such as the death of a parent or child behavioral problems. Some children remain in their own homes and receive family support services, while others are placed in out-of-home settings. Such settings usually include a foster home, the home of a relative, or group care (i.e., non-family settings ranging from those that provide specialized treatment or other services to more general care settings or shelters). A significant number of youth spend at least some time in foster care during their teenage years. They may stay in care beyond age 18, typically up to age 21, if they are in a state that extends foster care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which administers child welfare funding, collects data from states on the number and characteristics of children in foster care. On the last day of FY2017, approximately 122,000 youth ages 13 through 20 comprised 27% of the national foster care caseload. Youth ages 13 through 20 made up 28% of the exits from foster care in FY2017. Most of these youth were reunified with their parents or primary caretakers, adopted, or placed with relatives. However, 19,945 youth aged out that year, or were \"emancipated\" because they reached the legal age of adulthood in their states, usually at age 18. Youth who spend their teenage years in foster care and those who age out of care face challenges as they move to early adulthood. While in care, they may miss opportunities to develop strong support networks and independent living skills that their counterparts in the general population might more naturally acquire. Even older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians can still face obstacles, such as poor family dynamics or a lack of emotional and financial support, that hinder their ability to achieve their goals as young adults. These difficulties are evidenced by the fact that youth who have spent at least some years in care during adolescence exhibit relatively poor outcomes across a number of domains. Two studies\u2014the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study and the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth\u2014have tracked these outcomes.

April 3, 2014. 6 R40139.pdf The Chafee program provides federal assistance to states to improve the educational and employment outcomes of youth who have been in foster care. Among other activities, Chafee funds are used to: \u00b7 provide case management services; \u00b7 provide education and training vouchers; \u00b7 assist youth in applying for federal financial aid; \u00b7 fund independent living skills assessments and development; \u00b7 encourage financial literacy activities; and \u00b7 provide independent living skill grants. Recent congressional proposals would have sought to expand the definition of an eligible youth for the Chafee program to include individuals who were in foster care on their 18th birthday and certain youth who were emancipated as minors but are later reunited with their biological parents.

May not be reproduced on other websites without permission from Politico.\nVisit the website at Politico\nThe bill before Congress to prohibit social media companies from suspending or blocking users\u2019 accounts\nby\nMarc A. Thiessen\n/ Dec. 10, 2021\nWhat did Donald Trump do to cause his suspension from\nsocial media platforms?\nHe did what many believe was his greatest\naccomplishment as president: he won the White House.\nTherein lies the problem. For many on the left, Trump\u2019s\nvictory was not legitimate, but rather the result of foreign interference. His\nelection, the left and most of our news media decided, was illegitimate, so he\ndidn\u2019t actually win the election, was not an elected president and was not in compliance\nwith the demands of the Constitution.\nAfter his victory, therefore, he had no right to sit in the president\u2019s chair and no right to engage in the exercise of executive power via his Twitter account. He was an illegal president who was engaged in an illegitimate exercise of power, so any action taken to curb his Twitter power was justified.\nThat was the first step down the slippery slope that ended with Twitter\u2019s suspension of Trump\u2019s account. Since Trump took office, Twitter has consistently suspended or \u201cunverified\u201d his account, including on the night of Jan. 6, 2021, after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent riot he disavowed. But the real reason Twitter took these actions wasn\u2019t because Trump was a danger to public safety\u2014many people on [insert twitter-name-here] post violent threats all the time and nothing seems to happen to their accounts\u2014but because he was a danger to Twitter\u2019s business interests.\n\u201cEvery time Trump got off a tweet, our stock price went through the roof,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive officer. But when Trump got on Trump\u2019s account, Twitter\u2019s stock price plummeted. \u201cWe have a revenue model that\u2019s very simple. We have no control over our revenue if we\u2019re not in this marketplace and open to conversation with people. If our services are perceived as not trusted or safe, that has an impact on people\u2019s willingness to use it.\u201d\nTwitter is not Trump\u2019s only problem on social media. He\u2019s also been suspended by Facebook (albeit temporarily) for violating its policies against glorifying violence. Yet the reason he remains a problem for Big Tech goes beyond Trump\u2019s words. It goes to a deeper fear of conservatives and others whom the Left seeks to silence.\nTwitter isn\u2019t just a private company, it\u2019s the de facto town square\u2014or town mall\u2014of 21st-century America. In 1905, the Supreme Court held that a state could not bar a socialist newspaper publisher from disseminating his ideas in a privately owned shopping concourse, a \u201cpublic forum\u201d for civic life. Similarly, Facebook is not \u201cjust another website\u201d but rather an \u201cinvaluable means of communication and cultural integration.\u201d Twitter plays a similar role in our digital age, as do TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest. The courts may not view these platforms as the successors to the town square, but the American people do\u2014just listen to Trump\u2019s Twitter account..\nAnd it\u2019s not just Republicans. According to a recent survey by the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Center, 63% of Republican users and 70% of Democratic users\u2014and 73% of voters overall\u2014believe that social media companies regularly censor conservative viewpoints.\nThis isn\u2019t just a political issue; it\u2019s a threat to the basic principles of freedom and democracy.

The flag code also specifies how to deliver the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and appropriate conduct while watching a performance of the National Anthem. Most of the flag code contains no explicit enforcement mechanisms, and relevant case law would suggest that provisions without enforcement mechanisms are declaratory and advisory only. Efforts by states to punish either verbal flag disparagement or disrespectful flag display (\"flag-misuse laws\") have been struck down under First Amendment free speech precepts that apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal law and many state laws also provide penalties for physical mistreatment of the flag (\"flag-desecration\" laws), although application of these laws would generally violate the U.S. Constitution. For instance, the federal Flag Protection Act, which criminalizes flag desecration, was struck down on First Amendment free speech grounds as prohibiting symbolic speech. Some federal and state flag-misuse laws also prohibit placing advertising images on the U.S. flag or displaying the U.S. flag on merchandise; these laws may also be vulnerable to free speech challenges, although the Supreme Court has reserved this question.

The following report examines the evolution of Senate impeachment rules and practices, paying particular attention to the rules and precedents of the Johnson trial. The intent of this report is not to discuss possible grounds for impeachment or other Constitutional or legal issues, but rather to provide information regarding potential impeachment trial process issues, such as the number and timing of witnesses, the role of a Committee, and the possibility of an early motion to dismiss. 3................................................................................. JUDGE ANDREW JOHNSON: PRESIDENT TO IMPEACHED SENATOR In January 1868, following the end of the Civil War the House of Representatives impeached President Andrew Johnson. The charges of impeachment claimed that the President acted \"in a high and contemptuous manner in violation of the Tenure of Office Act\" passed in March, 1867.4 The Act aimed to \"secure independent action\" of a President in the removal, resignation or vacation of office, and limited the right of the President to remove or suspend executive officers serving their term of office and those appointed by presidential appointment.5 The Act explicitly provided that the President had full and exclusive power \"to appoint all necessary officers\u00e2\u0080\u0093and the same shall be considered impeachable.\"6 However, in December 1867, Johnson opposed the renewal of Secretary Stanton's military post, and his refusal to replace him eventually resulted in the passage of the Tenure of Office Act. The following year, Johnson impeached the Secretary. The President's impeachment followed shortly thereafter. 7 Senator Ben Wade served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and in his stead, the Senate chose Senator Edmund G. Ross as the President's trial judge and Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (former Secretary of the Treasury to President Abraham Lincoln) served as President of the Tribunal. 8 In addition to serving as the Vice President, Wade was a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, President of the Senate, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a practicing attorney. Wade was the primary defender of Johnson's position as President of America and argued that the President did not commit an impeachable offense as defined under the Constitution, 9 specifically stating he believed the President \"has shown a desire that his Secretary of War be appointed according to the law; and that when congress refuses to accede to that desire, he takes such lawful steps as were open to him to prevent that appointment taking place. He may have overstepped the line, I will not deny, but his action has not been in violation of the Constitution.\"10 The President's attorneys argued Johnson acted accordingly to the rule of the Constitution as his conduct was protected by the doctrine of separation of powers. 11............................................................................................. THE PROCESS OF IMPEACHMENT: PROCEEDINGS OF BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS The impeachment process began in the House of Representatives on February 24th 1868, with one resolution introduced accusing Johnson of violating the Tenure of Office Act.12 The House Judiciary Committee was charged with the duty of determining whether the President had committed an impeachable offense. After conducting a six-day hearing, the House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment. 13 The first stated Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 by removing Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War.14 The second stated Johnson attempted to prevent the appointment of General George Brinton McClellan as War Secretary, a position he was nominated for in 1868, in retaliation for General McClellan's work as the chairman of the Democratic National Convention during the President's election campaign.15 After the House Judiciary Committee approved the articles of impeachment on March 3rd 1868, the House concurred.16 The process of impeaching officials began in the House of Representatives. The House Judiciary Committee considered if the President had committed an impeachable offense. The House of Representative then voted to impeach or reject impeachment. If the House decided to impeach, the Senate then considered the impeachment resolution and tried the impeached official. An individual could be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" In the United States, impeachment is not a criminal proceeding, yet it is a form of action in which the House of Representatives votes whether it believes the President should be removed from office. If the House of Representatives votes \"yes,\" the process continues. If the House votes \"no,\" the process is over.............................................................................................. THE SENATE TRIAL PROCESS: PROCEEDINGS AND PRESIDING OFFICERS On May 13th,", "T he Agriculture appropriations bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094formally called the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u00e2\u0080\u0094funds all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service. For FY2020, the House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 3164 on June 6, 2019 (including H.Rept. 116-107 ). Funding for USDA was included in a five-bill minibus appropriations bill ( H.R. 3055 ) that passed the House on June 25, 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2522 on September 19, 2019 (including S.Rept. 116-110 ). The full Senate did not act on this bill by October 1, 2019, so FY2020 began without a full-year appropriation. To avoid a lapse in funding, Congress and the President approved two consecutive continuing resolutions to fund federal agencies at the FY2019 level ( P.L. 116-59 and P.L. 116-69, respectively). The Senate passed a four-bill minibus appropriations bill ( H.R. 3055 ) on October 31, 2019, setting up negotiations with the House for a final bill. On December 20, 2019, Congress passed and the President signed the FY2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 116-94 ), which includes agriculture and related agencies under Division B. This report provides a brief overview of the conservation-related provisions in the FY2020 Agriculture appropriations acts. For a general analysis of the FY2020 appropriations for agriculture, see CRS Report R45974, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2020 Appropriations. USDA administers a number of agricultural conservation programs that assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These include working lands programs, land retirement and easement programs, watershed programs, technical assistance, and other programs. The two lead agricultural conservation agencies within USDA are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical assistance and administers most conservation programs, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which administers the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Most conservation program funding is mandatory, obtained through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and authorized in omnibus farm bills (about $6.4 billion of CCC budget authority for conservation in FY2020). The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill; P.L. 115-334 ) reauthorized most mandatory conservation programs through FY2023. Other conservation programs\u2014mostly providing technical assistance\u2014operate with discretionary funding provided in annual appropriations (about $1 billion annually). The FY2020 appropriation included an increase from FY2019 levels for discretionary conservation programs. The Administration's FY2020 request proposed a decrease for discretionary conservation funding from the FY2019 enacted levels and reductions in funding for mandatory conservation programs. The FY2020 appropriation does not generally include these proposed reductions and would continue to redirect some conservation funding to the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center. NRCS administers all discretionary conservation programs. The largest program and the account that funds most NRCS activities is Conservation Operations (CO). The CO account primarily funds Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), which provides conservation planning and implementation assistance from field staff placed in almost all counties within the United States and its territories. Other components of CO include the Soil Survey, Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers ( Figure 1 ). Technical assistance for conservation is currently funded through both mandatory and discretionary sources, with CO being the primary account receiving discretionary funding from annual appropriations. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget requested $755.0 million for CO, $64.5 million less than the amount enacted for FY2019, in part due to a proposed consolidation of mandatory and discretionary accounts to pay for conservation technical assistance. USDA has proposed consolidating funding through multiple Administrations, but Congress has never adopted this approach (see \" Funding for Technical Assistance \" section below). The FY2020 appropriation increases CO funding in FY2020 by $10.1 million from FY2019 and directs CO funding for a number of conservation programs ( Table 1 ). Report language further directs funding to selected activities ( Table 4 ). NRCS is the current federal provider of technical assistance for agriculture conservation. NRCS provides technical assistance at the request of the landowner to conserve and improve natural resources. The assistance includes technical expertise combined with knowledge of local conditions and is provided through a network of federal employees called conservationists who deliver technical and financial assistance to farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to implement conservation practices in the field.

Specifically, the following changes have been made:\n\n1. Higher loan limits - Prior to the 111th Congress, the loan limit for the 504/CDC program was set at $1.5 million. In 2010, the Small Business Jobs Act increased the limit to $5.5 million.\n\n2. More businesses are eligible - The 2010 law also expanded the eligibility requirements to allow more businesses to qualify for the loan, including those in rural areas.\n\n3. Increased loan amounts for energy-related projects - P.L. 111-240 also increased the loan limit to $5.5 million for small businesses involved in energy-related projects.\n\n4. Loan refinancing - During the financial crisis following the housing market crash, the 504/CDC program allowed businesses to refinance existing debt through 504/CDC loans.\n\n5. SBA fee reductions - During the financial crisis, the SBA temporarily reduced fees for 504/CDC loans in 2009 and 2010.\n\n6. Increased guarantees - To help struggling small businesses weather the crisis, the SBA temporarily increased the 504/CDC loan guarantee percentage from 50% to 90%.\n\n7. Loan repayment flexibility - To help businesses weather the pandemic, the Biden administration extended certain loan repayment options for 504/CDC loans. \n\nOverall, the changes and expansions to the 504/CDC program in recent years have been designed to increase small businesses' access to capital and credit, particularly during difficult economic times.", "Hypersonic cruise missiles are powered by high-speed air-breathing engines.

The President delegates their authority to the heads of agencies. Then, agencies issue regulations through the administrative agencies to implement statutes.

Of the EPA provisions related to drinking water, Title LXXIII, Subtitle A, directs EPA to require public water systems to conduct additional monitoring for PFAS and establishes a grant program for public water systems to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants. On January 10, 2020, the House passed H.R. 535, a broad PFAS bill that would direct EPA and other federal agencies to take numerous actions to address PFAS. Among its provisions, H.R. 535 would amend SDWA to direct EPA to regulate PFAS in drinking water and would authorize grants for communities for treatment technologies. Other bills would variously direct EPA to take regulatory and other actions under several environmental statutes, including SDWA. Similar to H.R. 535, multiple SDWA bills would require EPA to establish final or interim drinking water regulations for some or all PFAS, require monitoring for more of these substances, or authorize grants to assist communities in treating PFAS in drinking water.

While HHS is primarily focused on health and human services programs, the budget for FY2020 would also focus on research related to these fields. The budget would be slightly higher than the previous year, which would lead HHS to account for over 25% of federal outlays. The two leading sources of expenditures would be mandatory spending, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, which would account for 86% of all estimated HHS spending.", "The text discusses background information and potential issues for the Congress regarding the Navy's FFG(X) program. It focuses on the FFG(X) program and outlines its purpose, the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget, shipbuilding programs, and potential oversight issues for Congress to deal with. The text explores the possible impact on Congress's decisions on the program, naval capabilities and funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Related programs under the Navy shipbuilding program are addressed in a related report.\nWhy hasn't the FFG(X) program been implemented?\nThere could be several reasons why the FFG(X) program has not been implemented yet. One possible reason could be budget constraints or shifting priorities in the Navy's shipbuilding plans. Another reason could be ongoing development and testing of the weapon and sensor systems that will be integrated onto the FFG(X) and the need to refine the design. Additionally, it could be that the FFG(X) design and shipyard facilities are still in the planning phase, needing further testing and resources before moving into full production.", "The House of Representatives rules for bills and resolutions are governed by a standing House Rule, XV. Suspension motions govern the procedure for considering non-privileged measures under a special order of business. Most of the bills are called up and considered under suspension of the rules, even if they have to be reported first, by unanimous consent or some other means. When considering such a motion, the House is voting on the two questions simultaneously. The measure considered under the suspension procedure is not subject to floor amendment. A motion to suspend and pass the measure may provide for passage of the measure in an amended form. There are no separate votes on the floor approving such amendments. The suspension motions are \"debatable for 40 minutes, one-half in favor of the motion and one-half in opposition thereto.\" Once debate has concluded, a vote is called on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure. The motion requires approval by two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present. Should the vote fall short of the two-thirds required, the measure is not permanently rejected.", "Robocalls, also known as \"Voice Broadcasting\", are the top complaint received by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and a consistent congressional concern. A robocall, also known as \"voice broadcasting,\" is any telephone call that delivers a pre-recorded message using an automatic (computerized) telephone dialing system, more commonly referred to as an automatic dialer or \"autodialer.\" The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) regulates robocalls. Legal robocalls are used by legitimate call originators for political, public service, and emergency messages, which are legal. Other legitimate uses can be, for example, to announce school closures or to remind consumers of medical appointments. Illegal robocalls are usually associated with fraudulent telemarketing campaigns, but an illegal robocall under the TCPA does not necessarily mean that the robocall is fraudulent. Illegal, fraudulent calls usually include misleading or inaccurate Caller ID information to disguise the identity of the calling party and trick called parties, which is called \"spoofing.\" Scammers sometimes use \"neighbor spoofing\" so it will appear that an incoming call is coming from a local number. They may also spoof a number from a legitimate company or a government agency that consumers know and trust. Like robocalls more generally, spoofing can also be used for legitimate purposes, such as to hide the number of a domestic violence shelter or an individual employee extension at a business or government agency. This report addresses robocalls that are both illegal under the TCPA as well as intended to defraud, not robocalls that are defined only as illegal. The number of robocalls continues to grow in the United States, and the figures tend to fluctuate based on the introduction of new government and industry attempts to stop them and robocallers' changing tactics to thwart those attempts (see Figure 1 ). In 2019, U.S. consumers received 58.5 billion robocalls, an increase of 22% from the 47.8 billion received in 2018, according to the YouMail Robocall Index. In 2016, the full first year the Robocall Index was tabulated, that figure was 29.1 billion calls\u00e2\u0080\u0094half the number of calls in 2019. Further, the FCC states that robocalls make up its biggest consumer complaint category, with over 200,000 complaints each year\u00e2\u0080\u0094around 60% of all the complaints it receives. Over the past three years, the FCC has pursued a multi-part strategy for combatting spoofed robocalls. The agency has issued hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for violations of its Truth in Caller ID rules; expanded its rules to reach foreign calls and text messages; enabled voice service providers to block certain clearly unlawful calls before they reach consumers' phones; clarified that voice service providers may offer call-blocking services by default; and called on the industry to \"trace back\" illegal spoofed calls and text messages to their original sources. The FCC estimates that eliminating illegal scam robocalls would provide a public benefit of $3 billion annually. A survey by Truecaller, a company that tracks and blocks robocalls, puts that figure as high as $10.5 billion. The Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED Act) empowered the FCC to take specific actions to fight illegal robocalls; it was signed into law on December 30, 2019 ( P.L. 116-105 ). The law requires the FCC to administer a forfeiture penalty for violations (with or without intent) of the prohibition on certain robocalls; promulgate rules establishing when a provider may block a voice call based on information provided by the call authentication framework, called Secure Telephony Identity Revisited (STIR) and Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN) (together known as \"STIR/SHAKEN\"), and establish a process to permit a calling party adversely affected by the framework to verify the authenticity of its calls; initiate a rulemaking to help protect subscribers from receiving unwanted calls or texts from a caller using an unauthenticated number; assemble, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, an interagency working group to study and report to Congress on the enforcement of the prohibition of certain robocalls; and initiate a proceeding to determine whether its policies regarding access to number resources could be modified to help reduce access to numbers by potential robocall violators. STIR/SHAKEN is seen by many, including the FCC, as a particularly important part of achieving the projected cost savings associated with eliminating illegal robocalls. STIR/SHAKEN must be implemented by June 30, 2021.", "The text gives an overview of the impact and the efforts of demining UXO in Southeast Asia.

The following day, the Senate adopted a similar motion to accept the House motion to pass its bill with House amendments by voice vote. On September 27, 2019, the bill was transmitted to the President for his signature. The President is expected to sign it into law; if signed, it will become P.L. 116-93. DOD Appropriation Authorization. The annual defense appropriations bill provides the funding authority to pay for the discretionary costs of Department of Defense (DOD) programs that Congress authorizes over a multiyear period. These programs are authorized by various titles of U.S. Code and include the procurement, research and development, and other investments necessary to field the nation's military forces and to sustain them in combat. The costs for military pay and retirement of members of the armed forces and their families are authorized in the permanent (title 37, U.S. Code) rather than the discretionary appropriations legislation. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act covers a broad array of defense programs. These include programs directly related to the military operations of the branches of the armed forces and to the support services that provide a professional work force and infrastructure for those operations. The bill funds about $250 billion for those operations, including military personnel and family housing, overseas base operations, and other OCO-related programs. In addition, the bill provides more than $400 billion for other defense-related activities, including the purchase of equipment and other items and the investment in facilities and infrastructure. Defense personnel represent the largest component of DOD's budget request for FY2020, at about $168 billion. The bill provides $145.5 billion to fund military personnel accounts, including military pay and benefits, as well as retirement funds. The bill provides $73 billion for military family housing. The bill provides $12 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts. These funds have been provided in each year since FY2009, even though the conflicts in southwest Asia and elsewhere have ended. The bill provides $6.8 billion for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the Defense Health Program. Other operations and maintenance programs funded in the bill include sustainment of ships, aircraft, vehicles, and other equipment used by the Navy, Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps. The bill provides $11 billion to fund Air Force and Navy aircraft procurement programs and $10 billion to fund Navy shipbuilding programs, according to DOD's budget request. In addition, it provides a total of more than $100 billion for other procurement programs of DOD (e.g., ground vehicle programs). The bill provides about $7 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) of DOD weapons, communications, and sensor systems. The bill provides just over $150 billion for operations and maintenance programs that support the deployment and combat readiness of the military forces. This includes activities such as the training of these forces, as well as the supplies and operating costs of the bases and installations that provide the infrastructure and administrative support for these operations. The bill provides about $7 billion for maintenance and repair of DoD facilities. The bill provides more than $22 billion for housing for service members and their families. The bill provides $35 billion for military health care programs including dental care, medical research, and procurement of medical equipment and supplies. The bill provides $11 billion to pay for travel expenses of military personnel, including $2 billion for home leave travel and $1.8 billion for transportation of wounded or ill military personnel. The bill provides $65 billion for military retirement benefit accounts. The bill provides $9.2 billion for various family programs offered by each of the armed services. These include such services as child care, education, and counseling. The bill provides more than $9 billion under a new account, \"Defense Education Activity,\" which is intended to provide more flexibility for the services to implement DOD's new policy on free tuition for college education to service members' family members. The bill provides $30 billion for family housing construction projects. The bill provides $2 billion for military service members' housing allowances. More than $12 billion is provided for operating expenses associated with the maintenance of these properties, $11.7 billion to sustain existing facilities, $2 billion for environmental compliance and restoration projects, and $4 billion for a", "It is possible to have a summary of the text above with 100 or fewer words. \nPlease type a summary of 100 words or fewer for the text mentioned above.", "PRESIDENTIAL EMOLUMENTS BY KEITH BOWMAN KEITH W.

UMRA covers those that impose requirements on state, local, or tribal governments or on the private sector (intergovernmental mandates) that are not accompanied by federal funding to defray their implementation costs. UMRA requires estimates of costs associated with such mandates (estimates termed \"mandate costs\") from Congress and affected agencies. If a bill or regulation that imposes unfunded intergovernmental mandates proceeds to a floor vote in Congress, there exists a point of order prohibiting consideration of the bill or resolution that imposes such mandates. UMRA requires estimates of costs associated with the affected legislation and regulation, and this summary text provides information on such estimates and the potential costs and requirements associated with unfunded mandates.", "In a summary of a text discussing critical infrastructure (CI), you are told that it focuses on machinery, facilities, and information that enable vital functions of governance, public health, and the economy.

These agreements are considered stage one of a broader trade liberalization negotiation, and Congress and other stakeholders will be monitoring their impact moving forward, and also the potential impact of future trade talks between the U.S. and Japan.", "The official poverty measure in the United States is the poverty thresholds developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. This measure is based on the income of a reference family type, which corresponds to a certain number of people, and it varies depending on the ages of the family members and whether the family includes dependent children. These poverty thresholds are adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index. The poverty threshold is a threshold value used in determining the level of poverty. The official measure is calculated by determining the family's total income before taxes and then comparing that with the poverty threshold value that corresponds to the size of the family. Individuals living alone have a different poverty threshold than married couples, and so on. As a result, the poverty threshold varies for different-size families. According to the poverty measurement, approximately 39.6 million people in the United States were living below the poverty line in 2017. However, the poverty rate (the proportion of the population under the poverty line) decreased from 12.3% in 2017 to 11.8% in 2018. This decrease is attributed to the fact that there has been a decrease in the number of people living in poverty. Also, in 2018 the average amount of income for people below the poverty line was higher than in 2017, which indicates that the average income of those in poverty increased, and as a result, the level of poverty in 2018 also increased. The poverty rate is also based on the definition of poverty created by the Census Bureau. According to the official definition, the poverty threshold is calculated by adding three times the value of food stamps/SNAP received by each household member to the current income of the household, and then dividing the sum by the number of people in the household. This method is used to estimate the amount of income required to support a given household size.</s> \nWhat are some criticisms of the official poverty measure used by the U.S. Census Bureau?</s> \nSome criticisms of the official poverty measure used by the U.S. Census Bureau include the following:\n\n1. The measure does not consider non-cash benefits such as housing assistance or food assistance.\n\n2. It does not account for the differences in living expenses between different geographic regions, which can make it difficult to compare poverty levels across different parts of the country.\n\n3. The thresholds used to determine poverty have not been adjusted for changes in inflation accurately, which can lead to the underreporting of poverty.\n\n4. Some argue that it does not accurately measure poverty among single-parent households, who may have higher expenses than the model assumes.", "THE SEPTEMBER 11th VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND", "The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS) was established in 1968 through the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of current and future generations.

The United States has more nuclear power reactors than any country worldwide. 2. The 98 operable nuclear generating units provide approximately 20% of the electrical generation in the United States. 3. Uranium is the fundamental element used to fuel nuclear power production. 4. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle comprises the industrial stages starting with uranium extraction from the earth and ending with power production in a nuclear reactor. 5. Congressional interest in the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle is associated with many factors, including (1) domestic uranium production and supply, (2) concerns about increasing reliance on uranium imports, and (3) the economic viability of U.S. nuclear power reactors. 6. Historically, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a predecessor federal agency to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), promoted uranium production in the United States through federal procurement contracts between 1947 and 1971. 7. The majority of domestic uranium concentrate production prior to 1971 supported the development of nuclear weapons and naval propulsion reactors. 8. After 1971, uranium mill operators produced uranium concentrate primarily for use in commercial nuclear power reactors. 9. By the late 1980s, nuclear utilities and reactor operators in the United States purchased more uranium from foreign suppliers than domestic producers. 10. By 2017, 93% of the uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear utilities and reactor operators originated in a foreign country. 11. Nuclear utilities and reactor operators diversify uranium supplies among multiple domestic and foreign sources, intending to minimize fuel costs. 12.

Legislative Branch\nSince the early 1990s, Ghana has maintained a stable and orderly political and judicial system. In 1992, a military government was briefly established after a coup, but the military quickly ceded power to a democratically elected civilian government. The president and the 279-member unicameral parliament (whose composition is identical to that of the legislative branch) in Ghana are elected concurrently. The president serves a 4-year term and is eligible for reelection.  The Speaker of the Parliament is the only member of the executive branch. He is elected by the majority party and presides over a leadership team that manages the legislative process. The Cabinet consists of eighteen senior ministers and several government ministers. All ministers are appointed by the president and the Cabinet's decisions are subject to approval by a simple majority vote of the legislative branch. The President's Office is responsible for coordinating the activities of the government and represents the government in international affairs. It includes administrative, fiscal management, and security support offices and committees. The Cabinet Office is also part of the President's Office, and its responsibilities include developing the policies that the executive branch aims to implement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration includes administrative, diplomatic, security, trade promotion, and travel advisory responsibilities.\nGhana has had considerable success in advancing democracy, although its most recent election was marred by isolated incidents of violence and irregularities. Ghana has experienced peaceful and constitutional changes in government since its independence in 1957. Despite the challenges of poverty, Ghana has become a model of democracy in Africa with the peaceful transfer of executive power between parties at the ballot box. It recently ranked seventh in Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index, ahead of major U.S. and international partners, such as South Africa and Colombia. Overall, Ghana is making progress on its commitment to improving public service, tackling corruption, and promoting accountable and transparent governance. Ghana's national development efforts are supported by the United States through the Millennium Challenge Corporation's second compact, which aims to provide significant economic growth in Ghana through the expansion of electricity service, improvement of water management, construction and upgrading of roads, and increasing access to basic quality education. President Akufo-Addo's inaugural speech in January 2017 highlighted his commitment to free speech, religious tolerance, respect for human dignity, and the rule of law while recognizing the diversity and complexity of Ghanaian society. Ghana's constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, as well as for the right to public assembly, although in practice these rights are limited.\nOne area of concern for the government has been the proliferation and use of social media as a tool to spread rumors, false information, and outright lies. The National Media Commission, responsible for overseeing the media, has developed guidelines aimed at promoting positive coverage, curbing hate speech, and protecting the rights of children and vulnerable groups. In November 2016 the Ministry of Communication suspended Alhaji Mohammed, the owner of the popular Oman FM Station, over comments his station made that were deemed \"inciting\" and \"unprofessional.\" The president has pledged to lead a \"digital revolution.\" He has called on the Ministry of Communication to establish a strategy to promote technology-based entrepreneurship and to create an \"e-government\" platform to improve transparency and accountability. The government is making significant efforts to ensure that more Ghanaians have access to Internet and mobile phones. Akufo-Addo has also committed to promoting gender equality by increasing educational opportunities for women and girls and supporting women-led businesses and professions.\nThe government is committed to protecting the environment, mitigating climate change, and sustainably managing Ghana's natural resources. However, it has been unable to adequately address illegal mining and logging, and unregulated informal mining remains a significant problem. The government has also struggled to enforce environmental regulations, particularly in industrial communities.\nHuman Rights\nThe government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However, there were occasional abuses.\nThe most significant human rights issues included:.\nDespite the government's willingness to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses, there continued to be some limited impunity, especially for lower-level officers in the security forces.\nSection 6.

Proceed to summarize the following text.\nText: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first in the People's Republic of China (PRC or China), and now globally, including in the United States, is drawing attention to the ways in which the United States and other economies depend on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production based in China. Congress is particularly concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to better understand and address them. An area of particular concern to Congress in the current environment is U.S. shortages of medical supplies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceuticals\u00e2\u0080\u0094as the United States steps up efforts to contain COVID-19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient U.S. industrial capacity. Because of China's role as a global supplier of PPE, medical devices, antibiotics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), reduced exports from China have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the United States. Starting in early February 2020, U.S. health care experts began warning of a likely global spread of COVID-19, and early reports of U.S. medical supply shortages began to emerge. At the same time, the Chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in China, directing all production for domestic use. The Chinese government also directed the national bureaucracy, local governments, and Chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market. This effort likely exacerbated medical supply shortages in the United States and other countries, particularly in the absence of domestic emergency measures that might have locked in domestic contracts, facilitated an earlier start to alternative points of production, and restricted exports of key medical supplies. As China's manufacturing sector recovers while the United States and other countries are grappling with COVID-19, the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery. Those decisions are likely to be driven, at least in part, by political calculations, as it has done recently with many countries around the world. COVID-19 was identified in China in December 2019 and peaked in late January 2020. In response, China shut down a large part of its economy in an effort to contain the outbreak. A key factor in the sharp economic slowdown in China was the dramatic downturn of both demand and supply after Chinese officials imposed restrictions in the third week of January on movement of people and goods in and out of localities across China. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China has eased, the Chinese government's efforts to restart business activities has been slow and uneven across sectors and locations. Companies have sought to meet new government requirements for virus containment and faced worker and supply shortages as interregional logistics have remained constrained. Resumption of bilateral trade will likely be uneven due to bottlenecks in inputs, locations of containers, and logjams in current shipments. U.S. companies typically maintain anywhere from two to ten weeks of inventory, and transportation time for trans-Pacific container shipments is typically three weeks. With this timeframe in mind, initial shortages that U.S. firms faced of deliveries of microelectronics, auto parts, and health and medical products could intensify over the next few months. There could be additional shortages in a wide range of imports that transit via container ship (e.g., processed raw materials, intermediate industrial goods, and finished consumer products). As China's economic activities resume, other countries around the world are taking an economic hit. As in China, new restrictions around the world on the movement of people and business operations could trigger sharp new slowdowns in demand, transportation, and logistics worldwide, further dragging down prospects for global trade recovery. Suppressed global demand will likely further complicate efforts to orchestrate a rebound in China's (or global) economic activity. In sectors where China has extensive capacity (such as steel), some fear China could overwhelm overseas markets, as it ramps up export-led growth to compensate for the sharp economic downturn in the first quarter of 2020. Congress faces current choices that will influence the longer-range U.S. trade trajectory vis-a-vis China. Since the imposition of Section 301 tariffs on U.S. imports from China and China's retaliatory tariffs beginning in 2018, some Members have raised questions about the dependence of U.S. supply chains on China for critical products. There are also concerns about the potential ramifications of these dependencies, particularly in times of crisis or PRC nationalization of industry. Current demand pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic could increase U.S. reliance on medical supplies from China, at least in the short term (provided that the Chinese government is willing to export these supplies to the United States). At the same time, these pressures are also incentivizing diversification efforts. As the United States' third-largest trading partner in 2019, bilateral trade with China is important to the U.S. economy, and the recent sharp", "The United States have about 610,000 million acres of land, with agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Forest Service (FS) and other bodies charged with managing those lands. Agencies have four different types of funding - discretionary, mandatory, off-budget and fee-based funds. Out of those four, mandatory funding is the focus of this report. The current study takes a brief tour of the history of mandatory appropriations and how they have evolved in four agencies including DOI and USDA. The paper describes the history of mandatory appropriations, and how they have transformed over time in four principal agencies related to land management. The report also provides data on the agencies' mandatory appropriations under different programs and accounts. The aim of this study is to shed light on one fundamental facet of a complex federal budget process, mandatory appropriations. Mandatory appropriations are an increasingly important part of the federal budget. A study shows that between 1980 and 2009, the share of federal outlays accounted for by mandatory appropriations have increased by over 7 percentage points and now represent 58 percent of total federal outlays. Mandatory appropriations are distinct from discretionary appropriations, which are appropriated each year by Congress for specific federal programs through the annual appropriations process. Mandatory appropriations, on the other hand, are provided through authorizing statutes that automatically provide funding for specific programs without further congressional action. This type of funding is subject to annual caps and other limits set by Congress, but the actual amount spent can differ from the caps. Mandatory funding is used for a wide variety of programs, including entitlements like Medicare and Veterans' Benefits, and for various government operations. Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) produces a report called \"The Budget and Economic Outlook,\" including a report entitled \"Historical Information for FY2014-FY2024.\" The report highlights the importance of mandatory spending as a percentage of the total U.S. budget. In 2020, it showed that mandatory spending was 73% of the federal budget. In 2030 it increased to about 72% of the budget. This trend continues in the 2040 time frame when mandatory spending increases again to about 74% of the federal budget. The main focus of this report is to provide an up-to-date review of mandatory appropriations. Mandatory appropriations could affect a small number of programs, and it could also result in major effects. The paper will provide a summary of mandatory appropriations for DOI and USDA agencies related to land management. The report offers a comprehensive analysis of the mandatory appropriations budget. The report aims to aid the decision-making of Congress in a comprehensive approach in considering budget and funding policies. The report will be informative for members of Congress, their offices, as well as academic researchers, policy makers and practitioners.", "The retransmission of television signals to subscribers of cable, telephone company (telco), and satellite services has been governed in part by the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014", "We have been discussing the coronavirus.

Prominent issues addressed by the Supreme Court in recent terms have included (1) tribes' civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, (2) the scope of tribal sovereign immunity, and (3) termination of Indian parents' rights in adoption cases. The October 2018 term likewise featured several Indian law issues: the Court heard arguments in three significant cases, each of which implicated the complex relationships among tribal, state, and federal laws. In Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, the Court upheld a Washington Supreme Court decision permitting a tribe to import fuel without paying state fuel taxes. The right to travel on public highways guaranteed by an 1855 treaty, the Court ruled, included the right to transport goods for sale on the reservation without paying additional taxes to do so. In Herrera v. Wyoming, the Court determined that neither Wyoming's admission into the Union nor the designation of the Bighorn National Forest abrogated an earlier treaty preserving tribal hunting rights. Thus, a tribe member's conviction for exercising those hunting rights in violation of Wyoming state law could not stand. Finally, in Carpenter v. Murphy, the Court reviewed whether Congress disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) reservation more than a century ago, with potential consequences for Oklahoma's ability to prosecute major crimes in the eastern half of the state. However, the eight Justices considering this case have not yet reached a decision, and the case is scheduled to be reargued in the October 2019 Supreme Court term. This report discusses each of these three cases in turn, focusing on analyses of the Supreme Court's interpretive rubric for treaties and relevant legislation, statements about the scope of legislative authority and discussions of legislative intent, and possibilities for future congressional action. </s> \nWhat impact could the Supreme Court's decision in Murphy v. Carpenter potentially have on future cases related to tribal rights in the United States?</s> \nIf the Supreme Court upholds the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, it could set a precedent for the legal status of the reservations of other tribes beyond the Muscogee (Creek) Nation that have been disestablished. This would include reservations such as the Great Sioux Reservation that were purportedly disestablished by the 1905 Allotment Act, which opened up most Indian reservations to settlement by non-Indians. If recognized by the Supreme Court, the decision could ultimately increase tribal sovereignty and protect the remaining reservations from being further disestablished by the United States government.", "", "Net farm income is projected to exceed 2018's levels for the third consecutive year due to significant farm policy and trade retaliation supports despite projected declines in production expenses and farm asset values. Key policy drivers are the farm bill's expanded Market Facilitation Program, and trade retaliation payments that offset anticipated trade impacts. Net cash income is also anticipated to increase above last year, driven by continued government support. Total farm payments, including trade retaliation and other federal programs, are projected at $19.5 billion in calendar 2019, the second highest on record in constant dollars (2019 $) exceeded by 2010's $24.8 billion. An increase in government support in 2019, projected at $19.5 billion and up 42.5% from 2018's level, is the principal driver behind the rise in net farm income. The government support forecast of $19.5 billion represents an increase of $3.8 billion from USDA's preliminary February 2019 projection. At a projected $19.5 billion in calendar 2019, direct government payments would represent 22.2% of net farm income\u00e2\u0080\u0094the largest share since 2006 when federal subsidies represented a 27.6% share of net farm income. Total government payments are driven a large part by trade retaliation payments, including Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments and direct payments to farmers from payments to purchase foreign grains, beans, cotton, and fruits as a result of trade agreements. Trade retaliation payments in 2019 are projected at $3.5 billion, less than half the record $8.2 billion of 2018. However, the August 2019 forecast of $19.5 billion is just above (+0.9%) the 10-year average of $19.2 billion and represents continued agriculturesector weakness since 2013's record high of $123.7 billion.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: Election security is one of the most prominent policy challenges facing Congress. A November 2019 warning from the heads of several federal agencies illustrates the interdisciplinary and ongoing nature of the threat to American elections. According to the joint statement, in the 2020 election cycle, \"Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions. Adversaries may try to accomplish their goals through a variety of means, including social media campaigns, directing disinformation operations or conducting disruptive or destructive cyber-attacks on state and local infrastructure.\" These are just the latest challenges in securing American elections. Traditionally, election administration emphasizes policy goals such as ensuring that all eligible voters, and only eligible voters, may register and cast ballots; that those ballots are counted properly; and that the voting public views that process as legitimate and transparent. Preserving election continuity is a chief concern. Election officials therefore have long prepared contingency plans that address various risks, such as equipment malfunctions, power outages, and natural disasters. These traditional concerns remain, but have taken on new complexity amid foreign interference in U.S. elections. In addition to managing traditional security concerns about infrastructure and administrative processes (e.g., counting ballots), mitigating external threats to the accuracy of information voters receive, particularly from foreign sources, is a potential challenge for political campaigns, election administrators, and the public. Addressing any one of these topics might involve multiple areas of public policy or law. Doing so also can involve complex practical challenges about which levels of government, or agencies, are best equipped or most appropriate to respond. How those entities can or should interact with political campaigns, the private sector, and voters, are also ongoing questions. Technical complexity in some areas, such as cybersecurity, and the federal structure of shared national, state or territorial, and local responsibility for administering federal elections make election security even more challenging. Election security in general appears to be a shared policy goal, but debate exists in Congress about which policy issues and options to pursue. Debate over the scope of the federal government's role in election security shapes much of that debate. State, territorial, and local governments are responsible for most aspects of election administration, including security. This report provides congressional readers with an overview that includes how campaign and election security has developed as a policy field; recent legislative activity, especially bills that have advanced beyond introduction; federal statutes and agencies that appear to be most relevant for campaign and election security; state, territorial, or local roles in administering elections, and federal support for those functions; and highlights of recent policy debates, and potential future questions for congressional consideration. Additionally, this report discusses cybersecurity activities by the federal government and private companies that could affect the security of elections, and the role of disinformation in elections and its potential effects on election security. This report does not seek to comprehensively review every federal law or policy that could affect campaign and election security, nor is the report intended to address all federal or state policy options or opinions on every aspect of election security. Many policy options are possible that this report does not address, and many aspects of the debate are complex and evolving. This report, however, can help congressional readers understand some main policy options available, and to evaluate, consider, or advance their own or others\u2019 proposals.", "WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS IN POLICY DECISIONS?

Iranian assets are largely limited to a small bank account with more than $500 million held in an Iranian bank account in New York, blocked since 1979 and designated under many executive orders. Iranian assets have been frozen under the Algiers Accords that resolved the U.S.-Iran hostage crisis. Claims against the U.S. by Iran, mostly blocked during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, continue to be addressed at the Hague by a \"U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal.\" A court at the Hague handles some 4,700 private U.S. cases involving Iranian claims. The federal court system has heard over 60 civil cases that involved assets frozen pursuant to various EOs. Iran has blocked property of private U.S. persons and entities in its country since the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. In 2006, Iran designated assets of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) held in the United Kingdom, Canada, and abroad. On November 13, 2006, the EU added CBI to its list of sanctioned entities.

This has caused the United States to become increasingly dependent on imports for its seafood needs, which has contributed to an increasing seafood trade deficit. In contrast, most other nations in the world have experienced increases in the volume of their aquaculture production. Global aquaculture production is projected to increase from 80.0 mmt in 2016 to 113.6 mmt by 2030. A large portion of this increase will come from increased production in China and other Asian countries. Offshore aquaculture (or mariculture) is becoming more prominent in many countries because of coastal land and water availability constraints and negative environmental and community impacts from some existing aquaculture operations. Globally, mariculture production is only about 1.2 mmt, or less than 1% of the total aquaculture production, but it is increasing as a result of expansion in a number of countries. By 2030, the volume of mariculture production is projected to grow to 3.3 mmt, or 3% of projected world fish production (See Figure 1). The United States, with about 2% of world fisheries production (including aquaculture), produces about 12% of world aquaculture (including domestic aquaculture) and had estimated marine aquaculture production value of about $1.7 billion annually in the last decade. Because so much of U.S. marine aquaculture production is in coastal areas, which may face constraints in the future, offshore marine aquaculture production seems to offer increased opportunities for the future. However, offshore aquaculture requires technology that may be different from that of traditional operations and raises legal, policy, and other issues. In the 116 th Congress, the two bills pending introduced in the Senate (S. 1358 and S. 1439) and the one pending in the House, H.R. 2604, each address offshore marine aquaculture regulatory issues. Some have estimated that if offshore marine aquaculture is developed in federal waters of the United States, it could amount to $4 billion annually by 2030. It remains unclear how many additional jobs could be created by expanded offshore aquaculture. A key issue to consider with offshore marine aquaculture development is how to balance economic production and environmental protection. In the past, some aquaculture operations in nearshore or inland waters have contributed substantially to excessive waste and nutrient loading and resulted in other negative environmental impacts. There are potential ecological risks associated with offshore marine aquaculture development, including potential impacts on marine organisms and their habitats. Another key issue to consider is the potential conflict between marine aquaculture and other industries in the U.S. outer continental shelf (OCS). Other industries operating in U.S. OCS areas include commercial fishing, which accounts for about 80% of federally permitted fishing activities; offshore energy development, including oil and gas production; and other potential users of OCS space for wind farms, solar installations, and other renewable energy initiatives. Potential conflicts include adverse impacts on fishing, possible physical interference with commercial and offshore energy development activities, and potential impacts on recreational users. The extent of such conflicts depends largely on the location of offshore marine aquaculture facilities and the location, size, and timing of other uses of OCS areas, but the potential for adverse effects may be greater in some locations than in others. Congress has passed various statutes to address the development of aquaculture in the past. However, none of them have effectively addressed the development of offshore aquaculture, and a comprehensive package may be needed to address offshore aquaculture. In addition, potential legislative provisions to regulate offshore aquaculture may be broader than those applied to land-based aquaculture facilities. There are two potentially relevant federal statutes that address aquatic plants and animals; however, there is disagreement among some stakeholders about the adequacy of current federal authority to address potential offshore aquaculture development. The 1949 Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), Public Law 86-381, codified at 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., applies to all coastal pelagic fisheries by virtue of its definition of \"exclusive economic zone\" as the 3 mile to 200 mile offshore waters. An extension to it, the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Security Act of 2006, established certain Gulf of Mexico fisheries regulations for shrimp, tuna, and other specified marine life in the Gulf of Mexico federal Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is a 200 mile offshore area. Some dispute that 16 U.S.C. 5502 and its implementing regulations are applicable to aquaculture operations, including because the act applies to pelagic and specified marine life and the MSA definition of aquaculture does not encompass the Gulf of Mexico fisheries. Some stakeholders assert that the Magnuson Act (which includes the MSA) does not provide adequate authority for managing offshore aquaculture;", "SALT Cap\nDescription:\nOrder your custom written analysis essay now - SALT Cap Research Paper", "THE CONSTITUTION IMPEACHES AN OFFENSIVE POLITICIAN ON THE NATIONAL STAGE\u00e2\u0080\u0094WILL THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY RASHEED HOMESLICE (A PSEUDONYM) FROM OFFICE?

Funding originates from a transfer by the Secretary of Agriculture into a separate fund, known as the Promote and Develop American Fisheries Products and Research Pertaining to American Fisheries Fund (P&D account). NMFS administers the funds within the Department of Commerce. Most funds are transferred to the Operations, Research, and Faculties (ORF) account, which supports fisheries science and management. Some funds support the S-K Grant Program, which provides financial assistance for fisheries research and development. Table 1 provides a history of legislative changes to the S-K Act. Figure 1 shows how funds flow from the P&D account to NOAA and the S-K program. CONCLUSION: The Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Act provides funding for fisheries research and development in the United States. The majority of funds are transferred into the ORF account, which supports fisheries science and management. The S-K Grant Program provides financial assistance for research and development related to fishery production, processing, and marketing.

Congress ultimately did not accept President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in new funding for the construction of a proposed border wall, providing instead $1.375 billion for additional pedestrian fencing as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (CAA). Unsatisfied with the negotiated agreement, the Trump Administration issued a Presidential Proclamation on February 15, 2019, declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States, a move that, among other things, allowed the President to invoke special authorities for redirecting military construction appropriations. Concurrently, the White House released a plan for reprogramming or transferring $6.7 billion to southwest border barrier projects, of which $6.1 billion would come from unobligated Department of Defense (DOD or Department) appropriations. Congress, noting the President's attempt to secure more funding than provided in the CAA, and concerned over a potential violation of its constitutional prerogatives to manage appropriations, acted quickly in an attempt to terminate the national emergency declaration. A joint resolution, H.J.Res. 46, Relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019, was passed by both houses on March 14, 2019, but was subsequently vetoed by the President one day later. On March 26, 2019, an attempt to override the veto fell short of the required two-thirds majority in the House by a vote of 248-181. In September 2019, Congress again attempted to terminate the state of national emergency with a joint resolution ( S.J.Res. 54 ) passed by both chambers.

The second dimension of the Senate's inherent rulemaking authority is the requirement that rules be adopted by a majority vote. By tradition, the Senate conducts most of its business by unanimous consent. The reason for this tradition is a requirement that is unique in American politics -- that a majority of the Senate must approve of a change in the Senate's rules. If a change proposed by one Senator is approved by only one other Senator, then it violates the principle of majoritarian rule in the Senate. The majority-vote principle requires the Senate to decide changes in its rules explicitly by voting on them and by recording the vote. The House of Representatives has no requirement that rules require the explicit vote of a majority of the House. Because the Senate is the Senate, it tends to enforce adherence to its precedents. In that sense, the precedents of the Senate operate somewhat like case law and not only like a legislative history that a court might read when interpreting a statute. Precedents reflect past practices, but they also reflect past commitments made by the Senate to others who can now rely on them. A decision of the Senate's President -- for example, a ruling from the Chair in relation to a point of order on the floor -- becomes precedent that a future Speaker will be bound to respect. Because precedents are enforceable, Senators can rely on them as an essential source of law and procedure when conducting the Senate's business. Members can rely on past precedents as if they were part of the Senate's code of law. Although they are written as rules, the precedents are only enforceable through the active involvement of Senators and staff, as well as officials of the Senate. The precedents will only have consequence if invoked by someone who can raise a point of order. The precedents will only have effect as part of the Senate's parliamentary process if someone enforces them. These precedents are enforceable, in part, because the Senate provides several forums for enforcing its rules, procedures, and precedents. For example, a Senator can raise a point of order against a procedure or precedent being followed. If the Chair agrees that a precedent is violated, then the Chair must decide the point of order against the offending party. The consequences of the Chair's ruling can include that the offending party cannot continue to pursue what was being attempted, or that the offending party takes the Chair at the next opportunity for doing the same thing. In rare cases, the Senate will consider a point of order to be a violation of the Constitution. In 2009, the Senate acted on a proposal that is considered to be an exercise of the Senate's constitutional authority. The Constitution provides the Senate with broad authority to organize its proceedings, including a \"rule or order\" for consideration of bills. Senate Rule VIII provides for extended debate by a senator recognized under Rule IX. This rule provides a procedure for recognizing a senator recognized for up to 30 hours. The Senate amended Rule VIII to limit its application to a period of no more than 8 hours, including yielding at least two periods of 30 minutes each for other senators, unless the senate otherwise orders by majority vote. The Senate acted on a motion to reconsider the amendment to Rule VIII. This motion was an initiative of the minority, and it had an unusual character. It was not a rescinding of an amendment to the standing rules, but an attempt by the minority to do so after two days 3", "TEXT : Honduras, a Central American nation of 9.1 million people, faces significant domestic challenges.

Reclamation's purposes, according to Sections 3, 5, and 6 of the Reclamation Act, include \"the irrigation of arid lands in the United States, the reclamation of arid lands in the United States, the improvement of navigation, and the promotion of beneficial agricultural values, the promotion of the health of needy lands in arid sections of the United States, and the development of water sources for mining and industrial purposes of the cities, towns, and counties embracing any reclamation area as herein defined.\" The act included three parts: 1) Reclamation Projects (Section 1); 2) Sale of Land (Section 6); and 3) Irrigation of Arid Lands (Section 7). Title 1 created the Reclamation Service (later the Bureau of Reclamation), as well as the Reclamation Fund. It also provides federal funding for reclamation projects and outlines methods of project construction. Title 2 dealt with rights-of-way, and title 3 concerned irrigation practice and the utilization of irrigation lands. Reclamation's early projects were designed to help establish irrigated agriculture, and included the construction of irrigation canals, dams, and pumping systems (e.g., diversion works). As the program developed, the focus shifted from the construction of single-purpose irrigation structures to comprehensive watershed development and flood control projects and multipurpose water storage and distribution systems. By the end of 2009, the Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a total of 638 water resource projects and operated a total of 487 projects.

These include informing Congress, providing expert advice on complex or controversial issues, and generating policy recommendations. To aid Congress, commissions are generally authorized to hold hearings, conduct research, analyze data, and/or make field visits as they carry out their duties. Most complete their work by delivering their findings, recommendations, or advice in the form of a written report to Congress. For example, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 911 Commission) was created to examine and report upon the facts and causes related to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and to investigate and report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective measures. The commission ultimately submitted a final report to Congress and the President containing its findings and conclusions, along with 48 policy recommendations.

Biological products are approved through the Biologics License Application (BLA) process. Biological products are often more complex to develop, manufacture, and regulate than drugs. For example, biologics are often proteins synthesized in living cells; therefore, the manufacturing process must be regulated carefully to ensure consistency in the quality and potency of the product. A third approval pathway, the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process, allows a generic drug to be approved on the basis of FDA's review of a reference brand-name drug. A generic is a drug that is the same as the reference brand-name drug, except for the labeler. The labeler is the party who manufactures, packs, or distributes a drug. To obtain FDA approval for a generic drug through the ANDA process, the manufacturer must demonstrate bioequivalence. This means that the generic drug is absorbed into the human body at the same rate as and to the same degree as the reference brand-name drug. While the medicine for a brand-name drug is patented, a generic drug is essentially unpatented. After a product is approved through the NDA or BLA process, the drug sponsor may sell the medicine in interstate commerce lawfully. As the drug sponsor holds the original patent rights, the sponsors have the exclusive rights to sell and distribute the branded product. In contrast, an ANDA approval permits the distribution and sale of only one generic. The generics must have the active ingredients as the reference brand-name drug, but they may use different inactive ingredients, provided these do not affect any efficacy or purity of the product. The manufacture and sale of a generic drug are thus different from manufacturing and selling a generic. The sale of multiple generics are permitted, although the price of a generic may be substantially less than the brand-name drug because the generic has a lower development cost. The manufacturer of the generic does not need to invest capital in R&D. The brand-name product, however, is designed to be a new and innovative drug for treatment, and the R&D costs for the brand-name drug development are considerably higher. Thus, the generic product's lower production costs permit it to be sold at a lower price point. If the brand-name drug's price declines below its own manufacturing costs, the drug company may opt to stop manufacturing it. These are the basic elements of the FDA drug approval process and patent law, which affects the nature of the pharmaceutical industry and is the foundation for the legislation and analysis that follows. The FDA oversees the regulation and approval of prescription drugs in the United States. The FDA's mission is to ensure that these drugs are safe and effective for their intended use. The FDA's regulation of medication is both premarket and postmarket. Premarket regulation includes the clinical trials stage of development and submission of the NDA. Postmarket regulation includes surveillance, inspection, and regulatory power over label changes, advertising, promotion, and recalls. In addition to new drug applications, in order to manufacture biologics or generic drugs in the United States, manufacturers must demonstrate a quality management system and follow good manufacturing practices. The FDA does not review brand-name drug applications for safety or efficacy. ANDA applications for generic drug safety and efficacy are required to be filed. After FDA approval of an ANDA application and FDA approval of the generic product, it is considered interchangeable with the brand-name drug. The purpose of the ANDA approval process is for the agency to determine if the generic product is therapeutic and pharmacokinetic (e.g., how well is the medicine absorbed into the body) equivalence to the reference drug. The generic drug manufacturer is required to reference the active ingredients in the reference drug in the ANDA application. After FDA approval, an ANDA sponsor may lawfully sell the medicine in interstate commerce and it can be distributed and sold to the public. Generic drug manufacturers that sell generic drug are required to comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) of 1987. In general, PDMA regulates the distribution and sale of prescription drugs to avoid tampering, adulteration, or diverting prescription drugs to the black market. A Prescription Drug Product (PDP) is any drug, human tissue, blood product, or biological product for which the FDA requires a prescription. Distribution may also include wholesalers or pharmacy chains. A wholesaler is defined as any person or entity that sells or offers for sale prescription drugs for wholesale distribution to persons other than the final consumer. The final consumer is defined as the person or entity receiving the prescription drug product. Distribution must comply with PDMA's requirements regarding chain custody, labeling, packaging, and record", "FFACCA-Famileis FirsT Coronavirus Aact of 2020 (Division A) 11/15/2020 1/15/2021 COVID-19 response and testing (Sec. 101) Health coverage for Coronavirus testing for uninsured (Sec. 102) Pay for sick leave for COVID-19 precautions (Sec. 103) Pay for emergency sick leaves for school closure or decreased hours (Sec. 104) Pay for employee COVID-19 testing (Sec. 105) Pay for food assistance for closed schools (Sec. 106) Pay emergency FMLA leave (Sec. 201) Supplemental Medicaid (Sec. 202) Supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP food stamps) (Sec. 203) Temporary Child Care Assistance (Sec. 204) Federal Pell Grants for undergraduates (Sec. 207) Public Housing Capital Fund (Sec. 201) Indian Health Services (Sec. 215) Payment for testing/associated items (Sec. 211) Direct payment for COVID-19 associated health care items (Sec. 221) Public health response (Division F) Support for Medicaid (Sec. 501) Telehealth/Telemedicine (Sec. 502) National Guard and Medicaid (Sec. 503) Indian Health Service (Sec. 504) Opioid response and COVID (Sec. 505) Nutrition and child care programs (Sec. 601) (See Appendix for a list of CRS experts.)

To receive payment, health care providers must submit information to HHS through various reporting mechanisms, attest that they have treated or tested individuals for COVID-19, have incurred expenses or experienced revenue losses related to COVID-19, and have not received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. Additionally, hospitals receiving aid must refrain from Medicare billing and must use the funds to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus,\" with a portion of the funds also limited to healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. States, tribal governments, and territories are eligible if they have been determined to be a hot spot for COVID-19 (based on criteria designated by the HHS secretary). HHS is also directed to give priority to HHS-funded community health centers; a disproportionate share hospital with (1) at least 10 percent of its annual patient inpatient days attributable to non-coronavirus-related Medicaid; or (2) at least 30 percent of its annual patient inpatient days attributable to non-coronavirus-related Medicare. Health centers are not eligible.

Initially, it did not require labeling and instead focused on ensuring the safety and efficacy of the products. However, as concern among U.S. consumers about genetically modified (GM) food increased, the government began to implement various labeling policies. Currently, two different policies coexist: mandatory labeling and voluntary labeling. The mandatory labeling policy requires manufacturers to disclose the presence of bioengineered ingredients in their products, with a focus on preventing fraud and providing accurate information to consumers. The voluntary labeling policy involves manufacturers who may decide to disclose the presence of bioengineered ingredients in their products, but they are not required by law to do so. As a result, the U.S. government has taken steps to establish bioengineered food standards for labeling, such as the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard mentioned in the text, in response to societal demands.", "The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 grants the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor (DOL) the authority to promulgate, modify, or revoke occupational safety and health standards.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: The Department of Defense (DOD) operates a Military Health System (MHS) that delivers certain health entitlements under Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S. Code. The Defense Health Agency (DHA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a component of the MHS\u00e2\u0080\u0094administers the TRICARE program, which offers health care services to approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries, composed of military personnel, retirees, and their families. Beneficiaries may receive health care services in DOD-operated hospitals and clinics\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as military treatment facilities (MTFs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094or through participating civilian health care providers. DOD operates 723 MTFs in the United States and in overseas locations. Each MTF provides a range of clinical services depending on its size, mission, and level of capabilities. Only active duty servicemembers are entitled to care in any MTF. Dependents and retirees may receive care on a space-available basis that takes into account patient capacity, beneficiary category (e.g., servicemember, family member, retiree), and enrollment status. When care is not available at an MTF, beneficiaries may receive care from a civilian health care provider who participates in TRICARE. The three main health plan options offered to eligible beneficiaries include TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. TRICARE also offers premium-based health plan options for certain beneficiaries, such as qualified members of the Selected Reserve, retired reservists, young adults, and transitioning servicemembers. Other TRICARE benefits include a pharmacy program, optional dental plans, and a vision plan for certain beneficiaries. This report answers frequently asked questions about TRICARE health plan options tailored for certain reservists, retired reservists, and their families (i.e., TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Retired Reserve) and certain statutory prohibitions that limit their participation in the plans. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) is a premium-based health plan available worldwide for some members of the Selected Reserve and their families. TRS was established by Section 701 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of Fiscal Year 2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ). TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) is a premium-based health plan available worldwide for qualified retired members of the reserve components. TRR was established by Section 705 of the NDAA for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-84 ) as a TRICARE coverage option for so-called Gray area reservists, defined as those who have retired but are too young to draw retired pay. The plans are similar to TRICARE Select (i.e., preferred provider option), which feature monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and fixed co-pays when receiving care from a network provider or paying a percentage of the allowable charge when receiving care from a TRICARE-authorized, nonnetwork provider. Eligible beneficiaries residing outside of the United States are also eligible for TRS and TRR; however, the availability of network providers may be limited based on geographic location. By law, the Department of Defense (DOD) is required to subsidize the cost of TRS. Servicemembers pay 28% of the cost of the program in the form of premiums. For TRR, enrollees pay the full cost of the calculated premium as determined by the Secretary of Defense. DOD does not subsidize the program costs for TRR. DOD annually updates the premiums for each program on an \"appropriate actuarial basis.\" Monthly TRS and TRR premiums for calendar years 2019 and 2020 are listed in Table 1. DOD reports that at the end of FY2018, 383,683 beneficiaries were covered by TRS and 9,019 beneficiaries were covered by TRR.", "INFOPEDIA TEXT\nWhat steps has the government taken to improve healthcare access for the uninsured during the COVID-19 pandemic?\nThe government has taken several steps to improve healthcare access for the uninsured during the COVID-19 pandemic, including: 1.

A Supreme Court decision in 2014 ruled some employers with religious objections do not have to fulfill this requirement. A federal court has allowed regulations that exempt many organizations, but the Supreme Court is considering the issue this year. \nWhat are the potential impacts of the Supreme Court's decision in the Little Sisters of the Poor case on access to contraception for women?\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the Trump Administration's expanded religious and moral exemptions from the federal contraceptive coverage requirement, as many employers and insurance providers have done since 2017, millions of women could lose their current access to contraception free from cost sharing. For many women, that could mean a return to out-of-pocket costs, or they might avoid accessing necessary contraceptive services altogether. Estimates of the potential impact on women's ability to access contraceptives vary, but most agree that millions more women would likely go without needed reproductive health services. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 4% of U.S. women could lose access to contraception if the Trump Administration's expanded exemptions are allowed to take effect. It is worth noting that this estimate does not account for state actions to enforce contraception coverage laws or the impact of other legal challenges. Additionally, as states and stakeholders consider how best to ensure access to contraception for women who may lose access under the expanded exemptions, policymakers may be confronted with difficult trade-offs and legal considerations. For instance, states considering their options may weigh the potential impact on employers and insurance providers against the potential health and economic consequences on women and their families.", "The text suggests that CBD has been promoted as a treatment for certain conditions with limited scientific evidence to confirm this claim.

However, these changes did not alter the existing FDA authority and requirements applicable to FDA-regulated products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including hemp-derived CBD.", "In a simplified summary, the report discusses FDA's interpretation of the FDCA as it pertains to the NCE exclusivity provisions and how this interpretation has spurred legislation that would codify its current approach as to NCE exclusivity while simultaneously extending it.", "As the term is currently being discussed, surprise billing typically refers to situations where a consumer is unwittingly, and potentially unavoidably, treated by a provider outside of the consumer's health insurance plan network and, as a result, unexpectedly receives a larger bill than he or she would have received if the provider had been in the plan network. Most recently, in federal policy discussions, surprise billing has commonly been discussed in the context of two situations: (1) where an individual receives emergency services from an out-of-network provider and (2) where a consumer receives nonemergency services from an out-of-network provider who is working in an in-network facility. However, surprise billing may occur in other situations (e.g., ground ambulance and air ambulance services) where consumers are unknowingly and unavoidably treated by an out-of-network provider. As these situations imply, surprise billing is rooted in most private insurers' use of provider networks. Therefore, this report begins with a discussion of the relationship between provider network status and private health insurance billing before discussing existing federal and state requirements around surprise billing. This report then discusses various policy issues that Congress may want to consider when assessing surprise billing proposals. Such policy topics include what plan types should be addressed; what types of services or provider types should be addressed; what types of consumer protections should be established; what requirements (including financial requirements) should be placed on insurers, providers, or both; how these policies will be enforced; and what is the role of the state. The list of topics discussed in this report is not exhaustive but should touch on many aspects of the surprise billing proposals currently under consideration. The report also briefly discusses potential impacts of the various surprise billing approaches. It then concludes with an Appendix table comparing two federal proposals that have gone through committee markup procedures. Specifically, the proposals included in the appendix are Title I of S. 1895 (Alexander), which went through a Senate Committee Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) markup session on June 26, 2019, and Title IV of the amendment in the nature of a substitute (ANS) to H.R. 2328, which went through a markup session held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 17, 2019. As of the date of this report, no other proposals have been approved through committee markup or gone further in the legislative-making process. \u2022 FIGURE 1: HEALTH INSURANCE PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS FOR COVERED IN-NETWORK SERVICES \u2022 Source: Congressional Research Service (CRS).\nThe amount paid for out-of-network services, on the other hand, are typically negotiated and established by the parties involved (i.e., not the insurer). Out-of-network providers may also establish their own individual payment requirements. These requirements may vary from negotiated amounts established with insurers for in-network services and can vary from provider to provider. The insurer and consumer share responsibility for paying the provider for out-of-network services, and the consumer's portion can be substantial.\nEmergency situation services refer to certain specific medical scenarios, such as an unintentional injury or sudden onset of a severe health condition. They can occur at hospitals, physicians' offices, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and other health care facilities. When these situations require medical attention and occur in facilities that are outside of an insurance plan provider network, emergency providers may bill consumers for the covered services rendered (i.e., unexpected bills). These bills may be referred to as balance billing.\nWhen a provider treats a patient in the emergency setting, the provider should bill the health insurance plan in which the patient is enrolled for the emergency services performed. The health insurance plan then pays the provider for the services rendered as per the terms of the insurer's contract with the provider. When a patient is treated in the emergency setting, the patient is considered to be an enrollee of the health insurance plan in which the patient is enrolled, even if he or she has not yet met the annual out-of-pocket spending limit applicable to that plan. However, the health insurance plan's contracts with its participating providers typically do not cover emergency services furnished by providers not participating with that particular health insurance plan in that health insurance plan's network.\nTo avoid balance billing situations, individuals typically should seek emergency care at facilities that participate with the person's insurance plan. It is also important to check with one's insurance plan about the extent of coverage for emergency services rendered in facilities outside of the insurance plan's provider network. Most insurers provide some coverage for emergency services rendered in out-of-network facilities, but coverage details (e.g., amounts paid) may vary by insurance plan and type of service provided.\nIn the absence of an emergency, some hospitals have reportedly implemented an practice called facility-based surprise billing. Some hospitals are reportedly design", "The federal government's role in historic preservation activities dates back over a century. While the government was actively involved in the protection of historic sites from the earliest days of American history, its role became more defined in the 1890s and the 1930s. In the 1960s, the Johnson administration concluded that a new coordinated approach was necessary to address the serious challenges facing historic preservation at the federal level. The result was the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966. This law, along with its subsequent amendments, constitutes the basic statutory framework for federal historic preservation activities. Several federal agency programs fund activities to preserve cultural resources, from national monuments to the rehabilitation of historic properties. Each program has a specific geographic focus or targeted area, such as historical landmarks, civil rights sites, battlefield preservation or tribal historic preservation. While their goals may differ, NHPA establishes the basic framework of principles that guide federal implementation of historic preservation efforts. Overall, the federal government manages a variety of tools and programs that provide grants and technical assistance to historic preservation activities at the national, regional, state and local levels. Congress appropriates federal funds for these various tools and programs. Funding levels for these programs are determined through the annual appropriations process (see \" Funding History for Historic Preservation Programs.\" ) It is through these efforts that the federal government preserves cultural resources of national significance. The United States is the custodian of a rich collection of cultural resources, inherited from the civilizations that existed on these shores for well over 14,000 years. The NHPA acknowledges this responsibility and emphasizes the importance of preserving the heritage of past generations for future generations. The bill defines historic properties as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, bridge, object, or landscape that has historic significance. NHPA recognizes the value of preserving and conserving historic properties for their intrinsic value as well as their ability to help communities to understand their heritage and identity. NHPA identifies three general categories of historic properties: \\- Prehistoric resources that provide insight into the earliest occupants of this country, including Native American cultural traditions, and ancient ruins or artifacts that help us understand America's ancient civilization. \\- Historic resources that document and illustrate important events, ideas, and values that shaped the country, such as buildings, monuments, and landscapes associated with our earliest colonial settlements and the American Revolution, the Civil War and Civil Rights era, and the nation's westward expansion, and historic resources associated with major events of the 20 th century, such as the World Wars and the civil rights movement. \\- Historical sites and buildings related to America's diverse communities that reflect life in rural and urban communities, including traditional ethnic neighborhoods and early suburbs, and religious, fraternal, civic, and reform organizations, that together embody America's cultural heritage. NHPA recognizes that cultural landscapes deserve special attention because of their historical, social, or cultural significance. Such cultural landscapes include open spaces and streetscapes, as well as archeological sites that provide information about past cultures. Cultural landscapes that have evolved naturally over time sometimes provide information about the environment and how it has been modified. They may also reflect how different cultures have made use of the land in ways that have shaped it. Historic resources are also important for their association with significant historical figures or events, and for the aesthetic quality and craftsmanship of their design and construction. Many cultural resources hold particular value for the educational opportunities they offer to citizens and visitors who seek to better understand the past. Preservation not only retains our collective identity and sense of place, it also generates economic activity. Historic preservation attracts tourists, creates jobs, generates tax revenues and revitalizes rural and urban communities. Preservation has significant cultural and social benefits as well, helping communities understand and appreciate their heritage and history. Finally, preservation efforts also protect resources that are susceptible to degradation and loss. Some resources will be lost over time due to natural or industrial deterioration, and many historic resources in the United States face such challenges today. NHPA recognizes that natural forces, including earthquakes and fire, can destroy cultural resources, as well as human activity, such as war, neglect, or exploitation. Changes in technology, land development patterns, transportation, pollution, and other factors make other historic resources vulnerable to loss or alteration. Many historic resources are endangered by time, and in order to protect, preserve and restore them, their stories must be told, their character-defining features must be understood and maintained, and their location discovered and valued. NHPA created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to provide advice to federal agencies, states and Indian tribes, non-federal entities, and professional organizations on a wide range of preservation issues. The NHPA establishes a number of procedures and requirements in dealing with historic properties for federal agencies. Whenever federal funds are to be used in a way that can impact historic properties, federal agencies must consult with the state for purposes of coordinating its planning, and with interested parties, such as preservation organizations and the public to", "Text: How did internet make a big impact?\"", "Non-Degree Programs institutions.

In addition, general purpose governments may provide revenues directly for education either (1) for specific LEAs within the jurisdiction, or (2) for specific educational purposes (such as the construction or renovation of school buildings) without regard to the LEA structure. Local revenues may be raised through property taxes (either ad valorem or specified purpose-based), income taxes, sales taxes, license fees, impact fees, or a combination of these types of local taxes. The availability of property taxes for financing public schools varies among states and among LEAs within a state. In some states, such as California and Massachusetts, local property tax systems are relatively robust and can provide significant amounts of funding for public schools. In other states, such as Arizona and Michigan, local tax systems do not provide as much funding. Property tax rates can vary widely among LEAs in one state; for example, in Washington, property tax rates in Seattle are five times higher than in Spokane. Overall, in 2015-2016, 38.4% of the funding provided by all sources that was available for public education came from local property taxes. The share of funding provided by property taxes ranged from a low of 0.9% in Wyoming to a high of 48.5% in New Jersey. Income taxes can also be a significant source of funding for public schools; in fact, income taxes accounted for 37.0% of revenues available for public education in 2015-2016, more than the share contributed by property taxes. In 2015-2016, nine states had income tax levied for public education; the remaining states either raised revenues indirectly through a tax on corporate or individual income or did not levy an income tax. In 2015-2016, nine states had income tax levied for public education; the remaining states either raised revenues indirectly through a tax on corporate or individual income or did not levy an income tax. The revenues from all sources available for public elementary and secondary education are not distributed evenly among LEAs; there is wide variation in the number of dollars available per student. Average per pupil revenue ranged from a low of $5,681 in Utah to a high of $25,221 in New Jersey. Differences in resources also vary within states, with more prosperous LEAs tending to raise higher property tax revenues from higher assessed property values than less affluent LEAs. A key feature of the system of public elementary and secondary education is how the financial resources available to each LEA is generated and provided. The federal government raises revenue through a variety of means, including income and corporate taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, import and export duties, and fees. Federal revenues in 2015-2016 were $2.7 trillion; 43% of these revenues were raised indirectly, 39% through taxes. The LEAs receive financial resources from the federal government through two ways: (1) block grants, and (2) direct programs, such as student-based programs. Block grants provide LEAs with allocations of revenue, based on a formula involving factors such as poverty, LEA population, or LEA expenditures per pupil, with general restrictions on how the grant revenues may be used, while direct programs provide allocations of revenue for a specific program or target population. In 2015-2016, the federal government provided $13.3 billion of financial resources to LEAs to be used for student-based programs, including funds raised by local education agencies as a match to such programs. In 2015-2016, the ESEA was amended, with Title I-A authorizing LEAs to use Title I funds at each Title I school (1,332,300 schools) to provide services to low income and/or other targeted pupils and to carry out activities that are designed to improve the school as a whole. In 2015-2016, Title I-A school allocations in 2015-2016 totaled about $15.6 billion. Additional amounts were available, authorized by ESEA Title I-A and Title IV to provide services such as summer school, after-school programs, and extended-time programs, as well as to support teachers and principals in the school improvement efforts. The ESEA also has a provision\u2014Title I-D\u2014by which LEAs serve students living in rural or isolated areas through such programs as distance education and telecommunications, and in some cases serve as a conduit in distributing such funds to other ESEA-eligible LEAs. ESSA, in 2015-2016, continued these programs, with LEAs able to use funds provided under the LEA and school-level programs (Title I-A and Title I-D) to make available", "The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) within the U.S. Department of Education (ED) is the primary entity responsible for the administration and oversight of the federal student aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended).

The Washington Post contends that \"the Lessons Learned interviews broadly resemble the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department's top-secret history of the Vietnam War,\" although the SIGAR interviews and Pentagon Papers differ in several key ways. Perhaps most importantly, the Pentagon Papers were a contemporaneous recounting of the Vietnam War based mostly on classified material from the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the SIGAR Lessons Learned documents are unclassified records of interviews with a wide array of policymakers carried out as many as 15 years after the events described. The documents, and the Washington Post stories that accompany them, suggest that US policies in Afghanistan often were poorly planned, resourced, and/or executed. These apparent shortcomings contributed to several outcomes that either were difficult to assess or did not fulfill stated US objectives. The documents, released at a time when the United States is engaged in talks with the Taliban aimed at ending the 18-year US military presence in the country, have attracted attention, and some Members of Congress have called for further investigation into US policy in Afghanistan. However, there is debate over how revelatory the SIGAR interviews are, with some analysts contending that the information they contain was available at the time and remains so today (see \" Reactions to \"the Afghanistan Papers\" below). SIGAR, an independent investigative body created by Congress in 2008, conducted interviews with hundreds of US and other policymakers as part of a lessons learned project, a self-assigned effort to \"identify and preserve lessons from the US reconstruction experience in Afghanistan, and to make recommendations to Congress and executive agencies on ways to improve our efforts in current and future operations.\" Since 2015, SIGAR has published seven lessons learned reports on topics such as corruption, counternarcotics, and US efforts to reintegrate ex-combatants. The Washington Post obtained the interview notes and transcripts after submitting a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests beginning in August 2016. In response to an October 2017 lawsuit against SIGAR filed by the newspaper, SIGAR released the first document, a 10-page 2015 interview with Michael Flynn (who had served in several senior military capacities in Afghanistan). SIGAR subsequently released other requested documents to the Washington Post. After federal agencies reviewed the documents to determine whether they contained classified material, the final batch of interviews was delivered in August 2019. In total, SIGAR conducted 428 interviews with US, European, and Afghan officials. Sixty-two interviewees are identified while 366 are redacted; the Washington Post has sued SIGAR to disclose those names because, it argues, \"the public has a right to know which officials criticized the war.\" SIGAR contends that those individuals should be seen as whistleblowers and may face professional or other harm if their identities are made public. As of January 2020, a decision from the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, remains pending. In reviewing the Papers, which total roughly 2,000 pages and evade simple characterization, several key themes emerge, as outlined below. Dates in parentheses or noted in the text indicate when the interview was conducted. Quotes in this report, unless noted in the text as direct quotes from transcripts, are from SIGAR notes of interviews; CRS cannot independently verify or otherwise characterize the documents and the interviews the documents purport to describe. At least four of the named interviewees have contested the views attributed to them by SIGAR. The most frequently discussed subject in the SIGAR interviews was (a) the large sum of US money ($132 billion in development assistance since 2001) that poured into Afghanistan and (b) the extent to which much of it was reportedly wasted, stolen, exacerbated existing problems, or created new ones. Nearly every SIGAR interviewee who discussed the issue argued that Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest and least developed countries in 2001, was unable to make use of the amount of financial resources that the U.S. and its international partners channeled into the country. Variations of the phrase \"absorptive capacity\" were repeated throughout the interviews. \"Absorptive capacity\" refers to a nation's ability to translate foreign aid into physical, societal, or political change. CRS-3 As SIGAR's then-Inspector General John Sopko has noted, Afghanistan has been \"a broken country for 40 years\"", "BUDGETS AND APPROPRIATIONS. These reductions have been made in effect, for a total of about $150 billion over FY2012-FY2021 (through FY2020). </s> \nWhat were the arguments made by Congress members during the negotiations that led to the implementation of the Budget Control Act of 2011, and how did the budgetary policies and fiscal outcomes under this act impact the U.S. economy?</s> \nDuring the negotiations that led to the implementation of the Budget Control Act of 2011, Congress members argued about the growing federal budget deficit and the need for budget enforcement mechanisms to address it. Some members argued for more immediate spending cuts and reductions in entitlement programs, while others favored more balanced approaches involving both spending cuts and revenue increases. The outcome of the negotiations reflected these different perspectives, with deep spending cuts to several federal agencies and programs, as well as modest revenue increases. The final result was a compromise package that included mechanisms such as the creation of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, spending caps on federal agencies, and an across-the-board sequester if the committee failed to produce a deficit-reduction plan.\n\nOver the 10-year period (FY2012 to FY2021), the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in significant budgetary policy changes and fiscal outcomes. These include a decrease in federal spending as a share of GDP, with sequestrations totaling $1.4 trillion. This led to reductions in federal employment, as well as delays or cancellations in various federal programs and services. Revenue increases, including higher income taxes and fees, produced some revenue growth relative to GDP, but not enough to offset the loss of federal spending.\n\nThe implementation of the BCA had a significant impact on the U.S. economy, but it was not the only factor contributing to economic growth or decline during the 10-year period. The Great Recession of 2007-2009, the slow pace of economic recovery, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 were other important factors. However, the BCA's fiscal policies reduced federal spending, especially among key economic sectors such as defense and education, and increased taxes among certain segments of the population. These fiscal policies were implemented during a period when federal deficits and debt as shares of GDP were already relatively high, and some economists argue that these policies had a negative impact on economic growth.", "The text summarization of the given text is not clear.

Bolsonaro campaigned as a social conservative, a gun rights advocate, and a law-and-order leader who would take a hard line against crime in Brazil's notoriously violent cities. He also pledged to eliminate corruption and to promote job creation and economic growth through policies that favor market liberalism and prioritize state and private-sector partnership over social inclusion efforts. Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has served as minister of foreign relations since the outset of the Bolsonaro Administration, and a close group of 38 advisors--composed mainly of retired military personnel--has dominated policymaking on most fronts.

These lands include selected federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, all in the Department of the Interior (DOI); lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture; federal water projects; dredge disposal areas; and some military installations. Enacted in 1976, PILT is the broadest\u00e2\u0080\u0094in terms of federal land types covered\u00e2\u0080\u0094of several federal programs enacted to provide compensation to state or local governments for the presence of tax-exempt federal lands within their jurisdictions. PILT was enacted in response to a shift in federal policy from one that prioritized disposal of federal lands\u00e2\u0080\u0094one in which federal ownership was considered to be temporary\u00e2\u0080\u0094to one that prioritized retention of federal lands, in perpetuity, for public benefit. This shift began in the late 19 th century and continued into the 20 th century. Along with this shift came the understanding that, because these lands were exempt from state and local taxation and were no longer likely to return to the tax base in the foreseeable future, some compensation should be provided to the impacted local governments. Following several decades of commissions, studies, and proposed legislation, Congress passed PILT to at least partially ameliorate this hardship. PILT payments generally can be used for \"any governmental purpose,\" which could include assisting local governments with paying for local services, such as \"firefighting and police protection, construction of public schools and roads, and search-and-rescue operations.\" The Office of the Secretary in DOI is responsible for the calculation and disbursement of payments under PILT. Payments under PILT are made annually to units of general local government\u00e2\u0080\u0094typically counties, though other types of governmental units also may be used (hereinafter, counties refers to units of general local government)\u00e2\u0080\u0094containing entitlement lands. PILT comprises three separate payment mechanisms: Section 6902, Section 6904, and Section 6905 payments, all named for the sections of law in which they are authorized. Section 6902 payments account for nearly all payments made through PILT. The Section 6902 authorized payment amount for each county is calculated according to a statutory formula that is subject to a maximum payment based on the county's population (see \" PILT Payments Under Section 6902 \"). The remaining payments are provided through Section 6904 and Section 6905 under selected circumstances and typically are limited in duration. Through FY2019, PILT payments have totaled approximately $9.2 billion (in current dollars). Members of Congress routinely consider amending PILT within both appropriations and authorizing legislation. For example, legislation in the 116 th Congress would amend how PILT appropriations are provided and would change how payments are calculated under Section 6902. In addition, Members of Congress may address issues related to which federal lands should be eligible for payments under PILT. This report provides an overview of the PILT payment program and includes sections on PILT's authorization and appropriations, which discusses the history of how Congress has provided funding for PILT; Section 6902 payments, which includes a breakdown of how Section 6902 payments are calculated; Section 6904 and Section 6905 payments, which outlines what situations result in payments under these mechanisms; and issues for Congress, which discusses several topics that have been or may be of interest to Members of Congress when considering the future of PILT. Congress has funded PILT through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations at various times since the program was first authorized. Some stakeholders and policymakers have routinely expressed concern about changes in the appropriations source, both the process of switching between mandatory and discretionary appropriations and the uncertainty that may accompany such changes. From 1982 to 2008, Section 6906 provided an \"Authorization of Appropriations\" for PILT, which stated, \"Necessary amounts may be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior to carry out [PILT].\" Further, it clarified that \"amounts are available only as provided in appropriation laws.\" Congress amended this language in 2008 and changed the section title from \"Authorization of Appropriations\" to \"Funding.\" Further, Congress changed the text to read For each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012- (1) each county or other eligible unit of local government shall be entitled to payment under this chapter; and (2) sums shall be made available to the Secretary of the Interior for obligation or expenditure\n\nAre there any specific sections of the PILT report that you require to be summarized further", "The report discusses the economic impact of the transportation infrastructure funding that was provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Enacted on February 17, 2009, ARRA was a response to the recession that officially ran from December 2007 through June 2009. The report states that ARRA was the largest fiscal stimulus measure passed by Congress in reaction to the Great Recession. ARRA represented a 72% supplement to the Department of Transportation's regular FY2009 funding of $67.2 billion, and the highway funding was predominantly distributed by formula. The report states that most of the funding for public transportation was distributed by formula, and the $8 billion for high-speed and intercity rail projects was an entirely new discretionary program. The report states that ARRA also created an entirely new discretionary program whose explicit purpose was economic stimulus. Overall, ARRA demonstrated that infrastructure funding is generally spent more slowly than other types of assistance.", "", "Summary of an expert, text-based document on Funding for Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Independent Agencies in Title V of FSGG appropriations bill.", "TEXT:\nThe act, which is an emergency supplemental appropriations and relief bill, includes provisions related to the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) COVID-19 response efforts, as well as increased funding for the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nProvisions related to the PPP and EIDL include increases in the amount set aside for loans by small financial institutions, certain types of entities, and those with gross receipts less than $20 million.

Oil-related sanctions are one option that could be used to apply economic pressure on certain countries in order to achieve broader geopolitical and foreign policy objectives. Currently, the United States has active economic sanctions imposed on three major oil-producing and exporting countries: Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. Combined, these countries produced approximately 17.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2018 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 approximately 18% of total world oil production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 according to one estimate. Only a portion of these supply volumes might be directly affected by U.S. economic sanctions in the near future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 potentially ranging from 3.3 million to 4.0 million bpd from both Iran (estimated to be 2.8 million bpd) and Venezuela (estimated to range from 0.5 million to as much as 1.2 million bpd). Estimated oil production volumes affected to date have been approximately 1.7 million bpd from Iran. Venezuela oil production has likely also been affected, although accurately quantifying volumes is challenging due to monthly oil production declines that had been occurring over a period of years prior to U.S. sanctions affecting oil trade in January 2019. A sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements (both upward and downward) for crude oil and related petroleum products (e.g., gasoline and diesel fuel). To date, oil supply impacts related to economic sanctions have not generally resulted in significant upward price pressure for benchmark oil prices. Generally, sanctions-related supply losses have been counterbalanced by increased production and exports from the United States, Russia, and other countries; petroleum trade flow adjustments; indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates; and design elements of oil-related sanctions. Oil sanctions frameworks can include wind-down periods, requirements to consider and certify that global oil supply is adequate to compensate for supply reductions, and engagement with other oil producers before applying certain sanctions. These design elements are intended to mitigate sanctions-related market and price impacts and to build into the sanctions regime multilateral coordination and cooperation. Oil-related economic sanctions for each respective country discussed in this report differ in terms of design and potential market impacts. As a result, each framework is likely to have a different effect on oil production, trade, and potentially price levels. Generally, each sanctions framework is structured to reduce \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either immediately or in the future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oil sales revenue to the subject country. Since 2011, sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector have aimed to eliminate the country's oil export revenue. Sanctions applied to Russia's oil sector generally target long-term, high-risk oil production projects. Venezuela sanctions imposed to date prohibit petroleum trade with the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0094 historically one of the primary destinations for Venezuela's oil exports \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and have the potential to affect Venezuela's petroleum trade with other countries.\n\nVenezuela is currently experiencing significant oil-sector constraints\u00e2\u0080\u0094which could be exacerbated by recently imposed U.S. sanctions. Although oil production and exports from Venezuela may face severe constraints, additional U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil sector could be imposed, which may further hamper Venezuela's ability to produce oil and to export  it.\n\nIn contrast, oil production and trade in Russia and Iran may face different limitations, as evidenced by the current oil-related sanctions framework imposed by the United States. As shown in Table 1, current U.S. economic sanctions affect both countries and are likely to continue to do so. However, the scope and magnitude of the effects on oil production and trade will depend on the design elements of the U.S. sanctions regimes, the reaction by affected private sector companies and foreign governments, and the evolution of global oil supply and demand dynamics. Factors affecting oil markets (such as the level of global oil demand and supply, the U.S. dollar exchange rates, and global macroeconomic and political developments) could also play a role in determining the magnitude of the effects of economic sanctions on the overall economies of all three countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of U.S, sanctions targeting oil sectors of countries such as Iran, Venezuela, and Russia could have varied effects on oil markets, countries' economies, and foreign relations. The impact of economic sanctions on oil production, supply, and trade in target countries and the resulting market impacts could vary depending on how the sanctions frameworks are designed and implemented, as well as on many other factors.", "TEXT: Under this assumption, we can provide only a summary of important events in the development and spread of the new financial services markets that came to dominate the consumer credit markets, the automobile market, and the subprime housing market.

Therefore, an investigation related to the conduct of a Member of Congress of his official duties would not be appropriate for consideration under the rules discussed below. Similarly, investigations of a sitting Member of Congress or a staff member working for a Member in connection with that Member\u00e2s job performance is not appropriate. The House maintains a separate process for exercising its powers of \u00e2inherent contempt\u00e2 (i.e., citing a person into custody of the House) in the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, and that process is not discussed in the report on impeachment. It may also be inappropriate to discuss impeachment relating to the conduct of a former Member in connection with official duties. The House has considered these types of cases before, but a former Member of Congress or a former staff member under investigation have generally resigned or been defeated for re-election before such matters were resolved. Finally, in the early years of the Republic, the federal judiciary had limited authority, including limited jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court had little power or influence. (During those times, impeachments of judges were much more commonplace and often resulted in resignations.) In recent years, however, such actions would raise serious problems of constitutional interpretation and practice. Therefore, none of these issues are addressed in this report. The decision by the House to conduct an impeachment investigation does not mean that impeachment is inevitable. Many inquiries begin on the basis of investigative leads generated by journalists, interest groups, or other citizens. In such cases, the committee and the House leadership have historically been sensitive to the source of the referral. (The committee and the House as a whole tend to be more hesitant when a resolution seeking an impeachment resolution has its origin in a political dispute; they do give more weight to such a resolution when it is referred by a member of the House leadership.) After 1807, the House resolved that it would \"in general\" require \"the charges of the impeaching resolution to originate\" in the Judiciary Committee or to be \"adopted\" by a committee vote. That rule did not bind subsequent Houses, and it was repealed in 1993. Instead, House Practice \u00e2 which, once adopted, does bind subsequent Houses \u00e2 permits the referral of a resolution to impeach to be made by any Member in good standing (not barred from sitting on a committee). Such resolutions may originate from a committee, a group of Members (the House does not have joint resolutions of impeachment, although joint resolutions seeking censure of a Member are common, and the same procedures would apply to a joint resolution seeking to impeach an officer for \u00e2\u00a6 6 Congressional Research Service 7 Summary: House and Senate Impeachment Proceedings Impeachable Offenses) or be referred to a select committee if a resolution establishing such a committee has passed. The House does not require that a committee investigation be completed before voting to impeach federal officials. Furthermore, the House can decide to discharge the responsibility of investigating allegations of impeachable offences itself instead of appointing a subcommittee to conduct an investigation\u00e2this, too, may be done by a simple affirmative vote, whether the subcommittee is to be appointed on the floor or in committee. The committee that is authorized to conduct the impeachment investigation, or a House select committee created solely for the purpose of conducting impeachment proceedings, may consist of Members from just one chamber but a majority of any committee authorized by the House to investigate matters for the purpose of a House rule of impeachment must be Democrats. The Committee on the Judiciary, or a similarly constituted select committee, must be the principal body authorized to conduct the impeachment investigation. However, in conducting its investigation of an impeachment, a committee may create a special panel of seven Members, which is the number needed to prepare and report articles of impeachment. The special panel could include both Members of the committee and non-Members of any other committees, without regard to party affiliation. The special panel would report its work to the Judiciary Committee, which would be responsible for crafting and offering the articles to the House. If the Judiciary is appointed as the committee of inquiry, it will need to appoint a subcommittee to report a resolution impeaching a Member. When all three Members of a select committee are from the House, its rules and precedents allow the adoption of committee rules for a select committee for any purpose \u00e2 including impeachment \u2013 that are generally applicable to the House. A select committee can be created in a House rule, passed with a simple majority, in order to consider articles of impeachment and prepare impeachment resolutions, if directed to do so by another House resolution. After 1807, the House had a long-standing precedent allowing joint resolutions to impeach. That rule was rescinded in 1993. A joint resolution can impeach a President, Vice President, judge, Cabinet Secretary, and Ambassador from his or her office. It, too, could be raised by a select committee.

Source: Congressional Budget Office. eligibility criteria for awarding grants (such as the minimum and maximum amounts awardable in a single year) have been adjusted in the annual appropriations act each year. What Congress chooses to include (e.g., the emphasis on rural projects or transit and passenger rail projects in FY2019) may reflect a sense by lawmakers about the priorities in a particular year. Most years Congress has authorized DOT to make grants to projects selected based on its consideration of merit criteria. At the time of the project selection, Congress typically instructs DOT to give priority to projects that address certain national objectives (such as those related to safety, the environment, or economic revitalization) or target certain populations. In FY2020. Congress added a new requirement that the program prioritize projects that address \"climate change mitigation, resilience, or adaptation,\" in addition to those that address other national objectives such as safety, economic competitiveness, environmental protection or sustainability, and accessibility. This report examines trends over the ten-year life of the program, including changes in award sizes, the overall distribution of grant awards, the project types receiving grants, and the share of grants going to projects outside large metropolitan areas. (Although Congress authorized the creation of the program in 2009, no grants were awarded before ARRA was approved in the spring of 2009. This report uses the term \"first year\" to refer to the first round of grant awards, after the program was created in 2009.)\nThe most recent awards represent the sixth round of the program, funded by the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 DOT appropriations bill (Public Law No. 116-110). In September 2020, DOT announced the results of the sixth round of awards, identifying 51 meritorious projects totaling $517 million to receive funds, 36 of which were new awards in new programs, meaning they did not benefit from awards in previous years.1 The sixth round of awards is the first in the Trump Administration. Although the President does not have input directly into the grant selection process, the new Administration's agenda for DOT is in some ways different from the previous Administration: its policy is to promote the use of tax-free highway finance options, such as private activity bonds; its FY2020 Appropriations Act eliminates funding for three programs that provide a limited capacity for financing state and local transit and highway projects through federal grants; and its March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act made $14 billion in TIGER funds available to States for COVID-19 highway and transit funding with special emphasis on rural areas.2 These changes may have affected the types of projects receiving TIGER grant funds.

H.R. 6455 would allow a $10,000 honorarium. H.R. 6440 would not provide compensation, unless otherwise authorized by law. H.R. 6431 would prohibit compensation, in conformity with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. H.R. 6429 and H.R. 6548 would not provide compensation. In addition to compensation, previous congressional commissions might also have reimbursed member travel expenses. For example, the commission that oversaw the 1917 Bonus Army encampment reimbursed members who were veterans for travel expenses. H.R. 6429 and H.R. 6455 would prohibit the commission from reimbursing congressional members for their travel expenses. H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548 would not reimburse members for travel expenses. Previous congressional advisory commissions typically have been comprised of approximately equal parts of members of each party. The four Republican-sponsored bills (H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, and H.R. 6548) each require that the political appointments be split between the two parties. H.R. 6455, by contrast, would not require equal partisan balance. Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, every advisory commission must be balanced in its composition to reflect the balanced opinions of the public. As such, a commission may not be established in which one political party holds a majority of the membership. In general, these provisions could make it far more difficult to create and maintain a truly bipartisan commission. In addition to restrictions on the partisan balance of the commission, some previous congressional advisory commissions restricted the balance of the specific occupations or interests represented among the membership. For example, the President's Commission on the Status of Women (1961-1972) restricted its membership to women. The Commission on Presidential Debates (1986-2004) required that there be a mix of party labels, as well as a mix of professional backgrounds (e.g., academics, reporters, elected officials). In some instances, congressional commissions have included provisions that specify particular individuals by name who shall be appointed. For example, in 1987, the 102 nd Congress established the Commission on the Administrative Conference of the United States (COACUS) and required that a particular group of individuals be appointed to the commission. There is precedent for a provision requiring the appointment of certain individuals. For example, the House Committee Reform Commission established by the 99 th Congress specified particular individuals who should be seated on the commission. Similarly, the Federal Ethics Reform Commission created by the 91 st Congress listed three individuals by name who should be appointed to the commission. For the most part, the proposed COVID-19 commissions would require the use of a merit-based appointment process. However, H.R. 6455 would reserve a commission seat for a person recognized for his or her leadership concerning infectious disease research and another for a medical expert with a record of leadership regarding public health in a local jurisdiction. If enacted, it remains highly unlikely that Congress will fund a fifth coronavirus commission. While not explicitly prohibited, only two instances have ever been mentioned where Congress created two separate panels of experts in the same or subsequent Congresses\u2014 in 1937 and 2001\u2014 to consider an identical subject matter. 2 of 19 There is no question that the coronavirus pandemic (and the policies implemented in response to it) have been historic in scale and scope. However, the five proposed COVID-19 commissions might arguably also be historic in their scale and scope. Specifically, three provisions are notable: the size of the commission (in terms of membership), the breadth of commission authority and powers, and the expected work product or final report of the commission. The five proposals for COVID-19 commissions could create entities that rank among the largest congressional advisory commissions in history. In general, past commissions have included between five to eight members. By contrast, the five proposals for COVID-19 commissions would lead to the creation of entities that are more than three times larger, with 10 to 25 members. In many ways, the large size of the commission might be understandable: The pandemic is a complex, multifaceted policy issue that requires input from several different perspectives. However, it is also noteworthy that the current size of the five proposals is out of step with many previous congressional commissions, which were smaller. Previous congressional commissions have often had 10 members (H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R", "On May 23, 2019, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that USDA would undertake a second round of trade aid in 2019 to assist farmers in response to trade damage from continued tariff retaliation and trade disruptions.", "In today's text, it's mentioned that about 2 million Americans lack access to running water, indoor plumbing, or wastewater services.

Such efforts include feasibility studies and construction initiatives to better deliver the services to the targeted communities. However, the funding has been insufficient, and Congress may need to look at other avenues to provide the necessary resources for these communities.", "The writer has to write 400 words on the given topic.

As common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, railroad companies built hundreds of thousands of miles of track across the country offering both freight and passenger transportation, making the distinction between a freight railroad and a passenger railroad a relatively recent one. Federal regulation was important in the industry's development. The Hepburn Act of 1906 authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate maximum interstate passenger fares to ensure that they were \"just and reasonable.\" The Transportation Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-625, 72 Stat. 571) gave the ICC authority to allow a railroad to discontinue passenger service on a line while continuing freight service. By the mid-20 th century, passenger services faced increased competition from jet airliners offering faster travel times and private automobiles offering convenient access to a network of new federally funded highways. The rail industry's worsening financial health meant that infrastructure conditions also worsened as maintenance was deferred, contributing to reduced speeds and reliability. With ridership declining, the ICC permitted railroads to discontinue many passenger services and focus on carrying freight. In an effort to shore up flagging passenger rail service, Congress passed the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-221), creating an office in the Department of Commerce to foster research and development of new transportation technologies (the Department of Transportation did not yet exist). This contributed to the establishment of the nation's fastest rail service, the Metroliner, on the Washington, DC, to New York City portion of the Northeast Corridor (NEC), when that line was still under private ownership. In the years since, Congress has taken an active role in preserving and improving passenger rail service. Although ridership is much lower than in the heyday of long-distance trains, the federal government continues to support passenger rail through a variety of grants, loans, and tax preferences. There continues to be debate over whether federal subsidies for passenger rail are justified, given competing alternatives by air or highway that dominate most intercity travel markets (though these alternatives may also receive subsidies). The Trump Administration has called for \"the end of the [federal] Government subsidizing operating losses\" on passenger trains, shifting decisionmaking and cost responsibility to states. As several freight railroads, including the Pennsylvania Central, the nation's largest, entered bankruptcy in 1970, Congress created Amtrak\u00e2\u0080\u0094officially, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0094to preserve a basic level of intercity passenger rail service, while relieving private railroad companies of the obligation to run passenger trains that had lost money for decades. Amtrak is structured as a private company, but virtually all of its shares are held by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT). Amtrak owned no infrastructure at the time of its creation. It was originally structured as a contracting agency, and Amtrak trains were operated by private railroads over tracks they owned. Under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (4R Act) of 1976, ownership of the NEC was transferred from the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad to Amtrak. At the same time, Congress initiated the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program, which required travel times of 3 hours and 40 minutes between New York and Boston, and of 2 hours and 40 minutes between New York and Washington, by 1981. While the act funded many improvements along the corridor, these goals were not achieved. The law that created Amtrak also stipulated that Amtrak pay host railroads for the incremental costs specific to Amtrak's usage of tracks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, the additional track maintenance costs required for passenger trains. Amtrak is not required to contribute to a freight railroad's overhead costs. Then, in 1973, Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in using a rail line, junction, or crossing ( P.L. 93-146, \u00c2\u00a710(2), 87 Stat. 548), but Amtrak has been unable to enforce this preference to ensure that host railroads operate its trains on schedule. Several railroads continued to operate long-distance passenger services after 1970 rather than contracting with Amtrak. The last of these services was discontinued in 1983. Amtrak itself discontinued a number of the routes it originally operated, but has been required by Congress to maintain a \"national network\" of long-distance trains. Amtrak has received federal funds to cover operating losses and capital expenditures since its creation. In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA, P.L. 102-240", "The National Security Space Launch program aims to acquire launch services and ensure continued access to space for critical national security missions. DOD implemented the original program in 1995 using four companies to produce two rocket families. The current program consists of the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy, provided by United Launch Alliance, and Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, provided by SpaceX. The focus of the program is providing reliable and cost-effective access to space for NSS missions.", "Congress maintains an ongoing interest in the pace of U.S. innovation and technological advancement due to its influence on the economy, national security, public health, and other national goals. Historically, the federal government has played a significant role in supporting research and development (R&amp;D)\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially basic research\u00e2\u0080\u0094that has led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. The global landscape for innovation is rapidly evolving\u00e2\u0080\u0094the pace of innovation has increased and the composition of R&amp;D funding has changed (i.e., private R&amp;D investments are larger than public R&amp;D investments and the U.S. share of global R&amp;D has declined). These changes have led some to call for new approaches and the expansion of existing mechanisms to help the United States maintain its leadership role in innovation and technology. One mechanism that has received some attention is the possibility of establishing additional agency-related entities that would facilitate the use of private donations in federally generated research projects. In addition, such entities might play a role in the commercialization of new technologies. The potential establishment of such entities in statute raises several questions: What kinds of organizations has Congress established in the past to address similar needs in the federal government? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these potential models? What are the opportunities and risks of developing a new entity for federal R&D using one of these models? The varied organizational arrangements of the executive branch have resulted from more than two centuries of legislative and administrative actions. These arrangements reflect a diversity of viewpoints, policy preferences, and political goals among the thousands of elected and appointed officials who have played a role in creating and shaping them. During the middle of the 20 th century, hybrid organizational forms\u00e2\u0080\u0094incorporating both public and private characteristics\u00e2\u0080\u0094began to grow in number. These organizational forms, sometimes collectively referred to as \"quasi-governmental entities,\" differ from one another in their specific features, relationship to the federal government, funding mechanisms, purposes, levels of accountability to elected officials, and use of private sector incentives and efficiencies, among other characteristics. Agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations fall into this category of organizations. Working with successive administrations, Congress has established, or provided for the establishment of, many quasi-governmental entities. Some of the considerations that contributed to their creation and development were linked to political and policymaking dynamics that were idiosyncratic to the specific time and issue at hand. Nonetheless, observers have identified some common purposes for, and expected benefits of, establishing such entities: providing for stable funding during federal budget tightening and uncertainty; freeing a program from general government management laws, particularly those pertaining to caps on personnel and compensation; harnessing business principles and mechanisms with the aim of providing government-driven solutions without the \"red tape\" associated with the federal bureaucracy; and providing authorities tailored to the desired mission and functions that allow flexible approaches not typically allowed under statutes or regulations, such as those in the area of financial management. In comparison to traditional government agencies, quasi-governmental entities of various kinds have been touted for their potential to harness business-like entrepreneurial incentives and drive, greater managerial flexibility, and increased employee input in decisionmaking to better carry out the entity's responsibilities. As quasi-governmental organizations have grown in number and variety, some observers have criticized the exemption from government management laws of many such entities. A complex legal framework has been established over time to guide government agencies so that their actions adhere to the values of democratic governance, such as accountability, transparency, and fairness. It might be difficult for stakeholders to verify on an ongoing basis that the activities of a quasi-governmental entity, established by statute and vested with the power to carry out some public purpose, are directed to the public good rather than private gain without the routine accountability and transparency provided by this legal framework. Many of these laws and regulations specify the processes by which action must be taken. Some have criticized such governmental processes as \"red tape,\" particularly in cases where they appear to have been applied overzealously, slowly, or seemingly without regard for an individual's or business's need for a service or flexibility. Arguably, quasi-governmental entities involve a tradeoff: What appears to some to be red tape during an administrative encounter may appear to others to be an essential accountability or transparency mechanism. Most federal agencies are funded through the annual appropriations process, and Congress has sometimes used the \"power of the purse\" to influence agency priorities and activities. Most federal agencies are headed by appointees of the President subject to Senate advice and consent, and the confirmation process provides Senators with an opportunity to discuss agency issues and concerns with these leaders. Congress establishes, or provides for the establishment of, quasi-governmental entities, but it might not have the same level of influence over them as it does over conventional federal agencies.

Two years later, the intelligence analysis community judged that al Qaeda was preparing to strike the United States before the middle of 2004. Following the attack of September 11, 2001, the Border Patrol initiated the Integrated Security and Advanced Technology Enhancement Strategy (ISAVE). This plan, released by the Border Patrol in June 2002, outlined 11 initiatives to be pursued during the next five years (through FY 2007). The initiative that received the most attention focused on the construction of physical barriers along the international border with Mexico. The ISAVE plan included several categories of border barrier design. The plan called for the construction of vehicle barriers, including barriers in El Paso, Texas and Nogales, Arizona, designed to slow vehicle traffic and impede illegal migration. The ISAVE plan called for vehicle barriers in San Diego, California as well. The vehicle barriers did not significantly impede pedestrian traffic; people could climb over or go around the barriers. The vehicle barriers were designed to slow the arrival of vehicles carrying unauthorized migrants, and to improve the likelihood of apprehension by providing agents more time and space to intercept people and vehicles before they reached the primary immigration inspection station. The ISAVE plan recommended the construction of secondary walls or barriers to impede pedestrians, which would slow human traffic. The secondary barriers were intended to impede the arrival of vehicles and people carrying illegal migrants, and would provide agents additional time and space to detain those apprehended before they reached the primary inspection station. The ISAVE plan called for improvements to primary and secondary border barriers in El Paso and Nogales. These barriers were intended to impede vehicle traffic and pedestrian traffic. The ISAVE plan called for enhanced physical barriers along many segments of the border, which would include both vertical and horizontal barriers. However, under this initiative, the Border Patrol had no clear priority for these locations. Rather, the Border Patrol assessed which portions of the border required physical barriers, and in what priority, in dialogue with members of Congress and their staffs. The plan acknowledged the possibility that the Border Patrol might need to increase the number of border patrol agents, and suggested that technology improvements or alternative systems for identifying people and vehicles might also be considered as alternatives or complements to construction of physical barriers. Congress appropriated $1.8 billion for construction of border barriers (in addition to its general appropriations for border security) in response to the Border Patrol's strategic plan and other border security proposals, and allocated another $32 million for barrier technology research and development. This border barrier authorization included funding to complete primary and secondary vehicle barriers that were underway in San Diego (and had previously received $6 million in FY 2002 and FY 2003, before the passage of the consolidated appropriations bill in January 2004), and to initiate construction of physical barriers in El Paso and Nogales. These funds were allocated among projects to construct vehicle barriers, pedestrian barriers, and technology enhancements. By the end of FY 2004, 13.5 miles of vehicle barriers were under construction, and by the end of FY 2005, 14.3 miles of vehicle barriers were complete, a significant portion in San Diego. The Border Patrol's FY 2005 budget request included an expansion of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 in response to the requirements for \"fencing and other infrastructure (consistent with the President's Border Security Initiative)\" and the Secure Fence Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-13). The Border Patrol plan identified additional priorities for future barrier construction. The request described a process whereby future construction of physical barriers along the international border with Mexico would be prioritized by consultation between Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and members of Congress and their staff, working in conjunction with state, local, and tribal officials. In February 2006, the Border Patrol issued a preliminary request for bids for a technology procurement program associated with border barrier construction. The request for proposal (RFP) included provisions for construction of pedestrian and vehicle barriers. The Department of Homeland Security exercised an option to purchase approximately 14.5 miles of vehicle barrier designs in four segments. The purchase option included 6.5 miles in each of the San Diego, Calexico, and El Paso areas and 1.5 miles in Nogales. Later in 2006, the Border Patrol developed a new border security plan, the Border Patrol Sectors Operations Plan (BP-SOP). This plan recommended the development of sector operations plans to \"address specific border security concerns\" and \"improve enforcement and operational effectiveness.\" In many respects, the BP-SOP concept was a continuation of the Border Patrol's ongoing efforts to develop \"new strategies and tactics to counter changing conditions along the border.\" The approach is somewhat flexible; the Border Patrol has indicated that \"sector", "THE US FARM SECTOR PAGE 1 2019 were the highest since 1993, when the government sought to address the farm sector's financial crisis brought on by the 1988 market crash. Because the trade dispute with China remains unresolved, USDA expects direct payments to remain high, at $19.1 billion, in 2020. However, net cash income in 2020 is forecast to be near its lowest level since 2002 ( Figure 26). In contrast, net farm income is forecast to be high enough to rank in the top 20% of its historical distribution ( Figure 29). Government payments would have been lower in 2020 absent the trade dispute with China because the market price for some crops (for example, soybeans) is expected to return to historical norms. However, payments would have had to be increased from recent levels to offset income declines projected to arise from the trade dispute and from its expected effects on U.S. farm prices. Net farm income for 2020 is forecast to be lower than net farm income for 2019 ($96.7 billion vs. $109.6 billion) but higher than net farm income for 2018 ($88.7 billion)\"", "Summarize this text. TEXT: The 116 th Congress continues its interest in U.S. research and development (R&D) and in evaluating support for federal R&D activities. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites, shale gas extraction, and defenses against disease. In recent years, federal budget caps have driven executive and legislative branch decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, among other things, increased the previously established FY2020 and FY2021 discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending. This act reduced some of the budgetary constraints affecting R&D decisions. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D. Its purposes include addressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of the R&D activities of these agencies. There is no single, centralized source of R&D funds. Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process. R&D funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to R&D or in accounts that also include funding for non-R&D activities. Agency budgets are subjected to review, revision, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and become part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The federal R&D budget is then calculated by aggregating the R&D activities of each federal agency. Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of R&D funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094overall, within agencies, and for specific programs. In recent years, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending (for R&D and for other purposes) in light of the federal deficit and debt. Other Members of Congress have expressed support for increased federal spending for R&D as an investment in the nation's future competitiveness. As Congress acts to complete the FY2021 appropriations process, it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal R&D and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding. This report begins with a discussion of the overall level of R&D in President Trump's FY2021 budget request, followed by analyses of R&D funding in the request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency R&D initiatives. The remainder of the report discusses and analyzes the R&D budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that, collectively, account for approximately 98% of total federal R&D funding. Selected terms associated with federal R&D funding are defined in the text box on the next page. Appendix A provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations. On February 10, 2020, President Trump released his proposed FY2021 budget. President Trump is proposing $142.2 billion for R&D for FY2021, a decrease of $13.8 billion (8.8%) below the FY2020 level of $156.0 billion. Adjusted for inflation to FY2021 dollars, the President's FY2021 R&D request represents a constant-dollar decrease of 10.6% from the FY2020 actual level. The President's request includes continued R&D funding for existing single-agency and multiagency programs and activities, as well as new initiatives. This report provides government-wide, multiagency, and individual agency analyses of the President's FY2021 request as it relates to R&D and related activities. Additional information and analysis will be included as the House and Senate act on the President's budget request through appropriations bills. It is not yet clear how the national response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will affect Administration and congressional priorities for FY2021 R&D funding, or the congressional authorization and appropriations processes for enacting that funding.", "", "This report identifies and examines issues associated with small refinery exemptions for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The question and answer format presents information about the RFS and small refinery exemptions, such as the exemption process, challenges to agency decisions and a summary of recent rulemakings.", "ABANDONED COAL MINES AND OVERVIEW OF SMCRA AND H.R. 1747\nCoal mining and production in the United States during in the 20th century contributed to the nation meeting its energy requirements and left a legacy of unreclaimed lands. Prior to the enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, no federal law had authorized reclamation requirements for coal mining operators to restore lands and waters affected by mining practices. Title IV of SMCRA established the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program to address the public health, safety, and environmental hazards at these legacy abandoned coal mining sites. The objective of reclamation under Title IV of SMCRA is to restore lands or waters adversely affected by past coal mining to a condition that would mitigate potential hazards to public health, safety, and the environment. The actions necessary to attain these objectives may vary from site to site depending on the nature of the hazards and the technical or engineering feasibility of reclamation alternatives to mitigate the hazards. The severity of the hazard would also determine the prioritization of funding for reclamation. Examples of reclamation activities include removing or stabilizing coal mining waste piles, re-contouring and re-vegetating affected lands, mitigating the potential for subsidence, filling voids or sealing tunnels, and treating acid mine drainage. The costs to complete reclamation at a particular site would depend on the scope and nature of actions necessary to mitigate the potential hazards and any technical or engineering challenges to implement the selected actions. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, established under Section 401 of SMCRA, provides funding to eligible states and tribes for the reclamation of surface mining impacts associated with historical mining of coal. Title IV of SMCRA applies only to sites that were abandoned or left unreclaimed prior to the enactment of SMCRA on August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under other federal or state law. SMCRA also established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) in the Department of the Interior. OSMRE is the federal office responsible for administering SMCRA in coordination with eligible states and tribes. The balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is provided by fees collected on coal mining operators in coal producing states. The fee rates in current law are based on a per-ton fee for the volume of coal produced at a mine annually or the percentage value of the coal produced at a mine, whichever is less each year as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. SMCRA authorizes annual grants to eligible states and tribes for the reclamation of abandoned coal mining sites. SMCRA also authorizes two sources of federal financial assistance to three United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) coal mineworker health benefits plans and the UMWA pension plan. These federal payments augment employer contributions to these plans. Interest transfers from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund have supported the UMWA health benefit plans since FY1996, supplemented by payments from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury since FY2008. As amended in the 116th Congress, SMCRA authorizes additional General Fund payments to support the UMWA pension plan. The coal reclamation fee collection authorization is set to expire at the end of FY2021 absent the enactment of legislation extending the sunset date. If the authority to collect reclamation fees is not reauthorized, SMCRA directs the remaining balance of the fund to be distributed among states and tribes receiving grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund based on the FY2022 grant amounts. The FY2022 grant amounts would depend on the fees collected in FY2021, and payments from the fund would begin in FY2023, continuing annually until the balance has been expended. Given that scenario, reclamation grants to eligible states would continue for some years. This report discusses funding for eligible states and tribes, reclamation priorities, annual receipts and appropriations, reauthorization issues, and other related bills that would authorize the use of the existing balance of the fund. This report does not discuss issues associated with Title V of SMCRA, which authorized the regulation of coal mining sites operating after the law's enactment. SMCRA requires coal mining operators regulated under Title V to be responsible for providing financial assurance for completing site reclamation. Coal mining sites regulated under SMCRA after August 3, 1977, are ineligible for grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. If financial assurances are inadequate to meet reclamation needs, the availability of federal funding to pay reclamation costs would be subject to the enactment of legislation.
