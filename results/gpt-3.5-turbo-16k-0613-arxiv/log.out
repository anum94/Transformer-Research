["Noncommutative gauge theories, which emerge from string theory, have dynamics that are not well understood compared to ordinary gauge theories. The main difficulty is that noncommutative quantum field theories are highly nonlocal. The nonlocality arises from dipole degrees of freedom with a spatial extent proportional to their momentum. This gives rise to a phenomenon called UV-IR mixing, where UV dipoles grow in size and dominate long-distance interactions. UV-IR mixing causes difficulties in the conventional treatment of noncommutative theories, such as renormalization and Wilsonian integration. The gauge invariance of noncommutative theories requires an infinite summation of diagrams. In contrast, in the matrix formulation of noncommutative gauge theory, gauge invariance is manifest and the dipole nature of the elementary quanta is clear. The matrix approach allows for a separation of UV and IR effects, and the interactions resulting from integrating out UV states have been calculated. It has been shown that the leading long-distance interactions cancel in each order of perturbation theory for supersymmetric theories. Nonetheless, there are still many unanswered questions, such as the analysis of higher orders of perturbation theory and the issue of renormalizability. In this work, the authors continue to develop", "The article discusses the importance of tracing back the evolution of galaxies to when they were formed. It mentions the use of multicolor techniques to select young galaxies and the discovery of actively star-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. The article also discusses the role of dust extinction in optical deep surveys of protogalaxies and the importance of studying the cosmic infrared background radiation. It then goes on to discuss galaxy evolution at low redshift and the increase of comoving star formation rate with redshift. The article mentions the advances provided by all-sky surveys and the infrared space observatory in understanding the properties of star-forming galaxies. It also introduces the infrared imaging surveyor as a next-generation infrared satellite. The article then describes a model for galaxy spectral energy distribution and the calculation of FIR galaxy counts based on different sets of cosmological and evolutionary parameters. The paper concludes by discussing the expected number counts and redshift distributions of galaxies in future missions such as SOFIA, SIRTF, FIRST, and LMSA.", "The article discusses the use of micro- and nano-structured surfaces for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). It highlights the challenges in controlling the SERS enhancement due to random plasmon distribution. The article proposes the use of nanovoids, such as pyramidal pits, to achieve tunable Raman enhancement. The article describes the geometry of the pyramidal pits and its resemblance to an optical resonator. It discusses the different theories explaining the intensity enhancement in sub-wavelength apertures and the use of a v-shaped slit as a simplification for the pyramidal pit. The article presents the formulation used to calculate the diffraction problem in the v-shaped slit and the resulting green functions. It also discusses the resonant intensity enhancement and the formation of vortices in the cavity. The article concludes that the v-shaped slit acts as an optical resonator with intensity enhancement determined by near-field effects, and that different laser wavelengths can lead to different Raman enhancement in this geometry.", "The study re-examines the initial configuration of the giant planets in the solar system and their subsequent evolution. It determines that the most likely initial configuration is a 3:2 resonance between Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus and a 2:1 resonance between Uranus and Neptune. Additionally, it explores the possibility of a late planetary instability and finds that it is possible under certain conditions. However, the specific dust flux required for this late instability is uncertain and further research is needed. Overall, the study provides new insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system.", "Observations of the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines, polarized dust emission, starlight polarization, radio synchrotron emission, and Faraday rotation can reveal the magnetic fields of celestial objects. These approaches have been used to detect the strength and orientation of magnetic fields in molecular clouds, as well as the orientation of transverse magnetic fields in the interstellar medium. Pulsars and extragalactic radio sources are particularly useful for studying the galactic magnetic field on a large scale. The distribution of rotation measures from these sources reveals the azimuthal field configuration of an a0 dynamo in the halo, with field reversals above and below the galactic plane. Pulsars have been used to study the large-scale magnetic field structure in the galactic disk, showing a bi-symmetric spiral field with reversed directions from arm to arm. Overall, pulsars are important probes for detecting large-scale interstellar fields.", "This paper explores the theoretical exploration of the triggering and injection scenario for short-lived radioisotopes (SLRIs) in chondritic refractory inclusions. The study focuses on shock waves striking a dense molecular cloud core, which could have collapsed to form the solar system. The results show that shock waves with speeds in the range of 5 km/sec to 70 km/sec are able to simultaneously induce collapse of the cloud core and inject shock wave material into it. However, the injection efficiency is low, and more research is needed to increase it to levels consistent with observations. The study also considers the implications for the star formation environment where triggering and injection might have occurred. Future work will include 3D models and experiments with different shock front and target cloud parameters to better understand this process.", "The authors propose a quantum coherent Otto engine, which takes advantage of quantum coherence and correlations to enhance work output and efficiency. They suggest using a biomimetic design inspired by the natural solution of long range quantum coherence in photosynthesis. The working substance of the engine is a generalized Rabi model, consisting of a central two-level system coupled to a large ensemble of two-level systems. The authors analyze the behavior of coherence and correlations in the working substance and find that positive work can be obtained when there are strong quantum correlations at the end of the cold reservoir stage and when the system is more correlated in the cold reservoir stage than in the hot reservoir stage. They also discuss the implementation of the proposed engine in a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics system and provide estimations of the power output and efficiency.", "The observed accelerated expansion of the late-time universe has surprised cosmologists, as it requires explanations such as introducing a cosmological constant or a dark energy component. Another explanation is that general relativity is only accurate on small scales and needs to be modified on cosmological distances. One example of this is the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane-world model, in which gravity leaks off the brane into the bulk space-time. It is difficult to distinguish between a scenario involving dark energy and the DGP model. The growth rate of structures has been proposed as a possible way to distinguish between the two, but this paper argues that it is not sufficient to do so. The paper also explores how dark energy perturbations influence dark matter and metric perturbations, and provides an example of a dark energy model that reproduces the metric perturbations of the DGP scenario. It concludes that the growth factor is not enough to distinguish between modified gravity and dark energy models, and that other cosmological observables would be needed to do so.", "In this study, the authors investigate the local-field correction to the spontaneous-decay rate of an excited atom in a dielectric medium. They consider the case of an atom embedded in a spherical dielectric body, but the results can also be applied to atoms in arbitrary dielectric bodies. The authors use a born expansion of the green tensor to calculate the local-field correction. They find that the local-field corrected decay rate can be separated into two terms: one representing the correction to the decay rate in free space, and one related to the scattering green tensor of the body without the atom. The authors compare their results with previous studies and find good agreement, while also providing a more general formula that applies to atoms in arbitrary dielectric bodies.", "High contrast imaging has allowed for the first direct images of young extrasolar planets and substellar companions. The Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) at the Gemini-South telescope is a specialized instrument tailored for direct imaging of brown dwarfs and exoplanet companions. The NICI planet-finding campaign has been obtaining high-contrast adaptive optics imaging of young nearby stars since December 2008. A close substellar companion to PZ Tel, a young solar analog, was discovered using NICI. The companion, PZ Tel b, has a projected separation of 18 AU and a mass estimate of 36 Jupiter masses. The observations also set limits on the companion's orbital eccentricity and provide information about its spectral type, effective temperature, and surface gravity.", "There are about 200 known extrasolar planetary systems, many of which contain gas giant planets. The two main theories for forming these planets are the core accretion theory, which suggests that a heavy element core is built up by the accretion of planetesimals, and the disk instability theory, which suggests that an instability in the protoplanetary disk can lead to the formation of self-gravitating clumps of gas and dust. The core accretion theory has the advantage of being able to explain the formation of different types of planets, but it has some limitations in terms of the required core mass and the time it takes to form a gas giant. The disk instability theory can form planets quickly, but it starts with a solar abundance of elements, whereas observations show that gas giant planets like Jupiter have an enriched envelope. This paper presents an evolutionary model of an isolated giant gaseous protoplanet formed by a clump caused by an instability in the solar nebula. The model calculates the rate at which the protoplanet would capture planetesimals, taking into account different sizes and compositions of the planetesimals. It shows that the protoplanet can capture a substantial amount of solids and end up with a non-solar composition. The model also suggests", "The text discusses the use of event generators in high-energy physics. It mentions that these generators are used to simulate events produced by machines like the Tevatron and LHC. The generators provide a detailed description of the final state of the events, allowing for predictions and comparisons with experimental data. The text also explains the concepts of matrix elements and parton showers, which are used in event generators. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and how they can be combined. The text concludes by mentioning different algorithms used in event generators, such as merging and vetoed parton showers. It also discusses multiple interactions and the effects of these interactions on event simulations.", "Neutron stars are extremely dense and provide a unique opportunity to study dense matter. At such high densities, quarks could be squeezed out of nucleons to form quark matter. Strange quark matter, consisting of comparable numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, may be the stable ground state of quark matter. This has led to the idea of strange stars, which are either entirely composed of quark matter or have quark cores surrounded by a hadronic shell. The nature of compact stars can be studied through their cooling behavior and by observing stellar vibrations. The viscosity coefficients of matter in compact stars, especially the shear and bulk viscosities, play an important role in modeling and understanding these objects. The anisotropic hydrodynamics of magnetized strange quark matter and the calculation of bulk viscosities are discussed in this paper. The dependencies of the bulk viscosities on magnetic field strength and temperature are found to be complex, exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations. The r-mode instability in rotating quark stars is also analyzed, and it is found that the critical angular velocity for instability decreases with increasing magnetic field strength. Overall, the study provides insights into the properties and behavior of matter in magnetized compact stars.", "Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has become a mature scientific technique, allowing researchers to study non-thermal phenomena in the universe and the acceleration of cosmic ray particles. Cosmic rays cover a wide range of energies and are mainly composed of protons and helium. Different experimental techniques are needed to study cosmic rays at different energy ranges. Gamma-rays are neutral and interact with local radiation fields, making them useful for studying the origin of cosmic rays. Ground-based telescopes, called Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), are used to detect gamma-rays by capturing the Cherenkov light produced when gamma-rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The current generation of IACTs has limitations in energy range, sensitivity, and resolution, but a new generation of IACTs, called the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), is being developed to overcome these limitations. CTA will have an array of telescopes of different sizes distributed over a large area to increase sensitivity and improve energy and angular resolution. It is expected to open a new era of precision gamma-ray astronomy and provide insights into the acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays and fundamental physics. The CTA project is a partnership between various institutions and is planned to run as an observatory.", "The text discusses the importance of understanding the origin, properties, and evolution of our galaxy and how this requires a careful examination of its stellar members. The fundamental properties of stars, such as mass, age, and abundances, are crucial in determining their history and future development. However, these properties are not directly observable and must be inferred through the stellar spectrum. Several atmospheric parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, have been defined to indirectly determine these properties. The text also highlights the limitations and complexities of modeling these properties and the historical methods used to classify stellar spectra. It then discusses recent attempts to directly determine the physical parameters of stars using neural networks trained on synthetic spectra. The accuracy with which physical parameters can be determined from spectroscopic data depends on factors like spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and wavelength coverage. The text emphasizes the need for accurate determination of physical parameters for a complete survey-oriented classification system and compares the performance of different resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios. It also discusses the implications of the results for future survey missions like Gaia. The text concludes by proposing further research directions, such as better accounting for observational data and including interstellar extinction and multiple star systems in the parametrization model. It also mentions the importance of", "The text discusses the relationship between the geometry of a manifold or graph and the spectral properties of the Laplacian defined on it. It mentions the rise of spectral graph theory in the late 1980s and 90s, and the still open field of spectral theory of random graphs. The text then discusses the recent contributions that take a probabilistic point of view to derive heat-kernel estimates for Laplacians on supercritical Bernoulli bond-percolation graphs and investigate the integrated density of states of Laplacians on subcritical bond-percolation graphs. The text explains the different behavior of the Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacians with regards to the integrated density of states, depending on the boundary condition and the spectral edge. The text refers to other literature for a more detailed discussion of other spectral properties and the history of the problem. The text then presents two main results: the lifshits tail behavior of the integrated density of states of the Laplacian on bond-percolation graphs, and the van hove asymptotics of the integrated density of states of the Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacians on bond-percolation graphs in the percolating phase. The text also provides a proof for these results and discusses observations and remarks.", "This text discusses the existence of dark matter and the ongoing search to detect it. It explains that the most likely candidate for dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and that direct observation of WIMPs is challenging. The text also discusses different scenarios for dark matter annihilation and decay, as well as the effects of baryonic matter and adiabatic contraction on dark matter density profiles. The authors present maps of gamma-ray emission from different dark matter scenarios and compare them to the observed diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission. They suggest that the different scenarios could provide additional templates to fit the data and offer insights into the nature of dark matter. The authors also mention the need for more realistic density profiles and the inclusion of other factors, such as the substructure of dark matter halos and the spatially dependent velocity dispersion of dark matter particles. They conclude by stating that their results are not meant to set new constraints on dark matter, but rather to provide possible templates to fit the observed data and illustrate the range of profiles for different dark matter models.", "The text discusses the generation and properties of nonclassical light, specifically narrow-band biphotons, which are pairs of entangled photons. These biphotons, which have applications in quantum communication and information processing, can be produced through a process called four-wave mixing (FWM) in atom-gas media using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The properties and waveforms of the biphotons are determined by the nonlinear coupling coefficient and the linear optical responses of the medium. The temporal correlation of the biphotons can exhibit damped Rabi oscillations or rectangular shapes, depending on the parameters of the system. The text also mentions the possibility of manipulating the linear optical responses to switch the two-photon interference from an anti-bunching effect to a bunching effect, and discusses potential applications and future research directions.", "This paper discusses the concept of amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, which is the basis for lasers and masers. It explains that population inversions are necessary for amplification to occur and describes the conditions that lead to population inversions. The paper also discusses the theory of stimulated emission, including time-dependent perturbation theory and the Einstein coefficients. It explores the behavior of an ensemble of particles and the radiative transport of the amplified signal. The paper further explores the effects of line narrowing and rebroadening in the spectrum and discusses the potential applications of amplification by stimulated emission in astrophysical systems.", "The study of lattice polymers in two dimensions has been ongoing for decades. Various models have been proposed to compute critical exponents for different types of polymers. In 1982, Nienhuis computed critical exponents for free self-avoiding walks and dense polymers on the hexagonal lattice. A tri-critical point, known as the 8-point, was identified by Duplantier and Saleur in 1987.\n\nBlte and Nienhuis proposed a lattice model on the square lattice in 1989, which includes weights for site-collisions and straight segments. This model has five different critical branches with known critical exponents. One of the branches corresponds to the collapsing polymer behavior, and the critical exponents for this branch were conjectured to be different from the other branches.\n\nFoster and Pinettes studied the semi-flexible visaw model at this collapsing point using different methods, including transfer matrices and the density matrix renormalization group method. They found some agreement with the predicted values of the scaling dimensions, but also some discrepancies.\n\nIn this paper, the authors used Monte Carlo simulation to study the semi-flexible visaw model at the collapsing point. They found estimates for the scaling dimensions that are in line with previous studies by", "In recent years, there has been intense research on highly inhomogeneous light beams, particularly those carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), also known as twisted light. These beams have been studied in various areas such as beam generation, interaction with matter, and applications in fields such as optical trapping and quantum information technology. Twisted light beams exhibit unique characteristics, including a vortex or phase singularity at the beam axis and an intertwined polarization and OAM. The interaction between twisted light and matter is of particular interest due to the inhomogeneous nature of the light beam. In this study, the authors propose a new gauge transformation, called the TL gauge, which retains the advantages of the dipole moment approximation (DMA) while also capturing the twisted nature of the light. They show that for certain cases of twisted light beams, an electric multipolar hamiltonian can be derived, which is advantageous for its clear physical meaning, gauge invariance, and perturbative treatment. However, they also find that for certain classes of twisted light, an electric field coupling (EFC) hamiltonian is not applicable and a more general approach is necessary. Overall, the TL gauge provides a useful framework for describing the interaction of twisted light beams with matter.", "This text discusses compact groups of galaxies, which are associations of three to seven galaxies with closely spaced distances between them. These groups are ideal for studying galaxy interaction and intergalactic star formation. The main goal of this work is to establish a connection between the evolutionary stage of a group and the presence of young intergalactic objects formed during galaxy interactions. The study focuses on a subsample of seven compact groups that range from early stage to late stage of evolution. Velocity maps, UV data, and optical images are used to analyze the evolutionary stage of each group. Ultraviolet emitting regions in the vicinity of the compact groups are detected using the sextractor software and compared to a control sample outside the group. Some groups, like HCG 92 and HCG 22, have a higher field density, indicating the presence of young star-forming regions. The velocity field and rotation curves of each galaxy in the groups are also analyzed to search for interaction indicators. NGC 92, for example, shows a prominent tidal tail and a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate. Overall, the data and analysis of the compact groups suggest that some groups are in early stages of interaction, while others are in late stages of evolution with significant intergalactic star formation.", "The text discusses the approximate and exact solutions of the pairing Hamiltonian in condensed matter and nuclear physics. The BCS approximation and the density matrix renormalization group are commonly used approximations, but the exact solution was worked out by Richardson in the 1960s. The exact solution has been used to study the effect of resonant single-particle states on the pairing Hamiltonian and to investigate the pairing correlations in various systems. The paper focuses on determining the exact eigenenergies of the pairing Hamiltonian when the continuum is included, using both real and complex energy representations. It also discusses the derivation of the Richardson equations and their solutions for different model spaces. The effect of the resonant and non-resonant continuum on the many-body pairing correlations is investigated by comparing the ground state energies and pair energies in different model spaces. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of including the continuum in the exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian and its implications for studying pairing correlations.", "The distribution of the duration of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggests two distinct groups. The bursts are separated into two groups based on the time interval during which the integrated counts go from 5% to 95%. Time dilation, evidence for the cosmological origin of GRBs, is found in the long bursts. A recent study on the pulses in GRBs suggests that the duration of each pulse and the mean duration of individual pulses are bimodal. This paper presents a different approach to investigating the average pulse width of GRBs using light curves from the BATSE GRBs. The average pulse width of GRBs is found to be bimodal, dividing the bursts into shot-pulse bursts and long-pulse bursts. The duration of the average pulse width is longer in the dim long-pulse bursts compared to the bright long-pulse bursts. Further study of the short-pulse bursts is needed, including the correction of the BATSE selection effect and studying short GRBs with high time resolution data. The analysis of 1186 BATSE GRB light curves confirms the bimodal distribution of the duration of GRBs. The duration of the average pulse width in GRBs is consistent with a different approach and the long-pulse bursts show evidence of the time dilation effect", "Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) are a type of thermonuclear explosion that result from the accretion onto a white dwarf star or the coalescence of two white dwarfs. These explosions produce synthesized elements such as silicon and sulfur. The uniformity of SN Ia explosions has allowed them to be used as cosmic standard candles to measure cosmological distances. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) conducted a supernova survey to improve the reliability of SN Ia as distance indicators. The SN Ia subclasses include SN 1991t-like and SN 1991bg-like events, as well as more recently identified objects such as SN 2002cx, SN 2005gj, and SN 2008ha. SN 2007qd is a member intermediate to the 02cx and 08ha subclasses, and its observed properties link these objects. Spectroscopic analysis of SN 2007qd suggests that it is a thermonuclear deflagration, as opposed to a core-collapse supernova. The low luminosity and short rise time of SN 2007qd are inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor, but it does share similarities with other 02cx-like supernovae. The presence", "Scale-free networks have been widely studied because of their connection to real-world structures. These networks consist of nodes connected to each other via links, and they possess the small-world property. They also exhibit a power-law distribution for the number of links each node has. Many real-life networks, such as the internet and social networks, follow this power-law form. The unique properties of scale-free networks, including the presence of highly connected nodes known as hubs, have been extensively studied. In this work, the authors investigate random walk properties on scale-free networks, including mean-squared displacement, network coverage, and trapping processes. They find that diffusion on these networks can range from superlinear to sublinear depending on the network's connectivity. They also observe that coverage of the network by random walks increases almost linearly with time. The survival probability in trapping processes is found to decay exponentially, with the validity of the Rosenstock approximation depending on the network's connectivity. The authors conclude that the behavior of random walks on scale-free networks is different from that on regular lattices and is influenced by the presence of highly connected nodes.", "Silicene is a two-dimensional material similar to graphene. It has been proposed as a potential alternative to graphene due to its stronger intrinsic spin orbit coupling. Silicene has a stable 2D buckled honeycomb structure with a band gap that can be electrically tuned. The electronic properties of silicene have been extensively studied using density functional theory calculations. Experimentally, silicene has been grown on metallic substrates, but it is desirable to achieve freestanding silicene. The effect of strain on the electronic and mechanical properties of silicene has been investigated using first-principles calculations. It was found that strain can induce hole doping in silicene, unlike in graphene. The phonon spectrum of silicene was also studied, showing that the lattice remains stable up to a certain strain. The grneisen parameter for silicene was calculated and found to vary with strain. Overall, this study provides insights into the behavior of silicene under strain and its potential applications.", "The paper discusses the problem of designing team trajectories for cooperative patrolling of environments using mobile robots. The focus is on minimizing the refresh time (the time between same-region visits) and latency (the time needed for information to spread among the robots). \n\nThe paper first presents the problem and introduces the notion of refresh time and latency. It then describes the roadmap representation of the environment and presents the assumptions and capabilities of the robots. \n\nNext, the paper discusses the existing approaches to the patrolling problem and presents a procedure for building a graph to represent the area to be patrolled. It also discusses the case of a chain, tree, and cyclic graph and presents the results for the chain and tree cases. \n\nIn the case of a chain graph, the paper presents a method to compute a minimum refresh time and latency team trajectory by optimally partitioning the graph among the robots. It also proposes a centralized algorithm to compute an optimal partition and design an optimal team trajectory.  It discusses the robustness of the method through a simulation study.\n\nFor the case of a tree graph, the paper reduces the minimum refresh time patrolling problem to a known graph optimization problem and presents a centralized algorithm to compute an optimal solution. \n\nFor the case of a cyclic graph, the paper shows that", "The study focuses on the structure functions of hadrons in the Bjorken limit and at high momentum scales, as probed in inclusive deep inelastic scattering. Perturbative QCD is traditionally used to study this phenomenon. The study utilizes leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) phenomenological calculations to relate leading twist contributions to structure functions at different momentum scales. The study also examines the nonperturbative profile functions needed for the Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (GLAP) equations, which describe the initial conditions for the evolution of the structure functions. The study shows that uncertainties in the parton distribution functions of the nucleon include a large body of experimental data and theoretical error estimates. The study also applies this approach to the parton distribution functions of other hadrons, such as the pion, using constituent quark models. The study finds that the parton structure of the pion can be understood with the proper incorporation of chiral symmetry constraints. The study also discusses the parton distribution functions of the kaon and eta mesons. Overall, the study provides insight into the parton structure of various mesons and highlights the similarities and differences between their parton distribution functions.", "This study focuses on the mechanism of particle number production in baryogenesis and leptogenesis. The authors propose a model involving a heavy neutral scalar and one complex scalar. They use non-equilibrium field theory with density matrix to study the time evolution of the particle number. The paper discusses the particle number violating model, the current associated with the particle number, the particle number production rate, and its properties. The authors find that the production rate oscillates and decreases in amplitude over time. They suggest further research on the effect of the expanding universe and the case for non-zero chemical potential. The work was supported by a grant from JSPS.", "The architecture of the outer solar system and extrasolar planetary systems is shaped by different dynamical mechanisms. In the solar system, the scattering of small bodies by ice giants drives planetary migration and the capture of objects into resonance. The effects on gas giants are smaller but still significant. In extrasolar planetary systems, there is currently no evidence of a dynamical role for planetesimals. The eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets at small orbital radii matches models of gravitational scattering among massive planets. Gas disk migration likely plays a role in the observed distribution of semi-major axes. It is probably common for young planetary systems to have a reservoir of planetesimals at larger radii. The typical masses of these planetesimal disks are unknown, but they are likely comparable to those inferred for the early outer solar system. A model is proposed in which planet formation results in a marginally unstable system of massive planets in contact with both a residual gas disk and an exterior planetesimal disk. N-body simulations are used to study the subsequent evolution of these systems. The presence of planetesimal disks can stabilize some systems and lead to resonant capture of planets. The results are consistent with current observations of extrasolar planetary systems, but further studies are needed. The main prediction of the model is the statistical distribution", "The ability to realize ultracold quantum gases in periodic and disordered potentials has allowed for detailed studies of fascinating effects originating in solid state physics. Ongoing investigations include single particle phenomena such as Anderson localization and many particle effects like the Bose-glass phase and the Mott insulator. Quantum gases in periodic potentials have enabled the first direct observation of Bloch oscillations, where the periodicity of the potential leads to an oscillatory motion of the particles.\n\nIn solid state systems, scattering at imperfections in the crystal structure leads to damping of Bloch oscillations. However, in optical lattices, which are perfect optical crystals, long lived Bloch oscillations can be observed. The effect of adding disorder to an optical lattice potential is of interest for theoretical and experimental investigations. The inhomogeneity caused by the disorder can have important consequences for using Bloch oscillations as a sensitive tool for high precision measurements of small forces.\n\nIn this study, the effect of a small disordered potential on Bloch oscillations of Bose-Einstein condensates in a 1D optical lattice potential was investigated. It was found that the inhomogeneity leads to significant damping of the center-of-mass motion. The damping rate increases with the depth of the disorder. Furthermore, it was", "The text discusses the energy loss of charged particles as they pass through dense matter and how this is a fundamental aspect of understanding matter properties. The text also mentions the importance of accurate calculations and measurements of the energy loss, as well as its relationship to the radiation length of charged particles in matter. The stopping power and radiation length of materials are widely used in various fields such as x-ray tomography and high energy physics. The text then transitions to discussing the interaction between quarks and gluons and the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics. It mentions the exploration of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma and the suppression of particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The text highlights the need to understand the stopping power of cold nuclei for color-charged particles and references the observation of particle suppression in d+Au collisions. It also discusses the importance of clean and sensitive experimental observables in studying jet energy loss in cold nuclear matter. The text then delves into the significance of cold nuclear matter energy loss from both a phenomenological and theoretical perspective. It presents a comparative study of initial-state and final-state energy loss and discusses the differences in their path length and energy dependencies. The text explains the soft interactions and the distinction between initial-state and final-state energy loss", "The polynomial eigenvalue problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix polynomial. This problem has applications in various fields and can be solved using different approaches. One approach is linearization, where the matrix polynomial is transformed into an equivalent linear eigenvalue problem. Another approach is root finding, which involves computing the eigenvalues one at a time using iterative methods. The root finding methods are more accurate and have been shown to be cost efficient for large degree polynomial eigenvalue problems. In this paper, the authors propose a root finding algorithm based on Laguerre iteration. They also use the numerical range of the matrix polynomial to compute initial estimates for the eigenvalues, which improves efficiency. The algorithm is implemented in the LMPEP software package and numerical experiments show its effectiveness in terms of computational complexity, stability, and accuracy. However, there are still open questions and areas for further exploration.", "The text discusses the problem of sampling from complicated probability distributions when the target density function is only known up to a scalar constant. It compares Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to other sampling algorithms and describes the Metropolis algorithm and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as generalizations of MCMC. The text also explores the applications of MCMC in various fields and introduces the problem of choosing an input with an unknown probability density for a fixed model. It presents a solution to this problem by modifying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and provides a theoretical framework for this modification. The text concludes by demonstrating the application of this method to sample from the space of solution paths to a stochastic differential equation.", "This study investigates the vertical structure, energy advection, and convective stability of radiation pressure-supported accretion disks in spherical coordinates. The authors find that the disks are geometrically thick, with most of the accreted matter concentrated around the equatorial plane. They also show that the polytropic relation is unsuitable for describing the vertical structure of such disks and that energy advection is significant even for slightly sub-Eddington accretion disks. Additionally, they find that the disks are convectively stable, with the disk in the equatorial plane being particularly stable. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the inner regions of accretion disks and the nature of ultraluminous X-ray sources.", "The problem of understanding the origin of high-energy cosmic rays is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Enrico Fermi proposed a mechanism called Fermi acceleration, where cosmic particles are accelerated by collisions with moving magnetic walls in interstellar space. Another proposed mechanism involves rapidly rotating magnetic field lines, which can lead to efficient acceleration of particles and the emission of very high-energy photons. Previous studies have examined particle dynamics along straight rotating channels, but a more generalized model considering curved trajectories has been presented. The study also considers the influence of the radiation reaction force and the photon drag force on particle acceleration. The results show that the photon drag force slows down particle motion and affects the dynamics of particles in various configurations of field lines, such as straight lines, Archimedes spirals, and dipolar field lines. The presence of the photon drag force can lead to force-free dynamics and stable equilibrium points. Future research will focus on applying these results to astrophysical objects, such as pulsars and active galactic nuclei.", "On February 15, 2013, a 17-meter asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the southern Ural region. It became a superbolide meteor, brighter than the sun, and several small fragments of the meteorite were found. About 16 hours later, a 45-meter asteroid missed Earth by about 27,700 km. A similar situation occurred two years earlier when a fireball was seen over central Poland and a new asteroid was discovered. An analysis of the fireball trajectory and orbit suggests that it was related to the newly discovered asteroid. The Polish Fireball Network, which monitors the sky over Poland for fireballs, observed the fireball and calculated its trajectory and orbit. The orbit of the fireball is similar to that of the two asteroids, suggesting a possible common origin.", "Graph theory originated in 1736 with Euler's solution to the puzzle of K\u00f6nigsberg's bridges. Since then, graph theory has been extensively studied, and graphs have become a crucial tool for understanding various systems in different fields. In recent times, graphs have been used to study biological, social, technological, and information networks. Graph analysis has become essential for understanding the features of these systems, such as social network analysis and community structure. Real networks are not random graphs, but rather display big inhomogeneities and community structure. Community structure refers to the presence of groups of vertices that share common properties and/or play similar roles within the graph. Different methods have been developed to detect and analyze these communities, including algorithms based on local connectivity, global similarity measures, and spectral clustering. There are also measures of quality to evaluate the goodness of a partition, such as modularity, which quantifies the difference between the number of internal edges and the expected number of internal edges in a null model. Graph partitioning, which involves dividing a graph into clusters with minimal connectivity between them, is another important topic in graph theory. Several algorithms, such as the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and spectral bisection, have been developed for graph partitioning. Overall, graph theory provides", "This text discusses the study of nuclear matter in equilibrium and its relevance to nuclear physics and astrophysics. Different theoretical models, such as the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) theory and the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory, have been developed to describe nuclear matter. The DBHF theory successfully describes properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, but cannot be applied to finite nuclei calculations. The RMF theory has been widely used for finite nuclei calculations and can be fitted to the more fundamental DBHF approach to obtain an effective parametrization applicable to finite nuclei. The density-dependent relativistic hadron field theory is another approach that can be used. Recent experimental techniques and devices have allowed for the study of high-energy ion collisions, producing nuclei with high isospin asymmetry and nuclear densities higher than those occurring in normal nuclei. This has led to a focus on proper asymmetry description and the study of hyperons. Neutron star masses and radii are also being used to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter. At higher densities, other particles such as quark deconfinement and hyperons may appear. However, the interaction constants for hyperons and nucleons, as well as the interaction between hyper", "The text discusses the theory of graph-like legendrian unfoldings, which are a special class of big legendrian submanifolds. The theory has been developed over the past two decades and has applications in the study of lagrangian singularities. One of the main differences from the theory of legendrian singularities is that caustics equivalence does not imply lagrangian equivalence. The text also discusses the parallels of a plane curve, which are a type of big wave front, and the concept of the evolute of a curve. The theory of contact with foliations is explained, as well as its relationship to the theory of lagrangian unfoldings. The text concludes by discussing an application of the theory of graph-like legendrian unfoldings to the study of caustics of world sheets in Lorentz space forms.", "This text discusses the interaction of extragalactic jets with their environment and the stratification of the jet beam in the direction normal to its velocity. It explores the morphology of different types of jets, such as FR I and FR II sources, and the evidence for stratification in these jets. The text also discusses the kinematic structure of the boundary layers in these jets and how they can affect the radiative output of the jet. It concludes by comparing the observational signatures of different kinematic models of shear layers in kiloparsec-scale jets.", "Solar dynamics affect the emergent spectral line polarization in a complex way that cannot be explained solely by the Doppler effect. Velocity gradients lead to variable opacity and changing Doppler shifts along the optical path of each ray, which affects the formation of the spectral line in the atmosphere. Each wavelength of the polarization profile can be sensitive to different regions and conditions in the atmosphere. Temporal evolution of physical quantities and rhythms of variation with height also impact observations. Doppler-induced polarization modulation, along with velocity and temperature gradients, plays a role in the atomic density matrix that describes population imbalances and coherences in the plasma. Solar phenomena such as tornadoes, quiet-sun jets, spicules, and supersonic flows demonstrate the richness of dynamic processes. Detailed calculations in time-dependent models are necessary to understand the scattering polarization caused by dynamics. Integrating the synthetic Stokes vector components in time and space emulates observations and shows a strong agreement. The study connects observations with magnetohydrodynamic models, revealing the influence of time, space, and wavelength on the polarized emission. The study also emphasizes the need for proper measurements of magnetic fields above the photosphere and the importance of considering dimensions where kinematic and magnetic effects behave differently. The combination of magneto-hydrodynamics, atomic", "The article discusses the importance of supramolecular assembly in controlling the electronic properties of conjugated polymers. It explains how supramolecular structures can be assembled in solution and transferred to the solid state, enhancing the charge mobilities of the polymers. The article also discusses the effects of inter-chromophore coupling on optoelectronic properties and the role of resonance energy transfer in describing exciton dynamics. The authors investigate the kinetics of energy transfer in two pairs of oligo-p-phenylenevinylene (OPV) derivatives and find that the dimensionality of the energy transfer process depends on the supramolecular structure of the system. They conclude that controlling the supramolecular structure of polymers can enhance energy transfer and lead to better optoelectronic properties.", "The text discusses the discovery of a large enhancement in the polarization of a deuteron target during deep inelastic muon scattering experiments. It was found that frequency modulation of the microwave power supply led to a significant increase in the maximum polarization and polarization growth rate of the target. The effect was attributed to changes in electron paramagnetic resonance absorption and may be related to cross-relaxation and the migration of spin packets within the target. The enhancement in polarization has important implications for high energy physics experiments.", "The text discusses the use of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models in various fields and the need for efficient and robust parameter optimization methods for these models. The text highlights the challenges of optimization with nonlinear equality constraints and proposes a simulation-based framework for numerical optimization with steady state constraints. The framework utilizes the local geometry of the steady state manifold to move on the manifold and stabilize it using a continuous retraction. The text provides a proof for the exponential stability of a locally optimal point and evaluates the proposed method using two application examples from systems biology. The method is compared to standard constrained and unconstrained optimization methods and is found to outperform the constrained optimization methods and achieve a performance comparable to the unconstrained methods. The method is shown to be applicable to a broader class of problems as it does not require an analytical expression for the steady state. The text concludes by mentioning possible extensions and open questions for further research.", "Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability occurs when a heavy fluid is accelerated or supported by a light one in a force field. It is a fundamental and ubiquitous form of interfacial instability between fluids with different densities. RT instability has a wide range of applications and has been extensively studied using theoretical, experimental, and computational methods. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), based on the Boltzmann equation, has emerged as a versatile computational tool for studying RT instability. However, previous LBMs have mainly focused on mono-component fluids with a cold/hot region on the top/bottom half. In this study, the authors propose a lattice Boltzmann kinetic method, known as the discrete Boltzmann method (DBM), to investigate the RT instability in compressible bi-component systems. The DBM is validated and numerically verified, and it is used to simulate the dynamic process of non-equilibrium RT instability. The authors investigate the non-equilibrium manifestations, such as the fluctuation of translational energies and non-organized energy flux, as well as the entropy of mixing. The results show that the non-equilibrium manifestations and the growth of entropy of mixing have similar trends in the evolution of RT instability. The DBM provides a simple tool to study the non", "This review article discusses the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos and their interaction with atoms. The authors explore the theoretical background for neutrino scattering on atomic electrons and discuss the ionization of many-electron atoms by neutrino impact. They also analyze the effects of atomic ionization on the differential cross-section of neutrino-atom ionization and compare theoretical calculations with experimental data. The authors conclude that the free-electron approximation and the stepping approximation, which consider the effects of atomic ionization, provide reasonable descriptions of neutrino-atom ionization for energy transfers down to low values. However, they find that the differential cross-section for ionization of helium and germanium by electron-antineutrino impact is suppressed relative to the stepping approximation when the energy transfer is close to the ionization threshold. The authors attribute this suppression to electron-electron correlation effects and suggest that further studies are necessary to accurately interpret low-energy data in searches for neutrino electromagnetic properties. Finally, the authors discuss the implications for the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and propose that the accurate calculation of the neutrino magnetic moment-induced contribution to this scattering process is important for the interpretation of future measurements.", "The text discusses the continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their relationship to the emission lines observed in these objects. It highlights the difficulty in determining the strength and shape of the ionizing continuum and discusses recent observations that suggest the presence of a soft ionizing continuum in quasars. The text concludes that if the observed SEDs are correct, the broad emission line clouds must see a different, harder continuum than what is observed. It also considers the possibility of a second, powerful EUV bump in the SED that could explain the observed emission lines. The text highlights the implications of these findings for our understanding of quasars and AGNs.", "The standard Maxwell's equations have been criticized for being overdetermined and unable to handle certain situations that are considered trivial in common practice. The discovery of these inconsistencies led to the development of a renewed model that includes the solutions to Maxwell's equations and provides a description of a wider range of events. One important implication is that non-dissipating compact-support electromagnetic waves can be easily modeled with the new set of equations. Maxwell's equations also cannot accurately represent photons in vacuum. Engineers often follow a computational path that disregards certain constraints to obtain a reasonable output, but this can lead to contradictions. The traditional formulation of Maxwell's equations assumes that a vector field is the curl of another vector, but this is not always the case. The presence of nonhomogeneous terms and the limited solution space of homogeneous Maxwell's equations suggest that the model is mathematically incorrect. The analysis of the distribution of an electromagnetic field inside a capacitor depends on how the problem is presented, and the model itself is not mathematically correct when taken with all its constraints. There are too many degrees of freedom compared to the constraints in Maxwell's equations. The model also fails to account for the divergence of the electric field, leading to contradictions. A new model that allows for different solutions and addresses these issues is", "The paper discusses the algebraic theory of boundary problems for linear ordinary differential equations (LODEs) and its connection to the Heaviside calculus. It addresses the lack of a rich algebraic theory for boundary problems and the pragmatic nature of solving differential equations with boundary conditions. The paper introduces the concept of umbral boundary conditions and the operator ring for boundary problems. It shows that the multiplication of boundary problems corresponds to the composition of their Green's operators in reverse order. The paper then introduces the Heaviside calculus and its connection to symbolic boundary problems. It presents the basic setup of algebraic analysis, the main concerns of the paper, and the structure of the paper.", "This article discusses the generation and modulation of entanglement in macroscopic mechanical oscillators using the optomechanical interaction. The authors propose a scheme in which an optomechanical system, consisting of a cavity with a movable mirror and an additional oscillator coupled by the Coulomb force, is used to generate entanglement between the separated oscillators. They show that the entanglement can be modulated by adjusting the squeezing cavity field generated by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) placed inside the cavity. The authors also numerically simulate the critical temperature of the entanglement in experimentally feasible regimes and show that the laser driving power and the gain of the OPA can improve the critical temperature. Furthermore, they demonstrate that their scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of the environment compared to previous schemes. This work has potential applications in quantum information science and quantum metrology.", "In this text, the author discusses the collective behavior of groups of interacting dynamical components. They mention examples in biology, physics, and engineering where understanding the collective behavior is crucial. One example they focus on is the synchronization of oscillating systems, where a group of coupled oscillators synchronize despite having different frequencies. They also discuss the phenomenon of synchronization in various physical systems and its applications. The author introduces a model to study the synchronization of oscillators with reactive coupling and nonlinear frequency pulling. They present analytical arguments and simulation results to describe the behavior of the system for different frequency distributions. They find that for a lorentzian distribution, there are stable synchronized states for certain values of the coupling parameters. Finally, they discuss the behavior of the system for a wider distribution of frequencies and highlight the changes in the phase diagram.", "The traditional method used for image processing in the imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique (ACT) selects pixels based on specific thresholds. However, this method often includes noise pixels and excludes pixels with low signal. In this paper, a novel method based on wavelets is introduced to enhance the image processing technique. This method selects pixels containing cherenkov photons by comparing their wavelet coefficients with noise wavelet coefficient distributions. The wavelet method selects a greater number of signal pixels and improves the image reconstruction and characterization compared to the traditional method. The wavelet method has the potential to be advantageous for the selection methods used in cherenkov telescopes.", "Linear positive systems have recently gained attention for their ability to represent real-world processes and their interesting theoretical properties. They have been used to model various systems including communication networks, biological networks, and disease dynamics. Linear copositive Lyapunov functions can be used to formulate stability conditions for these systems, and state-feedback and static output feedback controllers can be designed using convex programming. The famous Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma can also be formulated in this setting. Extensions to delay systems and switched systems have been considered, and stability and stabilization conditions have been derived for linear positive impulsive systems. The conditions can be verified using various methods, including discretization, sum-of-squares relaxation, and Handelman's theorem. Computational examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.", "The text discusses different models and theories that have been used to describe dwarf nova outbursts. While some models, like the disk instability model (DIM), have been widely accepted and have provided explanations for certain systems, there are still uncertainties and weaknesses in predicting the outburst-quiescence cycles of many systems. Other models, such as the secondary instability model (SIM) and thermonuclear runaway (TNR) model, have also been used but with varying success. The presence of a magnetic field and its effects on the accretion process and outbursts is also discussed. The text suggests that a combination of models and further analysis is needed to better understand and predict dwarf nova outbursts.", "The formation of the parent bodies of primitive meteorites is still not fully understood. There are several properties of meteorites that have not been accounted for, including the dominance of small mineral particles, variation in physical and chemical properties, and differences in formation times. Recent evidence suggests that primary accretion started early but continued for several million years, resulting in inefficient and sporadic growth. Current models for primary accretion can be classified as incremental growth or instability. Challenges faced by the instability models include sticking of mineral particle aggregates and difficulty in growing beyond meter size due to rapid migration and collisional disruption. Incremental growth models have noted that turbulence precludes midplane instability models, but incremental accretion is at low relative velocity and the meter-size barrier is not a problem. Another scenario involves a complex interplay between turbulence, pressure gradients, and gravity that leads to planetesimal growth. Numerical simulations of turbulent concentration of particles show that large and dense clumps of particles can form, allowing them to survive disruptive forces and slowly sediment into a sandpile planetesimal. However, the current models are simplified and more realistic conditions need to be investigated. The fate of these sandpile planetesimals is also not modeled in this paper. Primitive meteorites provide clues about the primary accret", "The paper proves that the automorphism group of the complex of curves on a connected nonorientable surface of odd genus is isomorphic to its mapping class group. It also shows that the natural map from the mapping class group to the automorphism group is injective and surjective. The proof involves studying the structure of the complex of curves and the complex of nonseparating curves on nonorientable surfaces, and showing that automorphisms of these complexes preserve certain properties and can be realized by diffeomorphisms of the surface. The paper also discusses the action of the mapping class group on the complexes and proves various lemmas regarding the preservation of certain pairs of circles and the action on the punctures of the surface.", "The interior of cells is highly structured and dynamic, and active transport is essential for targeting molecules to different parts of the cell as well as maintaining and reorganizing its structure. This is accomplished by the cytoskeleton, a network of protein fibers, and motor proteins that use the cytoskeleton as rails for directed transport. These motor proteins use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to perform mechanical work and move along the filaments of the cytoskeleton. The behavior of these motor proteins has been extensively studied, and they are found to perform random walks that alternate between directed movements along the filaments and non-directed Brownian motion in the surrounding fluid. To study these random walks, lattice models have been developed that can be adapted to describe the properties of specific motor proteins. These models take into account motor-motor interactions, such as the exclusion of motors from binding sites on the filaments, which can lead to traffic jam-like density patterns and phase transitions. Analytical solutions have been derived for these lattice models, and they provide insights into the transport properties of motor proteins, such as the average position, speed, dispersion, and diffusion coefficient. Additionally, numerical simulations and continuum equations have been used to study the random walks of motor proteins in compartments with confining walls, such as", "Mergers are commonly used to build massive elliptical galaxies and they can leave signatures on the central structure of the galaxies. The presence of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies suggests that binary black holes formed through mergers can remove stars from the center of the galaxy. This process can cause a decrease in the light in the central part of the galaxy. Observations of galaxy nuclei have identified two types of behavior in the central light profiles of ellipticals: power-law and core galaxies. Power-law profiles are approximated by a single power law at small radii, while core galaxies display a distinct break from a steep outer slope to a shallower inner cusp. Numerical simulations have shown that merging two galaxies with steep cusps can result in a merger remnant with a shallow power-law cusp in the inner part (core). The size of the core (break radius) is found to double after each major merger and is thought to be related to the final black hole mass of the galaxy. Previous studies have explored the core properties and their correlation with other galaxy properties, but have used different samples, datasets, and assumptions, leading to different results. In this paper, the authors present improved core-property measurements and analyze the relationships between core properties and black hole mass", "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a research topic in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing that has gained attention in recent years. ZSL involves tasks where the classifier is given a set of known example-class label pairs (training set) and is expected to predict the unknown labels of new examples (test set) that are not present in the training set. ZSL differs from standard classification as it assumes the labels for test examples are not present in the training set. Additionally, ZSL can have a large number of class labels, making it intractable without further assumptions. To address this, labels are assumed to be embedded in a metric space, and their distance or similarity can be measured in this space. One approach to ZSL is to use regression techniques to obtain a mapping function from the example space to the label space. Researchers have used various regression techniques, such as linear ridge regression and neural networks, to find this mapping function. However, the regression step in ZSL can have a non-negligible effect on prediction accuracy, as it can lead to the emergence of hub labels. Hubs are labels that appear as the nearest neighbors of many mapped examples, and they can negatively impact prediction accuracy, especially in ZSL tasks with fine-grained", "The ability to transfer quantum information between qubits is important for quantum computation and communication. Several methods have been proposed, but they face challenges due to decoherence and imperfections. In this paper, the authors propose a scheme to improve the fidelity of quantum state transfer (QST) using quantum partial measurement. This partial measurement, or weak measurement, only extracts partial information from the quantum state and can be reversed. The authors demonstrate that this scheme can enhance the fidelity of QST and make it more robust against decoherence and coupling strength. However, it does not work for pure dephasing decoherence. The authors also provide an optimal strength for the measurement reversal. Overall, this scheme shows promise for improving the fidelity of QST in realistic scenarios.", "The leading optical flow algorithms are not end-to-end deep learning, despite the existence of large training datasets and advancements in deep optical flow. One algorithm, called EpicFlow, currently dominates the step of transforming a sparse list of matches into dense optical flow maps. However, EpicFlow is slow and limited in performance because it is a non-learning method. Replacing EpicFlow with a deep learning method is challenging due to the involvement of lateral and top-down feedback loops in the visual cortex. To address this, the authors propose a neural network-based sparse-to-dense interpolation method for optical flow. They also introduce a new loss function that incorporates lateral dependencies and define a novel architecture with detour networks. Their network outperforms the current state-of-the-art method and improves both accuracy and speed. The authors also discuss the importance of motion boundaries and show the similarities between their network's performance and the neuronal filling-in process in the visual cortex. They evaluate their network on three optical flow benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness using different features and losses.", "The Tanami program, known as Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry (TANAMI), uses very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to study extragalactic gamma-ray sources. By monitoring the blazar jets of active galactic nuclei, TANAMI provides insight into the physics of AGN and helps measure the relativistic motion and intrinsic jet parameters. TANAMI combines VLBI observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array and other telescopes in Australia, Antarctica, Chile, and South Africa. The program began in 2007 with an initial sample of 43 sources and has since been expanded. Some early results from TANAMI include the detection of a strong gamma-ray flare from the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS1454 and the observation of high-resolution images of the AGN jet in Centaurus A. The program has also investigated the correlation between opening angles and X-ray luminosity, the redshift distribution of AGN sources, and the brightness temperature distribution. Data from TANAMI contributes to the study of high-energy radiation from AGN and is part of several individual AGN studies.", "The association between meteoroid streams and comets is well-established, but the idea that some originate from asteroids is old. The formation mechanism of a meteor stream from a comet is well-understood, where ices sublimate generating a gas outflow that carries away small dust grains. Inter-asteroid collisions is the most obvious formation process, but there are other possibilities. The ejection velocity is small compared to the orbital speed, so a stream is formed on an orbit similar to that of the parent. Individual meteoroid orbits can evolve differently from the parent due to close planetary encounters or collisions between stream meteoroids, the parent, or interplanetary dust particles. The major tool for determining a pairing of parent and meteoroid stream is orbit similarity, which has been quantified by several criteria. Three major showers - Geminids, Quadrantids, and Taurids - have asteroids associated with them. The Geminids have a possible parent in the asteroid Phaethon, while the Quadrantids may come from the fragmentation of a comet. The Taurid stream is complex and has an active comet, 2P/Encke, associated with it. Sporadic meteors have lost the identity of their parent's orbit, making it difficult", "The presence of cold dark matter in galactic halos can lead to the formation of caustics, which are regions of infinite density when the dark matter particles have zero velocity dispersion. These caustics can be formed by axions and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which have very small primordial velocity dispersions. The annihilation of these dark matter particles can produce gamma rays, which can be detected using future experiments such as GLAST. Caustics can be observed in the form of outer caustics, which are topological spheres surrounding galaxies, and inner caustics, which have a ring-like appearance. There is observational evidence for caustic rings in the rotation curves of external galaxies and in the infrared astronomical satellite map of the Milky Way. The existence of dark matter caustics is sometimes disputed in large-scale cosmological simulations, but this may be due to the finite resolution and spurious collisions in these simulations. Future progress in numerical techniques may allow for the study of caustic properties using numerical simulations. The velocity dispersion of the dark matter flow plays a critical role in the existence of caustics. The density enhancement caused by caustics can enhance the annihilation signal of dark matter. This article provides simulated sky maps of", "Quantum computation requires error mitigation, and one method for this is fault-tolerant quantum error correction. There are many possible error correcting codes, but comparing them analytically is difficult due to the complexity of realistic local architectures. Simulation is typically used to determine error correcting properties, especially for stabilizer codes. The depolarizing channel is a common error model that efficiently simulates laboratory processes. However, there are also non-unital error channels that cannot be accurately simulated with pauli errors. In this paper, the authors go beyond simulating errors with the conventional pauli depolarizing channel and allow for subsets of efficiently simulable gate errors. They show that adding clifford errors and/or measurement errors improves the accuracy of approximations for most error channels. The paper is organized into sections that describe simulable error processes, compare how well the models approximate specific error channels, and conclude with future research directions. The authors also mention the use of kraus operators and the stabilizer formalism for simulating error channels. They define four sets of error processes: pc, cc, pmc, and cmc, each representing different combinations of pauli errors, clifford errors, and measurement-induced translation errors. The paper presents results showing that as the number of operators in the error", "The text discusses the presence of diamond particles in the protoplanetary disk of the star Elias 1. The emission of diamonds at a wavelength of 3.53 micrometers has been observed in several Herbig Ae/Be stars, but the origin of these diamonds is unclear. The paper suggests that the diamonds are formed in situ in the protoplanetary disk. The presence of diamonds in Herbig Ae/Be stars may be linked to their x-ray flares and the high-energy particles they produce. It is proposed that the formation of diamonds in the protoplanetary disk is facilitated by the presence of carbon onions, which provide a high-pressure environment and can undergo irradiation-induced phase transformation to form diamonds. The formation of diamonds in the protoplanetary disk may be rare and dependent on specific conditions such as the presence of a hot central star, a companion emitting hard x-rays, and a disk environment that can maintain high pressures. Further research is needed to understand the formation and role of diamonds in protoplanetary disks.", "In this letter, the author discusses the potential of the quadratic gravitational Lagrangian, which includes both the metric and the torsion as dynamical variables, to shed light on various gravitational problems. These problems include the discrepancy in galactic rotation speeds, the amount of intergalactic lensing, the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and the existence of different particle families in elementary particles. The author proposes that matter can be endowed with either the regular metric or the primed metric, with regular matter and primed matter interacting gravitationally only with their respective kinds. The author derives equations to calculate the gravitational forces and rotation speeds in the presence of both regular and primed matter, and shows that these equations can explain the observed galactic rotation curves and intergalactic lensing. The author also discusses the influence of primordial torsion on the expansion of the universe and how it can explain the observed acceleration. The author suggests that the existence of different particle families may be related to the different metrics associated with them. The author concludes by emphasizing the potential of the quadratic gravitational Lagrangian in understanding these gravitational phenomena based on the proposed postulate.", "In this study, the diffusion of spin-polarized carriers in an undoped GaAs quantum well is investigated. The experiment was conducted using an optical pump-probe technique to directly observe the spatiotemporal dynamics of the carriers. It is found that the spin diffusion cannot be described as a classical diffusion process with a constant diffusion coefficient. The spin diffusion is slower than the ambipolar carrier diffusion, and its behavior is influenced by the spin-relaxation rate, which increases with decreasing density. Theoretical analysis based on a three-component drift-diffusion equation suggests that the slow spin diffusion can be attributed to the Coulomb scattering between carriers. However, more research is needed to understand the short-time behavior of the spin diffusion coefficient.", "Relativistic heavy ion collisions are used to study nuclear matter at high temperatures and densities. When the temperature and baryon density are high enough, nuclear matter melts into a state of free quarks and gluons called the quark gluon plasma (QGP). Strange hadron production is used as a diagnostic tool to investigate the properties of matter created in these collisions. The measurement of final distributions of strange hadrons can give insight into strangeness production in the hot and dense stage of the reaction. It was suggested 25 years ago that strange particle production should be enhanced in collisions with QGP production compared to those without QGP, which serves as a unique signature of the quark gluon plasma. The enhancement of strange particle production can be quantified by the ratio of yields in nucleus+nucleus (AA) to proton+proton (pp) collisions. The NA49 experiment at CERN's SPS has collected data on central PB+PB collisions at 5 beam energies and minimum bias PB+PB collisions at 8.7 GeV and 17.3 GeV. The experiment has a large acceptance in the forward hemisphere. Rapidity spectra for various strange hadrons have been measured for different centralities in these collisions. The width of the p", "The author discusses the phenomenon of geometric scaling in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) on a proton. Geometric scaling refers to the property that the total cross-section data can be plotted on a one-dimensional curve where two variables span the kinematical domain of DIS. The author explores whether this scaling can be explained by the saturation of parton densities in the target. Saturation occurs when a high density of partons is created, leading to the formation of a new state of matter called the color glass condensate (CGC). The author investigates whether the non-linear QCD evolution of the gluon distribution in the target can explain geometric scaling. The author uses the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, which describes the evolution of the gluon distribution, to study the formation of traveling wave patterns during the rapidity evolution. These traveling waves are related to geometric scaling. The author also discusses the diffusive approximation of the BK equation and its mapping onto the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskounov (F-KPP) equation, which describes reaction-diffusion processes. The author describes the formation of traveling wave patterns and their relationship to geometric scaling. The author proposes a new approach to studying traveling wave solutions of the BK", "The article discusses the problem of maintaining cooperation in a group of unrelated individuals, specifically in the context of the \"tragedy of the commons.\" The text mentions that various studies have used the \"public goods\" game to study this problem, and highlights the importance of punishment, reward, and reputation in encouraging cooperation. The article also discusses the concept of non-participation as an option in the game, and how it can help dissolve the social dilemma. The results of experiments investigating the mechanism of the optional public goods game are presented, and the cyclic strategy pattern in the full state space is demonstrated. The article concludes by suggesting that the empirical dynamic pattern observed in the experiments aligns with evolutionary dynamics.", "The text discusses quantum interference in atom-light interaction due to various noise sources such as collisional noise and phase noise in the driving laser field. It presents a detailed analysis of a system of coherently driven two-level atoms, taking into account both collisional and phase noises. The analysis is done using the quantum-trajectory method and includes the calculation of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. The results show that while phase noise does affect the phase correlations between the dressed states, it does not completely destroy them. The presence of phase noise deteriorates the quantum interference induced by collisions, but the interference is relatively robust against phase noise. Funding for the research was provided by the Research Fund of Hungary and the Polish Committee for Scientific Research.", "The paper discusses the mathematical aspects of solving nonlinear systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations, which describe a variety of physical phenomena. The paper emphasizes the need for numerical methods to solve these systems, as well as the importance of studying discontinuous solutions and their behavior under vanishing viscosity and dispersion. The paper also discusses the development of high-resolution numerical methods for more complicated hyperbolic systems and highlights the challenges of extending methods from gasdynamics to other systems such as ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Various numerical schemes and interpolation methods are discussed and compared, and the issue of solution uniqueness and selection principles for relevant solutions is explored. The paper concludes by highlighting the nonuniqueness of self-similar solutions in certain problems and the influence of physical processes and smearing methods on solution selection.", "A distributed convex optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm aims to minimize a sum of unknown convex objective functions with a limited number of gradient oracle calls at each agent. It uses time-dependent weighted combinations of the SGD iterates to achieve an optimal convergence rate. The algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and is shown to outperform them for various network topologies and benchmark datasets. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the algorithm is shown to achieve the optimal convergence rate up to constant terms. Additionally, the algorithm is shown to be robust and does not require the optimization problem to be smooth. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated through simulations, and results show significant improvements over existing methods.", "Tilings are studied by mathematicians, physicists, and material scientists. Physicists are interested in aperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tiling, as models for materials that are neither crystalline nor disordered. They investigate the physical properties of these materials, such as the x-ray diffraction pattern and energy levels of electrons. Mathematicians approach tilings from a different perspective. They view a tiling as a point in a tiling space and study the topology of this space, as well as the dynamics and cohomology groups. The construction of a tiling space involves the placement of tiles and the identification of equivalent patches. Tilings with finite local complexity can be represented as inverse limits of compact branched surfaces. Deformations of the tiles can be described by closed 1-cochains modulo exact 1-cochains, which correspond to the cohomology of the tiling space. Topological conjugacy preserves the dynamical spectrum and certain cohomology classes are asymptotically negligible, meaning they do not change the topological conjugacy class of the tiling space. In the case of the Penrose tiling, the second tiling in Figure 1 is topologically conjugate, but not mld equivalent, to a linear", "Spatial stochastic modeling is a tool used to study biochemical reaction networks in cells, where the spatial distribution of molecules is non-uniform. There are three levels of modeling: macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic. In this paper, the focus is on the mesoscopic and microscopic levels. The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a popular model for the mesoscopic level. Exact trajectories can be generated using the Next Subvolume Method (NSM). On the microscopic level, individual molecules are tracked and their positions and movements are considered. The RDME is often faster than microscopic models and various software packages implementing RDME solvers are available. For systems in complex geometries, space can be discretized using an unstructured mesh. It has been shown that accurate reaction rates can be obtained for cartesian meshes, but the problem of obtaining accurate rates for unstructured meshes has not been thoroughly studied. This paper develops a method to compute accurate reaction rates for the RDME on unstructured meshes. The method is demonstrated and shown to provide accurate results for different geometries. It is suggested that for many systems, analytically derived rates on cartesian meshes will provide sufficient accuracy.", "In this text, the author discusses two different scenarios for steering a beam in a linear accelerator. In the first scenario, the beam is bent by vertically translating existing quadrupoles without introducing new elements or magnetic fields. This bending generates dispersion, which is estimated to be small and not damaging to the emittance of the beam. In the second scenario, the idea of constructing a main linac with localized bends at widely separated locations is proposed. These bends allow the beam to follow the equipotential in a coarser, piece-wise fashion. The text explains the calculations and results for both scenarios, including the residual dispersion and the effects of synchrotron radiation. It is noted that a practical limit to the upgraded energy of a device using the first scenario would be when the energy gain within a fodo cell is equal to the energy lost due to synchrotron radiation. The text concludes by stating that a \"laser straight\" linear collider with a lengthy interaction region would have its collision point located roughly 50m below the surface of the earth.", "Scientists have been studying the relationship between fluctuations in the energy delivered by the solar wind to Earth's magnetosphere and variations in the magnetospheric response. They use geomagnetic indices, like the auroral electrojet index, as a diagnostic for the magnetospheric response. One approach is to examine the scaling behavior of these fluctuations. Previous studies have shown evidence of multifractality in solar wind quantities and geomagnetic indices, meaning that the scaling exponent varies from scale to scale. Recent studies have found that some quantities, like the auroral electrojet index, show a simple scaling collapse, while others do not. In this paper, the authors propose using fractional Levy motion (FLM) as a model to describe the scaling behavior of the solar wind function and geomagnetic indices. FLM is a process that exhibits both the Noah effect (large discontinuities) and the Joseph effect (non-negligible global statistical dependence). The authors show that FLM can accurately describe the scaling behavior of the data and suggest that it can be a useful model for analyzing the magnetospheric system.", "The SMC 3 system in the Magellanic clouds consists of a white dwarf and an M giant with an orbital period of 4.5 years. It is considered a possible supernova IA progenitor due to its high accretion rate. The mass of the red giant was estimated to be 2.3 times the mass of the sun. Using the Startrack population synthesis code, the system was modeled for its future evolution. It was found that the system will not become a type IA supernova, contrary to previous suggestions. This could be due to a lower predicted mass transfer rate, which may be caused by underestimating the red giant's mass loss through wind. The system also shows ellipsoidal variability, suggesting tidal interactions.", "The text discusses the theory of bigravity, which is a theory of gravity with two independent dynamical metrics. The action of the theory depends on two metrics and includes an interaction potential. The text highlights the problem of the regularity of black hole horizons in bigravity and presents a potential that is consistent with diff invariance. The text also introduces the Isham-Storey solution, which does not have regular horizons and cannot represent black holes. However, the text then discusses a more general potential that allows for regular black hole solutions. The properties of these regular black hole solutions, including their mass, thermodynamics, and phase transitions, are analyzed.", "Researchers have studied the force of the evanescent wave of a quasicircularly polarized guided light field of a nanofiber on a dielectric spherical particle. They found that for certain values of the particle size parameter, the azimuthal component of the force is opposite to the direction of energy flow around the nanofiber. The force components are influenced by the particle size, refractive index, and the fiber radius. The presence of water reduces the magnitude of the force and weakens the oscillatory behavior. This research has implications for manipulating and controlling dielectric particles using nanofibers.", "The paper discusses the problem of reconstructing the phylogenetic topology of four taxa, which is essential for phylogenetic inference. The paper introduces a maximum likelihood framework called \"emtree\" that uses the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer the best tree topology under a Markov process. The performance of emtree is compared to neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods on simulated data. emtree is also tested as input for quartet-based methods and compared to other input methods. The results show that emtree performs well in reconstructing 4-taxon trees and is less affected by long-branch attraction.", "This text discusses a scalar field toy-model in a six-dimensional flat spacetime with a codimension-two brane. The goal is to explore the consequences of coupling gravity and electromagnetism and understand the regularization of the theory. The authors show that by renormalizing the coupling constants, the propagators of the field on the brane can be made finite, allowing for a consistent effective field theory on the brane. The renormalization of the couplings is shown to ensure that the three-point and four-point functions are finite as well. The arguments presented support the claim that the theory is renormalizable and can be considered at the classical level. Additionally, the effects of introducing a photon confined to the brane and interacting with a gravitational wave are explored. The authors also discuss the implications of localized kinetic terms on the brane. Finally, they explain the consequences of introducing kinetic terms in a scalar field toy-model.", "The text discusses the concept of code coverage, which is a metric used in software and hardware testing to measure how much of an implementation has been tested. The text explains that in simple terms, code coverage involves testing different parts and behaviors of a program. The text presents complexity results for several coverage problems, including the maximal coverage problem and the coverage with bounded time problem. It shows that these problems can be NP-complete or PSPACE-complete depending on the type of graph or game being tested. The text also discusses the complexity of coverage problems in terms of the size of the graph or game. It concludes by mentioning that coverage problems can also be studied in more general models, such as those incorporating incomplete information or timing.", "The text discusses the relationship between solar activity and p-mode frequencies, which are oscillations in the sun's surface. It mentions that previous studies have found that p-mode frequencies increase with increasing solar activity, and that the most significant changes occur in the antisymmetric part of the spectrum of oscillation multiplets. The text also discusses the use of satellite intensity data to study the changes in the sun's magnetic field. It suggests that the changes in the magnetic field can be detected by observing the changes in the p-mode frequencies. The text also mentions the possibility of a contraction of the sun's outer layers as activity rises and the presence of large activity in the polar regions. The text concludes by discussing the role of changes in temperature and turbulent velocity induced by the magnetic field in determining the frequency changes.", "For over 50 years, the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) has been used to measure the star formation history in stellar populations. This technique has been used to study the ages of star clusters in our galaxy, as well as in galactic globular clusters. With the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the installation of the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, star formation histories in more complex populations in the local group could be measured. The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) was installed on the HST in 2001, allowing for dating of the oldest populations in the local group. Deep ACS imaging of Andromeda (M31) showed that its halo is younger than our own, with over half of the halo younger than 11 gyr. This data is also useful for studying transient phenomena and variable stars. In the future, the Supernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) are expected to advance the study of star formation histories. SNAP, with a larger field of view than the HST, could map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large galaxies. TPF, with a wide field of view, could provide photometry in galaxies further away. Current", "The text discusses the investigation of complex systems using cellular automaton models. In particular, a two-dimensional model of traffic flow is examined. The model is defined on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and consists of arrows that move either upwards or to the right. The dynamics of the model are controlled by traffic lights, which dictate the movement of the arrows. The velocity of an arrow is defined as the number of moves it makes divided by the number of time steps. The average velocity of the system is obtained by averaging the velocities of all the arrows.\n\nThe model exhibits self-organization, meaning that regardless of the initial conditions, the system tends to evolve towards configurations where all arrows move freely or where all arrows are blocked. These configurations are referred to as moving and jamming configurations, respectively. The system undergoes a sharp transition between these two types of configurations as the density of arrows increases.\n\nThe text presents several theorems that provide exact results on the critical densities of the system. The upper critical density is the density above which there are only jamming configurations asymptotically, and the lower critical density is the density below which there are no jamming configurations asymptotically. The critical density for the jamming transition, where the ensemble average velocity becomes nearly zero, is also", "Recent observations of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data provide evidence for the accelerating expansion of the current universe. This acceleration is believed to be driven by a dark energy component, which represents a large portion of the matter content of the universe. While the nature and mechanism of dark energy are still unknown, some theories propose modifications to the theory of gravity itself in order to eliminate the need for dark energy. One such model is the covariant brane model based on the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. \n\nThe simplest explanation for dark energy is the cosmological constant, but it suffers from the problem of its smallness and recent dominance in the universe. Other candidates for dark energy include evolving scalar fields (quintessence), phantom energy, and the Chaplygin gas. Some authors believe that the dark energy problem belongs to the domain of quantum gravity. \n\nTo compare different cosmological models, model comparison methods such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian evidence, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and Bayesian complexity are used. These methods help determine the best model based on the fit to observational data and the principle of Occam's razor. \n\nIn", "The ultimate nature of the dark sector of the universe, specifically the negative pressure component that is causing the acceleration of the universe, is a relevant issue. One explanation for this acceleration is a tiny positive cosmological constant introduced into Einstein's equation. However, physicists have also considered other explanations, such as the dynamics of a scalar field. Several possibilities have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom energy, and cosmon fields. One proposal involves mass varying particles coupled to dark energy through a dynamical mass dependence on a light scalar field. This scenario, called the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG), can explain the origin of cosmic acceleration and is consistent with observational data. In this study, the authors aim to demonstrate that the GCG is an effective description of a coupled fluid composed of dark energy with an equation of state given by a scalar field and cold dark matter with a dynamical mass driven by the scalar field. The authors analyze the consequences of coupling dark matter with a scalar field and discuss the stability and accelerated expansion of the universe. They find that the mass varying mechanism can reproduce the effective behavior of the GCG and provide a natural explanation for the cosmic acceleration. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings and the potential for future research in this field.", "Dissect-CF is a versatile simulation framework that allows researchers to evaluate and analyze the behavior of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) systems. The framework focuses on areas such as resource sharing, energy consumption, and virtual machine placement. Dissect-CF offers several benefits, including a unified resource sharing model and a more complete simulation of the IaaS stack. It also allows for fine-grained energy consumption modeling and supports the analysis of scheduling algorithms. The framework was compared to other simulators, such as CloudSim and GroudSim, and showed better performance and scalability. Additionally, the simulator was validated using workload traces from real infrastructures, such as the Grid Workloads Archive. Overall, Dissect-CF provides a powerful tool for researchers to experiment with and improve the internal behavior of IaaS systems.", "This paper discusses the problem of handling noise in experiments and presents a method for separating and measuring two types of noise. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to a noisy nonlinear chaotic dynamical system. They also discuss the distinction between dynamical noise and measurement noise, and how to quantify the amount of noise. The paper concludes by showing that the method can be used to extract the signal of dynamical noise and its correlation from measured data. Overall, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to analyze the kind of noise in time series data without prior knowledge of the underlying dynamics.", "Recent developments in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have revolutionized very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. The current generation of stereoscopic arrays has contributed over 100 new sources to the catalog of confirmed gamma-ray emitters. However, there is still a strong motivation to continue identifying and categorizing additional gamma-ray sources and source populations. The initial source detections are likely to be dominated by bright or nearby gamma-ray emitters, so subsequent observations must target fainter source populations. Analytical techniques that maximize the use of instrumental sensitivity will become increasingly important as the life cycles of IACT arrays continue. The joint likelihood approach is a new technique that allows for the treatment of systematic uncertainties affecting the relative normalization of on and off-source event sampling regions in IACT observations. This approach provides accurate confidence intervals and avoids the under-coverage issue that is often seen in traditional data stacking analyses.", "This text discusses the optimization of the source covariance matrix in a noncoherent half-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input single-output (MISO) relay channel. The authors propose a new method based on the Laplace transform order to determine the optimum source covariance matrix with channel mean feedback at the source. They show that beamforming in the direction of the channel mean is optimal under certain conditions and provide numerical examples to validate their results. The authors conclude that the Laplace transform ordering approach used in this paper can be applied to solve stochastic optimization problems in wireless communications and signal processing.", "The recent progress of storage media has led to renewed interest in coding techniques for ensuring reliability and longevity of storage media. Write-once-memory (WOM) codes have become a promising coding technique for storage media. WOM codes are used in binary WOM storage, such as punch cards and optical disks, where a storage cell has two states (0 or 1) and once a cell changes its state to 1, it cannot be reset to 0. The first binary WOM codes were presented by Rivest and Shamir in 1982, which sparked active research in the field. With the advent of flash memory with multiple levels, there has been a need to develop non-binary WOM codes that are applicable to multilevel flash memories. There are two types of non-binary WOM codes: variable rate codes and fixed rate codes. Variable rate codes allow for varying writing rates, while fixed rate codes have a fixed message alphabet and are more suitable for practical implementation. Various constructions of non-binary WOM codes have been proposed, including using lattice tiling, lattice continuous approximation, and integer programming. Recently, a fixed rate WOM code for reducing inter-cell interference (ici) in flash memories was proposed, which utilizes constraint coding to avoid patterns that cause large ici. However, systematic constructions for efficient", "The text discusses the search for Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) in the Milky Way's dark halo through gravitational microlensing. MACHOs passing near the line of sight to a background star cause the star to appear magnified. The time-dependent magnification is determined by the distance from the MACHO to the line of sight and the observer-star distance. The EROS and MACHO collaborations both conducted experiments to search for microlensing events, but no events were found. The EROS collaboration concluded that MACHOs with specific masses cannot make up the entire galactic halo. The MACHO collaboration placed strong limits on the existence of low mass MACHOs in the halo of the Milky Way. The analysis used the first two years of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud) data and imposed selection criteria to search for short duration \"spike\" events. No spike events were found, allowing for strong constraints on the prevalence of low mass MACHOs. Different halo models were also considered to determine the limits on the halo mass fraction that can be contributed by MACHOs in the excluded mass range. The limits obtained are the strongest to date.", "This text discusses the importance of flavor changing decays of heavy hadrons in understanding the quark structure and weak interactions of hadrons. The text specifically focuses on the semi-leptonic decay of a specific type of baryon and aims to determine the form factors of this decay using the method of QCD sum rules on the light cone. The light-cone sum rule (LCSR) method is a non-perturbative approach that replaces the short-distance Wilson Operator Product Expansion with a light-cone expansion in terms of distribution amplitudes. The text mentions previous applications of LCSR to baryons, including the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. The paper presents the theoretical framework and calculations for the form factors of the semi-leptonic decay, using two different types of interpolating currents. The results predict the decay width of the process and indicate that one type of current is in better agreement with experimental data. The text concludes by mentioning previous studies on the topic using different approaches such as flavor symmetry or quark models.", "The Rashba effect in solids is caused by the motion of an electron in a strong electric field. This effect is well-known to be strong at metallic surfaces due to the presence of strong potential gradients. Recent studies have looked at the impact of the Rashba effect on the surface states of Mott insulators, as it may be connected to topological insulators. This article explores the breakdown of charge ordering in Mott insulators caused by strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The authors study a lattice model of interacting bosons in the presence of Rashba coupling and find that strong Rashba coupling can drive a direct transition from a Mott insulator to a superfluid state, even in the absence of single particle tunneling. They also find that the resulting superfluids exhibit finite momentum and have staggered phase patterns, and that they can be observed in time-of-flight measurements of the momentum distribution. The authors discuss the effects of boundary conditions and trapping potentials on the superfluid transitions, and show that first-order transitions between different superfluids can occur in finite-sized systems. They also show that these first-order transitions become smooth in infinite system sizes. Overall, this study provides insights into the interplay between strong interactions and Rashba spin-orbit coupling in Mott ins", "The paper discusses three phenomena of the universe that can be used to constrain cosmological models: 1) primordial fluctuations, which are currently studied using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe; 2) the expansion of the universe, which can be measured using standard candles and rulers, such as Type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations; and 3) the growth of cosmic structures, which can be examined using the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, abundance of galaxy clusters, and weak gravitational lensing. The paper proposes using the large-scale distribution of galaxies as a tool to study both the primordial fluctuations and the expansion history of the universe. This method, called the genus statistic, measures the topology of the large-scale structure and can be used as a cosmic standard ruler. The paper also discusses the limitations and systematic effects of using these methods and suggests future directions for research.", "The paper discusses the flat spectral indices observed in many galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), particularly those that interact with molecular clouds. The authors review different models proposed to explain this phenomenon, including the presence of a second-order Fermi acceleration, the contribution of secondary particles, and the thermal contamination from the surrounding environment. They also discuss the possibility of intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung radiation as a potential explanation for the observed flat spectra. The authors highlight the need for more accurate data and observations at higher frequencies to better understand the nature of the flat spectral indices in SNRs.", "The author discusses their experience studying physics in Copenhagen in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They specifically mention attending experimental meetings at the Niels Bohr Institute and learning from physicists Aage Bohr and Ben Mottelson. The author also highlights five topics in nuclear structure physics that they have worked on: particle-vibration coupling, one-particle motion in deformed and rotating potentials, triaxial shape of nuclei, nuclear structure as the neutron-drip-line approaches, and nuclear shell-structure in oblate deformation. They describe their research in these areas and the importance of understanding the interplay between one-particle and collective degrees of freedom. The author also touches on the formation of neutron halo nuclei and the possibility of oblate deformation in light nuclei.  Overall, the author emphasizes the significance of experimental data and its role in driving progress in nuclear structure physics.", "This paper discusses theories with extra spacetime dimensions, particularly in the context of string theory. The authors explore the implications of these higher-dimensional models for particle phenomenology and cosmology. They focus on braneworld models, where gravity can propagate freely through the extra dimensions but standard model particles are confined to the four-dimensional spacetime. The authors propose a higher-dimensional scenario based on nonfactorizable geometry that accounts for the hierarchy problem without introducing large extra dimensions. They show that by introducing a bulk stabilizing scalar field, the modulus of the brane separation can be stabilized without fine-tuning. The authors also discuss the effect of gauge fields or higher form fields in these models. They extend their results to arbitrary numbers of warped dimensions and derive the KK decomposition of the scalar KK masses. They show that in multiply warped models, there are a larger number of KK modes than in the five-dimensional RS model, with effective couplings in the inverse TeV range. The authors also discuss the numerical values of various parameters and compute the low-lying KK mode masses in their multiply warped model. They show that the KK modes are localized in the TeV brane and discuss the possible experimental signatures of extra dimensions. They also discuss the implications of their model for precision electroweak tests and derive", "In this study, the authors investigate the different extraction schemes for obtaining electromagnetic form factors of spin-one particles in light-front calculations. They compare the results obtained from a covariant calculation and a non-covariant light-front calculation using different prescriptions. The light-front calculations are performed using a null-plane wave function for the meson and the results are compared to the covariant calculation. The authors find that the different prescriptions for the light-front calculation lead to different results for the form factors, with the (gk) prescription showing the best consistency with the covariant results. They also find that the non-relativistic limit results in a vanishing quadrupole form factor for a s-wave state. The authors conclude that the (gk) prescription is the most suitable for calculating the form factors of the meson in the null-plane wave-function approach.", "The study focuses on the elliptic flow, which is the second moment of the azimuthal momentum distribution. It is a collective effect that provides information about the density and energy loss of partons in heavy ion collisions. The ideal hydrodynamics framework accurately explains the elliptic flow data up to certain transverse momenta, but fails to capture high transverse momenta. This is because ideal hydrodynamics assumes local equilibrium, which is not valid for heavy ion collisions. The study explores the dependence of elliptic flow on the initial density and elastic cross section. Parton cascade simulations show that the initial parton density based on Hijing is too low to produce the observed elliptic flow. Gluon saturation models predict higher initial densities that may explain the observed flow. The study also considers the effects of inelastic parton energy loss and hadronization on the final observable hadron flow. The elastic gluon scattering matrix elements are modeled using a Debye-screened form. The calculations show that the elliptic flow increases with increasing transverse momentum until it saturates at high values. It also varies with the impact parameter, showing a maximum at a certain distance. Quenching of the transverse momentum spectra due to elastic energy loss is also observed. The study concludes that", "The theory of persistent homology uses homology as a tool to analyze data and associate a computable invariant to a point cloud. It has applications in areas such as sensor networks and complex network theory. The theory approximates the point cloud with simplicial complexes and analyzes the long-lived homological features to infer the shape of the data. Multipersistent homology is a generalization of this theory where the homology is studied in a multifiltration, a sequence of simplicial complexes evolving along different directions. Previous work has studied the classification problem for multipersistence homology modules and developed algorithms for computing their Gr\u00f6bner bases. However, these algorithms have limitations in terms of the running time. This paper presents a new approach that eliminates the bottleneck of previous methods by using a new presentation of multipersistence modules. The algorithm has polynomial complexity for all multifiltrations and is especially efficient in the one-critical case. The paper also provides a step-by-step description of the algorithm and includes examples to illustrate the process.", "The driving mechanism of relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and galactic microquasars is a major problem in astrophysics. The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is a widely discussed model that explains the energy extraction from a rotating black hole along magnetic field lines. This process produces jets dominated by Poynting flux, which accelerate plasma particles to relativistic speeds. Recent observations of the M87 jet are being compared to this theoretical model. While the steady state condition of no Poynting flux is well understood, the physical mechanism for the creation of the flux in electromagnetically dominated plasma is not clear. The origin of the steady electric current that produces the toroidal magnetic field is still unknown. Previous studies have focused on the steady state condition without considering the time-dependent state towards the steady state. It is suggested that the electric current is driven in the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic region in the time-dependent state, and these regions are hidden near or within the event horizon in the steady state. The steady current is maintained without any current-driving source because force-free plasma has no resistivity. The physical mechanism for the production of the outward Poynting flux in the BZ process is", "The text discusses the properties of networks of semiflexible filaments and fibers, which are common in biological systems and are also being produced in industry for manufacturing functional materials. The physics of a single semiflexible filament is well understood, and the full theory is capable of accurately describing its force-extension relationship and transverse fluctuations. However, the physics of a network of semiflexible filaments is more complex, and various theoretical models have been proposed to describe their mechanical response. The text discusses some of these models and their limitations. It then presents a continuum theory of semiflexible networks, which takes into account the individual filament properties and the connectivity of the network. The theory is able to accurately describe a wide range of shear stress data for different filament networks. It also predicts the positive or negative poynting effect (normal stress) in a sheared network, depending on the filament stiffness and pre-tension. The theory also reveals the importance of filament pre-tension for the stability of the network and its mechanical properties. Overall, the presented theory provides an efficient and portable tool for studying the mechanical properties of semiflexible networks.", "The article discusses a dynamic model of economic aggregation and migration using active brownian particles. The model considers the movement of employed and unemployed agents, as well as the hiring and firing rates. The dynamics of the model are simulated using computer simulations. The simulations show that there are two stages in the evolution of economic centers: during the first stage, small economic centers are formed based on cooperative effects among the agents, while in the second stage, some of these small centers grow and compete with each other. The coexistence of different economic centers is stable, and there is a quasi-stationary non-equilibrium within each center. The simulations also show the concentration of the labor force in different extended economic regions. The model provides insights into the spatial-temporal patterns of economic aggregation and migration.", "Heterostructures involving transition-metal oxides have been of interest because they allow for the exploration of new functionalities that are not possible in the bulk material. Perovskite manganites, in particular, are promising candidates for spintronic devices due to their high spin polarization and high ferromagnetic Curie temperature. One potential application of perovskite manganites is as a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) junction, where the conductance across an insulating barrier can be changed by altering the magnetic orientation of the leads. However, previous attempts to fabricate perovskite TMR junctions have shown that the magnetoresistance decreases rapidly at temperatures below the Curie temperature, due to the temperature dependence of the spin polarization at the interfaces. In this paper, the authors investigate the surface magnetic phase transition of the double-exchange model for manganites using the Schwinger-boson mean-field method. They focus on metallic manganites with a relatively high Curie temperature and show that the surface magnetization decreases more rapidly than the bulk magnetization with increasing temperature. They also discuss the implications of these findings for the TMR effect and potential ways to improve it by suppressing low-energy spin fluctuations.", "The text discusses the solar neutrino deficit and the various solutions proposed to explain it. The most popular solution is neutrino oscillations, but the recent data also supports the neutrino magnetic moment solutions. The text also introduces the concept of resonant spin-flavor precession (RSFP) as a solution to the solar neutrino problem. The authors assume that RSFP is solely responsible for the neutrino deficit and discuss the consequences of this scenario. They derive a field profile function based on the RSFP framework and discuss the effects of neutrino parameters and solar neutrino data on the shape of the profile. The authors conclude that the RSFP solution is appealing based on data fits, but further experiments are needed to confirm its validity.", "The inverse Ising problem, which involves reconstructing the parameters of an Ising model from experimental data, has been intensively studied in recent years. In this problem, the goal is to find the fields and couplings that give rise to the same statistics as the experimental data. To account for sparsity in the network, a regularization term is added to the cost function. The regularized Ising model is then solved using the Bethe approximation and an l0-norm penalty. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated on sparse Hopfield networks, and the optimal regularization parameter is found to depend on the number of samples. The method improves the prediction accuracy and is applicable to other models as well.", "The photoemission process involves the ejection of excited electrons from the surface in order to reach a detector. The intensity measured in an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment depends on the properties of the initial and final states near the Fermi energy in the presence of the surface. This difference in intensity, known as the matrix element effect, is important in interpreting ARPES spectra, especially in complex materials like high-temperature superconductors. In this study, simulations of ARPES spectra in Bi2212 (BISCO) were carried out using first-principles band theory. The excitation of states near the M symmetry point, which have been the subject of controversy, was focused on. The intensity of the spectra depends strongly on the energy and polarization of the incident light. The behavior of the antibonding and bonding states differs, making it possible to distinguish closely placed bilayer bands by choosing appropriate experimental parameters. The polarization dependence of the spectra can be understood in terms of the symmetries of the initial and final states. The momentum matrix element for bulk transitions was investigated, revealing interference effects that enhance or suppress the intensity of specific transitions from certain atomic sites. These interference effects can be understood by considering the behavior of the initial and final states", "Graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphitic systems have unique electrical and mechanical properties, making them of great interest for a wide range of applications. Graphite, or multilayer graphene, is a van der Waals solid, meaning that the layers can easily slide and get peeled. The bending properties of multilayer graphene are dominated by interlayer shear, rather than compression. This bending-induced sliding affects the stacking and registry of the graphene layers, which in turn influence the electronic properties. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the detailed mechanical behavior of sliding stacks and the registry changes under bending. The simulations showed that sliding patterns altered the local stacking and registry of multilayer graphene, suggesting the possibility of modifying or controlling the electronic properties by peeling or creating localized kinks. The study also demonstrated that the sliding behavior depends on the stacking and direction of bending. The peeling force was found to be proportional to the number of layers, and the simulations did not observe stable kinks in multilayer graphene after releasing the peeling force. Overall, the study provides insights into the mechanics of multilayer graphene and its potential for electronic and optical property modification.", "Researchers are interested in designing efficient sources of terahertz (THz) radiation because of the wide range of potential applications in various scientific fields. However, the currently existing THz emitters have limitations in terms of size, cost, power consumption, and quantum efficiency. One possibility for improving the efficiency of THz emission is by using the phenomenon of bosonic stimulation in excitonic and exciton-polaritonic systems. A specific scheme that has attracted attention is the possibility of a radiative transition between 2p and 1s exciton states, which can be achieved through two-photon pumping of an exciton state. This scheme can lead to the efficient emission of THz photons and even the polariton lasing effect. The theoretical model presented in this article describes a THz laser based on the 2p to 1s optical transition. The model includes a quantum well placed inside a microcavity tuned to resonance with two-photon absorption and also a larger THz cavity to improve the efficiency of THz emission. The model predicts the occurrence of novel phenomena such as optical bistability and hysteresis of the THz signal. Experimental results demonstrate the possibility of achieving stable THz lasing and hysteresis behavior in the system.", "The text discusses the physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. It focuses on the underdoped and optimal doped regions, as well as the electron-doped cuprates. In the underdoped region, the pseudogap plays a crucial role, leading to the formation of hole pairs with a d-wave bound state. The energy gap (pseudogap) decreases with increasing hole doping, while the critical temperature for superconductivity increases. In the optimal doped region, both the pseudogap and superconductivity are present, and there is a coexistence of competing phases. The electron-doped cuprates have a more robust antiferromagnetic phase and show similar behavior to the overdoped region of the hole-doped cuprates. Overall, the superconducting transition is driven by weak-coupling d-wave BCS pairing in momentum space.", "The paper discusses the problem of coding over broadcast networks with multiple messages and more than two sink nodes. The paper introduces a new set of network coding bounds, called generalized cut-set bounds, which relate the basic cuts of the network using various set operations. The bounds are established using the submodularity of the Shannon entropy. The paper demonstrates the tightness of the bounds using examples of combination networks. The paper concludes by discussing future research on the topic.", "Recently, the problem of electromagnetic gauge invariance in deeply virtual compton scattering (DVCS) and similar exclusive processes has been discussed extensively. This development explored the similarity with earlier studied inclusive spin-dependent processes, and the transverse component of momentum transfer in DVCS corresponds to the transverse spin in DIS. The gauge invariance of relevant amplitudes is ensured by means of twist three contributions and the use of equations of motion, which exclude three-particle correlators from the amplitude. By combining these contributions with two-particle correlator contributions, a gauge invariant expression for the physical amplitude or hadron tensor can be obtained. This method was originally developed for particular inclusive processes with transverse polarized hadrons, like structure functions in DIS and single spin asymmetry (SSA) due to soft quarks. The color gauge invariance of the gluonic poles contributions was previously explored by other methods relying on Wilson exponentials. In this paper, the approaches are combined and applied to the case of the Drell-Yan (DY) process with a transversely polarized nucleon. The single spin asymmetry (SSA) in the DY process with a transversely polarized target manifests the gluonic pole contributions. The authors perform a thorough analysis to", "The aim of research in nuclear physics is to understand the properties of all nuclei in the periodic table using a unified method. Currently, the most successful theories for describing nuclear properties are the conventional Hartree-Fock method and the relativistic mean field theory. These theories are based on non-relativistic and relativistic kinematics, respectively. The relativistic mean field theory has been successful in describing many nuclear properties, but there are still fewer properties investigated than in the non-relativistic theory. In order to properly describe nuclear properties over a wide mass range, deformation effects and pairing correlations need to be taken into account. In this study, the authors use the deformed relativistic mean field theory with a zero-range three-force in the pairing channel to analyze the properties of Zr and Sn isotopes. They find good agreement with experimental data for binding energies, separation energies, odd-even staggerings, and nuclear radii. They also find that Sn isotopes are deformed in the region of Sn-130 and that the predicted halo phenomena in Zr isotopes are confirmed. Overall, the results support the use of the relativistic mean field theory for studying exotic nuclei.", "The Fermi Bubbles (FBs) are extended regions of gamma emission around the galactic center. They have a relatively constant intensity and can potentially be a source of high-energy neutrinos. The Antares neutrino telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, is used to detect and study these neutrinos. The telescope uses photomultiplier tubes to detect the Cherenkov light emitted by the neutrino-induced muons and reconstruct their direction and energy. The expected event flux from the FBs is lower than the atmospheric neutrino flux, so a proper estimation of the atmospheric background is crucial. The background is estimated directly from data by comparing the on zone (FBs area) with off zones (areas outside the FBs). The analysis cuts are optimized using Monte Carlo simulations to maximize sensitivity and reject atmospheric muons and neutrinos. No evidence of a neutrino signal from the FBs is found, and upper limits are calculated for different energy cutoffs. The data collected in 2011 will be added to increase the statistical significance of the analysis, and a neural network will be used to increase the energy resolution and sensitivity of the telescope.", "The author argues that the widely accepted model of the universe, based on an isotropic homogeneous geometry, overlooks the physical properties of general relativity. They propose a new model that accounts for the observed structure of the universe and the effects of gravitational energy. This new model resolves anomalies and makes new predictions, and is supported by observational data. The author suggests that the apparent cosmic acceleration often attributed to \"dark energy\" is actually a result of gravitational energy differences. The model also explains the observed isotropic hubble flow and addresses the sandage-de vaucouleurs paradox. The author concludes that a new understanding of the universe is needed, one that considers the subtleties of gravitational energy and the operational issues of measuring in general relativity.", "The normal distribution is commonly used in statistical problems in astrophysics and physics. However, it is often more useful to measure the deviations of a probability density function (PDF) from the normal distribution rather than proving that it is close to the Gaussian distribution. This has been done in various cosmological models, elliptical galaxies, and turbulence studies. Chebyshev and Hermite polynomials have been used to study slightly non-Gaussian distributions, and there are different expansion forms using these polynomials. The Gram-Charlier series is a Fourier expansion that often diverges in practical situations, while the Gauss-Hermite series has better convergence properties. The Edgeworth expansion, although divergent, is more useful in many applications because it is directly connected to the moments and cumulants of a PDF and is a true asymptotic expansion. The Edgeworth expansion has been used in studies of peculiar velocities resulting from cosmic strings and is capable of reliably extracting deviations from Gaussianity even when they are small.", "Gravitational lenses, also known as gravitational mirages, are distorted images of distant objects that are caused by the gravitational potentials of other objects. These lenses are now valuable tools in cosmological studies. The equations of general relativity can be used to understand the effects of gravitational potential on light rays. Around 50 distant galaxies are known to be strongly lensed by mass concentrations along the shortest path between the galaxies and Earth. One example is the cluster of galaxies CL0024+1654, which produces five images of a more distant ring galaxy. Gravitational lenses can be used to map the gravitating mass in the lensing object and to magnify features in distant objects. They can also be used to derive cosmological parameters such as the matter density of the universe, the cosmological constant, and the expansion rate of the universe. Time delays in the arrival of light from multiple images can be used to determine the expansion rate of the universe. However, there are challenges in observing and modeling gravitational lenses, and more data and analysis are required to improve the accuracy of measurements.", "The paper discusses the results of a combined analysis of ground-based and space-based photometric observations of the star HD 29248 (also known as Eri). The authors report the detection of six new gravity-mode frequencies and discuss the discrepancies between the observed and theoretical amplitude ratios of the pulsations. They suggest that mode identification in Cepheid stars should not be based solely on optical observations and that further theoretical work is needed to explain the observed pulsation amplitudes. The paper concludes with acknowledgements of funding support for the research.", "The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to perfectly copy an arbitrary unknown quantum state. Various cloning machines have been developed, including the Wootters-Zurek and Buek-Hillery copying machines. State-dependent cloners, which require information about the cloning state, have also been studied. Bounds on the global fidelity of the quantum cloning process have been explored, with the optimal strategy depending on the state set being cloned. The paper discusses the case of a three-state-dependent quantum cloning process and generalizes the method to multi-state-dependent cloning. Lemmas are introduced and the upper bounds for the global fidelity of the cloning process are derived. The conclusion highlights the importance of state-dependent cloning and its relation to eavesdropping in quantum cryptography.", "This text discusses the classification of radio sources based on their accretion rates and the presence of certain features in their spectra. The study uses mid-IR observations to search for evidence of accretion in radio sources. The sample studied includes the 37 brightest radio sources from the VLA survey. The objects are classified into different categories based on their optical/IR features, such as quasar, obscured quasar, galaxy, starburst, etc. The study finds that nearly all quasar-like objects in the sample are above the luminosity break between FRI and FRII radio structures, except for one object. The study also introduces the concept of the \"quasar-mode fraction\" to describe the fraction of objects with high accretion rates. The study examines the correlation between mid-IR excess and blueness and finds a positive correlation. The text also discusses a simple model connecting blueness and mid-IR excess. The study concludes that whenever nuclear accretion is significant, dust in the torus absorbs 30% of the photons and dust above and below the torus scatters 21% of the photons.", "The text discusses the correspondence between gravitational physics in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time and conformal field theories (CFTs) in one dimension fewer. This correspondence is known as holography. The field theory is identified as living on the boundary of the AdS space-time. The text also studies the thermal properties of charged black holes in AdS and determines the thermal phase structure of the corresponding field theories. It finds behavior consistent with field theory interpretations and presents some of the black hole solutions and their properties for the first time. The text discusses the connection between rotating branes and the corresponding gauge theories and explains the different types of symmetries that appear in the field theories. The results show interesting phase structures at various temperatures and suggest confinement at zero temperature. The text concludes by discussing the universal structures and the resemblance to the behavior of other thermodynamic systems.", "The formation mechanism of neutron stars (NSS) and black holes (BHS) is still unknown in high-energy astrophysics. One way to investigate the formation of NSS and BHS is by studying the birth and evolution of X-ray binaries hosting a BH or a NS accreting from a companion star. The galactic distribution of these binaries can provide information about the formation of compact objects. Pulsar proper motions have shown evidence that some NSS receive a low velocity, while others a high velocity at formation, known as \u201cnatal kicks\u201d (NKs). The prevailing idea is that NSS are formed either in a standard core-collapse supernova (SN), or in a less energetic type of SN expected for stars with small cores. For BHS, observations are scarce so far. In this paper, the authors investigate whether the galactic distribution of XRBs hosting a BH can reveal something about how BHS are formed. They build synthetic populations of BH- and NS-XRBs to model their binary evolution and kinematics in the galaxy, and investigate how different assumptions on compact object formation affect the observed distribution of these binaries. They also discuss a method to estimate the minimum peculiar velocity at birth of individual BH-XRBs, and analyze the validity of their estimate using simulations", "The text discusses the calculation of gluon bremsstrahlung from high-energy particles in a quark-gluon plasma. It explains that this calculation is complicated by the Landau-Pomeranchuk Migdal (LPM) effect, which affects the coherence of gluon emission. The text mentions different formalisms for treating the LPM effect and focuses on the Amy formalism. It states that the Amy formalism was derived independently and has some limitations, but can be used for the calculation of transport coefficients. The text also discusses the value of the jet broadening parameter in the weak coupling limit and provides equations and approximations for its calculation. It concludes with acknowledgments and references.", "The planetary nebula NGC6369 has a complex morphology, consisting of a main bright annulus and fainter outer structures. Deep narrow band images of NGC6369 were obtained, but no large faint halo was found. The HST image of NGC6369 shows the same main features as the observed image but with additional resolved details. The equatorial and galactic coordinates for NGC6369 are provided. The extreme distances determined for NGC6369 range from 0.33kpc to 2.00kpc, with a mean value of 1039pc. The temperature of the central star is determined to be 91000K. Spectra of NGC6369 were obtained, showing an expansion velocity of 13km/s and a system radial velocity of -106km/s. The spectral energy distribution of NGC6369 shows flux values over a range of wavelengths. Planetary nebulae are classified based on their appearance, but this classification can be misleading. Detailed modeling is needed to determine the 3D gas distribution. By determining the 3D structure of nebulae, more accurate distances can be determined. Observations of NGC6369 were made using a 1.5 m telescope with the RC spectrograph", "The text discusses the concept of community detection in network systems. It explains that network systems often display a modular organization, with densely connected clusters of nodes. Detecting these modules can uncover similarity classes of vertices and reveal the organization and function of the system. The text also mentions that detecting community structure in complex networks is a difficult task due to the controversial definition of a community. It suggests that consensus clustering, which combines multiple partitions of a network, can overcome some of the challenges associated with community detection. The text also discusses the computational complexity of community detection algorithms and the need to consider multiple network features, such as edge direction and weight. The text concludes by summarizing the advantages of consensus clustering, including its ability to generate more accurate and stable partitions and its effectiveness in tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic networks.", "The study focuses on the observation and analysis of the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD  189733b and HD  209458b, using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The authors use a technique called transmission spectroscopy to study atoms, molecules, and clouds in the atmospheres of these planets. They find deviations from a blackbody emission in the spectra, indicating the presence of absorption features due to water and methane. The study also provides insights into the structure and energy budget of the planets. The authors suggest that the differences in the physical properties and atmospheres of the two planets may be connected to their different levels of irradiation and internal energy sources. The study concludes that the Spitzer Space Telescope is a valuable tool for studying the atmospheres of distant exoplanets.", "A recent study used simulated galaxy disks to investigate the evolution of the magnitude-size relation in galaxies. The study found that the size of the disks is growing with time, while the luminosity is decreasing. This is in line with previous observational studies that have shown a dimming of surface brightness in disk galaxies since a redshift of 1. The simulations also matched well with observed disk sizes at both redshifts. The study concluded that the evolution in the magnitude-size plane is dependent on the mass of the galaxies, with more massive galaxies undergoing larger changes in size. The results also indicated that low mass galaxies show less growth in size compared to their more massive counterparts. The study also compared the simulated galaxies to analytic models and found that the predicted sizes based on these models were generally shorter than the sizes derived from the simulated light profiles. The discrepancy was attributed to the difference in the spin of the gas in the halo compared to the total halo. The study further demonstrated that the simulated galaxies followed the observed trends in the stellar mass-surface density relation. Overall, the study concluded that disk galaxies were growing in size with time and that this growth was consistent with the observed magnitudes and sizes of disk galaxies.", "The article discusses the superconducting properties of the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate superconductor RuSr2GdCu2O8 (Ru-1212). The compound consists of CuO2 bilayers and RuO2 monolayers. The role of the RuO2 layers is to enhance inter-layer coupling and reduce anisotropy. The compound exhibits both superconducting and magnetic properties, with the magnetic order below a certain temperature still being the subject of debate. The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in this compound is unusual, as they are typically thought to be mutually exclusive. The researchers used point-contact spectroscopy to study the superconducting order parameter in the samples. They found that the order parameter symmetry that best fits the experimental conductance curves is 2-wave, indicating that superconductivity in Ru-1212 is due to singlet Cooper pairs. The researchers also investigated the temperature dependence of the conductance curves and found that the zero-bias conductance peak decreases and goes to zero with increasing temperature. The results suggest that superconductivity in Ru-1212 is more similar to other cuprates than to ruthenates. However, further research is needed to fully understand the complex properties of this compound.", "The paper discusses the use of entangled qubits, specifically the polarization state of a photon, in quantum information processing and quantum cryptography. It focuses on the creation of entangled qudits using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The authors propose an experiment to test the non-locality of high-dimensional two-photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) states using just two detectors. They also discuss the reduction of the dimensionality of the two-photon Hilbert space and the violation of the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality. The paper concludes by stating that their experimental setup allows for the verification of the non-locality of the high-dimensional entangled states.", "This paper discusses the generation of single-band point source catalogues from scan-map observations made using the SPire instrument on the Herschel space observatory. The observations were part of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HERMES) and cover approximately 20 degrees in five regions located in four extra-galactic fields. The observations were taken in different modes and scan speeds, with the number of repetitions indicated in the table provided. Additional details about the observations can be found in the cited references.", "The text discusses the applications and physical phenomena of nanometer periodic magnetic dot arrays in magnetic recording and magnetic sensors. The study focuses on the dynamics of magnetization reversal in these nanostructures using simulations. The authors propose the use of artificial neural networks to analyze and classify the simulated magnetic structures. The paper presents the results of the simulations, including the formation of vortices and domain walls, and discusses the dynamics of the magnetization reversal process. The authors also compare the simulations with a simplified four-spin model and discuss the use of adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks for clustering and classifying the intra-dot configurations. The results suggest that the ART networks can effectively categorize the different magnetic configurations. Finally, the authors highlight the potential applications of ART networks in three-dimensional lattices.", "The paper by Liang et al. studied the coulomb breakup of 9Li experimentally. The motivation for this study was to use coulomb dissociation as a technique for studying stellar nucleosynthesis involving short-lived nuclei. The authors argued that with an increasing number of radioactive isotope beams available for studying capture reactions in stellar environments, more measurements will be performed using coulomb dissociation. In order to extract reliable information on radiative capture, the authors stressed the importance of understanding the reaction mechanism in coulomb dissociation. They specifically focused on the dynamic polarization effect, which they interpreted as a displacement of the valence proton behind the nuclear core and subsequent shielding from the target. This effect leads to a reduction in breakup probability compared to first-order perturbation theory predictions. While coulomb dissociation of neutron-rich nuclei is well understood, proton-rich nuclei are not as well-studied. The authors suggested that higher-order corrections and more accurate models are needed for proton breakup. They used first-order perturbation theory to calculate proton breakup and found that their model was successful in reproducing experimental angular distributions by increasing the binding energy of the valence proton. However, they also concluded that a more quantitatively reliable model is needed. This paper reports on", "Globular clusters (GCs) are valuable for studying the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. Accurate knowledge of their metal content is important for understanding astrophysical problems. High resolution spectroscopy is the best way to determine metal abundance, but it is limited to only a few stars. Indirect metallicity indicators have been used to overcome this limitation, but they require accurate calibration. This study presents new calibrations for metallicity indicators based on the morphology and position of the red giant branch (RGB) in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The calibrations are based on a new metallicity scale derived from high dispersion, high signal-to-noise spectra of red giants in 24 clusters. The calibrations provide good relative determinations of metallicity with an average uncertainty of 0.08 dex. These new calibrations help bridge the gap between photometric and spectroscopic determinations of metal abundance in GCs.", "Superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds is believed to be due to collective electronic fluctuations rather than electron-phonon interactions. The transport properties of these compounds in the superconducting state support the idea that the symmetry of the superconductivity is d-wave, which is promoted by antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations with long correlation lengths. This promotes scattering of fermions near the Fermi surface predominantly through angles around pi/2, which is essential for superconducting instability in the d-wave channel. Superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds generally occurs near the AFM quantum critical point where the correlation lengths are long. Random phase approximation calculations on the Hubbard model also suggest that d-wave superconductivity is promoted by AFM fluctuations. In recent years, inelastic neutron scattering experiments have provided details of the AFM fluctuation spectrum in heavy fermion compounds. This paper aims to estimate the superconducting transition temperature using the parameters provided by these experiments and solve the Eliashberg equations for d-wave superconductivity. The results suggest that AFM fluctuations are responsible for d-wave superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds.", "The GAMMEV Chameleon Afterglow Search (CHASE) experiment reported observing an anomalous afterglow in their apparatus after shining a high-power laser into a cryogenic vacuum chamber immersed in a magnetic field. The experiment was designed to produce chameleon particles through induced photon-chameleon oscillations within the magnetic field. The observed afterglow, known as the \"orange glow,\" did not match the theoretical predictions and had properties such as independence of laser polarization and magnetic field, a variety of outgoing photon wavelengths dominated by orange and red, and a dependence on the temperature of the vacuum chamber. Further tests were conducted to characterize the orange glow, including measurements using optical filters and varying vacuum chamber temperatures. The results showed that the orange glow had a temperature dependence and was broadband, lasting for at least a few seconds. The orange glow was similar to luminescence observed in vacuum products but had some differences in wavelength peak, decay time, and temperature dependence. The orange glow did not hinder the achievement of the design sensitivity for CHASE, but it could prove a limitation for experiments with lower dark rate photon detectors.", "The current set of interferometric gravitational wave detectors, including LIGO, Virgo, GEO, and TAMA, are expected to achieve sensitivities at which detections of gravitational waves are possible. These detectors are starting full-blown science runs, and plans for more sensitive second and third-generation detectors are being developed. There is also the possibility of a space-based observatory called LISA in the near future. This study focuses on the capture of compact stellar-sized objects by supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei, which will generate gravitational waves within LISA's sensitivity band. The challenge is to accurately model the decay of the orbits and the emission of gravitational waves, taking into account the back-reaction of the waves on the captured objects. The study proposes a perturbative approach in the time domain to treat this problem for equatorial circular particle orbits around a rapidly rotating black hole. The code used in the study evolves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain and analyzes the radiation at infinity. The code has been tested for various scenarios and has been found to produce stable evolutions. It imposes appropriate boundary conditions at the black hole horizon, rotation axis, and outer boundary. The code also calculates the energy and angular momentum fluxes in gravitational radiation. The convergence of", "The text discusses the formulation of physical theories that aim to unify all known fundamental interactions by introducing extra dimensions. These extra dimensions can have either a microscopic size or be large or even infinite. The text also introduces the concept of branes, which are hypersurfaces that matter fields are confined to, and discusses the classification of branes into infinitely thin branes and thick branes. The text then focuses on the study of thick branes supported by spinor fields, which are fields that describe particles with half-integer spin. The text presents equations for these systems and discusses the numerical calculations and results obtained. The text concludes by discussing the trapping of a test scalar field on the brane and the interpretation of the obtained solutions as brane solutions. The research is supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.", "The SDSS and 2DF surveys are conducting deep, wide-field redshift surveys to produce three-dimensional maps of extragalactic objects. These surveys rely on multiplexed instruments to record spectra at high rates. The accuracy of fiber positioning and other observational parameters affect the level of signal recorded. Factors such as astrometry, atmospheric dispersion, and focus errors can introduce errors in fiber positions. These errors can decrease the efficiency of observations and lead to position-dependent measurement errors. The efficiency of observation is defined as the fraction of light that enters the spectrograph input aperture. The efficiency depends on factors such as the image quality, fiber size, and fiber position errors. Knowing the sources of fiber position errors can help improve the efficiency of spectrographic observations. Tools such as real-time evaluation of signal-to-noise ratio and automated guiding systems can aid in maximizing the efficiency of fiber spectrographic surveys. Despite the challenges, surveys like the SDSS and 2DF have achieved success in mapping large areas of the sky.", "The study focuses on the effects of molecular discreteness on reaction systems. It investigates the transitions and dynamics that occur when the number of molecules in a system is small. The study demonstrates that discreteness can induce transitions to novel states, such as the 1-3 rich state and the 2-4 rich state. These states have different concentrations of chemicals and can greatly affect the behavior of the system. The study also discusses the requirements for transitions to occur and the stability of the different states. Additionally, the study explores the influence of molecular discreteness on macroscopic properties such as average chemical concentrations. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering molecular discreteness in understanding and modeling reaction systems.", "The geomagnetism of the Earth has been a longstanding and unsolved problem since it was discovered in the 1600s. Recent studies have used numerical simulations and simple models to understand the dynamics and features of geomagnetism. One such model is the \"domino model,\" which describes geomagnetism as a system of interacting macro-spins. This model has been successful in capturing many observed features of geomagnetism, such as its time evolution, power spectrum, and frequency distribution of stable polarity periods. \n\nIn this paper, the authors propose a more minimal and general version of the domino model called the \"long-range coupled spin model\" or LCS. In this model, all macro-spins interact with each other with the same amplitude of interaction, regardless of their distance. The authors demonstrate that this long-range coupling model is effective in describing the observed features of geomagnetism. \n\nThe authors also apply the LCS model to other celestial objects, such as planets and satellites, and show that it can be consistent with their magnetic fields as well. They also explore the synchronization physics of the LCS model and show that it can describe the quasi-periodic variation of the solar magnetic field. \n\nOverall, the LCS model is a simple yet effective model that can describe the dynamics and", "The paper discusses the study of non-ergodic effects in disordered systems of interacting localized particles, specifically focusing on the Coulomb glass. The main goal is to analyze the transitions between many-particle states and their influence on the specific heat. The paper presents a three-stage algorithm for obtaining low-energy many-particle states, as well as a method for mapping the dynamical behavior of the system using transition probabilities. The results show that non-ergodic effects are important in the Coulomb glass and depend on various factors such as temperature, disorder, and dimensionality. The paper concludes that the measuring time required to reach thermal equilibrium is much longer than typical experimental times, indicating glassy behavior. The studies have been performed using the Coulomb glass model on a regular lattice, as well as on other models including a simplified version and a random-position-with-random-potential model. The results show that the non-ergodicity quotient depends on the duration of measurement, the strength of disorder, and the temperature. The influence of dimensionality on non-ergodic effects is also considered, with the results showing stronger effects in lower dimensions. Finally, the effect of sample preparation on non-ergodic effects is discussed, showing that quenching the sample increases non-ergodic", "Large amounts of gaseous galactic haloes have been observed around starforming galaxies, with the gas reservoir in the haloes surpassing that of the galaxies themselves. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the gas in the haloes has solar metallicity. However, it has been found that the assumption of solar metallicity is unrealistic and that the actual metallicity is likely much lower. The fraction of OVI ions under thermal collisional ionization equilibrium does not exceed a certain limit, resulting in a conservative estimate of the amount of oxygen in the haloes. The ionizing radiation field in the haloes is time-dependent, which can lead to considerable changes in the ionization state of oxygen. It was found that the excess of galactic photons with energies between 113-130 eV contributes to the high fraction of OVI ions in the haloes. The high OVI fraction in the haloes can be explained by a lower metallicity of the gas, and the requirement for high oxygen production and mass ejection rates is reduced. It was also found that the observed high OVI column densities can be explained by the excess of galactic ionizing photons over the extragalactic background, combined with a lower metallicity of the gas. The main source of O", "The giant radio galaxy M87 is located in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. It has a plasma jet at a certain angle to the observer's line of sight. The black hole in the center of M87 has a large mass. M87 is a powerful accelerator of high-energy particles and is a candidate for emitting TeV gamma rays. Observations with the H.E.S.S. telescopes have confirmed the presence of TeV gamma-ray emission from M87, with the flux being below the level of the Crab Nebula. Further observations are needed to study the variability of the emission and understand the mechanisms behind it. Other observations at different wavelengths, such as X-rays, are also important to understand the production mechanism of the TeV gamma rays in M87. The construction and operation of H.E.S.S. was supported by various organizations and institutions.", "The text discusses the emission of gamma-ray binaries in the extra-solar sky and the challenges in detecting them. The two proposed models for gamma-ray emission are relativistic jets generated by accretion onto a neutron star or black hole, and the interaction between a pulsar's wind and its companion's stellar wind. The authors are developing techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and search for periodic modulation in gamma-ray flux, which would indicate a binary system. They are investigating the use of aperture photometry and maximum likelihood fitting for light curve analysis. Tools are being developed to determine the ideal aperture size and energy range for any source. The authors analyze all sources, not just those thought to be gamma-ray binaries, to ensure no misclassified binaries are missed. The study uses discrete Fourier transforms and Lomb-Scargle analyses to search for the periodic modulation expected in gamma-ray binaries. The authors also investigate the gain in signal-to-noise provided by obtaining light curves in different energy bands with different aperture sizes. Weighting factors based on exposure are used for light curves with a small number of photons per time bin. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated through power spectrum analysis of the light curve of 61.", "The recent discovery of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at RHIC has sparked theoretical efforts to understand strongly coupled quantum field theories at finite temperature. The transport properties of such theories are more affected by the strength of the coupling than thermodynamic properties. The near perfect fluidity in such theories is seen as a sign of strong coupling. The transport properties are related to the spectral functions of operators such as the stress-energy tensor. The first-principles calculation of the spectral functions is challenging, especially in the low-frequency regime. Constraints on the spectral functions in the form of sum rules have been the subject of recent attention. The discovery of the AdS/CFT holographic correspondence has opened new possibilities to study thermodynamics and transport in strongly coupled theories. In this paper, the authors focus on the sum rule for the spectral function in the bulk channel and consider a holographic model with the simplest mechanism of conformality violation, similar to QCD. They find that the temperature-dependent part of the bulk spectral function obeys a sum rule that coincides with the sum rule in QCD in the limit of a marginal operator. They also find a delicate cancellation between the high frequency tail and the intermediate region of the spectral function that ensures the sum rule is satisfied. The results are verified numer", "Low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly observed in X-rays emitted from stellar-mass black holes. These LFQPOs have frequencies ranging from MHz to a few hundred Hz. Several models have been proposed to explain the origin of these oscillations, including trapped oscillations in gaseous disks, diskoseismology, resonance caused by agreement of cooling and infall time scales in the post-shock region, and orbital precession. One model, the Shock Oscillation Model (SOM), explains LFQPOs naturally by considering the post-shock region as a centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer. In this model, LFQPOs occur when the cooling time scale due to comptonization in the boundary layer matches the infall time scale in the post-shock flow. The resonance hypothesis has been tested and confirmed in the outbursting source H1743-322, where LFQPOs were observed during the rising and declining phases of the outburst. In these phases, the cooling and infall time scales are comparable and satisfy the resonance condition. The evolution of LFQPOs in outbursting sources is directly related to the daily variations of disk and halo accretion rates. The different types of LFQ", "The text discusses the connection between accretion and the formation of galaxy halos, particularly in the assembly of the most massive halos found in the centers of massive galaxy clusters. It explains that clusters of galaxies are the most recent objects to form and continue to undergo active assembly and halo growth. The text also mentions that a variety of dynamical processes lead to the formation of intracluster stars, including interactions between galaxies, mergers, tidal stripping, and star formation in the intracluster medium. The morphology, color, spatial distribution, and kinematics of the diffuse light in the intracluster region can provide information about the different processes that contribute to its formation. The text uses the example of the Virgo cluster to illustrate the complex web of diffuse light observed in the core of the cluster, including tidal streams, accretion shells, and intragroup light. It emphasizes the need for a consistent and clear definition of the intracluster light, as different metrics can yield varying results. The text also mentions the challenges in studying the intracluster light, such as the observational difficulties in directly imaging intracluster stars and the ambiguity in separating the intracluster light from the extended halo of the most massive galaxy in the cluster. The text concludes by discussing the mixed results in characterizing the intra", "The text discusses the lepton flavor violating (LFV) neutrinoless conversion of a bound 1s-muon to an electron in the field of a nucleus. This process is considered one of the best probes to search for muon and electron flavor non-conservation. The experiments seeking for this conversion event have only been able to put upper bounds on the branching ratio, which is the ratio of the muon-electron conversion rate to the total rate of ordinary muon capture. The best upper limits so far have been extracted from experiments at PSI.\n\nCurrently, there are two conversion experiments ongoing, one at PSI using a titanium target and one planned at Brookhaven using an aluminum target. The expected sensitivity in the PSI experiment is better than the existing limits by about four orders of magnitude, and the Brookhaven experiment is expected to have even better sensitivity. The experiments depend on the nuclear transition matrix elements for the specific targets.\n\nThere are many mechanisms for muon-electron conversion, falling into two categories: photonic and non-photonic. The photonic mechanisms involve exchanging photons between the quark and lepton currents, while the non-photonic ones involve heavy particles in intermediate states. The text describes the calculations of the nuclear matrix elements for both types of mechanisms.\n\n", "In this paper, the authors propose two linearizations for bivariate polynomials. The first linearization uses a tree structure and does not involve any computation. It is suitable for both scalar and matrix bivariate polynomials. The second linearization is more condensed and involves minimal numerical computation. It is applicable only to scalar bivariate polynomials. Both linearizations yield smaller matrices and can be used to solve polynomial systems, but the second linearization is faster and more accurate. The authors compare their method with existing approaches and show that it is competitive for polynomials up to degree 30. They also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.", "The recent progress in laser technology has allowed for the development of femtosecond laser sources with ultrarelativistic intensities. This opens up possibilities for studying ultrafast laser-matter interaction dynamics in the relativistic regime. High-order harmonic generation (HHG) by atoms/ions is of particular interest in this field, as it is one of the most promising mechanisms for creating coherent XUV sources and intense attosecond pulses. In order to overcome the suppression of HHG in the relativistic regime, a standing wave configuration formed by two counterpropagating laser beams of linear polarizations can be used. The relativistic HHG by hydrogenlike ions in this uniform periodic electric field is studied in this paper. The harmonic emission rates with a standing wave field are found to be much larger than with a traveling wave field, and the cutoff position is shifted to lower values in the relativistic regime. The proposed scheme for HHG in plasma, using a traveling laser pulse and copropagating ions, is also discussed. Overall, the study provides insights into the relativistic HHG process and its potential applications in various research fields.", "The plastic deformation of crystalline materials is caused by the motion of dislocations, which are defects in the atomic structure of the material. However, building a continuum description of dislocations is still a challenge in the theory of crystal plasticity. Several models have been proposed to describe dislocation patterns, but the physical origin of the length scales introduced in these models is not fully understood. In this paper, the authors investigate the evolution of dislocation correlation functions and their relation to the screening effect of an external dislocation. They derive evolution equations for the correlation functions and show that they are similar to the evolution equations for the induced dislocation densities around an external dislocation. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the derived equations. The results suggest that the kirkwood superposition approximation can be used to describe the evolution of dislocation correlation functions.", "Recently, ground-based, long baseline interferometry has made it possible to directly measure the distances of nearby cepheids using the geometric Baade-Wesselink method. This method relies on accurate measurements of the cepheid diameter as the star pulsates. The VLTi instrument is well-suited for these measurements due to its long baselines and large apertures. However, accurate limb darkening models are critical for converting the measured visibilities into accurate diameters. A new approach has been developed that uses non-LTE hydrodynamic computations to compute phase-dependent limb intensity profiles for pulsating cepheids. These profiles show that limb darkening changes with pulsational phase and wavelength, and a single parametrization is not adequate for all phases. The corrections introduced by hydrodynamic effects and wavelength dependence of limb darkening are a few percent at optical wavelengths and about 12% in the near-IR, which is within the range of the VLTi's capabilities. The VLTi's sensitivity and angular resolution make it an ideal instrument for applying the Baade-Wesselink method to southern sources and calibrating the zero point of the period-luminosity distance relation. By measuring the angular diameter variations of classical cepheids with the VLTi, a larger", "The article discusses the study of hadronic structure and properties using the quark-diquark model, a QCD inspired model. The model considers the nucleon as a bound state of a single quark and a scalar or vector diquark state. The light-front scalar quark-diquark model is used to investigate the electromagnetic form factors and charge distributions of the nucleons in transverse coordinate space. The study also includes the gravitational form factors related to the energy-momentum tensor and the longitudinal momentum distributions of quarks and diquarks in the transverse coordinate space. The results show that the charge distributions in coordinate space are wider compared to the impact-parameter space, and the distributions for the quarks and diquarks contribute differently to the longitudinal momentum distributions of the proton. The study provides insight into the hadronic structure and properties within the framework of the quark-diquark model and the ADS/QCD correspondence.", "Galactic globular clusters (GCs) are dense and old stellar systems containing a large number of stars. They are important for studying the dynamical evolution of collisional systems and the interplay between dynamics and stellar evolution. GCs with high central densities are ideal for the formation of exotic objects like blue straggler stars, cataclysmic variables, low-mass X-ray binaries, and millisecond pulsars. \n\nThis study focuses on M71, a low-density GC located at a distance of about 4 kiloparsecs (kpc) from Earth. It has a high metallicity and a large population of X-ray sources. The number of X-ray detections in M71 is significantly higher than expected from its current mass and collisional parameter. The authors propose that M71 may have lost a substantial fraction of its initial mass due to interactions with the galactic field and shocks caused by encounters with molecular clouds and/or spiral arms. \n\nThe study used two epochs of observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and wide-field near-infrared and optical datasets to determine the stellar proper motions, absolute proper motion, cluster gravitational center, and structural parameters of M71. The authors found that M71 has a low-latitude disk-like orbit within the galactic disk", "This text discusses the problem of reconstructing a physical field from samples taken at unknown and statistically distributed locations. The field is assumed to be bandlimited and periodic, and only one-dimensional fields are considered. The lack of control in sensor deployment is modeled by a uniform distribution on the sensor locations. The text presents a consistent estimate for the field based on the order of the sample locations. It also provides results on distortion, mean-squared error, and weak convergence of the estimate. The text references prior work in the recovery of bandlimited signals from samples taken at unknown locations and the estimation of periodic bandlimited signals with random sampling locations. The text concludes by summarizing the main results and discussing future research directions.", "The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a high density phase of matter in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined but roam freely. It is believed to have existed for a short time after the Big Bang and can also be created in high-energy particle collisions. In this phase, there is a possibility of a phase transition to a hadron-quark phase at high densities and/or temperatures. Some compact objects, such as neutron stars, could actually be strange stars made entirely of strange matter, which consists of up, down, and strange quarks in equal proportions. There have been various investigations into the properties of quark stars, with the MIT bag model being commonly used. This model assumes that quarks and gluons have small interactions and neglects quark masses. The equation of state (EOS) in this model relates the energy density and pressure of the QGP. More sophisticated models have shown that the EOS can be approximated by a linear function. The maximum gravitational mass and radius of a strange star have been obtained numerically, with the bag constant being a determining factor. Quark stars are expected to form during the core collapse of a massive star after a supernova explosion, or they can form in low-mass X-ray binaries through", "X-ray spectral analysis of telescopes involves using programs like Xspec to determine the relationship between the source flux and the observed count rate. This is done by inputting the effective area of the telescope through the ancillary response file (ARF) and the energy resolution of the detector through the redistribution matrix file (RMF). This work presents a detailed explanation of the ARF and RMF, connecting the incident source flux to the observed count rate. The effective area of an X-ray telescope is the product of the effective area of the mirror and the quantum efficiency of the detector. The ARF depends not only on the telescope's aspect history and point spread function, but also on the details of the analysis such as data filtering and binning. With the Chandra X-ray Observatory, it is important to consider the shape of the PSF and spacecraft motion when computing the ARF. The goal of this work is to provide a derivation of the ARF that includes telescope motion and PSF, as well as any data filtering, in order to perform spectral analysis at the highest resolution. The ARF and RMF have traditionally been used for spectral image data analysis, but this work extends their use to dispersive spectral data analysis. The paper also discusses the definition of an exposure map", "The text discusses observations of the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-121b, a hot gas giant. The observations reveal evidence of water absorption, as well as the presence of titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO), which could indicate a thermal inversion in the atmosphere. The authors also compare their findings to previous observations of other exoplanets and discuss the possibility of stellar activity affecting the measurements. They conclude that further observations are needed to confirm the presence of TiO and VO in the atmosphere of WASP-121b.", "Studies of string theory have traditionally been performed perturbatively. However, many important issues have had to be left unresolved until a non-perturbative understanding of string theory could be achieved. Recent advances have begun to provide this understanding, although we are still far from being able to address real-world problems. Many of the exciting results in strong coupling string theory have been obtained using orientifolds and d-branes. D-branes are a more precise language for constructing perturbative string backgrounds, and their use allows for powerful statements about these backgrounds that hold beyond perturbation theory. There are five basic superstring theories that can be formulated perturbatively in ten dimensions. Each theory describes different types of closed strings and their interactions. In particular, the type I theory describes open strings with gauge symmetry. The type IIB theory has a symmetry between left and right moving structures on the string, while the heterotic string theories have one supersymmetric sector and one non-supersymmetric sector. By gauging the symmetry between left and right moving structures in type IIB theory, a new closed string theory can be constructed, but it turns out to be inconsistent. Similarly, attempts to construct a purely open superstring theory also result in inconsistencies. However, by identifying the closed string sector", "The text discusses the bottom-up thermalization ansatz in the context of heavy ion collisions. It explains that the original bottom-up picture can be modified to include other possibilities for the evolution of the produced matter, resulting in what is called the modified bottom-up parton system. This modification is done by introducing a scaling solution to the pre-equilibrium evolution. The text goes on to describe the glasma dynamical scales and the evolution of the system towards thermalization. It also discusses the quantities describing quark-gluon matter in the modified bottom-up scenario and shows how the thermalization time and temperature can be estimated. The results can be useful for calculating the yield of direct photons and di-electrons, as well as the elliptic flow of direct photons in heavy ion collisions. The text concludes by acknowledging the support and contributions from various individuals and institutions.", "This text describes a study on the magnetism of a new phase of iron-selenide called cscl-type FeSe. The study used density functional theory and calculations to analyze the magnetic properties of cscl-type FeSe. The results showed that cscl-type FeSe exhibits both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism over a range of lattice constants. The study also found that the antiferromagnetic state is most stable and has the largest lattice constant. The authors suggest that cscl-type FeSe could potentially be grown as a thin film or achieved at high pressure. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties and stability of cscl-type FeSe.", "The text discusses the use of advanced field-theoretical methods in condensed matter physics to study interacting many-particle systems at low temperatures. There are several reasons for this trend, including the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena, the use of renormalization group methods, the ability to capture the dynamics of many-particle systems, and the treatment of disorder and imperfections. The text also discusses the application of quantum field theory to trapped atomic gases, particularly Bose-Einstein condensation. The theoretical challenge in studying these systems lies in accurately solving the highly inhomogeneous many-body problem from first principles, and quantum field theory provides a convenient way to meet this challenge. The text summarizes the development of quantum field theory for trapped atomic gases, including the use of functional methods and the second quantization formalism. The text concludes by discussing the ideal quantum gases and the calculation of their partition functions using feynman path integral formulation. The text also introduces the Landau theory of phase transitions, discussing first and second order phase transitions and the role of fluctuations and inhomogeneity.", "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are organic-inorganic hybrid solids that have gained significant interest over the past decade due to their unique structures and properties. These materials consist of a three-dimensional framework formed by the connection of organic molecules and inorganic subnetworks. MOFs have a wide range of applications, particularly in gas storage and separation, catalysis, luminescence, and magnetorefrigeration. Magnetic MOFs, in particular, have attracted attention for their potential in low-dimensional and frustrated magnetism. The porous nature of MOFs allows for the storage and separation of gases. Neutron scattering techniques are commonly used to study the magnetic properties of inorganic compounds, but have been relatively underutilized for hybrid frameworks due to technical challenges and weak magnetic contributions. However, recent studies have demonstrated the ability to overcome these challenges and have provided new insights into the magnetic structures and properties of magnetic MOFs. In this study, the authors present a detailed investigation of the magnetism in a cobalt-based hydroxy-sebacate framework. They determine the magnetic structure using neutron powder diffraction and explore the magnetic properties using magnetic susceptibility and relaxation measurements. The results reveal a complex magnetic structure consisting of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic components and slow dynamics of the magnetization", "The statistical mechanics of two polymers with constraints on their winding angle has been extensively studied in order to understand the behavior of physical polymer systems, such as biological macromolecules or liquid crystals. While previous studies focused on ideal polymer chains or loops winding around each other, this study considers the case of two directed polymers interacting via a repulsive Dirac function potential. The researchers are particularly interested in the average degree of entanglement of the system, which they estimate by computing the square average winding angle of the two polymers. They develop an approach that combines quantum mechanical and field theoretical techniques to obtain exact results for the second moment of the winding angle. The partition function of the system is found to be too complicated to obtain analytical results, so the researchers approximate the potential with a radial potential and use field theories to compute correlation functions. The results of the study provide insights into how repulsive interactions affect the entanglement of two polymers.", "Granular materials are essential in various human activities and ecological concerns, but understanding their behavior is still a challenge. This study focuses on the compaction of granular materials under vertical taps using a simple model of hard spheres. The model qualitatively reproduces experimental results and provides realistic information on the local structure of the packing. The compaction dynamics exhibit a logarithmic behavior and show hysteresis effects. The model also reveals aging effects similar to those observed in glassy systems. The analysis of density profiles and pore size distributions confirms the existence of anisotropy and the role of collective rearrangements in the compaction process. The study concludes that compaction is mainly due to the rearrangements of the largest pores. Experimental confirmation and further investigations are needed to validate these findings.", "Cosmic strings formed during a cosmological phase transition at an energy scale of about 1 GeV can seed structure formation. However, the gravitational effects of strings are uncertain due to the evolving network statistics. Lattice simulations have shown that the formation of strings results in a distribution of closed loops and infinite strings across the universe. The evolution of the strings involves the growth of the step length as they attempt to straighten out and energy loss through loop production during reconnection. Previous work identified the key property of scaling, where the network can be characterized by a length scale that grows with the horizon. However, further investigation revealed dynamical processes at smaller scales. A model known as the three-scale model was developed to describe the network in terms of energy density, correlation length, and local structure on the string. This model predicts the scaling of certain correlation functions and has been tested numerically. The results show that the large length scales associated with these correlations are smaller than the causal horizon, indicating that the effects of the expanding background are small. The model is important for building a representation of the evolving network and has implications for predicting small-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background. Loop production and small-scale structure along the string are also studied. It is found that small-scale structure", "Hopf algebras are a generalization of groups. In this article, the author explores more general structures related to Hopf algebras, such as weak Hopf algebras and hopf categories. The author defines hopf algebroids and hopf categories and discusses their properties. The main results of the paper are two theorems which establish a correspondence between finitely-generated projective hopf algebroids and topological coupled hopf categories of finite type. The author also discusses examples of hopf algebroids, such as groupoid algebras and weak hopf algebras. The article concludes with a discussion of galois theory for hopf categories. The results of the paper contribute to the understanding of the geometry and representation theory of hopf algebroids.", "Experimental advances in generating strongly interacting photons have opened up new opportunities for exploring many-body quantum phenomena. Photonic systems are unique because they naturally act as open quantum systems, allowing for the controlled addition and removal of photons. This makes them ideal for studying questions about open system dynamics, dissipative phase transitions, and the effects of interactions in a dissipative environment. Currently, the most widely studied model for strongly interacting photons on a lattice is the Bose-Hubbard model, which describes the interactions and hopping of photons in an array of coupled cavities. However, when drive and dissipation are added to the Bose-Hubbard model, it does not exhibit superfluid or Mott insulator phases. Instead, it gives rise to mixed state nonequilibrium steady states and phases, the nature and generation of which are not fully understood. \n\nIn this article, the authors explore the physics of two coupled nonlinear cavities in a dissipative setting where both sites are driven coherently and symmetrically. They perform semiclassical and quantum analysis of the system, investigating the complex interplay between hopping, interaction, drive, dissipation, and detuning. In the semiclassical treatment, they find that the nonequilibrium steady states exhibit asymmetric number density in the two cavities, in addition to the", "Single-transverse spin asymmetries (SSAs) in high-energy collisions with one transversely polarized hadron have been observed for more than three decades in various physical processes. Recent experimental measurements of SSA in polarized semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon deep inelastic scattering and in hadronic collisions have renewed the theoretical interest in SSAs and in understanding their roles in hadron structure and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Within a model calculation, the authors showed that the final state interaction in deep inelastic scattering can generate a phase required for a non-zero SSA in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. They also found that summing all initial/final state interactions into the gauge link of the gauge invariant transverse momentum dependent quark distributions leads to a very complicated functional form of the gauge link.", "The paper introduces a family of penalty functions for generalized linear models called the Lamp family. These penalty functions aim to achieve a balance between sparsity and stability in model selection. The paper demonstrates that the resulting penalized estimation achieves model selection consistency and strong asymptotic stability. The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the Lamp family and suggests methods for choosing tuning parameters. Simulation results and real data examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the Lamp family compared to other penalty functions such as lasso, scad, and mcp. The paper concludes by discussing possible extensions of the Lamp family to handle other regression models and offering directions for future research.", "The discovery of a Higgs boson that is similar to the one predicted by the Standard Model (SM) suggests that the SM is a complete theory. However, there are several pieces of evidence that indicate that the SM is an effective theory valid only up to a certain energy scale. Two of the most important pieces of evidence are the fine-tuning problem of the Higgs mass and the existence of non-baryonic dark matter (DM). The fine-tuning problem can be expressed in the form of an equation that requires a cancellation between different terms to achieve the observed Higgs mass. To relax this fine-tuning problem, new fields are required. In this work, the authors propose a model that includes a scalar singlet and a vector fermion as dark matter candidates. The singlet scalar serves as the DM candidate and the vector fermion interacts with the SM only through the Higgs boson. The authors find that the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass imposes a strict constraint on the Higgs-portal coupling and the number of scalar singlets, which is determined by direct detection experiments. The authors also calculate the relic abundances of the DM candidates and find that the model is consistent with the observed DM relic density and direct detection constraints. Finally, the authors", "The presence of magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors modifies their properties. Electron scattering off magnetic impurities reduces the superconducting gap below its BCS value and can even result in gapless superconductivity. The effect of impurities on the superconducting gap has been studied through tunneling experiments between normal and superconducting electrodes and through thermal transport in superconducting films. Magnetic impurities can create a localized state within the BCS gap and at higher concentrations, the impurity states merge with the continuum, forming an impurity band. The effect of magnetic impurities on the surface impedance of superconducting multilayers and unconventional superconductors has also been investigated. Theoretical approaches have been developed to study the surface impedance and the effect of magnetic impurities on the electron spectrum. This paper studies the influence of magnetic impurities on the complex conductivity and surface impedance of a superconductor, focusing on the limit of low frequency and low temperature. The paper presents quantitative results for the experimentally relevant dirty limit and provides a theoretical framework to understand the effect of magnetic impurities on the surface impedance in different regimes.", "The text discusses a proposal for the teleportation of quantum states using electrons in a device consisting of semiconductor quantum wires. The process involves the entanglement of qubits and the use of quantum gates to teleport the state of one electron to another location. Numerical simulations show that the teleportation process can achieve a high fidelity, indicating a high level of reliability. The proposal suggests that the device could be implemented using current semiconductor technology, representing a significant advancement in the field of quantum computing.", "The text discusses anomalous diffusion, which is observed in various systems including plasma flow, surface growth, and financial markets. The author introduces the concept of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and its connection to Tsallis entropy. The author focuses on the dynamics of financial markets and describes the power-law tails and anomalous diffusion observed in these markets. The author proposes that the dynamics of financial markets can be described by the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, which is solved by a time-dependent probability distribution that maximizes Tsallis entropy. The author applies this approach to high-frequency intra-day price changes of the S&P500 index and finds that it accurately describes the data. The author concludes that the Tsallis distribution and the Fokker-Planck equation provide a natural framework for understanding the dynamics of financial markets.", "The text discusses the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect and the lack of its observation in landau levels with a higher landau index. It mentions the proposed realization of stripe and bubble phases based on the Hartree-Fock theory. The evidence of the stripe phase has been observed in experiments on ultra high mobility samples, while the evidence of the bubble phase has not been obtained directly. The text also discusses the limitations of exact diagonalization studies in determining the phase diagram of the system. The ground state of the system is investigated using the DMRG method, and the phase diagram for the third and fourth lowest landau levels is determined. The text also discusses the Hamiltonian for electrons in the landau levels and mentions the factors that affect the form of the Coulomb potential. The screening effect and its impact on the phase diagram are considered. The reentrant IQH state is identified as the two-electron bubble phase pinned by impurities. The text mentions the possibility of a reentrant stripe phase in the fourth landau level. The work is supported by grants from MEXT, Japan. References to relevant literature are also provided.", "In this study, the authors investigate the presence and properties of buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in infrared galaxies. They use the 2.55-5.05 micron spectra obtained from the AKARI  mission to analyze the emission and absorption features in 22 infrared galaxies. Based on the strength of the 3.3 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and the temperature of the hot-dust continuum component, they identify 14 out of the 22 galaxies as hosting buried AGNs. They find that the fraction of buried AGNs increases with infrared luminosity, with ulra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) having the highest fraction. They also find that the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared luminosity is relatively small, suggesting that the main source of the infrared emission in these galaxies is star formation. The authors conclude that infrared galaxies with buried AGNs are in an early phase of AGN evolution and may evolve into normal (unburied) AGNs.", "The article discusses the use of the @xmath0 meson in studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena. The authors introduce the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) which separates short-distance coefficients that can be calculated perturbatively from long-distance matrix elements (mes) that must be extracted from experiments. The authors explain how velocity scaling rules can estimate the relative importance of the mes and organize theoretical predictions into double expansions. The article highlights the prediction of color-octet processes and the success of the NRQCD formalism in correctly describing inclusive charmonium hadroproduction cross-sections measured at the Fermilab Tevatron. The authors discuss the evidence from inclusive @xmath0 production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and how it confirms NRQCD and disproves the traditional color-singlet model (CSM). However, there are anomalies in the rise of cross-sections that may be resolved with higher-order corrections and nonperturbative effects. The authors also mention the Chorus experiment which shows a significant discrepancy with the predictions for @xmath23. The article concludes by discussing the challenges and potential of studying inclusive @xmath", "The left-right symmetric model with a gauge group based on XCITE is an extension of the standard model. It requires introducing right-handed partners for the observed gauge bosons and neutrinos, as well as a higgs sector containing one bi-doublet, one left-handed triplet, and one right-handed triplet. In this model, parity is an exact symmetry at high energy scales but is spontaneously broken at low energy scales. However, there are nontrivial constraints from the vacuum minimization conditions, which make it difficult to realize spontaneous CP violation. Generalized CP violation scenarios have been extensively analyzed to overcome these difficulties. The LR symmetric model is also motivated to explain the small mass of neutrinos, and the well-known seesaw mechanism can provide a natural explanation. However, the right-handed gauge bosons are too heavy to be detected at current and future colliders. To resolve this, the focus is on the 10 TeV case. The LR symmetric model also suffers from the vev-seesaw puzzle, which arises due to the large VEV of the neutral component of the right-handed higgs triplet. By introducing a discrete symmetry, it is possible to resolve this puzzle, but it leads to the absence of majorana yukawa couplings, making neutrinos dirac", "The Ehrenfest time is a time scale that determines when the quantum time evolution is well approximated by classical dynamics. It is the time it takes for the chaotic classical dynamics to stretch an initially narrow wave packet to some relevant classical length scale. There has been much interest in determining the influence of the Ehrenfest time on various quantum observables such as conductance, conductance variance, shot noise, and higher moments of current. Most of the research on this topic has used the trajectory-based semiclassical approach to transport, which has been the method of choice for investigating the Ehrenfest-time dependences of quantum observables. The leading order quantum correction to conductance was found to decay exponentially with the Ehrenfest time, but this intuitive interpretation does not always hold. The conductance variance of systems ideally coupled to external leads is independent of the Ehrenfest time. In this paper, the authors determine semiclassically the Ehrenfest-time dependence of the variance of the conductance for a chaotic system coupled to external leads via nonideal contacts modeled by tunnel barriers of transparency. They show that the conductance variance increases or decreases with Ehrenfest time, depending on the value of system parameters. They also find that in some cases, the conductance variance can exceed the universal value", "This paper discusses the evaluation of the nuclear matter binding energy and saturation properties starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The understanding of the binding energy of nuclei is important in nuclear physics and has implications for astrophysics. Various approximation schemes, including the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone theory, have been developed to describe the correlation effects in nuclear matter. The self-energy of a nucleon, which contains information about occupation probabilities and spectral functions, is investigated. Different choices for the single-particle potential are considered, and the effects of hole-hole terms in the self-energy are studied. The self-consistent green's function formalism is used to calculate the hole and particle spectral functions, which provide information about single-particle strength in nucleon knock-out experiments. The results show that the inclusion of hole-hole terms in the self-energy leads to an enhancement of correlation effects and a prediction of larger binding energies for nuclear matter. The occupation probabilities obtained from the self-consistent calculations are in good agreement with experimental data. Overall, this study provides new insights into the saturation problem of nuclear matter and the reliability of the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone theory.", "Galaxy characteristics, such as morphology and star formation rate, are observed to change with environment. High density regions like clusters have a larger fraction of elliptical galaxies and a lower star formation rate compared to the field. These observations are known as the morphology-density and SFR-density relations. The morphology-density relation shows distinct behavior over three separate regimes, characterized by the projected galaxy density or the radial distance from the cluster center. At the lowest density regions farthest from cluster centers, the relation is flat. At a characteristic radius, the fraction of intermediate type galaxies increases while the late-type disk galaxy fraction decreases and the SFR decreases sharply. These trends continue until a higher projected density, where the fraction of intermediate types decreases and the elliptical fraction dramatically increases. The behavior of these relations indicates a change in the dominant physical mechanisms influencing the evolution of galaxies across these environments. The NGC 4065 group, located in the Coma supercluster, serves as a laboratory for studying ram pressure stripping as it has two independent means of measuring the density of the intergalactic gas in this system. The NGC 4065 group has been detected to have a hot intergalactic medium and a bent radio jet, indicating resistance from the intergalactic gas. The spiral galaxy UGC", "The paper discusses the use of time-gating technique in imaging turbid or diffusive media using optical radiation. The technique involves injecting a narrow pulse into the medium and using the first arriving photons to reconstruct an image of the medium, eliminating the multi-scattering effect. The authors explore the possibility of applying this technique to electron imaging to detect absorptive objects inside scattering media. However, they find that the parabolic dispersion relation of electrons causes strong dispersion, making it difficult to eliminate the multi-scattering effect. They demonstrate analytically and through numerical simulations that even in the presence of a delta function potential barrier, the barrier's presence is felt only at the third order of dispersion. However, the short-time measurement can reveal information about the nature of the barrier, whether it is imaginary or real. The authors also show that similar conclusions can be drawn when considering a continuous wavefunction, such as a Gaussian. They suggest using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to emphasize the impact of the potential barrier and demonstrate the difference between real and imaginary barriers. Overall, the paper concludes that it is possible to distinguish between an imaginary and a real potential barrier by measuring its effect at short times only on the transmitting wavefunction.", "The paper discusses a method for determining the helium abundance in stars using their oscillation frequencies. The authors apply this method to determine the helium abundance in a binary star system using 2.5 years of observations from the Kepler satellite. They find that the helium abundance for one of the stars is between 0.231 and 0.251, and for the other star it is between 0.218 and 0.266. The results from different techniques and models are consistent with each other, but there is a small difference in the helium abundance between the two stars. The authors also find that the method is not sensitive to the surface effect and that the precision of the determination of the helium abundance depends on the low order modes.", "Submillimeter-wavelength surveys are able to detect high-redshift dusty galaxies, and the use of gravitational lensing by foreground clusters enhances the efficiency of these surveys. Follow-up observations are also easier in lensed fields due to magnification. This study analyzes the detections of four high-redshift dusty galaxies in the 450\u03bcm SCUBA lens survey data, providing the first galaxy count at a wavelength of 450\u03bcm. The study also updates the 850\u03bcm galaxy counts using the same method as before but including two additional lensed high-redshift background sources. The results show that the relative counts of galaxies at 450\u03bcm and 850\u03bcm are consistent with the spectral energy distributions and forms of evolution of distant dusty galaxies. The study also presents the first count of galaxies at 450\u03bcm and updates the deep 850\u03bcm counts with improved optical identifications.", "In this paper, the authors address the optimization of the input covariance of bi-correlated Rician MIMO channels. They propose to approximate the average mutual information by its large system limit and derive an iterative optimization algorithm. The algorithm, when convergent, converges to the maximum of the approximate mutual information. Simulation results show that the new approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the mutual information but is more computationally efficient.", "The text describes the design and operation of a CCD camera system called ARGOS that is optimized for high-speed time-series measurements of oscillating white dwarf stars. The camera system is compared to photomultiplier (PMT) detectors that were previously used for these measurements. The goals of the ARGOS instrument were to take advantage of the improved quantum efficiency of CCD detectors, discover more variable white dwarf stars, and provide precise timing accuracy for the search of small deviations from the smooth secular change in pulsation frequency. The ARGOS camera is based on a commercial CCD camera and has specifications such as a back-illuminated pixel array, frame transfer operation, thermoelectric cooling, and low readout noise. The camera is mounted at the prime focus of the telescope and has a field of view of 2.8 arcmin on a side. The camera control system includes a timing system based on a GPS clock and a software program called Quilt 11 (Q11) that controls the camera operation. The data acquisition and on-line extraction process use flood level isolation and cut-level extraction techniques to identify and measure the brightness of target and comparison stars. The ARGOS instrument has been successful in identifying new variable white dwarf stars, improving data quality, and achieving precise timing accuracy.", "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is planning to increase its design luminosity by a factor of ten, which means that the trackers used in the experiments will need to have sensors with improved radiation hardness. Pixel systems, which are located close to the beam pipe, can use expensive semiconductor materials like diamond and have the possibility of periodic replacement. Strip tracker regions have lower maximum fluences, but larger sensor areas and no option for easy replacement. The group studying these upgrades has been using Magnetic Czochralski (MCz) silicon as a potential replacement for the current silicon sensors. The MCz process allows for better control of contaminants, such as oxygen, which actually improves radiation hardness. The group has tested several MCz detectors and compared their charge collection efficiency to that of the current sensors. They have also explored the use of current injected detectors as a means of extending the lifetime of the sensors. The results so far show that both n-type and p-type MCz sensors have the potential to survive the planned fluence levels in the strip trackers. The CMS collaboration is planning to test many of these sensors in a beam study in the fall of 2010.", "The text discusses the importance of controlling the rate of mixing in fluid flows, especially in industrial applications. The author explains that the mixing of species and thermodynamic quantities is influenced by fluid flows and the complexity of the fluid flow makes it difficult to understand how the fluid is coupled to the transported quantities. The author then focuses on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability as an example and investigates how the addition of polymers affects the stability and growth rate of the perturbations. The author presents analytical results and compares them with numerical simulations, finding that the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the numerical results. The author also suggests that the presence of polymers may lead to a drag reduction effect in the turbulent regime.", "Cable theory is a significant contribution to theoretical neuroscience, but it makes assumptions about the resistivity of the extracellular space around neurons. However, measurements have shown that the extracellular resistivity has a frequency dependence, indicating that the medium is non-resistive. This could be explained by the influence of ionic diffusion. The present study generalizes cable equations for media with complex frequency-dependent impedance and evaluates the impact on the variation of the membrane potential along the cable. Different types of models are considered, including resistive media, ionic diffusion, capacitive media, etc. The study shows that the nature of the extracellular medium has a significant influence on attenuation with distance and the spectral profile of the membrane potential. The findings suggest that generalized cable equations can accurately model neurons in complex extracellular and heterogeneous media.", "The moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 3 has been studied extensively, particularly the hyperelliptic sublocus. Classical algebraic geometers knew that isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves correspond to orbits of the action of a certain group on binary forms. The case of curves with an elliptic involution has been studied in depth, leading to the discovery of a group action and its invariants. This has spurred interest in finding the automorphism groups of curves of higher genus and generalizing the invariants for higher genus as well. In this paper, the authors focus on hyperelliptic curves with extra automorphisms. They provide a birational parametrization of the space of curves with elliptic involutions and determine the equations for the strata of curves with larger automorphism groups. They also investigate the field of moduli for these curves and show that it is a field of definition for most cases. They provide explicit equations for each sublocus of curves with extra involutions in terms of certain invariants.", "Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are a group of stars that are bluer and brighter than the cluster turn-off stars. They have been observed in various stellar systems, including globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. Their position in the color-magnitude diagram suggests that they do not fit the traditional scheme of stellar evolution for single stars. There are two favored physical mechanisms for the formation of BSSs: coalescence through stellar collisions and evolution of primordial binary systems. Observations of BSSs in dwarf galaxies are not as well understood as those in galactic clusters. However, recent studies of BSSs in nearby dwarf galaxies have suggested that they are mainly formed via mass exchange in primordial binaries. The presence of a significant population of BSSs in a dwarf galaxy has implications for understanding its star formation history. The presence of BSSs can be used to establish the age of the last star formation event in a galaxy. There is an anti-correlation between the frequency of BSSs and the absolute visual magnitude of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The anti-correlation is valid over a large range of luminosities and presents a different slope than that observed in globular clusters. The presence of a sizable sample of BSSs in a", "The article discusses the construction of atomic decompositions of function spaces using irregular grids and arbitrary dilations or transformations. The authors present a method for constructing frame decompositions in several variables, including wavelet frames and non-harmonic Gabor frames. They also show how to obtain perturbations of regular lattice transforms, and provide reconstruction formulas for the atomic decompositions. The article emphasizes the use of frames generated by families of functions translated on regular grids and dilated by powers of a dilation matrix. The authors demonstrate the generality and applicability of their approach through various examples and constructions.", "Question answering (QA) systems aim to understand and respond to natural language questions. While QA systems work well for certain types of questions, they may not perform as well for real-world questions that require more comprehensive answers. FAQ-based QA provides an economical solution by searching FAQ archives for similar questions and returning corresponding answers. Semantic similarities between questions are calculated to overcome the lexical gap problem. This paper proposes a word-alignment-based method for FAQ-based QA. The method includes a neural network model for calculating question similarity, a bootstrap-based feature extraction method, and a learning-to-rank algorithm for training. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for FAQ-based QA and outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems. The method is also evaluated on the answer sentence selection task and achieves significant improvements.", "The text discusses the spectra of quasars and Seyfert galaxies, which show strong emission lines superimposed onto a bright continuum. The continuum contains a feature known as \"the big blue bump\" in the optical-ultraviolet region. The spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum is not well known due to the opacity of the Galaxy. However, it has been possible to infer the sed of quasars down to 1350 Angstroms, and composite energy distributions have been derived. The composite quasar sed shows a significant steepening around 1100 Angstroms, leading to a far-UV power law. There are difficulties in reproducing the equivalent widths of high ionization lines assuming a soft power law. It is suggested that the far-UV break may result from absorption and two possibilities are explored: absorption by HI or by interstellar dust. Various locations for the absorbing medium are considered, and it is found that some cases have the potential to resolve the problem of the ionizing sed being too soft. The possibility of intergalactic dust consisting of nanodiamond grains is also explored, and although successful in reproducing the far-UV break, it requires too much intergalactic dust. The hypothesis of an intrinsic crystalline carbon dust screen", "The problem of distinguishing truly quantum properties from those that can be realized classically has been of interest since the birth of quantum mechanics. Two key notions in this field are nonlocality and non-classical correlations. Nonlocality is characterized by the violation of Bell-type inequalities, while entanglement is described in terms of non-separability. However, there are states that exhibit quantum correlations and are entangled, but can still be described by a local hidden variable (LHV) description. This paper introduces the notion of classical simulation to revisit and reformulate the problem of characterizing the quantumness of a system. A precise definition of classical simulation is given, and it is shown that violation of Bell inequality is not sufficient for a state to be exceptional. Three representative classes of entangled states are examined, and it is found that all Werner states, except the Bell state, are simulable. Additionally, partially entangled pure states and rank two mixed states are shown to be exceptional. The results highlight the role of coherence in determining whether a state can be simulated classically. This study provides a new way of characterizing quantumness and suggests that the notion of quantumness is context-dependent.", "Neutron scattering experiments were conducted on insulating Ca2SrRuO6 (CRO) crystals with different Ti substitutions to study the magnon dispersion and magnetic structure. The results show that CRO has a large magnetic anisotropy, leading to a splitting of the transverse magnon modes at the antiferromagnetic zone center. The dispersion of the magnons can be well described by a conventional spin-wave model with strong single-ion anisotropy parameters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed, revealing a small moment on the apical oxygen sites that couples ferromagnetically to the neighboring Ru moments. This small moment explains an additional low-energy magnetic signal observed in the neutron scattering experiments. Overall, the study provides new insights into the magnetic properties of CRO and highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling and oxygen moments in determining its magnetic behavior.", "The text discusses the thermal transport in nanojunctions using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. It explains the derivation of the NEGF equations of motion and the Feynman diagrammatic expansion. The text also discusses the application of the NEGF method to various systems, such as the FPU model, benzene rings, and carbon nanotubes. It discusses the limitations of the mean field approximation and the challenges of convergence in solving the NEGF equations. The text concludes by suggesting future directions for the application of the NEGF method, such as combining it with electronic transport and electron-phonon interactions.", "In this study, the researchers performed a 2D full particle simulation of a high Mach number and low-beta perpendicular collisionless shock in order to investigate the electron surfing acceleration mechanism. They found that the electron surfing acceleration was suppressed in the 2D system compared to previous 1D simulations. They attributed this to the absence of a strong guiding magnetic field in the 2D model, which prevented the formation of coherent electrostatic solitary structures. Instead, they observed strong heating of electrons along the ambient magnetic field due to electromagnetic whistler mode waves. These findings suggest that electron surfing acceleration may not be as effective in purely perpendicular shocks without a guiding magnetic field. The researchers also noted that their 2D simulation results were consistent with a simplified 2D simulation that had a different shock geometry. Further research is needed to explore other potential injection mechanisms for electron acceleration in these types of shocks.", "The text discusses the relationship between the metallicity of stars and the probability of them hosting planets. It mentions that the metallicity distribution of stars with planets is higher than that of field dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. It also suggests that the orbital periods of extrasolar planets may correlate with the metallicity of their parent stars. The text describes a project using the HIRES spectrograph to search for planetary companions orbiting metal-poor dwarfs. The analysis pipeline used has significantly improved the precision of radial velocity measurements. The text also discusses the sensitivity of the survey to detect planetary companions and mentions that none have been detected so far. It concludes by discussing the potential implications of the absence of close-in planets around metal-poor stars.", "The text discusses the different types of objects that can be expected at the flux levels accessible with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) radio telescope. The main classes of sources include steep active galactic nuclei (AGNs), flat AGNs, and star-forming galaxies. The models used in the study provide a good fit to the observed number counts and can reproduce the total number of sources in comparison samples within a factor of 2. The composition of the radio sky changes with flux, with radio galaxies and QSOs dominating at millijansky (mJy) levels and reappearing in large proportions at nanojansky (nJy) levels. Starburst galaxies and non-evolving spirals also contribute significantly at nJy levels. The study highlights the importance of deeper data to better constrain the models and provide more reliable simulations, which can be valuable for the design of the SKA.", "The paper discusses the effect of domain boundaries on the electron transport in graphene multilayers. It examines the transmission probability through domain boundaries as a function of the Fermi energy using the tight-binding model and transfer matrix method. The results show that the boundaries generally suppress electron transmission, but the reduction becomes weaker as the number of layers increases. There is also an odd-even effect at high electron density, where even-layer boundaries have better electron transmission than odd-layer boundaries. The paper also demonstrates that the electron transmission in bilayer graphene can be enhanced by applying a perpendicular electric field. Overall, the study provides a model for understanding electron transmission properties in multilayer graphenes and suggests that domain boundaries can be used to control electron current in graphene multilayers.", "Scale symmetry is an interesting topic in quantum field theory and particle physics. In string theory, scale symmetry is known as scale invariance or conformal invariance. However, implementing scale symmetry in particle physics has been challenging due to quantum radiative corrections and nonperturbative dynamics. The dilaton, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson related to dilatation symmetry, has been considered as an alternative to the Higgs boson. The dilaton interacts with the Standard Model (SM) fields through the quantum scale anomaly, which is a distinct property of the dilaton. The recent discovery of a new boson with a mass of around 126 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider has renewed interest in dilaton physics. The dilaton mixes with the SM Higgs boson and can affect the signal strengths of the Higgs boson in different decay channels. The mixing also has an impact on the triple and quartic couplings of the SM Higgs boson. Phenomenological analysis of the Higgs-dilaton system using the dilaton couplings that respect the full SM gauge symmetry is performed and compared with the LHC data. The results show that the observed 126 GeV boson is mostly SM-like, and there is", "Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging field that aims to incorporate quantum effects into the principles of thermodynamics. One application of quantum thermodynamics is studying the behavior of lasers as heat engines. In this paper, the authors propose a method to decompose the energy transfer in a laser system into work and heat. They formulate this method by investigating the time evolution of a system that receives the radiation from the laser. They show that the coherent radiation corresponds to work, while the incoherent radiation corresponds to heat. The authors also derive explicit equations for the work and heat flows based on the radiation energy and the photoluminescence spectrum. Overall, this method provides a reliable foundation for understanding the role of quantum coherence in the performance of heat engines.", "Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are a type of binary star system where a white dwarf primary star accretes matter from a secondary star. This matter is transferred through an accretion disk onto the white dwarf. CVs are believed to start out as wide binaries, with the white dwarf progenitor evolving off the main sequence. During this process, much of the angular momentum of the binary is shed, resulting in a shorter orbital period and the ejection of the red giant envelope. After emerging from this phase, a period of angular momentum loss occurs via magnetic braking, leading to the formation of a semi-detached binary and the mass transfer phase that gives rise to a CV. The composition of the secondary stars in CVs is expected to be relatively normal, unless they have accreted matter with an unusual composition during the common envelope phase or during classical nova eruptions. In a spectroscopic survey of CVs, it was found that the carbon monoxide (CO) features of the secondary stars in a number of CVs were weaker than expected for their spectral types. This suggested a deficit of carbon. In this study, the authors obtained moderate and lower-resolution spectroscopy of three of the brightest CVs (SS Cyg, RU Peg, and GK", "The text discusses the possibility of extra dimensions in the context of quantum gravity. It explains that if there are extra dimensions, they must be hidden or very small. The traditional approach is to make the extra dimensions small, close to the Planck scale. However, there has been a resurgence of interest in another approach where some of the extra dimensions are of larger size. In this scenario, the standard model fields are confined to a three-dimensional wall or \"brane\", while gravity can propagate in the other dimensions or \"bulk\". The text discusses the observational constraints on these ideas from both particle physics and gravity measurements. It mentions that the success of the standard model limits the unification energy scale to energies well above 1 TeV. Laboratory measurements of gravity limit the size of the extra dimensions to be smaller than about 0.3 mm. The text also discusses how the properties of gravitational waves can provide information about the physics and cosmological history of the brane. It concludes by discussing possible methods to detect a gravitational wave background from these extra dimensions and the implications of a non-detection. Overall, the text provides an overview of the theoretical and observational aspects of the existence of extra dimensions in quantum gravity.", "The text discusses the problem of optical field propagation in realistic environments, specifically in the context of quantum optics and quantum statistical mechanics. The decay of the radiation field inside a cavity due to interaction with a reservoir is an important aspect of this problem. The Liouville equation is used to describe the dynamics of the optical field, but obtaining analytical solutions is challenging. Quasiprobability representations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Liouville operator, group theoretical approaches, and the thermo-entangled state representation are some methods used to tackle this problem. The text then introduces a theoretical model in which the optical field propagation in a realistic environment is represented by a fictitious beam splitter model. The correspondence between this model and the optical-channel formalism is established. Formulae for the density operator, photon number distribution, and Wigner function are derived for the output optical fields in both the beam splitter and optical-channel formalisms. The time evolution of these properties is discussed, and a specific example of single-photon-added coherent state propagation in a thermal channel is analyzed. The results show the significance of the initial state and the evolution time in determining the statistical properties of the optical fields. The study was supported by research foundations in Jiangxi Province, China.", "The lognormal distribution is observed in various natural and social phenomena, including fluid turbulence. In fluid turbulence, the lognormal distribution is a consequence of the theory for modeling fluctuations of the energy cascade rate across scales. The lognormal distribution is also observed in laboratory experiments of turbulent boundary layers and recently in the coarse-grained squared velocity and squared velocity increments in turbulence. This paper investigates the lognormal behavior of the ornstein-uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is a simple way to generate correlated random variables. The numerical results show that the OU process exhibits the large-scale lognormality for a similar range of averaging scale as observed in turbulence. Analytical calculations of the moments of the OU process further reveal that the moments behave nearly as those of the lognormal distribution, although there is a small deviation. This study suggests that the large-scale lognormality is a general property of correlated random variables, not restricted to turbulence.", "Advanced gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, are being constructed with the goal of increasing sensitivity by tenfold compared to the first generation detectors. This increase in sensitivity is expected to allow for the first conclusive detection of gravitational waves. However, these advanced detectors will be limited in sensitivity by various noise sources, including seismic noise, radiation pressure noise, suspension thermal noise, shot noise, and thermal noise of the test masses themselves. One of the dominant sources of thermal noise is the brownian motion of the atoms that make up the reflective coatings on the test masses. This thermal noise has not been a limiting noise source in the past, but as progress in the field reduces other noise sources, its mitigation becomes a higher priority. One way to reduce the effects of this thermal noise is to use larger beam spots on the test mass surfaces, as larger beams average more effectively over the random motions of the surface. This can be done using \"flat\" beams with a more homogeneous radial intensity distribution. One type of flat beam that has been considered is the higher-order LG mode, which has the advantage of being theoretically compatible with the spherical mirror surfaces that are currently used. The birmingham group has been conducting research to evaluate the feasibility of LG mode technology for reducing the test", "Recent advancements in observations and modeling have revealed that sunspots are dynamic and complex magnetic structures. A closer look at the dark sunspot umbra using photospheric spectral lines has uncovered the structure of bright and nearly circular small intensity patches called umbral dots. These umbral dots show weaker magnetic fields and plasma up-flows. 3D simulations have shown that umbral dots result from magneto-convection in the sunspot umbra. Chromospheric observations have shown that the sunspot umbra may be finely structured and consist of hot and cool plasma elements. Bright umbral flashes, called umbral spikes, have been observed and are believed to be caused by sunspot oscillations. The umbral spikes appear to be co-located with strong magnetic flux concentrations. The existence of umbral microjets has also been reported, but no direct correlation with umbral spikes has been found. High-resolution observations using H\u03b1 imaging spectroscopy have revealed the existence of umbral spikes inside sunspot umbrae. The spikes are aligned with the umbral magnetic fields and are mainly vertical with a slight tendency to fan out closer to the periphery of the umbra. The spikes are correlated in time with the onset of penumbral waves. Umbral spikes are believed to be wave phenomena", "The text discusses the limitations of conventional source-finding algorithms in deep X-ray imaging of crowded fields. It introduces a multi-dimensional version of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, which performs better than other tests in small-number statistics cases. The authors propose an iterative source-modelling scheme that uses the K-S test to determine the optimal source distribution in a given image. They apply this method to a deep ROSAT exposure of a globular cluster and compare the results to other source-detection algorithms. The authors find that their method outperforms other techniques in crowded fields with low signal-to-noise. They also note a possible sixth source that was not previously detected.", "In this paper, the authors propose a resonant excitation mechanism for disk oscillations in deformed disks. They examine the nonlinear feedback processes and derive the excitation criterion and growth rate of the resonant oscillations. They also modify the previous analyses to correct inadequate treatments and derive more suitable expressions for numerical calculations. The study focuses on disks with pressure and considers both horizontal and vertical resonances. The results show that the stability criterion and growth rate are unchanged from previous papers, although the expressions are modified for numerical calculations. The resonant region is widened by pressure effects, and the width of the resonant region is determined by the spatial behavior of the original oscillations. The authors also discuss the meaning of the instability criterion and apply the resonant excitation mechanism to quasi-periodic oscillations observed in x-ray binaries.", "The most massive stars begin their lives in the darkest parts of giant molecular clouds, hidden by thick dust and gas. Observing the earliest stages of their formation is challenging due to the limited wavelength range available and the fact that massive stars form quickly. Additionally, these star-forming regions are located at great distances, making it difficult to observe them with high resolution. However, recent observations using cm-wavelength radio continuum and molecular line emission have been helpful in studying these massive stars. In this study, new mid-infrared observations of three candidate high mass protostellar objects (HMPOs) were presented. These observations were able to isolate the emission from the HMPOs and provide valuable information about their formation process. The observed data was compared to models of spherical accretion of dust and gas onto a central massive star. The best fit models provided information about the physical parameters of the HMPOs, such as the luminosity, density, and inclination angle. It was found that one of the HMPO candidates was not sufficiently luminous to be classified as an HMPO, while the other two candidates showed characteristics consistent with being in an early stage of formation, prior to the development of an ultra-compact region. These results suggest that massive star formation can occur in a similar", "The Perron-Frobenius theorem states that a real square matrix with strictly positive entries has a spectral gap. This means that the matrix has a positive simple eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues are strictly smaller in modulus. The theorem has been generalized to integral operators with a strictly positive continuous kernel. Proof of this theorem uses the Schauder-Tychonoff theorem and the concept of dual eigenvectors. Kren-Rutman theorem gives an abstract setting for this result by considering a punctured real closed cone mapped to its interior by a compact operator. Birkhoff developed a more elementary and intuitive theory by considering the projective contraction of a cone equipped with its associated Hilbert metric. This projective metric satisfies a contraction principle, which means that any linear map preserving the cone is a contraction for the metric and the contraction is strict and uniform if the image of the cone has finite projective diameter. Complex analysis also provides a contraction principle with respect to conformal maps. Kobayashi constructed a hyperbolic metric on complex manifolds using analytic images of complex discs. Perturbation theory allows considering small complex perturbations, but uniform estimates are usually hard to obtain. The Poincare metric on the unit disk and the induced metric on a hyperbolic", "A blind HI survey of the Abell 1367 region was conducted as part of the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES). A total of 100 HI sources were detected, of which 55 have confirmed optical counterparts and 45 are candidate optical counterparts. The HI selected galaxies show a different distribution pattern compared to optically selected galaxies, with HI galaxies being more homogeneously distributed in the cluster volume. HI selected galaxies are also more gas-rich, covering a wide range of gas to stars ratios, from gas-poor to extremely gas-rich galaxies. The baryon fraction of the HI selected galaxies appears to be constant, suggesting that the difference in the star to gas ratio between bright and faint galaxies is due to a different star formation efficiency rather than a loss of baryons in low mass galaxies. The HI distribution and luminosity function of the optically selected galaxies are significantly different from the HI selected sample, with the optically selected sample underestimating the number of HI rich galaxies and missing a considerable fraction of low luminosity, low surface brightness galaxies. Extended HI emission associated with high velocity clouds was also detected in the region.", "Superwimps are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that are produced in the late decays of other WIMPs, and they are considered promising candidates for dark matter. There are two well-motivated superwimp candidates: the gravitino in supersymmetric models and the first excited graviton in universal extra dimension models. In the supersymmetric case, the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), while the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is a slepton or sneutrino with weak-scale masses. The NLSP freezes out as usual and then decays into the gravitino, which inherits much of the relic density of the NLSP. This scenario naturally achieves the right magnitude of relic density without the introduction of new scales. The decays of the NLSP occur well after the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and may have significant effects on the observed abundances of light elements and cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. However, the constraints from BBN and CMB are not severe enough to exclude most of the weak-scale parameter space. In fact, the existing anomaly in the lithium-7 abundance prediction of standard BBN may already be interpreted as a signal of super", "The text discusses the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) in computational quantum mechanics. DFT is a widely used method to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems. The text explains how the Kohn-Sham equation is used to minimize the ground-state energy of a system by considering the electron density rather than the wavefunction. The text also describes how the method is implemented using a plane-wave basis set and the challenges associated with large-scale parallelization. The authors propose a parallel orbital-updating approach to improve the scalability of the calculations. Numerical experiments on different systems are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of their methods. Overall, the paper highlights the advantages of the parallel orbital-updating approach for large-scale calculations in DFT.", "Entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum mechanics and plays an important role in quantum information processing. There are several methods to create entanglement, including applying a global quantum operation, using the swap operation, and distributing entanglement using a separable state. This letter reports an experimental creation of entanglement using the third method mentioned above, specifically in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system. The experiment demonstrates the creation of entanglement between two non-directly coupled spins with the aid of one ancilla spin, while keeping the ancilla spin never entangled with the data spins. The results confirm that a separable state can be used to create entanglement. The experiment was performed on a 3-qubit NMR quantum processor, using a C-labeled alanine molecule. The initial state was prepared using a pseudopure state, and a CNOT gate was applied to create entanglement. The final state was reconstructed using state tomography, and the entanglement was confirmed by measuring the correlation using the attenuated correlation measure. The experimental results show that entanglement can be produced using a separated state with NMR technique, and the number of ancilla qubits required is reduced compared to other methods. It is also shown that", "Researchers have studied the cataclysmic variable 1RXS J1808 in detail using spectrometric and photometric observations. They found that the binary system has a nonuniform brightness distribution in the accretion disk, with two bright spots of different intensities. The brighter spot is near the accreting gas stream- accretion disk impact site, while the second spot is more extended and located on the opposite side of the disk. The researchers modeled the binary light curves and found that the second spot revolves around the white dwarf with a period of approximately 23.5 hours. They also determined the binary parameters and the component masses of the system. Based on their analysis, they concluded that 1RXS J1808 is most likely a cataclysmic variable star in outburst, similar to nova-like stars. Further observations are needed to confirm this conclusion.", "This study focuses on the formation of Population III stars and their properties in the presence of an ultraviolet background. The simulations show that increasing the ultraviolet background delays the collapse of high-density gas and increases the virial mass of the halo. However, contrary to previous predictions, even with a high ultraviolet background, star formation still occurs. The simulations also show a relationship between the ultraviolet background strength and the rate of gas accretion onto the evolving protostellar cloud. Additionally, the simulations indicate that halo cores with higher ultraviolet background strengths have less specific angular momentum. Overall, the results suggest that the formation of Population III stars is influenced by the presence of an ultraviolet background, but is not completely suppressed.", "White dwarf asteroseismology is a valuable tool for studying white dwarfs by comparing observed pulsation periods with theoretical models. A recent study analyzed a group of 44 ZZ Ceti stars using evolutionary white dwarf models and found internal chemical profiles, brunt-visl frequencies, and pulsation periods. This information can be accessed on their website and used for period fits or scaling with other white dwarf models. The models used in the study were computed using the LPCode evolutionary code, which includes important physics such as equation of state, opacities, diffusion, and nuclear burning. The pulsation code used is based on the Newton-Raphson technique and provides eigenfrequencies, oscillation kinetic energies, and rotational splitting coefficients. The database includes results for different stellar masses, effective temperatures, and H envelope thicknesses. The models were computed for different pulsation modes and a range of periods. The database can be downloaded from the website, and each file contains information for a specific sequence characterized by values of mass and envelope thickness. The files provide data on periods, forward period spacings, and other quantities.", "Neutron stars have velocities much higher than other stellar populations in our galaxy. Recent studies have provided evidence that these high velocities are a result of asymmetric supernovae and large kick velocities at birth. Various studies have estimated the birth velocities of pulsars, with results ranging from 9 km/s to 11 km/s. Pulsars with velocities greater than 14 km/s may be underrepresented due to selection effects in surveys. There is evidence for the existence of pulsars with velocities of 15 km/s based on observations of the Guitar Nebula pulsar. Binary pulsars and pulsar-supernova remnant associations also provide evidence for supernova asymmetry and pulsar kicks. The exact mechanism for these kicks is still unknown, but two classes of mechanisms have been suggested - convective instabilities in the stellar core and asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields. In this study, the authors focus on the second class of models and investigate the effect of asymmetric magnetic field topology on pulsar kicks. They find that the modifications to the absorption opacities of neutrinos due to the magnetic field are rather small and unlikely to generate appreciable kick velocities, unless the difference in field strengths at the two poles of the neutron star is at least 10^15 g", "The text discusses the use of small cells and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology in 5G mobile communication systems. It highlights that small cells and massive MIMO are not rivals, but rather can be used together to achieve better spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. The power consumption and interference coordination in a two-tier network architecture with small cells and massive MIMO are analyzed. The text also proposes a distributed energy efficient power control algorithm for the uplink two-tier networks, which uses game theory and evolutionary game theory to improve fairness among users and reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges quickly and improves fairness among cells.", "Vitruv is a second generation VLT instrument that combines 4 to 8 telescopes to make the VLTI more efficient. It allows for massive surveys of sizes and routine interferometric imaging. The science cases for Vitruv are focused on routine interferometric imaging. With the full operation of the Amber instrument and 3 movable ATs, the Paranal Observatory will have similar interferometric imaging capabilities as the Plateau de Bure Observatory. Vitruv is a spectro-imager with three modes of spectral resolution. It can observe in JHK bands and has the possibility of extending to visible and l bands. Vitruv can be used to study various aspects of star formation, such as accretion and outflow, the morphology of pre-main-sequence stars, and the distribution and morphology of PAHs and nanodiamonds in the inner regions of disks. It can also be used to study the morphology and kinematics of jets in microquasars and AGNs, as well as the morphology and kinematics of the broad line region in AGNs. Additionally, Vitruv can be used to study the galactic center and extragalactic black holes, including their environment, relativistic effects, and the size and mass of the black", "This paper discusses the relationship between entanglement generation and nonclassicality in quantum systems. The authors show that a beam splitter can generate entanglement if the input states are nonclassical, and they derive a criterion for detecting entanglement based on the nonclassical properties of the input states. They also introduce an entanglement witness construction method and apply it to the output of a beam splitter to detect entanglement. The authors demonstrate that the entanglement generated by the beam splitter can be verified by measuring marginal phase-space functions. They also discuss the effect of loss on the generation and detection of entanglement, specifically in the context of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The paper concludes by summarizing the main results and their implications.", "Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have different properties compared to high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies, offering new opportunities to test theories of galaxy structure and dark matter distribution. Optical and HI imaging have shown that LSB galaxies have lower surface brightness and HI densities compared to HSB galaxies, but have similar disk shapes. Rotation curves of LSB galaxies rise more slowly than those of HSB galaxies, indicating lower total mass densities. Mass modeling from HI rotation curves suggests that LSB galaxies are dominated by dark matter, but recent observations have questioned this conclusion. Additional baryonic components or similar luminous and dark mass distributions may explain the observed rotation curves. LSB galaxies may have cuspy halos despite their low density, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. Overall, the mass modeling for LSB galaxies is challenging, and independent estimates of mass in the stellar disks are crucial.", "The estimation of quantum states is an important task in quantum theory. When many copies of a state are available, state tomography can be used to obtain maximal information about the state. However, if only a single copy of the state is available, tomography is not a viable option. In this paper, the authors consider the problem of estimating a parameter of a quantum state from a single copy. They propose a Bayesian estimator that minimizes the deviation between the estimated and true values of the parameter. The authors show that the optimal measurement strategy depends on the prior information about the parameter and the states involved. They provide explicit solutions to the problem for qubits and discuss how the results can be applied to higher-dimensional cases. The authors also analyze specific examples, such as estimating the decay rate of a two-level atom, and discuss the implications of their findings.", "The paper discusses the concept of comtraces, which are a generalization of traces used to represent concurrent behaviors in systems. The authors introduce several different ways to represent comtraces, including the use of labeled so-structures and combined dependency graphs. They also show that these different representations are equivalent and provide composition operators for comtraces and cd-graphs. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for research, including the study of generalized comtraces and the development of logics for comtraces. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of comtraces and their various representations and applications.", "The text discusses the stability and properties of classical fields in various cosmological space-times. It focuses on the spectrum of scalar and Dirac fields in rotating and expanding backgrounds, including massless and tachyonic fields. The instability and decay of tachyonic fields is a major issue in their quantization, and they are usually not considered as real quantum particles. However, the text suggests that very light tachyons could be stable in rotating cosmological backgrounds. The analysis also extends to normal (tardyon) fields and discusses their spectra and potential problems in quantization. The work concludes by discussing the implications of the obtained results and potential future research directions.", "This text is about quark matter and its thermodynamics. It discusses the idea of quark matter and how it can be stable. It also mentions that quark matter can be formed in heavy ion colliders, neutron stars, and the early universe. The text goes on to explain the different phases of quark matter based on density and temperature. It also talks about the equivalence principle of general relativity and how quark matter can be used as a source of gravity. The text then introduces a formalism for studying the geometry of quark matter using the same methods used in general relativity. The plan for the paper is outlined and then the thermodynamics of quark matter is discussed. The thermodynamic potential density of quarks is given, as well as the ideal massive s quark thermodynamic potential. The text also presents the thermodynamics of quark matter at zero temperature and free quark matter. It goes on to discuss the thermodynamics of quarks at finite temperature and the low temperature regime. The text also discusses the thermodynamics of gluons at finite temperature. In the next section, the text introduces a geometric approach to studying phase transitions in quark matter using a legendre invariant formalism. The metric for the thermodynamic space of quark matter is", "Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by experiments such as boomerang and maxima-1 confirm the inflationary model as the favored explanation for the origin of structure in the universe. The model is attractive because it can explain the observed density perturbations and is supported by rigorous theoretical predictions. However, there are many different implementations of the inflationary idea, each with its own potential. The stewart-lyth inverse problem is a method that uses observational data on density perturbations and gravitational waves spectra to determine the inflationary potential. In this study, the feasibility of the method is tested using the example of power-law inflation. The dynamics described by the stewart-lyth equations are analyzed qualitatively, and it is found that most solutions are monotonic and do not exhibit periodic or chaotic behavior. The behavior of the solutions is determined by the spectral indices, and for smoothly and slowly changing indices, power-law solutions are still valid. This suggests that power-law inflation is a good candidate for the early universe. Further research is needed to obtain explicit functional forms of the inflationary potential.", "The text discusses the Nambu-Goto model, which describes the evolution of a string in higher-dimensional space-time. The model has been studied and modified to improve its quantitative results, but it is not in very good shape compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The text presents exact solutions to the gap equations and determines the interquark potential for the Nambu-Goto model with finite point masses attached to the ends of the string. The results show that the potential depends on the mass parameter and has different behaviors for different values of the mass parameter. The text also discusses the universality of the Luscher term and concludes with a brief account of the results.", "The study of artificial structures with engineered permittivity and permeability is an active area of research in electromagnetics. One interesting example is materials with zero permittivity at a certain frequency, allowing for quasi-static wave propagation over long distances. This behavior, known as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ), can be used for applications such as complete transmission of signals and sensing. This paper demonstrates experimentally that the transmission effect of ENZ materials can be controlled by placing a tuning element within the waveguide. The introduction of nonlinearity into the system allows for control of the ENZ resonance by the incident wave itself. The paper also discusses the construction of the ENZ structure and presents experimental and numerical results to validate the tunability and slow-light properties of the system.", "Inflation is a theory proposed to explain certain problems in the standard hot big bang cosmology. The simplest inflation model has made predictions that have been tested, including a coherent and nearly scale invariant power spectrum of density perturbations, a small tilt of the scalar power spectrum, nearly Gaussian density fluctuations, and the detection of gravitational waves. However, there are still challenges for theorists and experimentalists, including the difficulty of constructing large field inflation models and the high energy scale of inflation. New tests for inflation include the measurement of the tilt of the tensor power spectrum, which is currently not precise enough to test the predictions of inflation models. The paper explores the possibility of blue tensor tilt and examines various models and possibilities that could produce blue tensor spectra. The data analysis shows a hint of blue tensor tilt, but further research is needed to test and refine these findings.", "The understanding of confinement and the principles governing low energy dynamics in QCD is a major open question in the theory of strong interactions. Three-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories have proven to be useful in studying confinement because they are confining and have strong coupling dynamics. One model of particular interest is the Georgi-Glashow model with an adjoint Higgs field. This model exhibits confinement and can be studied using semiclassical methods. The relevant low energy degrees of freedom in these models are magnetic vortex fields, which were first introduced by 't Hooft. The effective Lagrangian for these models exhibits confinement in a simple and straightforward way. The presence of fundamental quarks, however, complicates the picture. The vortex field is no longer a local field and the effective Lagrangian can no longer be a simple local scalar theory. In the presence of fundamental quarks, the magnetic U(1) symmetry in the effective Lagrangian is gauged, with the gauge coupling inversely proportional to the mass of the quark. The presence of fundamental quarks also implies the existence of a conserved baryon number charge, which is represented in the low energy theory by the vortex field. The structure of finite energy baryon states is studied, and it", "String phenomenologists face the challenge of connecting high energy theories with low energy phenomena. This requires a superstring theory that can produce the standard model gauge group, three generations of quarks, and a mechanism for supersymmetry breaking. The researchers analyze orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string within the context of supergravity effective theories, focusing on models dominated by one-loop order contributions to soft breaking terms. These models exhibit non-universality of supersymmetry breaking, which leads to new behavior in the gaugino and scalar sectors. The researchers have already studied the constraints from accelerator physics and dark matter aspects. They are now interested in understanding how experimental limits on supersymmetric particles can provide information and potentially rule out certain models. The study is based on two regimes: one where supersymmetry breaking is driven by the compactification moduli, and another where it is driven by the dilaton field. The soft supersymmetry breaking terms depend on the one-loop beta function coefficient and other factors, resulting in a mixture of universal and non-universal terms. The phenomenology of the moduli-dominated scenario leads to light scalars and relatively heavy gauginos, while the phenomenology of the dilaton-dominated scenario leads to heavy squarks and sleptons and light gauginos", "The text discusses the importance of social media in political campaigns, specifically focusing on Twitter. It mentions the use of different techniques by politicians to transmit their messages effectively and the increasing popularity of social media platforms among the population. The text also references studies that have analyzed political conversations on Twitter and used data from the platform to predict election outcomes. The authors of the text propose a new parameter called the \"relative support\" to measure the support for different candidates on Twitter and apply it to the 2011 Spanish presidential elections. They also introduce a model based on network theory to understand the structural and dynamical patterns of interactions on Twitter. The authors analyze the behavior of politicians on Twitter and propose further research on the most efficient techniques to influence voter sentiment on the platform.", "The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) aims to make high resolution measurements of the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The telescope consists of four multichroic, polarization-sensitive tes bolometer detector arrays. Each array is sensitive to two frequency bands and the detectors are cooled to 100 mk using a dilution refrigerator. The detector and feedhorn wafers are fabricated at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The advACT experiment will include multiple arrays and will observe nearly half of the sky with approximately 5800 detectors. This experiment is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and NASA.", "Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are binary systems that undergo large amplitude outbursts with a recurrence time of about 1 year. Most SXTs are low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which are binary systems where a neutron star or black hole accretes matter lost by a low-mass companion. Some SXTs show X-ray bursts during decline from outburst and must contain neutron stars, while others have mass functions that suggest they contain black holes. Most of the outburst energy in an SXT is emitted in soft X-rays. There are certain spectral characteristics that can help distinguish between neutron star and black hole transients, but it is not clear if all transients exhibit these characteristics. The binary periods of SXTs generally range from 5 hours to 6 days. The outbursts of SXTs can be explained by either a mass transfer instability in the X-ray illuminated regions of the companion or a disk instability model similar to that seen in dwarf novae. However, there are difficulties with both models and a hybrid model that combines the two mechanisms may be more accurate. The disk instability model works better for SXTs when the thin disk is truncated at a large transition radius, as in the advection-dominated flow", "The unidentified gamma-ray point sources along the galactic plane have been a puzzle for a long time. However, recent x-ray and optical observations of one of these sources, 2EG J0635+0521, have provided some clues to its identity. The x-ray observations revealed a point source with a hard spectrum, and the optical observations identified a be star as the most likely counterpart to the x-ray source. While the identification of this be star with the gamma-ray source is still tentative, it is possible that the gamma-ray emission is due to pulsar emission, shock interaction between the pulsar wind and the companion star, or accretion onto a neutron star or black hole. Further observations are needed to confirm the identification and understand the nature of the source.", "The text discusses the concept of one-way propagation and non-reciprocal structures. It explains that this concept can be achieved by violating Lorentz's reciprocity using asymmetric susceptibility or time modulation. Several different configurations are proposed, including one-way total reflection from magneto-optical layers, interfaces between photonic crystals and metals, and photonic topological insulators. The text also introduces the idea of \"meta-weaves,\" which are nano-scale surfaces made up of one-way threads that can control the flow of light. The properties and behavior of these meta-weaves are described, and several examples are given to illustrate their effectiveness.", "The proximity of the sun to the earth has a significant influence on the earth's climate and environment. Research has shown that solar activity is correlated with the earth's global climate, sea surface temperatures, albedo, cosmic ray flux, cloud cover, and monsoon rainfall. The flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun can cause disruptions in the earth's atmosphere, communication systems, and power grids. Predicting the physical parameters of future solar cycles, such as amplitude and period, is important for understanding space weather effects on the earth. Many predictions have been made in the literature on the 24th solar cycle and beyond. This study focuses on predicting the period of future solar cycles using a forced and damped harmonic oscillator model based on the physical parameters of previous cycles. The results show that the amplitude of solar cycle 24 will be smaller than cycle 23, and there will be periods of high and low sunspot activity in future cycles.", "The purpose of this work is to describe the dynamics of homogeneous three-dimensional incompressible fluids containing vortex filaments. The evolution of these fluids is governed by the Euler equations, where the velocity and vorticity of the fluid are denoted by u and \u03c9, respectively. The focus is on fluids with vortex filaments, which are thin tubes where the vorticity is concentrated. The motion of these filaments is described by the binormal flow equation, which exhibits a variety of motions, including the generation of singularities in finite time. The binormal flow also has special solutions given by infinite straight filaments. The dynamics of multiple vortex filaments are studied, and a system of coupled equations for their positions is derived. Special attention is given to systems of vortex filaments that are nearly parallel, which can be linearized to the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are investigated, with a focus on the conditions for large time or global existence. Finally, examples of finite-time collapses of vortex filaments are provided.", "In this paper, the authors study the frequency shift and damping of the sloshing mode in a trapped fermi gas. They use the moments method to approximate the solutions of the boltzmann equation with mean field and in-medium cross-section. The first-order ansatz predicts a downwards shift of the sloshing mode frequency, but it is insufficient to describe the coupling between the center-of-mass motion and the internal degrees of freedom of the gas. The authors extend the ansatz to include third-order moments, which allows them to study the coupling effects. They find that the sloshing mode is damped due to its coupling to other modes, especially the radial dipole and bending modes. They compare their results with experimental data and find good agreement. They also discuss the effects of trap anharmonicity on other collective modes, such as the radial dipole and octupole modes. Finally, they study the bending mode in more detail and find that it is also damped and deformed by the trap anharmonicity.", "The text discusses the Baldwin effect, which is an anti-correlation between the equivalent width in certain emission lines and the continuum luminosity in quasar spectra. The effect was first discovered by Baldwin in 1977 and has since been confirmed in various emission lines such as IV CIV, Ly-alpha, and OVI. The physical cause of the effect is still unknown, but various models have been suggested. One model suggests that the observed relation can be explained by an anti-correlation of the ionization parameter and the continuum luminosity, while another model suggests that the beff is driven by a softening of the ionizing continuum towards higher luminosities. The beff is important as a diagnostic of active galactic nucleus structure and metal abundances and can be used to study the evolution and physics of the quasar phenomenon. Overall, the study confirms the existence of the beff and provides further insight into its characteristics.", "The text discusses the unsolved problem of mass transfer in the black-hole candidate LMC X@xmath03 and the difficulty in accurately identifying the companion star. The optical counterpart of LMC X@xmath03 shows ellipsoidal modulations and long-term brightness variations associated with changes in the soft X-ray flux. The authors conducted optical photometric observations of LMC X@xmath03 and determined its intrinsic colors and spectral type, which suggested that the companion star is a subgiant of spectral type B5IV. This identification is consistent with the observed range of colors and luminosity. The authors also found that the companion star is filling its Roche lobe, indicating that mass transfer occurs via Roche-lobe overflow. The low column density inferred from X-ray data supports the lack of significant wind from the companion star. Finally, the authors note that the observed radial velocity variations may be affected by X-ray irradiation and suggest a correction to the mass function of the compact object.", "The study focuses on the commensurate magnetic excitations in n-type cuprates near the optimal doping. It is known that the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors are antiferromagnetic (afm) Mott insulators, and superconductivity emerges when charge carriers are doped into the planes. The study aims to shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity by investigating the spin dynamics in n-type cuprates using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). The ins measurements reveal a commensurate spin response in n-type cuprates, characterized by the strongest intensity peaked at a certain momentum. This commensurability exists for a wide range of doping, even above the superconducting critical temperature, indicating its non-superconducting origin. The study also compares the spin response in n-type and p-type cuprates and discusses the intrinsic particle-hole asymmetry between the two types. Theoretical works have been carried out to interpret the magnetic excitations in n-type cuprates, and the study adopts a spin-density wave (SDW) description to investigate the cuprates near the optimal doping. It is found that the commensurability is a result of the band splitting and Fermi surface topology, and is closely related to the strength of the effective SD", "The text discusses the use of entanglement and quantum dots in quantum information processing. It explains that accurate calculations of entanglement in quantum dots are important, but often require approximations. The Hubbard model is introduced as a simplification that captures a significant amount of physics in many-body quantum systems. The text compares the predictions of the Hubbard model to results from a system of two interacting fermions trapped in quantum wells. The average single-site entanglement is calculated and compared between the two systems. The accuracy of using the Hubbard model to approximate the entanglement in the quantum well system is evaluated. The text also discusses the spatial entanglement in the quantum well system and compares it to the average single-site entanglement. It concludes by summarizing the findings and suggesting further research directions.", "In this article, the authors study the excitation phase of two different types of spin waves in an in-plane magnetized magnetic film. One type of spin wave, called the backward volume magnetostatic spin wave (bvmsw), is characterized by a harmonic distribution of magnetization and is reciprocal. The other type, called the magnetostatic surface spin wave (mssw), has an exponential distribution of magnetization and is non-reciprocal. The authors find that the excitation phase of the bvmsw is zero, while the excitation phase of the mssw is non-zero. They explain this difference based on the configuration of the antenna's microwave field and the distribution of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are important for understanding spin wave phenomena and have implications for applications in magnetic memory devices and spin wave logic. The authors demonstrate their results using phase resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, which allows them to measure the excitation phase of the spin waves using an optical technique.", "This paper explores the effect of spiral stellar density waves on the dynamics and abundance distribution of heavy elements in spiral galaxies. The authors use numerical simulations to show that the non-axisymmetric gravitational field of the spiral density waves causes large changes in the angular momenta of individual stars and gas clouds around the corotation radius. Radial migrations associated with these angular momentum changes are expected to dilute the abundance gradients in the gas component of spiral galaxies. The authors also find evidence for a complex radial distribution of heavy element abundances in both external galaxies and the Milky Way. They propose a model that explains the formation of plateaus in the heavy element abundance distribution near corotation as a selective action of star formation, which results in a minimum heavy element production at the corotation radius. The simulations demonstrate the development of cyclones and anticyclones in the gas flow around corotation, which significantly affect the radial abundance distribution of heavy elements. The authors conclude that the sizes of plateaus in the abundance distribution around corotation increase along the Hubble sequence of spiral galaxies and that the effect of spiral density waves on the abundance distribution is stronger in galaxies with more open spiral arms. The study also highlights the importance of including continuous star formation in future simulations to fully understand the shaping of the abundance distribution.", "The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle detector that will be installed on the International Space Station in 2005. Its main goals include searching for cosmic antimatter, dark matter signatures, and measuring cosmic ray spectra. During a precursor flight in 1998, AMS collected data for about 180 hours. The AMS-02 detector, which will be installed for a 3-year mission, will include a superconducting magnet and new instruments such as a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and an Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL). The Time of Flight (TOF) system in AMS-02 will have improved resolution but also more weight and power constraints. The TOF system in AMS-01 consisted of 4 planes of scintillator counters and had a good time resolution. The new TOF system in AMS-02 will have different photomultiplier tubes and light guides due to the stronger magnetic field, and its time resolution will be worse than AMS-01. The weight and power consumption budgets will also be more strict in AMS-02. However, the new read-out electronics will improve charge resolution and trigger efficiency.", "The production of window glass relies on the synthesis of a mixture of quartz sand, sodium carbonate, and calcium carbonate. The process is carried out at high temperatures to eliminate defects and homogenize the melt. The grain size of the raw materials affects the quality of the glass. However, there is limited information on the interplay between the geometry of the system and the rate of chemical reactions during the melting process. In this study, a technique called in-situ high-temperature tomographic x-ray imaging was used to study the process of glass melting. The experiment involved heating a mixture of silica sand, sodium carbonate, and calcium carbonate and observing the changes in the microstructure of the system. The results showed that solid-state reactions between the grains occurred before the formation of melts. The reactions resulted in the fragmentation of sodium carbonate grains and the formation of new compounds. The proximity of sand and calcium carbonate to sodium carbonate influenced the occurrence of these reactions. The study also revealed the formation of a sodium-rich liquid at lower temperatures than predicted by the phase diagram. The research provides insights into the processes involved in glass melting and highlights the importance of observing the reactions in real-time.", "The properties of x1 in a nuclear medium have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental studies have shown that the mass of x1 becomes lower in a nuclear medium compared to free space. The depth of the x1-potential in normal nuclei has been found to be about 30 MeV. Total photoabsorption experiments have shown a broadening of the x1 peak but no shift in the peak position, indicating that x1 properties in a nuclear medium are modified. Experiments with photons in the x1 energy region are expected to provide more information on x1 properties in a medium. The photon can directly produce x1 in the bulk region due to the weak electromagnetic interaction, whereas proton- and pion-induced reactions mainly produce x1 in the surface region. Additionally, the momentum transfer for photoreactions is the same as the energy transfer, resulting in x1 with a smaller momentum compared to proton-induced reactions. However, the multistep collisional processes after photoabsorption need to be analyzed to fully understand x1 properties in a medium. The authors have developed a framework of a Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model combined with a Statistical Decay Model (SDM) and applied it to nucleon-induced reactions. The framework has been successful in reprodu", "The ability to cool fermionic atoms to extremely low temperatures allows for the study of superfluidity in a new context. Cold degenerate gases are ideal for studying superfluidity due to their diluteness and lack of long-range coulomb interactions or lattice effects. Current state-of-the-art cooling techniques can reach temperatures around absolute zero. To achieve even lower temperatures, a strong coupling mechanism is needed, which requires going beyond the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) approach. One approach is to increase the interatomic couplings by using a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the interactions cannot be adequately described by a scattering length, as the scattering length diverges near the resonance. The true descriptor of the interactions is the energy-dependent scattering t-matrix. This paper focuses on incorporating the physics of the resonance into the microscopic description of the interatomic couplings. Fluctuations also play a significant role in the critical behavior of the system, especially in the crossover regime where tightly bound composite particles are present. This paper aims to incorporate fluctuations to properly describe the behavior of a superfluid fermi gas at all detunings from the resonance. The results obtained are compared to a complimentary treatment developed by Ohashi and Griffin. The study of", "The paper discusses the existence of odd automorphisms in cubic symmetric graphs. The main result is that a graph admits odd automorphisms if and only if it is non-bipartite and its order is odd. The paper also analyzes different types of cubic symmetric graphs and their properties with respect to odd automorphisms. Additionally, it provides a detailed explanation of the concept of even and odd automorphisms and their implications in the study of graph symmetry. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the existence and properties of odd automorphisms in cubic symmetric graphs.", "The quantum dynamics of photosynthesis have recently attracted a lot of attention. Understanding how nature exploits quantum coherence could have significant scientific and technological implications. Photosynthesis involves two main steps: light harvesting and photochemical processing. Light harvesting molecules absorb photons and transfer the excitation energy to the photosynthetic reaction center. The reaction center then undergoes a series of electron transfer reactions, resulting in the formation of a charge-separated state. In these reactions, radical-ion pairs are formed, which exhibit intricate magnetic field effects. It has been discovered that there is a new mechanism at the fundamental quantum dynamical level of radical-ion-pair reactions that leads to enhanced nuclear spin polarization, known as chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP). This new mechanism is due to the inherent quantum measurement of the radical-ion pair's spin state continuously going on as part of its charge recombination process. The decoherence caused by this \"internal\" quantum measurement is responsible for a new kind of nuclear spin sorting, which is particularly efficient at low magnetic fields. This new mechanism can significantly enhance the nuclear spin polarization, creating a new type of CIDNP signal. This signal has been observed to be at least four orders of magnitude higher than the thermal polarization. The new CIDNP effect is unrelated to other known CIDNP", "The understanding of the QCD phase diagram, which describes the different phases of strongly interacting matter, is an important topic in the field of physics. It is relevant to various phenomena, such as the early universe, neutron stars, and heavy ion collisions. The standard picture of the QCD phase diagram consists of two phases: a low temperature and density phase where quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons and chiral symmetry is broken, and a high temperature and density phase called quark-gluon plasma where these particles are deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored. However, recent studies suggest that at low temperatures and medium densities, other phases may appear, such as the color superconducting phase. Due to the difficulties in calculating the QCD phase diagram using first principles methods, most theoretical approaches rely on effective models of QCD, such as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In this study, the authors investigate the chiral phase transition and the possible appearance of a superconducting phase using a nonlocal covariant separable interaction model. They find that the phase diagram depends on the strength of diquark correlations and the choice of regulator. The results show the existence of critical points, such as a triple point and an end point,", "Recent observations suggest the presence of \"dark energy\" in the universe, which has an equation of state close to -1 and dominates the expansion history. This poses a problem for particle physics, as most solutions involve a non-zero vacuum energy. However, some physicists doubt the existence of any vacuum energy. This paper presents an alternative mechanism for generating accelerated expansion and negative equation of state without relying on vacuum energy. The model involves a fundamental field that breaks Lorentz invariance, creating a non-zero vector expectation value and a gas of fermions that interacts with this condensate. At high energies, the fermion gas behaves like ordinary radiation, but at temperatures comparable to the fermion mass, it behaves with a negative equation of state. The paper discusses the equation of motion for the fermion field and presents cosmological scenarios where particle dark energy can explain late-time acceleration. It also explores the possibility of late-time decoupling and late-time decay of a separate dark matter particle as explanations for the acceleration. These models do not require fine tuning and can potentially explain the observed acceleration of the universe.", "The investigation of the effects of weak localization in low-dimensional electronic systems is still popular today. Experimental studies have shown surprising results such as metal-insulator phase transitions in 2D electron gas and unusual behavior of dephasing time in quasi-1D metallic wires at low temperatures. Impurity effects in 1D disordered systems have been accurately studied due to exact methods for weak and strong disorder. Perturbative approaches have also given good results for weakly disordered 3D systems. Weak localization corrections to the kinetic coefficients of 2D disordered systems are logarithmically divergent and difficult to sum perturbatively. The dimension two is the marginal dimension for the localization problem and a small external perturbation can change the character of localization. According to the scaling theory, all states of 1D and 2D electronic gases moving in the field of randomly distributed impurities are completely localized, regardless of the degree of randomness, and a metal-insulator phase transition occurs with increasing impurity concentration in 3D systems. The scaling theory and diagrammatic approach have shown logarithmic quantum corrections to the conductivity in weakly disordered systems, tending towards localization. Short-range and weak correlations in weakly disordered metals result in nontrivial quantum corrections to the", "The text discusses the structure of winds in binary star systems, specifically focusing on colliding winds in hot star binaries. It mentions that winds in these systems are highly structured, with density and velocity variations. The question of how the interaction of winds with these inhomogeneities occurs is explored, and the possibility of revising the theory of colliding winds is raised. The text also mentions that there is no coherent theoretical model for the formation of density and velocity inhomogeneities in hot star winds. It discusses the importance of heat conduction and the effects of clumps and voids on the interaction zone. The importance of 2D and 3D simulations, as well as the role of equilibration timescales, is also discussed. The text concludes that a quantitatively correct model of colliding inhomogeneous winds is currently out of reach, but provides a qualitative picture of the effects that are important in these systems.", "The text discusses the effects of carrier doping in the material @xmath0-Tas@xmath1. It explains that correlated materials with correlated electrons can exhibit interesting quantum states, and that external electric or light fields can be used to manipulate these states. The stability of electric field or light induced states has been demonstrated in some systems, and this characteristic can be useful for electric devices such as transistors and memories. The text goes on to describe the crystal structure of @xmath0-Tas@xmath1 and its different phases. It then discusses the various manipulations of the states in @xmath0-Tas@xmath1, such as gate-controlled intercalation, electric field-induced transitions, and light-induced transitions. The mechanisms of these transitions are still not fully understood. The text then describes simulations of carrier doping effects on the charge density wave (cdw) in @xmath0-Tas@xmath1. It finds that ccdw is stable upon electron doping, while hole doping suppresses ccdw instability. The mechanisms of electric and photoelectric manipulations of ccdw in @xmath0-Tas@xmath1 are found to be different. The text also discusses the potential for superconductivity to emerge in hole", "The control and manipulation of magnetization in small scales has been a topic of growing interest in recent years. One approach is to control the motion of domain walls in nanowires, which can be used to build logical devices and memories. Artificial defects, such as notches, are useful in controlling the position and movement of the walls. The existence of magnetic vortex structures in confined structures has also been studied extensively. While the flipping of the vortex core polarity has been extensively studied, achieving a fine control of the vortex chirality has proven more difficult. Recent experimental and simulation studies have investigated the dynamics of domain walls in nanowires with notches, demonstrating that different notches can provide different potential barriers and lead to different types of walls. The interaction between vortex walls and triangular asymmetric notches in permalloy nanowires was investigated using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and micromagnetic simulations. The results showed that the chirality of the vortex wall can be tailored when interacting with a notch, and the dynamics of the wall depend on the symmetry of the notch. The studies also revealed that the occurrence probability of different chiralities can be controlled by the symmetry of the notch. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of vortex walls and the possibilities of manipulating their", "Infrared and millimeter observations have provided support for the single star plus accretion disk model of star formation. However, the majority of young, low-mass stars are members of binary systems, which complicates this model. The study of disks in binary systems is crucial to understanding star and planet formation processes. In this study, high-resolution mid-infrared imaging observations were conducted on the binary system Hen 3-600. The observations revealed that the thermal dust emission in the system originates from the primary star, indicating that it has a circumstellar disk, while the secondary star does not. This is inconsistent with previous models that suggest both stars in a binary system should have circumstellar disks. The presence of a circumstellar disk around only one star in a binary system is a puzzle that requires further study. The Hen 3-600 system is part of the Tw Hydrae association, which is a group of young stars that are potentially coeval and can provide insights into disk evolution timescales. The age of Hen 3-600 is estimated to be between 1 and 10 million years. It is possible that the disks in binary systems are influenced by the presence of a companion star, leading to different disk evolution timescales. Further studies of disks in binary systems can", "HD271791 is a high-velocity runaway star with a galactic rest-frame velocity typical of hypervelocity stars. These stars have velocities that exceed the escape velocity of our galaxy. The existence of these stars was predicted by Hills, who proposed that close encounters between binary systems and supermassive black holes could result in the ejection of one component with high velocities. Another possible mechanism for the production of hypervelocity stars is through interactions with a binary black hole in the galactic center. However, proper motion measurements are not available for most hypervelocity stars, making it difficult to determine their birthplace. HD271791 is one of the few hypervelocity stars with measured proper motion, and it was found to have been ejected from the periphery of the galactic disk. This suggests that it was not produced in the galactic center. The alternative explanation for the origin of hypervelocity stars is through strong dynamical interactions in young and dense star clusters or through tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies during close passages near the Milky Way. The young age of HD271791 suggests that the second possibility is unlikely. Przybilla et al. proposed that HD271791 attained its peculiar velocity through the disintegration of a close massive binary system following a supernova explosion.", "The paper focuses on the use of morphological operations using hypergraph in the pre-processing phase of line objects recognition. It explains the concepts of mathematical morphology and hypergraph theory, and how they can be applied to image analysis. The paper also discusses various morphological operators, such as dilation and erosion, and their effects on the input image. It demonstrates the importance of pre-processing in improving the accuracy of line objects recognition and shows the results of applying morphological operations using hypergraph to eliminate common errors like noise, line fuzz, holes, and separations. The paper concludes by highlighting the effectiveness of using morphological operators in the pre-processing phase and their potential applications in various domains.", "The paper discusses the formation of planetesimals, which are the precursors to planets, in a protoplanetary disk. The central problem is the growth of centimeter-sized grains to kilometer-sized planetesimals. The authors perform numerical simulations to study the effect of gas on the formation of planetesimals through gravitational instability. They find that the gas drag and the dissipation of kinetic energy cause the dust layer to shrink vertically and decrease its velocity dispersion. The gravitational instability occurs and forms non-axisymmetric wake-like structures, which eventually fragment into planetesimal seeds. These seeds grow rapidly through mutual collisions and form one large planetesimal. The final mass of the planetesimal depends on the size of the computational domain. The authors also compare their results with previous simulations and discuss the importance of gas drag and turbulence in the formation of planetesimals.", "A single source model, based on a supernova remnant (SNR) near the Earth, was suggested to explain the sharpness of the knee in the cosmic ray energy spectrum. The model estimated the distance and age of the single source to be between 230-350 pc and 84-100 kyears, respectively. High energy gamma rays from the single source were found to be unlikely to be observed with current telescopes. The SNR monogem ring and its associated pulsar PSR 0656+14 were identified as potential sources that satisfy the distance and age criteria. Armenian physicists found an excess of cosmic ray intensity in the region near the SNR, which was attributed to the pulsar. The possibility of PSR B0656+14 being the single source responsible for the knee and the excess of cosmic rays was analyzed. It was concluded that while the pulsar can contribute to the formation of the knee, it cannot be the dominant source. The confinement of cosmic rays by the SNR and pulsar was observed to increase the observed intensity of high energy particles. The association between the pulsar and the excess intensity observed in the Armenian peak was discussed, taking into account the position and motion of the pulsar. Other pulsars, such as Gem", "Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are a subclass of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) that exhibit rare outbursts characterized by short, luminous flares. These flares reach high X-ray luminosities and have a duty cycle lower than a few percent. SFXTs are typically observed at X-ray luminosities below 10^5 erg/s, but in some cases, a luminosity as low as 10^4 erg/s has been observed. The mechanism responsible for the flaring behavior of SFXTs is still widely debated, with some attributing it to the properties of the compact object and others invoking orbital geometries and the clumpy winds of the massive star. Recent research has proposed an alternative model based on the instability of the quasi-spherical shell of captured matter above the magnetosphere of a slowly rotating neutron star. In this study, the authors investigate the waiting time between consecutive flares and the duration of the brightest phase of the outbursts in order to gain more insight into the nature of these transients. They find that the waiting times between flares follow a distribution with a plateau just above 1 day, suggesting that this timescale can separate the flaring activity belonging to different out", "Hydrodynamic simulations are now being used to accurately describe the convective photospheres of different types of stars, allowing for more precise determinations of their properties. These models can be produced for stars with different properties and metallicities. The simulations are able to reproduce the details of solar spectral line profiles and the fine structure observed across the solar surface. However, verifying these models for other stars is challenging since their surface structures cannot be spatially resolved. Synthetic spectral line profiles can be computed from the output of these simulations and can provide information about the atmospheric structure and dynamics of the stars. Exoplanet transits offer an opportunity to study spectra from small portions of the stellar surface. This method is observationally challenging, but it is feasible with current spectrometers and is expected to become more powerful in the future. The aim is to retrieve narrow photospheric line profiles from small portions of the stellar disk using an averaging approach. With current facilities, this is possible for the broadest and strongest chromospheric lines. However, future developments in telescopes and spectrometers will improve the possibilities for spatially resolved stellar spectroscopy.", "This article discusses the characterization of randomness and dynamical complexity in quantum mechanics and their relationship to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The article presents a cyclist approach towards the quantum many-body problem, inspired by studies of quantum and classical chaos. The article explores various numerical examples, including the Bethe ansatz, quantum Monte Carlo, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. It also discusses the challenges of solving the many-body problem in quantum mechanics, as well as the limitations of certain methods under different conditions. The article then focuses on the possibilities of characterizing quantum chaos and non-equilibrium properties in the kicked Ising (KI) model, which undergoes a transition from integrable to quantum chaotic regimes. The article examines the properties of non-equilibrium steady states, quantum relaxation to equilibrium, and quantum dynamical complexity in the KI model. It concludes by discussing the connection between quantum chaos and transport in far-from-equilibrium steady states, as well as the validity of Fourier's law in quantum chains.", "Galaxy mergers can lead to intense star formation, known as a starburst. During the merging process, the gravitational disturbances remove angular momentum from the galactic interstellar medium (ISM), causing it to settle into the gravitational center of the system and leading to starburst activity. This can result in large-scale outflows, or \"superwinds,\" driven by supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars. These galaxy mergers and their successive processes can significantly alter the morphology, stellar population, gas content, and chemical abundance of the galaxy. \n\nNGC 6240 is a well-studied merger/starburst galaxy that is often considered an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), although its infrared luminosity is slightly smaller than the criterion for ULIRGs. It has double nuclei, known as the northern and southern nuclei, which are colliding active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the progenitor galaxies. The galaxy also has a bright optical emission line nebula associated with it, believed to be primarily excited by shock-heating induced by a starburst superwind. \n\nDetailed observations of NGC 6240's extended optical emission line gas structure have not yet been fully understood. This study presents deep optical narrow-band imaging of NGC ", "In this study, the velocity gradient tensor in fully developed turbulence is analyzed. The study focuses on the lagrangian dynamics and modeling of the velocity gradient tensor. The tensor is found to have interesting statistical and geometrical properties in turbulent flows. The study also investigates the role of the pressure hessian and its effects on the velocity gradient. Closures for the pressure hessian are proposed, but they are found to be unrealistic at higher Reynolds numbers. Synthetic velocity fields are used to reproduce the behavior of the pressure hessian, and they are found to capture many of its properties. In particular, the synthetic fields reproduce the redistribution of probabilities towards enstrophy production and the non-vanishing action of the pressure hessian even when the velocity gradient is zero. The study also examines the importance of spatial locality in determining the properties of the pressure hessian. The anisotropic part of the pressure hessian is found to contain non-local contributions from the spatial variations of the velocity gradient. A local approximation for the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian is proposed, which is shown to be highly correlated with the true pressure hessian. The local approximation is able to reproduce the probability current associated with the pressure hessian and the conditional expectation of the pressure hessian norm. Overall,", "The paper investigates random walks on the t-graph, a type of deterministic fractal. The authors derive an analytical formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between all pairs of nodes on the t-graph. They show that the location of the trap (a special node where the random walk ends) has no qualitative effect on the scaling of the MFPT. The authors also provide an expression for the MFPT as a function of the network order, showing that it increases superlinearly with the number of nodes. Finally, they discuss the implications of their findings and suggest that their analytical method can be applied to other fractals and random media. The research was supported by various funding sources.", "The atmospheric helium abundances of sdB stars are poorly understood. Diffusion models predict an almost total depletion of helium, but observations show a range of helium abundances from slightly above solar to 3 times less than solar. Mass loss and extra mixing in the atmosphere have been proposed to explain the observed helium abundances. There is a correlation between helium abundance and temperature, with hotter sdBs having more helium in their atmospheres. There are also two distinct sequences of helium abundance with temperature, with the majority of stars lying on the upper sequence. Diffusion and gravitational settling cannot fully explain the observed patterns, so other mechanisms must be at play. Isotopic anomalies, specifically enrichment of the light isotope 3He, have been found in some sdB stars. It is found that 8 out of the observed sample of 46 sdB stars have isotopic shifts indicating an enrichment of 3He. The stars with 3He enrichment are clustered in a narrow temperature range. This enrichment cannot be explained by diffusion and gravitational settling alone.", "The text discusses the use of AlGaAs edge emitting lasers in the field of optoelectronics, particularly for pumping solid-state lasers. The authors describe their calculations and experiments to improve the electrical and optical parameters of these lasers, such as decreasing the lasing threshold current and increasing the optical power and efficiency. They explore the effects of changing the width and depth of the quantum well and the doping levels in the different laser layers. The results show that lower doping levels in the waveguide and emitter regions lead to better laser characteristics, and a \"n-p\" waveguide structure provides better results than a \"n-n\" structure. The authors also discuss the role of the lasing offset voltage and differential resistance in the overall performance of the lasers. Overall, their work aims to optimize the opto-electrical parameters of AlGaAs lasers for improved efficiency.", "Most models of dark energy in the present universe satisfy the null energy condition (NEC), but there is still a possibility that dark energy is phantom and violates the NEC. Observations have shown that the equation of state for dark energy with time-dependent parameters can allow for phantom behavior. This raises the question of whether phantom behavior can also be obtained in modified gravity theories. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of effective phantom dark energy in scalar-tensor gravity. They find that models with effective phantom dark energy can be consistent with all constraints, but the scalar-tensor Lagrangian must have a specific shape and the initial data must be fine-tuned. Additionally, the phantom stage must have begun fairly recently. The authors conclude that the effective phantom behavior in scalar-tensor gravity is unlikely, and that some of the undesirable properties discussed in the paper are present in scalar-tensor models regardless of whether they exhibit phantom behavior or not.", "This paper discusses the pivoting methods for the p-matrix linear complementarity problem (p-LCP), a problem for which polynomial-time algorithms and hardness results are not available. The paper introduces unique sink orientations (USOs) and their properties in the context of simple principal pivoting methods for p-LCPs. It also explores the randomized method of Murty and the Morris orientations, which can be used to solve p-LCPs. The paper then delves into K-matrix linear complementarity problems (K-LCPs) and their properties, including the quadratic bound for the Murty rule and the linear bound for any simple principal pivoting method. The paper concludes by discussing the combinatorial structure of p-LCPs and the potential for polynomial-time algorithms.", "Regions near OB stars are often hot and highly ionized due to the strong ultraviolet radiation produced by these stars. The structure of these regions has been studied through observations of various emission lines and the use of photoionization models. Recent data from the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) has provided a better understanding of these regions. In the case of the Spica nebula, it was found to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a gas density of 100.6 cm^-5 and a hydrogen ionization rate of 10^11 photons s^-1. The ratio of [OIII] 5007 to H-alpha was found to be higher in the Spica nebula compared to other regions. In this study, the authors analyze far ultraviolet (FUV) emission lines and WHAM data to study the Spica nebula. They find that the nebula shows an asymmetric feature with strong enhancement in the southern region below Spica, which is associated with a high neutral hydrogen density. The nebula is also possibly embedded in a medium of enhanced temperature. The observed emission profiles have long extended tails and respond to the density increase in the southern region, indicating the presence of background hot gas and multiple resonant scattering of ions. The authors also compare", "Local helioseismology techniques have limitations in accurately determining the sub-surface structure of flows and sound speed distortions around large-scale solar magnetic field concentrations like sunspots. This is due to the complexity of magnetohydrodynamic processes involved and the incomplete understanding of the behavior of magnetoacoustic waves as they interact with sunspots. Recent studies have shown that solar magnetic fields and the process of wave mode conversion associated with them cause significant changes in wave travel times. There are four dominant processes that affect wave behavior in sunspots: fast/slow mode conversion, the \"ramp effect,\" fast wave reflection, and fast/Alfv\u00e9n mode conversion. These processes produce shifts in travel time measurements, making it difficult to accurately measure and infer subsurface solar structure. Improvements in computational power have made it possible to model these wave propagation and mode conversion processes in realistic solar magnetic field structures. A sunspot model is presented that is spectropolarimetrically accurate and magnetohydrostatically stable. The model allows for the study of wave propagation and behavior in the simulated model using synthesized radiation. Multi-height observations are performed to disentangle the wave mode conversion process in the solar atmosphere. The research findings suggest that the umbral power increase observed in sunspots is a", "The dynamical response of black holes to external disturbances is dominated by a discrete set of damped oscillations called quasinormal modes (qnms). These modes have been observed in both linearized level and numerical simulations for stellar gravitational collapse and black hole collisions. Observation of the radiation due to qnms could provide direct evidence of black holes existence and estimate their parameters. There is also a connection between qnms and the ads/cft conjecture, which suggests a correspondence between string theory in anti-de Sitter (ads) spacetime and a conformal field theory (cft) on the boundary of this space. By computing qn frequencies in an ads space, we can obtain the thermalization time scale in the strongly coupled cft. The study of perturbations in ads spacetimes has been extended to black holes with nonspherical topology. The objective of this work is to answer questions about the wave equations governing general metric perturbations, the qn frequencies in different regimes, and the behavior of the qnm spectrum in the regime of highly damped overtones. The method used to compute the qn frequencies is the Horowitz-Hubeny method, which allows us to calculate the modes for different horizon radii and wave numbers. The analysis of the modes", "This paper introduces a new class of models describing the quark mass hierarchy and the isospin violation in different quark families. The dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is separated from the dynamics triggering isospin violation. The authors consider scenarios with an elementary Higgs field, technicolor, and a dynamical Higgs mechanism with a Higgs doublet composed of 4th family quarks. They assume that the EWSB dynamics leads to a quark mass spectrum with no or weak isospin violation, and that the masses are of the order of the observed masses of down-type quarks. The models require flavor-changing-neutral interactions and the presence of heavy exchange vector particles. The paper also describes the introduction of horizontal interactions between quarks in the different families, with an emphasis on the third and second families. Lastly, the paper discusses the generation of the CKM matrix and the appearance of composite Higgs bosons.", "The text discusses the development of a scintillator-based electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) for use in future linear collider experiments. The ECAL, known as the Scintillator ECAL (SCECAL), is a critical component of the particle flow approach (PFA) for high-performance jet physics. A prototype SCECAL module has shown expected performance in terms of energy resolution. The next step in the development is to embed the readout system between the ECAL layers to reduce dead volume. A technical prototype of a thinner and denser readout board has been developed. The scintillator-ppd unit, which combines the scintillator strip and the pixelated photon detector (PPD), is a core part of the SCECAL. Different designs and ideas for the scintillator-ppd unit are discussed, including thinner scintillator strips, different shapes for the PPD's sensitive area, and methods to increase reflection on the scintillator surface. The development of a higher pixel count PPD is also discussed. A special event-reconstruction method called the strip splitting algorithm (SSA) has been developed for SCECAL. The algorithm splits the energy deposited on a strip into virtual square cells to achieve fine segmentation. The algorithm has been tested and shows", "In this paper, the authors review the use of point contact spectroscopy to study the interaction between electrons and phonons or dynamical defects in metals. They first introduce the concept of two-level systems (TLS) and their connection to electron-phonon interaction. They then discuss how TLS can be studied using point contact spectroscopy, where defects in the contact region can cause anomalies in the current-voltage characteristics. The authors describe the different regimes of point contacts, including diffusive, ballistic, and thermal regimes, and how the conductance is affected by the presence of TLS. They also discuss the use of point contact spectroscopy to probe the dynamics of TLS. The paper concludes with a discussion of the experimental results and the limitations of the current theories.", "The paper discusses the frequency of dual active galactic nuclei (DAGNs) in the universe and their demography, as well as the factors that influence their formation. The authors construct a phenomenological model to estimate the frequency of kpc-scale DAGNs and find that it is consistent with current observational constraints on the merger rates of galaxies and the triggering mechanisms of nuclear activities. They also predict the distribution of DAGNs at higher redshifts and discuss the uncertainties in their estimates. Overall, the paper suggests that major mergers of galaxies play a significant role in the triggering of nuclear activities, but other factors such as gas content and separation distance also play a role.", "The text discusses the use of diffraction calculations in various fields of optics including computer generated holograms, digital holography, phase retrieval, image encryption and decryption, steganography, and 3-dimensional analysis for optical devices. The text also introduces the cwo++ library, which is a C++ class library for computational wave optics involved in diffraction and computer generated hologram calculations. The library can be used on both CPU and GPU for faster computation. The text also provides examples of generating inline phase-only computer generated holograms and implementing the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for phase retrieval. The performance of the library is compared on CPU and GPU, and it is shown that GPU calculations are much faster. The cwo++ library is user-friendly and can be used for a wide range of optics applications. It is available for download and has been supported by various research grants.", "The field of atmospheric quantum optics has become an important area of research in recent years, driven by the goal of establishing quantum key distribution in global communication networks. The transmittance of ground-to-satellite atmospheric links is affected by various atmospheric conditions, such as turbulence, which cause temporal and spatial variations in the optical properties of the atmosphere. Understanding the behavior of nonclassical light in these fluctuating atmospheric channels is crucial for the successful implementation of quantum information applications, such as quantum key distribution. Several theoretical models have been developed to describe the effects of atmospheric fluctuations on quantum states of light, and laboratory experiments have been performed to simulate these effects. In particular, a method has been developed to simulate fluctuating losses in a controlled manner by measuring the transmittance of fixed attenuation levels and weighting and merging the data to obtain a probability distribution of the transmittance. This approach has been applied to the study of various atmospheric conditions, including strong turbulence and beam wandering. The nonclassicality of the detected light has been analyzed using matrix of moments and click-counting statistics, and the effects of post-selection protocols have been investigated. The simulation method has also been demonstrated to work with arbitrary probability distributions, such as beta-binomial distributions. Overall, the simulation of fluctuating loss channels", "The paper discusses the tensor model, which is a generalization of the matrix model used to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity, to higher dimensional cases. The paper proposes a new interpretation of the rank-three tensor model as a theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces, which allows for a new way of extracting physics from the model. The paper shows that the tensor model can reproduce the properties of low-lying long-wavelength modes of small fluctuations around certain classical solutions, which are in remarkable agreement with general relativity. The paper also discusses the connection between the tensor model and the general relativity, as well as the emergence of gauge symmetry in the tensor model. The results of numerical analyses of the tensor model are compared to the general relativity and shown to be in agreement. The paper concludes that the tensor model provides an interesting model for the emergence of space, the general relativity, and its gauge symmetry in any dimensions.", "This paper discusses the phenomenon of anomaly inflow in the context of brane-world scenarios. In these scenarios, the standard model fields are localized on a 4-dimensional defect called a brane, embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The paper explores the consequences of anomaly inflow, which occurs when the brane fields have anomalies that are canceled by inflow from the extra dimensions. The authors show that such inflow leads to observable effects, such as changes in the distribution of electric and magnetic fields and the appearance of anomalous electric charge and dipole moments in particles. The results are valid even in the presence of small anomaly coefficients and are independent of the mass scale of the extra dimensions. The paper also discusses the fine-tuning of anomaly mismatch and the possibility of radiative corrections in the theory.", "In this paper, the authors present a multirate method for integrating systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that arise from step models describing nanostructure evolution. The strength of their method, in comparison to other existing multirate schemes, is its fourth-order accuracy. A multirate method takes different step sizes for different components of the solution, which is useful when a few components contain time singularities or are locally stiff. The authors demonstrate their method using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for the inner and outer schemes and coupling them together with cubic interpolants. They show that their method is applicable to problems in surface evolution and is effective for problems with locally coupled ODE systems that are locally stiff. Their method is able to efficiently solve large systems of ODEs where only a few components are stiff. The paper also discusses the physical motivation behind step models and the evolution of vicinal surfaces in crystal structures. The authors validate their code and present their results in terms of convergence and efficiency. They conclude by discussing potential extensions of their work and future research directions.", "The text discusses the topic of Majorana fermions in condensed matter physics. Majorana fermions are particles that are their own antiparticles and are known for their nonlocality and non-Abelian statistics. They have the potential to realize exotic phenomena and can be used for fault-tolerant topological quantum computations. The Kitaev model, which describes a one-dimensional nanowire with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction, is the simplest model that realizes Majorana zero-energy states. Thin films and multichannel nanowires with 3-wave superconducting pairing have also been investigated. The text proposes a system of topological superconductors placed in parallel, where the superconducting pairing phase can be changed arbitrarily, and investigates the system using the ladder of topological superconductors. The topological phase diagram of the system is determined by calculating the topological numbers of the system. The text also discusses the energy spectrum and the low-energy behavior of the system. Additionally, the differential conductance of the system is calculated, showing the quantization of the conductance in the topological regions and the resonant andreev reflection induced by Majorana fermions. The text concludes by mentioning the possibility of realizing the proposed system using insb nanow", "The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a powerful method used for low dimensional interacting systems. It was developed by S. White in 1992 and has since been applied to a wide range of systems and problems. The DMRG has been highly accurate in calculating ground state energies and has been used in systems such as spin chains, ladders, fermionic and bosonic systems, disordered models, impurities, and molecules. It has also been improved in several directions, such as studying two and three-dimensional classical systems, stochastic models, the presence of phonons, quantum chemistry, field theory, including temperature and calculating dynamical and time-dependent properties. The DMRG method reduces the size of the Hilbert space through the use of a density matrix, which allows for a more efficient calculation of larger systems. The method has been successful in many applications and has been used to study the spin gap in the Heisenberg chain, calculate spin correlation functions, and analyze the behavior of impurities in spin systems. The method has also been extended to include classical and quantum systems in two and three dimensions, as well as including temperature and dynamical responses. Overall, the DMRG method has proven to be a valuable tool in understanding the behavior of low", "The text discusses the study of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy ion experiments using the RHIC and LHC accelerators. The QGP is a nearly ideal fluid that is formed when quarks are no longer confined into detectable particles. The transition from QGP to the hot gas of hadrons is characterized by a crossover. Lattice simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are used to study the properties of the QGP and the transition phase. These simulations allow for a first principles description of the transition. The lattice calculations are valid for both the hadronic and quark-gluon phases, and can access different theories with varying quark masses. The order of the transition depends on the quark mass, with a 1st order transition for infinite quark masses and a crossover for lighter quarks. The transition is characterized by the restoration of chiral symmetry. The lattice simulations also provide insight into the equation of state, freeze-out parameters, and fluctuations of conserved charges. The text describes the simulation setup and algorithms used. The renormalization procedure for the chiral condensate and polyakov loop is discussed. The results of the simulations for the chiral condensate, strange quark number susceptibility, and polyakov", "Adic-Bratteli-Vershik (BV) systems represent all measure-preserving systems on nonatomic probability spaces and all minimal systems on the Cantor set. They provide a combinatorial description of the construction of systems by the cutting and stacking method, present tail fields of stochastic processes as the fields of adic-invariant sets, facilitate the study of measure-preserving and topological orbit equivalence, and present important and interesting particular systems for detailed study. Recent work has investigated the effect of orderings on the sets of maximal and minimal paths, and has given necessary and sufficient conditions for a diagram to admit a perfect ordering. The coding of orbits of paths according to natural partition into cylinder sets allows traditional methods of symbolic dynamics to be applied, even if the adic transformation cannot be defined as a homeomorphism. The Pascal adic with a particular edge ordering allows the coding of orbits of paths according to the natural partition into cylinder sets to be an essentially faithful representation of the system as a subshift on a finite alphabet. Each minimal finite topological rank adic system, with unique maximal and minimal paths and having all orbits dense, is either expansive or topologically conjugate to an odometer. The coding by initial path segments of length 3 for distinct paths in the", "Integrable systems, which are well understood in classical physics, are much more mysterious in quantum physics. In classical physics, integrable systems have a phase-space decomposition into independent tori on which trajectories are constrained. These systems have conservation laws, of which there are a certain number, that can be used to annotate the distinct tori. However, in quantum physics, there is no generic picture for integrable systems. Most integrable systems are solved using the Bethe ansatz method. In addition to spectral properties, conservation laws have been found in parallel investigations. Integrable systems have some surprising properties, including anomalies such as anomalously slow decay of currents. In this text, the concept of long-time residuals is examined, specifically whether the long-time residual is saturated by the standard conservation laws or if there might be a secondary mechanism or non-local conservation laws that contribute. The problem of saturation of the long-time residuals is investigated both formally and numerically for a particular case, the XXZ model. It is found that the long-time residual is exhausted by the known conservation laws, but this only happens when the current operator is compatible with the complete set of mutually commuting conservation laws. Depending on the particular system and its symmetries, the long-time residual may or may not be", "Deep learning approaches have been successful in various applications, and they have also been relevant to computational neuroscience. However, it is still unclear whether deep networks truly support neuronal representations and processes that allow for flexible reasoning. One candidate mechanism is neuronal synchrony, which has been postulated to play a key role in how the cortex processes sensory information. In this study, the authors propose a framework that incorporates neuronal synchrony into deep networks using complex-valued units. They demonstrate the potential functional role of neuronal synchrony and show that it can be used for tasks such as binding by synchrony and gating of interactions. The authors also present several experiments to support their claims and discuss the implications and challenges of incorporating synchrony into deep learning.", "The text discusses the observation and analysis of star clusters and associations in the Magellanic Bridge, which connects the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds. The authors conducted observations using the Soar telescope and analyzed the properties of the clusters, such as their ages, metallicities, and distances. They found that the clusters in the bridge are quite young and have varying metallicities. They also discovered that some of the clusters are associated with a tidal dwarf galaxy, which is a dwarf galaxy formed from material stripped from interacting galaxies. The study provides insights into the formation and evolution of star clusters and associations in tidal structures.", "Shell models are dynamical systems that represent simplified versions of the spectral Navier-Stokes or MHD equations for turbulence. They were originally introduced in hydrodynamic turbulence and are now a relevant alternative approach to the study of fully developed turbulence. Shell models are built by dividing wave-vector space into discrete shells, each assigned a scalar dynamic variable. The equations for these variables include terms for nonlinear coupling, dissipation, and forcing. Shell models have the advantage of being easily investigated through numerical simulations. The paper discusses different types of shell models, including the Obukhov-Novikov model and the Gledzer-Yamada-Ohkitani (GOY) model. The extension of shell models to MHD is also discussed. The paper explores various phenomena in shell models, such as dynamo action, the growth of correlation between velocity and magnetic field, and spectral properties in forced stationary states and intermittency. The stability properties of shell models and the effects of different forcing terms are also investigated. Finally, the paper mentions two potential applications of shell models in astrophysics, namely studying primordial magnetic fields in the early universe and investigating scaling laws in solar flares.", "The absence of diffusion of waves in disordered media was predicted by Anderson 50 years ago. This phenomenon, known as Anderson localization, has been observed in different types of waves including light and sound. Recent experiments have observed Anderson localization in ultracold atoms, paving the way for the observation of new phenomena and shedding light on long-standing problems. In this paper, the authors consider the case of an atomic vapor described as a weakly interacting Bose gas in the presence of a weak disorder. They study the transport properties of the system and show that there are two limiting cases: superfluidity in the deep subsonic regime and Anderson localization in the deep supersonic regime. They also show that for speeds in between, one reaches a regime of time-dependent flows. Additionally, they analyze the effect of interactions on the localization properties and provide a theoretical model for the threshold length beyond which most flows become time-dependent. Finally, they discuss the experimental strategies and possible signatures for the observation of Anderson localization in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate.", "Summary:\nThis paper introduces a method for incorporating risk aversion into Markov decision processes (MDPs) using the Average Value at Risk (AVaR) metric. The paper presents a solution algorithm for the risk-averse total cost MDP problem and demonstrates its application in a rapid robotic deployment task. The results show that risk-averse policies can provide more informative solutions compared to traditional risk-neutral policies. The paper also discusses possible extensions of the algorithm to other risk metrics and the constrained MDP case.", "The paper investigates the growth and decay mechanisms of breather solutions in the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation. The authors consider both localized and extended perturbations to the breather and analyze their long-term effects on the system. They find that when an internal mode of the breather is excited, the breather grows due to a transfer of energy. On the other hand, if the breather interacts with a small-amplitude standing-wave phonon, the breather can either grow or decay depending on the phonon wave vector. The growth and decay processes involve the generation of higher-order radiation modes. The authors also discuss the instability of phonobreather solutions and their interaction with the breather. Overall, the paper provides insights into the dynamics of breather solutions in the DNLS equation.", "The presence of a tight correlation between the rest-frame optical color and luminosity of early-type galaxies, known as the color-magnitude relation (CMR) or red-sequence, is well-established in the literature. This correlation implies that the properties of the stellar populations in early-type galaxies strongly depend on the total stellar mass of the system. The tight correlation observed along this relationship requires a strong coherence between the age and metallicity of stellar populations in early-type galaxies. Measurements of the slope, zero-point, and dispersion around the CMR can provide physical insight into galaxy formation and evolution. Possible explanations for the slope of the CMR include the retention of more metals in more massive galaxies or the occurrence of early mergers. Studies of the evolution of the CMR towards high redshift argue that the relation is primarily driven by metallicity. The dispersion around the CMR for early-type galaxies in clusters is small, indicating that these clusters must have stopped forming stars at a relatively early time. The dispersion is larger for galaxies in groups or in the field. The scatter in galaxy colors in the core of a cluster is smaller than that measured in the field, indicating stronger coordination of star formation in clusters. The CMR between different clusters is very homogeneous. Galaxy environment affects the scatter around the", "The paper discusses the theoretical evidence that the n-type doped single bilayer BiH is a time-reversal invariant (TRI) topological superconductor. The band structure of BiH is described by a tight-binding model, and the electron correlation is taken into account using the intra and inter-orbital coulomb repulsion and the Hund's rule coupling. The mean-field pairing analysis predicts the dominant pairing channel as s-wave. The crystal and band structures of the BiH bilayer are discussed, and the hopping integrals and on-site spin-orbit coupling are calculated. The band structure of undoped BiH exhibits a quantum spin hall (QSH) insulator phase with in-gap helical edge modes. Upon doping, hole and electron pockets appear in the band structure. The electron correlation is modelled using the Hubbard model, and the interaction parameters are obtained from constrained density functional theory calculations. The transformation properties of the pairing operators under symmetry operations are discussed, and it is found that the inter-orbital s-wave and intra-orbital s-wave channels have s-wave symmetry, while the inter-orbital f-wave and intra-orbital f-wave channels have f-wave symmetry. The pair operators for the @xmath16 and @xmath", "The text discusses the use of perturbation theory in elementary particle phenomenology, specifically in calculating Feynman diagrams. It mentions that perturbation theory supplemented with non-perturbative additions is more accurate than direct calculations of physical observables on the lattice. The accuracy of perturbation theory is increasing as experimental data improves, requiring calculations with an increasing number of loops. However, these calculations are still complicated and involve sophisticated algorithms and extensive computer resources. The text also introduces the concept of water melon diagrams and discusses their various applications, such as in calculating the effective potential in quantum field theory. The paper presents a method to calculate the near threshold expansion of the spectral density for water melon diagrams and compares it with the exact results. It concludes by discussing the advantages of using the configuration space technique for calculating water melon diagrams.", "Summary:\n\nThe paper explores entanglement properties in (1/2,1) mixed-spin systems described by the Heisenberg model with nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. Analytical results for two-spin and three-spin cases are provided, as well as numerical calculations for larger systems up to eight spins. The effects of magnetic fields on entanglement are also studied. It is found that the entanglement between NN spins is determined by the internal energy, and the entanglement between NNN spins is enhanced by increasing NNN interactions. The results show rich behaviors of entanglement in mixed-spin systems, which differ from those in pure spin-half systems.", "The article discusses models of weak arithmetics and proof complexity. It explains how models of weak arithmetics have been extensively studied for their ability to do mathematics while still allowing for constructiveness. The article then discusses the strength of theories obtained by restricting reasoning to a small part of a given model. It mentions that certain cuts of models can be models of stronger theories. The article also explores the concept of proof complexity and how it is connected to the lengths of formal proofs in proof systems. It mentions the connection between weak arithmetics and complexity classes and how certain proof systems are stronger than others. The article discusses the simulation of certain proof systems by others and the application of cuts to prove simulation results. It also mentions ongoing work on improving simulation results. The article concludes by summarizing the structure of the paper and mentioning the assumptions and familiarity with certain concepts that are required for understanding the content.", "The study analyzes the properties of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 0614+09. The power spectra of the X-ray data show strong band-limited noise, as well as twin kHz peaks. The separation frequency of the twin peaks is consistent near 323 Hz, and there was one detection of a third peak near 328 Hz. The study also compares the QPO properties with the broad-band noise and X-ray spectra, as well as analyzes the photon energy spectrum of the oscillating flux in the kHz QPO. The results suggest that 4U 0614+09 is an atoll-source in the island state. The study also discusses the correlation between QPO frequency and count rate, and suggests that count rate may not be a good measure of the inferred accretion rate. The study concludes by discussing the possible origins of the kHz QPO and band-limited noise in X-ray binaries.", "The text discusses the need for efficient multiaccess communication schemes in a system where communication resources are limited. It introduces different multiaccess schemes such as TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, and contention-based protocols like slotted aloha, carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), and CSMA with collision detection and collision avoidance. It also introduces interference alignment as a technique for managing interference in communication systems. \nThe text then presents an algorithm that works in both many-to-one and many-to-many communication scenarios, where a receiver manages collisions and interference by decoding the collided packets and interfering signals. The receiver uses the received signals to construct a matrix and applies a decoding algorithm based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract the desired packets. The algorithm is shown to achieve high performance and asymptotic throughput in high SNR conditions. \nThe text also discusses the effect of SNR on the ability of the receiver to correctly detect the identity of the transmitters and decode the packets. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulations, showing that a higher SNR improves the accuracy of transmitter detection and reduces the symbol error rate. \nOverall, the algorithm presented in the text offers a solution for efficient multiaccess communication in wireless networks, considering various scenarios and interference conditions.", "Modified theories of gravity (MG) have gained attention as they could explain phenomena that general relativity (GR) cannot. These phenomena include the accelerated expansion of the universe, spatio-temporal variation of fundamental constants, and dark matter. MG theories propose modifications to GR on large scales. It is believed that GR is not the complete theory of gravity and that there is a need for modifications due to singularities and non-renormalizability. Scalar-tensor theories, where a scalar field couples non-minimally to gravity, are commonly used to explain these modifications. These theories often involve higher dimensional gravity and braneworld scenarios. Scalar fields are also introduced in string theory and supergravity. One common feature of modified gravity theories is the introduction of a fifth force that leads to enhancements of gravitational force. This can be detected through experiments like the ET-Wash experiment and tests of the equivalence principle. However, these experiments have only been performed in the local vicinity and do not rule out large-scale modifications of gravity. Screening mechanisms, like chameleon screening, can suppress fifth forces in high density environments, allowing solar system and laboratory tests to be satisfied. In this paper, deviations from GR in theories that rely on chameleon screening are considered. The effects of chameleon screening on the evolution of", "The letter discusses the use of photometric redshifts, obtained through the photometric redshift technique, to estimate distances to faint galaxies. The accuracy of these redshift estimates is assessed using a sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The study focuses on the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) field, where photometric data from various telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), are available. The results show that the photometric redshifts have good agreement with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a median offset of 0.04. The accuracy of the photometric redshifts is further studied for two specific subsamples of objects: Extremely Red Objects (EROS) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The photometric redshifts for EROS are found to be quite accurate, while the performance for AGNs is slightly lower. The study concludes that the photometric redshift technique, especially when combined with a prior, is a useful tool for estimating distances to faint galaxies in surveys like GOODS.", "The @xmath0 bootis stars are a type of population I star that have a peculiar surface abundance pattern. They have roughly solar levels of light elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, but show significant underabundances of iron-peak elements. The similarity between the abundance pattern of the @xmath0 bootis stars and the depletion pattern of the interstellar medium (ISM) has led to the suggestion that these stars accrete interstellar or circumstellar gas. This is different from other peculiar A-type stars where the abundance pattern is caused by processes in the stellar atmosphere itself.\n\nObservational data has shown that the @xmath0 bootis stars have the same fundamental parameters as normal stars, including temperature, gravity, mass, rotational velocity, and age. There is also a correlation between the sodium abundance of the @xmath0 bootis stars and the nearby interstellar column densities of sodium. This discovery has motivated further analysis of the interaction between the stars and the diffuse ISM cloud as an explanation for the @xmath0 bootis phenomenon.\n\nThe density distribution of the ISM in the solar neighborhood has been reconstructed from observations of sodium and hydrogen. Typical number densities for diffuse clouds in the ISM range from 0.1 to 100", "The text discusses the challenges of video stabilization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and introduces different algorithms that have been proposed to address this issue. It mentions that while there have been some advancements in UAV video stabilization, most methods are not able to achieve real-time processing and have limitations in terms of motion estimation and stabilization. The text then introduces a novel algorithm that aims to overcome these limitations by using an optical flow-based corner tracker and a reduced region of interest for motion estimation. The algorithm is able to achieve high processing speeds and can stabilize a UAV video in real time. The algorithm is implemented using multi-thread processing, with separate threads for motion estimation, motion compensation, and image composition. The text concludes by stating that the proposed algorithm has been able to achieve real-time video stabilization and provides links to access the demo of the algorithm. Future work is mentioned to address issues with large and gradual scene changes in videos.", "The 2slaq survey is a combination of the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the local structure of galaxies. The survey uses the precision of the SDSS photometric survey and the spectroscopic capabilities of the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) to extend the study of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) to higher redshifts. LRGs are ideal for tracing large-scale structure because they are luminous and homogenous, and can be reliably identified photometrically. The survey aims to reveal the large-scale structure of the universe when it was two-thirds of its present age and understand the evolution of the most massive galaxies. The survey has obtained redshifts for over 10,000 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.5 to 0.65, with a high success rate. The spatial distribution of the galaxies shows a pattern of clumps, filaments, and voids, similar to previous surveys at lower redshifts. The survey has provided important clues about the nature and evolution of galaxies in the local universe.", "The text discusses ultraslow diffusion processes, specifically ultraslow scaled Brownian motion (USBM) with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. USBM is different from regular scaled Brownian motion (SBM) because it has a logarithmic time dependence of the mean squared displacement (MSD) rather than a power-law dependence. The text also discusses USBM in confined systems and the effects of ageing on the MSD and time-averaged MSD. The ergodicity breaking parameter, which quantifies the statistical spread of the time-averaged MSD, is also analyzed. The text concludes that USBM adds to the understanding of ultraslow diffusion processes and has potential applications in various fields.", "Time series analysis in sports leagues, particularly soccer, has been a popular topic of study in recent years. Researchers have used both phenomenological and model-free approaches to analyze different aspects of the game, such as soccer characteristics and predicting match results. One specific focus has been on the distribution of goals, with recent findings suggesting a Poisson distribution. Additionally, studies have looked at the quality of teams, with the average goal difference being a good indicator. Interestingly, this value remains relatively constant throughout a season, regardless of coach changes. Similar analyses have also been conducted on basketball and tennis matches. In team handball, which is popular mainly in Europe, there has been growing interest in the German handball Bundesliga. One study analyzed the specific characteristics of this league, finding that the home team has a 58.9% chance of winning, with a guest win probability of 33.2% and a draw probability of 7.9%. The study also looked at the goal distribution and found that eight teams throw more than half of the total number of goals in a season. There is also a noticeable relationship between attack and defense, with teams with a positive goal difference showing a stronger correlation with attack and teams with a negative goal difference showing a stronger correlation with defense. The study also", "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has discovered many new white dwarfs, but there is still potential for further discoveries. The authors of this study have conducted a systematic survey of DA white dwarfs based on the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs by McCook & Sion. They compare their survey to other large surveys of DA white dwarfs and examine the properties of their current sample. They also focus on specific subsamples such as DAO white dwarfs, the ZZ Ceti instability strip, and DA+DM binaries. They discuss the importance of high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in their data and the implications of their mass distribution. The study also addresses the characteristics of DAO white dwarfs and the challenges in analyzing their spectra. The authors discuss their observations of ZZ Ceti stars and the presence of a possibly non-variable star within the instability strip. They also explain their methodology for analyzing DA+DM binary systems and present initial results. Finally, they discuss the intriguing case of CBS 229, which is believed to be an unresolved double degenerate binary composed of a magnetic DA white dwarf and a normal DA white dwarf. The authors outline their future plans for completing their survey and analyzing the remaining data. They express gratitude for the support they", "The study presents an analysis of the metallicities of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the disk of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The authors use photometry data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey to estimate metallicities of RGB stars and create a map of median metallicity in the galaxy's disk. They find a gradient towards lower metallicities at larger radii, consistent with previous observations. They also identify a region of high metallicity associated with the end of the bar in M31. The authors correct for systematic effects such as photometric bias and completeness and discuss the uncertainties in their measurements. They compare their results to metallicity gradients observed in the Milky Way and other galaxies, and discuss the implications for the history of star formation in M31.", "Graphene and other carbon-based nanostructures have gained attention for their remarkable properties and their potential for technological progress. Recent research has focused on the van der Waals and Casimir interaction of graphene on a substrate with an ordinary material. Several studies have been conducted using the Dirac model of graphene, which assumes a linear dispersion relation for the graphene bands at low energies. These studies have calculated the van der Waals coefficient for graphene sheets at zero temperature and the van der Waals and Casimir forces between graphene and an ideal metal plane at zero temperature. The thermal effects of graphene were found to be crucial at shorter separations compared to ordinary materials. Various approaches have been used to compute the graphene-graphene and graphene-metal interactions, but there is no complete agreement between the results of the different approaches. In this paper, the authors establish a link between the reflection coefficients of electromagnetic fluctuations on graphene and the components of the polarization tensor. They derive explicit expressions for both longitudinal and transverse electric susceptibilities of graphene, density-density correlation function, and conductivities at arbitrary temperature. The authors compare the computational results for graphene-graphene and graphene-metal interactions at room temperature obtained using the polarization tensor with those obtained using the density-density correlation function. They find that the explicit temperature dependence of the polarization tensor", "This study examines the use of corrugated structures to increase the bandwidth of radiation in x-ray crystallography. The researchers use beam dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the usage of corrugated structures can lead to a tenfold increase in radiation bandwidth. They show that data collection with a 3% bandwidth, a few microjoule radiation pulse energy, a few femtosecond pulse duration, and a photon energy of 5.4 kev is possible. The study also develops an analysis of the short-range wake function of the corrugated structures and discusses the layout of the European XFEL accelerator. The results of the simulations show that the radiation power along the pulse can be affected by the wake fields of the corrugated structures. Overall, this study suggests that the over-compression of the electron bunch and the insertion of corrugated structures could significantly increase the bandwidth of radiation in x-ray crystallography.", "This paper discusses the construction of solitonic operators in closed string field theory that create D-brane states. The authors first review the construction of solitonic operators in noncritical string theories and show that similar operators can be constructed in critical string theories. They then introduce the concept of boundary states and creation and annihilation operators for closed strings whose wave functions are proportional to boundary states. Using these operators, they construct solitonic operators that can be considered as creation operators for D-branes. Acting these operators on the vacuum state, they obtain BRST invariant states in which D-branes are excited. The authors calculate the vacuum amplitude and show that the operators they construct create two D-branes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and potential future directions.", "Experimental evidence has provided solid support for the existence of exotic baryons called pentaquarks, which are made up of four quarks and an antiquark. Several groups have confirmed the observation of these pentaquarks in various nuclear reactions. Theoretical models have predicted these pentaquarks and have played an important role in these discoveries. The mass and properties of these pentaquarks have been studied and calculated using a variational method, providing upper bounds on their masses. The results show that the pentaquarks have a mixture of octet and antidecuplet flavors, and their masses have been determined. These findings contribute to our understanding of the structure of baryons.", "The discussion about the structure of space and time has been ongoing among philosophers and physicists for a long time. The correspondence between Newton's disciple, S. Clark, and Leibniz about the absolute or relational character of space and time is well known. The laws of mechanics and electromagnetism were initially written with the assumption of an absolute space and time, but relational theories lacked consistency and were abandoned. However, with the development of the special theory of relativity, the arguments of relational theories were revisited, albeit only on a phenomenological level. In recent times, the controversy between physicists defending the absolute or relational theory of space and time has increased. This is driven by the advancements in general relativity, cosmological models, and the foundations of quantum mechanics. Some physicists argue to reduce the structure of space and time to properties of quantum processes. There have been various relational theories proposed, all based on the assumption that there exist fundamental objects from which the structure of space and time is constructed. These objects could be events, processes, yes-no experiments, monads, etc. According to these authors, space and time are derived concepts. They start with objects and their interrelations, and space and time emerge as a convenience at the end. Some theories propose a set-the", "Protein aggregation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The self-assembly of proteins into polymer-like structures also plays a role in cellular mechanics. The aggregation of proteins at the cellular scale is not well understood compared to in vitro experiments. The kinetics of protein self-assembly can occur through various pathways, but studying the stochasticity is challenging due to the small volume of cells. The stochastic behavior is mainly affected by statistical number fluctuations. This leads to large deviations from mean length distributions. The study of protein aggregation kinetics is currently limited by the complexity of the involved pathways. In this work, the authors use a computer simulation technique called kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) to study the kinetics of protein self-assembly. KMC allows for the stochastic nature of the process and does not require knowledge of the thermal noise beforehand. The authors investigate various combinations of molecular pathways and focus on the lag time associated with the polymerized mass fraction. They find that the lag time is inversely proportional to the system volume, while the nucleation time is precisely inversely proportional to the system volume. The elongation time plays a role in the non-universal correction to the leading-order stochastic lag time. The authors also find that the rate-limiting step in the lag", "This text discusses the transport of angular momentum in astrophysical discs and how it is related to turbulence. It mentions several candidate processes for sustaining turbulence in these discs, including the magneto-rotational instability, gravitational instability, vertical shear instability, and baroclinic instability. The magneto-rotational instability is currently the leading candidate for angular momentum transport. However, in protoplanetary discs, non-ideal MHD effects become important, which can change the nature of the turbulence or render it ineffective. The text also discusses the transport of dust particles in these discs and how the strength of turbulent diffusion is an unknown parameter. It suggests that observations of tracer species at snow-lines in protoplanetary discs can be used to probe the strength of turbulent diffusion and the schmidt number. The concentration and brightness distribution of the tracer species are strongly dependent on the schmidt number. The text proposes that observations using the ALMA telescope can help constrain the schmidt number in protoplanetary discs. However, it also acknowledges that several improvements and considerations need to be made in the models used to fit real data.", "PSR B105552 is a middle-aged pulsar that emits both radio and gamma-ray radiation. It has an interpulse and wide radio components, which provide valuable information about the pulsar's geometry. The radio emission occurs on fieldlines above the null surface and is likely produced by an outer gap. The gamma-ray emission comes from the same pole as the radio emission, suggesting a connection between high-energy production and radio emission. The pulse profile of PSR B105552 is complex, with multiple components and significant linear polarization. The separation between the main pulse and the interpulse does not vary with frequency, indicating a highly inclined magnetic axis. The emission height of PSR B105552 is estimated to be similar for both poles, around 700 km. The geometry of the pulsar's magnetosphere suggests that the radio emission comes from regions normally considered closed and corotating, while the gamma-ray emission originates from an outer gap above the null surface. The observed pulse profile and polarization properties of PSR B105552 support this model.", "The text discusses the phenomenon of spin-resolved orbital magnetization in a two-dimensional electron gas with rashba spin-orbit interaction. The orbital magnetization arises due to non-compensated spin currents flowing at the edges of a sample, similar to how electric currents generate orbital magnetization. The spin-resolved orbital magnetization contributes to spin nernst conductivity, which is the spin current flowing perpendicular to a temperature gradient. The temperature dependence of the orbital magnetization is shown, indicating a decrease with increasing temperature. The spin-resolved orbital magnetization can be calculated analytically in the low-temperature limit. This phenomenon has potential applications in spintronics devices for controlling spin transport.", "Chemical and biological systems are stochastic in nature, meaning they are subject to randomness. This randomness can come from inherent processes or outside influences. Intrinsic noise refers to the random variation in chemical reactions or gene expression, while extrinsic noise refers to fluctuations caused by external factors. For systems with a large number of molecules, deterministic approximations are often sufficient, but for systems with a small number of molecules, stochastic treatment is necessary. Intrinsic noise can lead to unexpected behavior and is studied using the chemical master equation approach. The stochastic simulation algorithm known as the Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate the chemical master equation. Noise, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, is typically seen as a disturbance, but in non-linear systems, it can actually enhance output regularity. This paper explores two types of noise-driven phenomena, periodic and aperiodic stochastic resonance, in a chemical system known as the Brusselator. The Brusselator undergoes a bifurcation, and the response of the system shows maximum regularity when an optimum level of noise is present. The study also examines the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic noise and explores the phenomenon of coherence resonance. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effect of intrinsic noise on the behavior of a chemical system and provides insight into", "This article discusses the construction of embedded minimal surfaces using gluing techniques and singular perturbation methods. The authors focus on constructing surfaces by desingularizing a collection of Cliffod tori that intersect along certain circles. The symmetry groups of these configurations are also discussed, and the authors provide a detailed description and characterization of the Clifford tori. The article concludes by introducing a set of data that controls the alignment of the towers and discusses how these data affect the congruence of the initial surfaces.", "The Peccei-Quinn symmetry is a solution to the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. This symmetry is broken at an energy scale that gives rise to the formation of a light pseudo-scalar particle called the \"axion\". The mass of axions and the energy scale are related. Astrophysical and cosmological arguments have constrained the mass of axions to a certain range. White dwarfs, which are the final evolutionary phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars, can be used to study the properties of axions. The cooling process of white dwarfs is well understood and can be described by a gravothermal process. The luminosity function of white dwarfs, which is the number of white dwarfs per unit volume and magnitude, can be used to study the evolutionary properties of white dwarfs. By studying the luminosity function, the existence of axions can be tested. The emission of axions would affect the luminosity function, and based on observations, the mass of axions has been constrained to be around 5 meV. These results are consistent with other constraints on the mass of axions. Further observational and theoretical efforts are needed to improve the determination of the mass of axions and to study the influence of axions on the lumin", "The text discusses the Chinese Rings puzzle and its mathematical aspects. The puzzle involves taking a ring off a rope that is tangled with the rigid part of the puzzle. The author aims to prove that a specific solution to the puzzle is the simplest possible. They also explore the topological properties of the puzzle and its connection to low-dimensional topology. The paper mentions the role of knot theory and the possibility of using new techniques to understand the topology of graph embeddings. The author also introduces the concept of Habiro moves and their connection to the Chinese Rings puzzle. The text concludes by discussing more advanced versions of the puzzle and their relationship to algebraic constructions like the Kauffman bracket skein module.", "The text discusses the theoretical descriptions of four-point correlation functions that quantify dynamic heterogeneity in liquids approaching the glass transition. It introduces the concept of three-point susceptibilities and derives equations of motion for these susceptibilities within the mode-coupling approximation. The text then presents numerical solutions for these equations and compares the time and wave-vector dependence of the density derivatives of the collective and self-intermediate scattering functions. It concludes by discussing the wave-vector dependence of dynamic heterogeneities and the connection to four-point correlation functions. The results show that there is no finite intrinsic wave vector at which dynamic heterogeneities are the largest. The findings are compared to previous simulations and theories, and the implications of the results are discussed.", "The Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity describes the behavior of superconducting materials in the presence of a magnetic field. In this paper, the authors consider a one-dimensional superconducting sample with a Ginzburg-Landau parameter and study the phenomenon of the loss of superconductivity when the sample is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. They prove that for large values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, there is a critical field strength such that if the magnetic field is larger than this critical value, the sample will be in its normal state, i.e., superconductivity is lost. They show that in certain geometric settings, such as annuli, the loss of superconductivity is not a monotone transition but rather exhibits an oscillatory behavior. They also consider the question of whether this oscillatory effect can be observed in domains without topology and show that, in general, it is not possible for a uniform magnetic field. However, they provide counterexamples to show that the oscillatory effect can occur for more general magnetic fields. The authors also investigate the energy functional of the Ginzburg-Landau theory and its minimizers, and they provide a rigorous analysis of the behavior of the lowest eigenvalue of the Schrodinger operator", "The microwave electrodynamic response in high-temperature superconductors (HTCs) is a valuable tool for studying these materials and addressing both fundamental physics and technological applications. By applying a static magnetic field, HTCs in the mixed state allow for the disclosure of additional physics related to vortices. Vortices, which dissipate energy through quasi-particle excitations, can be used to probe both normal-state and superconducting properties. This paper presents microwave characterization and study of DyBa2Cu3O7 (DyBCO) monodomains and compares the data with YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) single crystals and YBCO epitaxial thin films. The authors measure the surface impedance using two different resonators and investigate vortex dissipation and pinning mechanisms. They find that the viscosities of the different re-Ba2Cu3O7 systems exhibit similar values and temperature dependencies, indicating the same fundamental physics of quasiparticles in the mixed state. However, in one DyBCO sample with significant disorder on the nanoscale, the vortex viscosity is smaller than in the other samples. The authors conclude that microwave techniques provide important and complementary information for studying HTCs.", "The paper investigates a non-eruptive solar flare that occurred on June 12, 2014, and analyzes various observations of the solar atmosphere during the flare. The authors find evidence of magnetic reconnection and energy release in the form of a dynamic jet in the chromosphere near the magnetic field polarity inversion line (PIL). They also observe plasma flows, electric currents, and changes in the magnetic field during the flare. The authors suggest that the primary energy release occurs in the dense chromosphere near the PIL and is associated with strong electric currents and magnetic fields. They propose a model where two interacting magnetic flux tubes with a current sheet elongated along the PIL trigger the reconnection process. The observations support the idea that large-scale processes in solar flares, such as ribbon formation and hot loop generation, are connected to the small-scale energy release near the PIL.", "The field of quantum computation and information is developing rapidly, with proposals for constructing quantum computers using various techniques such as optical, ion-trap, and solid-state quantum computers. Among these, solid-state quantum computers are considered the most promising. This paper compares two types of quantum computers: optical quantum computers and solid-state quantum computers. The history and limitations of optical quantum computers are discussed, leading to the proposal of using solid-state quantum computers based on rds crystals. The technical requirements for constructing and operating quantum computers are examined, including the need for qubits, the preparation of initial spin states, isolation from the environment, unitary transformations for implementing quantum algorithms, and quantum measurements. Two proposals for constructing optical quantum computers based on linear and nonlinear optics are presented, with the advantages of using nonlinear crystals. However, it is argued that solid-state quantum computers based on rds crystals are more realistic and practical due to requiring fewer components and having less quantum noise.", "The paper discusses a class of models that generate random diagrams consisting of triangles and multiple hinges. The models are characterized by semisimple associative algebras and tensors. The paper shows that by introducing a color structure and taking an appropriate limit of parameters, it is possible to single out the diagrams that represent tetrahedral decompositions of three-dimensional manifolds. The paper also introduces a novel strong-weak duality in the models and investigates how the models depend on the group structure of the defining associative algebras. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for further study of the models, including topology summation, the continuum limit, and the introduction of matters to the models.", "The stress fluctuation formalism is a convenient way to calculate the elastic properties of solid materials. It involves the mean-square fluctuations of the stress tensor, which can be used to determine the shear modulus and compression modulus. The formalism has been widely used in computer simulations and has been generalized to various systems and potentials. The non-affine displacements, which quantify the deviations from affine deformation, are particularly prominent in polymers and amorphous solids. In systems at high temperatures, the shear modulus should vanish, while in deeply quenched glasses, the shear modulus should be constant. The stress fluctuation formula is applicable in different ensembles, but impulsive corrections need to be taken into account for truncated potentials. The shear modulus and stress fluctuations can be determined using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. In the low-temperature limit, the shear modulus approaches a finite asymptotic value and the stress fluctuations increase monotonically with time.", "The paper discusses the study of three-dimensional maps defined by certain parameters. These maps are a generalization of the well-known two-dimensional hnon map. The paper focuses on several properties of the maps, including their dynamics and the existence of wild-hyperbolic strange attractors. It also explores their origination in homoclinic bifurcations and their structure as members of the family of three-dimensional quadratic maps with constant jacobian. The paper emphasizes the importance of studying three-dimensional maps, as they can exhibit dynamics that are different from lower-dimensional cases and can have new types of attractors. The paper also discusses the distinction between stable and unstable attractors, introduces the concept of wild-hyperbolic attractors and their detection in concrete models, and explores the difference between chaotic attractors and quasi-attractors. The paper concludes by discussing the normal forms and structures of quadratic maps and highlighting open problems in the field.", "Clusters of galaxies have a higher number of low-luminosity galaxies compared to brighter systems. This results in a steeper faint-end power-law and Schechter function slopes in the cluster luminosity function (LF). The LF of clusters can be altered by galaxy evolutionary effects, such as merging events. However, low-mass galaxies are usually spared from merging due to their low mass. Recent observational results suggest that a significant fraction of low-mass cluster galaxies were not part of the initial cluster LF but were formed later through the dynamical stripping of higher mass galaxies. These stripped galaxies have different properties compared to low-mass galaxies that originally formed with the cluster. The presence of stripped galaxies steepens the LF of clusters, suggesting that cluster processes can alter the LF. Simulations show that the LF becomes steeper as galaxies undergo mass loss through high-speed interactions. It is suggested that these stripped galaxies are responsible for the observed steepening of the LF in clusters.", "The paper reports on the optical follow-up observations of GRB 070518 and analyzes its light curves in both the optical and X-ray bands. The burst is classified as an optically dim burst based on its low optical luminosity at 12 hours in the rest frame. The study compared GRB 070518 with three other optically dim bursts and found several similarities. The extinction in the host galaxy of GRB 070518 is estimated to be low, suggesting that extinction may not be the primary cause of its optically dim luminosity. The study also examined the spectral indices of GRB 070518 and found that it may be a dark burst or a gray burst. Overall, the study provides insights into the properties of optically dim bursts and their possible origins.", "This text discusses the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), particularly the color superconducting phases that are expected to occur at high density and low temperature. The text explains that color superconductivity is driven by the BCS mechanism, which occurs when there is an attractive interaction between fermions at a Fermi surface. The text also explores the different pairing patterns and the effects of the strange quark mass on the pairing. The text mentions that color superconducting quark matter may exist in the cold dense cores of compact stars, and discusses some of the observable properties of color superconducting quark matter in compact stars. The text concludes by discussing the effect of quark pairing on the mass-radius relationship of compact stars and the potential signatures of quark matter in astrophysical observations.", "Global constraints are an important part of constraint toolkits as they allow users to model common patterns and use efficient propagation algorithms to reason about them. One approach to implementing global constraints is to decompose them into sets of primitive constraints that do not hinder propagation. This allows for the use of SAT solvers and techniques like clause learning and backjumping. Many decompositions for a wide range of global constraints have been proposed, and some global constraints can be effectively propagated using simple encodings. Circuit complexity can be used to determine which global constraints can be effectively propagated using simple encodings. It has been shown that there is a polynomial-sized decomposition of a constraint propagator into conjunctive normal form (CNF) if and only if the propagator can be computed by a polynomial-sized monotone boolean circuit. This means that bounds on the size of monotone boolean circuits give bounds on the size of decompositions of global constraints into CNF. The tools of circuit complexity can be useful in understanding the limits of what can be achieved with decompositions.", "The text discusses compton scattering in quasi-spherical accretion flows, specifically focusing on its role in the x-ray spectra of accreting compact objects. It describes the importance of compton scattering in different astrophysical scenarios, such as weakly-magnetic accreting neutron stars and advection-dominated accretion flows onto black holes. The text then discusses the mathematical formulation of compton scattering in static and moving media, and presents two different approaches for solving the radiative transfer equation. It also summarizes the derivation of the photon kinetic or radiative transfer equation and their moments for compton scattering in various contexts. Finally, it presents a numerical algorithm for solving the radiative transfer equation in systems with spherical symmetry and discusses the results of numerical solutions for different scenarios.", "The paper discusses the concept of an abelian cover, which is a finite morphism of varieties that is the quotient map for a generically faithful action of a finite abelian group. The paper extends the theory of abelian covers to the case of singular varieties, allowing for applications in moduli theory. The paper provides a comprehensive treatment of abelian covers in the case of smooth base and normal cover, as well as the case of non-normal base. The paper also studies the singularities of the covers and determines conditions for log canonical and semi-log canonical singularities. It also classifies special cases when the group is Z2 and the base is smooth or has two smooth branches meeting transversally. The paper concludes with examples and applications of the theory.", "This text discusses the formation and evolution of galaxies and their disks. The text mentions that baryons accrete and settle to the centers of dark matter halos, and that gas with angular momentum forms a disk with high surface densities. Various processes like shocks and star formation can occur within these disks, and stellar feedback and other factors can inhibit star formation. The text notes that the disks of galaxies provide information about their star formation history and the underlying dark matter potential. The text also mentions that disks can be observed using the 21 cm line with radio telescopes, but this is not possible at high redshifts. Instead, gas can be observed through electronic transitions using quasars as background sources. The text reports on a survey of quasar spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 5, and presents results on the column density distribution, covering fraction, and mass density of disks. The text shows that the shape of the column density distribution does not evolve with redshift, and that the covering fraction and mass density decrease sharply from redshift 6 to 2. The text considers various explanations for this decline, including in situ star formation and feedback processes, and concludes that the decline is likely due to feedback processes removing gas from galaxies.", "It has been suggested that the neutrino-nucleon cross section could be enhanced by new physics beyond the electroweak scale. Neutrinos at ultra-high energies (UHE) may acquire cross sections approaching hadronic levels, allowing them to initiate air showers. This has important implications for both neutrino astronomy and high energy physics. Two major possibilities have been discussed in the literature for enhancing the cross section: the introduction of a broken SU(3) gauge symmetry and the possibility of additional large compact dimensions. Experimental verification through shower development altitude statistics is possible. The mean free path for UHE neutrinos is on the order of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers in air, allowing them to reach Earth unimpeded from arbitrarily great distances. This is important for the study of cosmic rays. Current experiments, such as AGASA and the Pierre Auger observatory, are able to detect extensive air showers and put constraints on the UHE neutrino flux incident on Earth. Future experiments, such as the Japanese Telescope Array, the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the Owl space-based experiment, will improve the current bounds. The detection of nearly horizontal air showers provides a direct measurement of the UHE neutrino flux and places limits on the neutrino-nucleon cross section. In the", "The consensus problem and its mechanisms are of interest in various disciplines, including political science, sociology, and statistical physics. In consensus formation models, it is assumed that individuals can possess different states that can change over time. Statistical physicists have analyzed a variety of models to study consensus formation, including the voter model, majority rule models, and the bounded confidence model.\n\nOne major mechanism that can lead to consensus in a population is the preference for the majority. Previous research has shown that different languages can stably coexist in models of language competition. The coexistence of languages can be achieved through spatial segregation, the introduction of bilingual individuals, or by manipulating the attractiveness of languages.\n\nIn this study, the authors extend a model of language competition to examine the case of competition among a general number of languages. They show that the behavior of the model is different depending on the relative strength of the majority preference and the minority aversion. In particular, the coexistence of different states and the consensus can be multistable only when there is some minority aversion present.\n\nThe authors also analyze the stability of various equilibria in the model and find that the consensus equilibria are stable only under certain conditions. They show that the introduction of the minority aversion can facilitate the multistability of", "Evolutionary game theory divides games into two categories: pairwise interactions and group interactions. Pairwise interactions include games like the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Snowdrift Game, while group interactions are exemplified by the Public Goods Game. In pairwise interactions, actions can be easily reciprocated or punished, but in group interactions, keeping track of other players' actions is more difficult. The central theme of evolutionary game theory is the successful evolution of cooperation, which challenges the idea that individuals are inherently selfish. The successful evolution of cooperation can be promoted through the introduction of additional strategies, such as peer punishment or rewarding cooperative players. Heterogeneities amongst players, such as their network structure or likelihood of adopting different strategies, can also play a crucial role in the evolution of cooperation. However, recent research suggests that strongly heterogeneous states may not be as effective at promoting cooperation in games governed by group interactions compared to moderately heterogeneous states. The specific interaction graph, such as a square lattice, triangular lattice, or random regular graph, also plays a less prominent role in promoting cooperation in group interactions compared to pairwise interactions. Overall, the transition from pairwise to group interactions has important implications for the successful evolution of cooperation.", "This paper presents the results of imaging polarimetry of the OMC-3 region in the Orion complex, which is a star-forming region undergoing massive star formation. The data, obtained using the new imaging polarimeter at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), reveal a highly ordered polarization pattern along the filament. The inferred magnetic field direction is predominantly perpendicular to the filament, except in the southernmost part of OMC-3 where it diverges slightly. The outflows observed in OMC-3 are not aligned with either the ambient field or the filament. The mean percentage polarization is 4.2%, with a dispersion of 1%. A depolarization effect is observed towards the denser parts of the filament. The authors suggest that the magnetic field of the filament alone does not determine the configuration of the protostellar systems embedded within it.", "The text discusses zero-temperature quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in many-body systems with competing ground states. First-order QPTs, which occur in systems such as quantum hall samples, itinerant ferromagnets, and heavy fermion metals, are of particular interest. The size dependence of the finite-size scaling (FSS) at first-order QPTs is sensitive to boundary conditions. The text presents general ansatzes for the FSS at first-order QPTs driven by a generic parameter. The FSS ansatzes are confirmed through numerical analysis of quantum Potts chains, which undergo first-order QPTs for a sufficiently large number of states. The analysis includes different boundary conditions and shows evidence of FSS behaviors. The authors also discuss the FSS behavior at first-order QPTs driven by magnetic fields, such as in the Ising chain. The paper provides insights into the finite-size properties of first-order QPTs and their sensitivity to boundary conditions, which are important for interpreting experimental or numerical data.", "The measurement of the flavor non-singlet structure function in deep inelastic scattering experiments on muon-proton and muon-deuterium performed by the NMC collaboration showed an excess of sea down quarks compared to sea up quarks in the free proton. This result was confirmed by the E866/NuSea experiment, which measured the difference directly using Drell-Yan production in proton-proton and proton-deuteron collisions. These results contradict the predictions of perturbative QCD, indicating that non-perturbative effects are responsible for creating flavor asymmetry in the light sea quarks. The excess of down quarks over up quarks was anticipated based on the chiral structure of QCD. The nature of hadronic structure in QCD and the contribution of non-perturbative effects were investigated using various models. The analysis of deep inelastic scattering on nuclear targets demonstrated that nuclear shadowing and antishadowing modify the properties of the nucleons. The nuclear shadowing correction to the structure functions of helium-3 and hydrogen was estimated, and predictions were made for the Gottfried integral for the helium-3-hydrogen system. The calculations showed that nuclear shadowing increases the Gottfried integral by about 4%, indicating that the integral is", "There is current interest in studying inverse transitions, such as melting or freezing, where the ordered phase is more entropic than the disordered phase. This phenomenon has become more interesting because it has been observed in various physical systems, including magnetic films and high-temperature superconductors. The Blume Capel and Gathak-Sherrington models have been proposed as classical magnetic models to study these inverse transitions. The Blume Capel model displays inverse melting, but only when a specific parameter is imposed. On the other hand, the Gathak-Sherrington model naturally exhibits inverse freezing, without the need for any specific conditions. It is believed that the presence of non-trivial randomness, or frustration, is the key ingredient that allows for inverse freezing. It is still unclear what role frustration plays in the production of inverse freezing and whether models with trivial randomness can also exhibit inverse transitions. In this work, the authors investigate the role of frustration in producing inverse freezing by studying the Hopfield Fermionic Ising Spin Glass (HFISG) model. They show that frustration is necessary to produce inverse freezing and that the level of frustration affects the range and robustness of the inverse freezing.", "The study focuses on the effects of Hall current on the steady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) free-convective flow and mass transfer over a stretching sheet in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. The researchers use a similarity transformation to transform the boundary layer equations into a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, which are then solved numerically using finite difference technique. The results show that the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles are affected by the magnetic and Hall parameters. The skin-friction coefficient, rate of heat transfer, and rate of mass transfer at the sheet also vary with these parameters. The study concludes that the Hall current parameter has a significant impact on the flow characteristics and heat and mass transfer rates.", "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is about to probe the physics of the TeV scale, with the hope of discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model and shedding light on electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter. The LHC detectors are designed to accurately detect various \"physics objects\" such as hard leptons, photons, and jets, in addition to missing transverse energy. In the search for new physics, researchers typically look for an excess of events with specific combinations of these physics objects. In addition to the standard physics objects, unconventional signals, such as highly displaced vertices and stopped stable gluinos, can provide valuable information about new physics at the TeV scale. In this paper, the authors propose a new observable physics object at colliders called an anomalous underlying event, which refers to everything in an event that is not the outgoing hard jets or leptons. They suggest that studying the characteristics of the underlying event can be a valuable tool for improving Monte Carlo event generators and for searching for new physics. They describe a search strategy for discovering anomalous underlying events and propose a specific example of a model involving quirks to demonstrate the strategy. The authors also discuss other possible scenarios and emphasize the importance of underlying event studies in conjunction with traditional searches for new physics.", "Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are systems in which a low mass star transfers matter to either a low magnetic field neutron star or a black hole. These systems produce observable properties in X-rays. This paper reports on Chandra observations of eight candidate LMXBs. The accurate locations derived from these observations will enable follow up observations in the infrared/optical. The paper provides a summary of previous observations for each candidate and presents the results of the Chandra observations. The energy spectra and fluxes measured for the detected sources are consistent with previous measurements, suggesting that these sources are persistent. The three undetected sources have shown previous transient behavior.", "The mechanism responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in the superconducting (sc) cuprates remains controversial. In this study, the authors investigate the normal, non-superconducting state of the electron-doped cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4 (NCCO) to gain insights into the nature of superconductivity in these materials. They use high-field magnetotransport measurements on high-quality NCCO crystals to locate two critical doping levels in the normal-state phase diagram. The first critical doping level is associated with a small magnetic breakdown gap separating hole and electron Fermi pockets, while the second critical doping level is associated with the emergence of a large energy gap right below the optimal doping level. Both gaps mimic the doping dependence of the superconducting critical temperature, extrapolating to zero at characteristic doping levels. The authors suggest that the first critical point corresponds to a Fermi surface reconstruction associated with a superlattice potential, while the second critical point may be related to the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism. Their findings highlight the importance of Fermi surface transformations for superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates.", "Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a growth method that is used to fabricate multilayer thin films. In PLD, a target material is ablated by a pulsed laser and then deposited on a substrate in pulses. PLD differs from ordinary molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in that in MBE, atoms are deposited continuously. PLD has been observed to lead to smoother surfaces than MBE in some cases. However, there is still much that is not understood about PLD, including the mechanism that leads to smoother surfaces, the growth quality for different materials and growth parameters, and the effect of ehrlich-schwoebel barriers. In this study, a simple model of PLD is investigated to improve the understanding of the growth morphology for different growth parameters. The results show that the growth behavior of PLD is influenced by the pulse intensity, the diffusion constant, and the incoming particle flux density. For low intensities, the growth behavior of PLD is similar to MBE, but as the intensity increases, the growth morphology of PLD becomes significantly different from MBE. The results also show that the second layer nucleation probability in PLD increases with increasing intensity, leading to the enhancement of the villain instability. However,", "The Skyrme model is a nonlinear field theory that describes baryons as localized solutions called skyrmions. It is an effective theory of low-energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and has been successful in describing the properties of baryons. The model can be generalized to different groups, such as SU(2) and SU(3), and can be quantized using the collective coordinate formalism. The canonical quantization of the model leads to quantum mass corrections that restore the stability of the solitons. However, the semiclassical quantization of the SU(3) Skyrme model has shortcomings and does not accurately describe the experimental mass spectrum of baryons. The quantum mass corrections are representation-dependent and play a crucial role in ensuring the stability of the quantum solitons in the SU(3) Skyrme model. The stability of the solitons is obtained by solving the variational equation numerically, and the resulting mass spectrum is in good agreement with experimental values. The quantum approach to the model improves the agreement with experimental data compared to the semiclassical approach. The symmetry breaking term is necessary for discriminating between states with different quantum numbers and must be included in the model. Overall, the quantum SU(3) Skyrme model provides a", "The theory of relativity, introduced by Einstein in 1905, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the world. It proposes that the laws of physics should be the same in any two reference systems that are moving relative to each other at a constant velocity. This led to the conclusion that time and space are interconnected and that their measurements depend on the reference system. The Lorentz transformation equations were developed to describe the relationship between coordinates in different reference systems, with the speed of light as a constant factor. One consequence of relativity is the dilatation of time, which means that moving clocks appear to run slower when observed from a stationary reference system. This is often illustrated using the \"twin paradox\" scenario, where one twin travels in a spaceship at high speeds and ages less than their twin on Earth. However, this interpretation of the twin paradox is incorrect. The authors argue that the flaw lies in comparing time intervals measured in different reference systems and not taking into account the change in the reference system at the point of return. They show how the proper time interval, which is invariant under Lorentz transformations, should be used instead. They also discuss other effects of relativity, such as the red shift of light from moving sources and the implications for our", "The paper discusses the behavior of a kink solution in a scalar field model under perturbations. The model is non-integrable and has been used to study physical systems in various branches of physics. The kink solution is topologically stable and indestructible. After a collision with an antikink, a breather solution appears, which is an unstable oscillatory solution with long-time existence. The paper aims to study how extra energy from perturbations is dissipated in the kink solution. Different behaviors are observed depending on the amplitude and width of the perturbation. When the amplitude is small, the perturbations are transformed into radiation. Beyond a threshold energy, oscillons, kink-antikink pairs, and structures can be created. The paper explores different parameters of perturbation and shows the different outcomes in the parameter space. The authors used a finite difference scheme to solve the differential equation. The paper emphasizes the nonlinear character of the field equation and the need for precautions in handling large perturbations. The work was supported by FAPESP and CNPq. References to related works are provided at the end of the paper.", "Resonances are a phenomenon that occurs often in physics and can be understood heuristically. There are two main definitions of resonances: resolvent resonances and scattering resonances. Quantum graphs provide a good background for studying resonances. The pseudo orbit expansion is a powerful tool for finding the resonance condition. The paper investigates resonance asymptotics on non-compact quantum graphs, focusing on several simple examples with standard coupling. The effective size of equilateral graphs is also discussed. The resonance condition is derived using the method of pseudo orbit expansion. The paper concludes with examples of non-Weyl graphs and their resonance conditions.", "Cosmic ray interactions at ultra-high energies provide insights into particle collisions at energies greater than 100 TeV. These cosmic rays can only be detected indirectly through the air showers they induce in the atmosphere, so simulations are needed to determine the mass and energy of the primary cosmic rays. Muons produced in these interactions are a tracer of high-energy hadronic interactions and can indicate the primary composition. The aim of this work is to determine the number of muons in air showers detected by the Auger observatory using air shower universality. This concept states that the average properties of air showers can be characterized by the primary energy, stage of shower evolution, and overall muon normalization. By using independent methods, the muon density at ground can be determined, which allows for a direct test of the predictions of hadronic interaction models. The study found that the number of muons measured in the data is larger than predicted for proton showers and even larger than predicted for iron showers. This discrepancy suggests a deficiency in the predictions of hadronic models for the number of muons produced in air showers.", "The study focuses on the problem of mitigating the resonant vibrations of nonlinear structures using nonlinear vibration absorbers. The performance of existing absorbers is known to be sensitive to motion amplitude. The authors propose a new absorber called the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber (NLTVA), which is tuned according to the nonlinear restoring force of the host structure. They develop a nonlinear generalization of Den Hartog's equal-peak method to determine the parameters of the NLTVA. The performance of the NLTVA is assessed using a duffing oscillator as the host system. The results show that the NLTVA can effectively mitigate the vibrations of the nonlinear resonance in a wide range of motion amplitudes. The NLTVA is compared to the linear tuned vibration absorber (LTVA), and it is found that the NLTVA outperforms the LTVA in terms of vibration suppression. The study also investigates the presence of other dynamical instabilities, such as detached resonance curves and quasiperiodic solutions. Overall, the NLTVA is shown to be a promising solution for mitigating vibrations in nonlinear structures.", "This paper presents a cosmological scenario based on hidden sector gauge symmetry in a five-dimensional orbifold. The model is minimal, using the minimal non-abelian gauge group and the simplest orbifold compactification. The inflaton field is a built-in ingredient of the theory and is free from quantum gravitational effects. The model predicts the observable quantities such as the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and the spectral index that are in good agreement with current observations. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio is close to the sensitivity of future cosmological experiments. The reheating temperature is estimated to be high enough to follow the standard hot Big Bang evolution.", "Glueballs, which are composed of pure gluons, have been studied extensively since the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) was established. Various methods have been used to estimate the properties of glueballs, including model analyses, lattice QCD simulations, and QCD sum rule calculations. The mass of the lowest scalar glueball has been predicted to be between 1.3 to 1.7 GeV in lattice QCD simulations. Different scalar resonances, such as f0(1370) and f0(1500), have been proposed as the lightest scalar glueball, but there is still debate about their compositions. The QCD sum rule approach has yielded different predictions for the mass of the scalar glueball, with some results in the range of a few MeV and others in the range of several GeV. The discrepancy between subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules has been a long-standing issue. Recent studies have suggested that instantons, which are localized regions of the QCD vacuum, may play a role in the properties of the scalar glueball. The instanton liquid model of the QCD vacuum and lattice simulations have found a significant instanton contribution to the QCD sum rules for the scalar glueball. However, the early QCD", "Electromagnetic levitation melting (ELM) is a technique that was invented in the 1920s but was only used starting in the 1950s when high-frequency power generators became available. ELM involves the use of a conducting sample, usually metallic, placed in a coil and subjected to an AC current. The AC magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sample, which results in a Lorentz force that repels the sample from the coil and heats it due to the ohmic dissipation. ELM is particularly useful for melting reactive metals with high melting points, as it avoids contamination of the melt. The balance of gravity and electromagnetic forces is essential for successful levitation. Static and dynamic stability of the levitated sample must also be considered. The stability of small amplitude oscillations in arbitrary directions and the spin-up instability are analyzed in this study using analytic techniques. The analysis is applied to an axisymmetric magnetic field produced by coaxial circular current loops. The results show that the position of the sample must be stable with respect to perturbations of sufficiently small amplitude to avoid falling out of the coil or touching it. The paper also discusses the static and dynamic stability of a spherical sample in different configurations of the magnetic field. The results highlight the importance of", "The problem of a single hole in the Holstein-$t$-$J$ model interacting with lattice degrees of freedom has attracted significant attention in the study of high-$T_c$ cuprates. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has revealed a low-energy peak in parent and underdoped compounds that is well described by the Holstein-$t$-$J$ model, but its broadness has been associated with incoherent multi-phonon shake-off processes. This interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions should also be reflected in the optical conductivity spectra. In underdoped cuprates, an ubiquitous mid-infrared (MIR) peak at 5 eV and a weaker peak around 6 eV have been observed. The origin of these features has been attributed to midgap or impurity states, charge/spin stripes, polaronic excitations, and the interaction with the antiferromagnetic background. The optical conductivity of the Holstein-$t$-$J$ model in the presence of lattice degrees of freedom has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents results for the optical conductivity of a single hole in the Holstein-$t$-$J$ model obtained using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT", "In this article, the authors analyze the dynamics of the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), which is a model of interacting particle processes. They focus on the problem of the diffusion of a tagged particle in the ASEP and investigate how initial conditions and the exclusion effect affect the diffusion property. They find that the scaling exponent of the diffusion depends on the initial conditions, and they identify anomalous diffusion in certain cases. They also find that the dynamics of the tagged particle can be described by the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. The authors analyze the multi-time distribution of position fluctuations of the tagged particle and express it as a Fredholm determinant. They discuss the scaling limit of the distribution function and find that it is related to the largest eigenvalue distribution in the random matrix theory. The authors also consider the case where defect particles are present and find that the diffusion properties change depending on the presence of these defect particles. They calculate the distribution functions for different initial conditions and find that they are related to different eigenvalue distributions in random matrix theory. Overall, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the ASEP and its relationship to random matrix theory.", "The authors propose that the electromagnetic signal from a source located in front of a black hole may be enhanced by the influence of strong gravitational lensing, which they call the retro-lensing effect. They discuss this effect in the context of a stellar-mass black hole illuminated by light from the sun and returning the ring of light back towards the observer. They also mention that this effect can be applied to other sources containing a radiation source close to the black hole horizon at perfect alignment with the observer's direction. The authors mention that the retro-lensing images are formed by photon rays that make a 180-degree turn just above the black hole photon circular orbit. They discuss that these images may have a weak signal but can be more noticeable in favorable geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, they mention that these higher-order images experience a characteristic time delay, which can help reveal the strong gravitational field signatures in the system. The authors emphasize that characterizing time delays together with polarization information can provide more confident constraints on the model parameters compared to photometric light-curves alone. They also mention that if the source of light is rapidly falling towards the black hole, the retro-lensing signal becomes enhanced compared to the primary signal. The authors discuss the influence of the radiation field on the motion of a cloud of particles", "Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by the same engine - the accretion of matter onto a super-massive black hole through an accretion disk. Different observational techniques, such as studying x-ray properties and optical linear polarimetry, are used to understand what kind of matter fuels the engine and how it is distributed. One study focused on soft x-ray selected AGN and found that those with steep x-ray spectra tend to have relatively narrow emission lines, weak narrow line region (NLR) emission lines, and strong FeII emission. The study proposed two hypotheses to explain the narrowness of the emission lines: the systems are seen at high inclination or the narrower lines result from a lower mass black hole. The former hypothesis predicts scattering polarization, while the latter predicts zero polarization. The study found that most AGN show no or low degrees of polarization, indicating a direct view to the nucleus. However, the highly polarized AGN are the ones with high Balmer decrements and reddened optical continua, suggesting they are affected by dust. The study also found warm absorber features in the x-ray spectra of the highly polarized AGN. Spectropolarimetry observations revealed that the broad lines are slightly more polarized", "Gauge theories in three dimensions have solitonic disorder operators that affect physics at long distances. One example is the confinement of monopoles in a pure gauge theory. The understanding of these disorder operators in theories without supersymmetry is difficult. Recent progress has been made in studying Chern-Simons theories coupled to matter, and it is now possible to compute the scaling dimensions of disorder operators in these theories. The lowest-dimension disorder operators with units of magnetic flux have a dimension proportional to the regulated Chern-Simons level, and this result is valid at all couplings. The study of disorder operators and their mappings to other operators in supersymmetric and bosonic theories remains an open question.", "Ultra luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are extragalactic, point-like, off-nuclear X-ray sources with observed X-ray luminosities higher than the Eddington luminosity for accretion onto a 10^10 solar mass black hole. They are believed to be accreting black hole X-ray binaries with massive donors. The size and origin of the black holes in ULXs are still debated, with possibilities including stellar mass black holes (accreting above the Eddington limit), intermediate mass black holes, and massive stellar remnant black holes formed from the direct collapse of low-metallicity, massive stars. Detailed analysis of the X-ray spectra of ULXs suggests that their environments have sub-solar metallicities. The spectra of ULXs can be well reproduced by a comptonization model plus a soft disc component in which the coronae are always optically thick. The spectral variability of ULXs is complex and may be explained by accretion disc-wind interactions and inclination effects. Further monitoring of ULXs is needed to better understand their spectral variability and metallicity.", "This study presents the first detailed chemical analysis of the globular cluster NGC 6362. The cluster is an intermediate metallicity cluster with a mass of 4 million solar masses. The analysis reveals that NGC 6362 has a bimodal sodium distribution and no significant variations in the abundance of light elements such as magnesium and aluminum. The cluster also shows no internal spread in the abundances of iron-peak elements and displays enhanced abundances of s-process elements. The chemical composition of NGC 6362 is found to be consistent with other globular clusters in the Milky Way with similar mass and metallicity. The study also compares the chemical composition of NGC 6362 with that of another globular cluster, M4, and finds good agreement between the two clusters. Overall, the study concludes that NGC 6362 is a regular globular cluster with a chemical composition representative of other globular clusters in the Milky Way.", "The text discusses the use of radio frequency (srf) cavities in the International Linear Collider (ILC) for high energy physics research. The challenge is to fabricate many state-of-the-art cavities without defects that can lead to a quench of the cavity. One approach to address this is to enhance the RF breakdown field of the superconductor material through novel coatings. The text proposes the use of a magnetic write head probe in a near field microwave microscope to identify defects based on their microwave performance at low temperatures. The text presents experimental results using the magnetic write head probe on superconducting samples, showing that it can generate a nonlinear response from the samples. The probe's nonlinearity can be suppressed by applying a DC current or by using a reference probe for phase cancellation. The text concludes by mentioning the potential application of the microscope to identify defects in Nb materials used in SRB cavities.", "In this paper, the authors study the solutions of the Dirac equation with a kink-like potential. They consider both scalar and vector potentials and examine the scattering and bound state solutions. The authors find that under certain conditions, a special unitary transformation can decouple the upper and lower components of the Dirac spinor, allowing for a simplified analysis of the problem. They also show that when the magnitude of the scalar coupling exceeds the vector coupling, the fermion can be trapped in a highly localized region without the manifestation of Klein's paradox. The authors generalize their results to the case of a smoothed out form of the sign potential and find a finite set of bound state solutions. They show that as one approaches the conditions for the realization of spin and pseudospin symmetries, these bound state solutions disappear. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the solutions of the Dirac equation with vector and scalar potentials and discusses the implications for heavy meson spectra and single-particle energy levels in nuclei.", "Nuclear thermodynamics has been a focus of research in recent years, with temperature-dependent nuclear properties being investigated. One interesting topic is phase transitions in atomic nuclei, including the first order phase transition in the multifragmentation of nuclei and the transition from a phase with strong pairing correlations to a phase with weak pairing correlations. The moment of inertia of nuclei has been found to increase with temperature, correlating with the suppression of pairing correlations. Experimental observations of heat capacity curves and level densities of low-spin states have provided insight into the pairing phase transition. In this study, thermodynamic properties of Fe-56 and Fe-57 isotopes were extracted from nuclear level densities. The self-supporting Fe-56 target was bombarded by a 2-na beam, and the outgoing charged particles and reaction gamma rays were recorded. The level densities were normalized using experimental data from other experiments and compared to model calculations. The average number of broken Cooper pairs and parity distributions as a function of excitation energy were also investigated. The results showed good agreement between experimental and calculated level densities, and step structures were observed in the average number of broken pairs and parity asymmetry plots.", "In this paper, the authors investigate the possibility of simulating curved spacetimes using optomechanical systems in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR) of optomechanics. They propose two types of optomechanical systems: a planar optomechanical microcavity and a two-dimensional array of coupled optomechanical systems. They show that by operating the mechanical oscillator in the RDR and using the optomechanical interaction, it is possible to achieve an effective Kerr-type photon-photon interaction. The authors demonstrate that the phase fluctuation in the photonic fluid can be described by the Klein-Gordon equation for a massless scalar field propagating in a curved spacetime. They also show that the metrics of the corresponding analog spacetimes can be controlled by system parameters. The proposed optomechanical systems offer a way to study the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and can act as quantum simulators for the collective excitations of photonic fluids in curved spacetimes.", "The text discusses the role of molecule-metal contact in using organic molecules as electronic components in nanoscale devices. It highlights the importance of the tunnelling probability in charge injection and the role of the lateral component of the electron wavevector. The text presents density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of phenylthiolate (PT) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on copper (Cu) and gold (Au) substrates. The calculations identify the molecular states closest to the metal Fermi level and their lateral dispersion. The text also discusses the work function change associated with SAM formation and calculates two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectra for comparison with experiments. The calculations suggest that the indirect mechanism contributes most to the 2PPE resonance observed in experiments. Additionally, the text calculates the electrostatic contribution to the work function change and compares it to experimental measurements. The results show good agreement with the experimental values and suggest that the dipole moment of the molecular SAM can be used to predict the work function change of the covered substrate.", "Vector autoregressive (VAR) models play an important role in contemporary macroeconomics. They are a part of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach, which is replacing traditional macroeconometric forecasting methods. VAR models are based on the idea that more recent values of a variable provide more useful information about its future movements. They can capture spatial and temporal structures of multidimensional variables that are often ignored in practice, resulting in more accurate estimation. VAR models are widely used by academia and central banks, such as the European Central Bank's Smets Wouters model for the euro zone. VAR models can be constructed from univariate ARMA processes and can be used to estimate large covariance matrices. Random matrix theory is an efficient tool for appropriately \"cleaning\" these covariance matrices. The mean spectral densities of the Pearson estimators of the cross-covariances for VARMA models can be derived using the free random variable (FRV) calculus. This calculus simplifies calculations and allows for the discovery of higher-order equations. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the calculations. The FRV calculus is a powerful and flexible tool for analyzing multivariate stochastic processes, particularly in the case of large matrix dimensions.", "This study focuses on dynamical properties of neural oscillators subject to quasiperiodic stimulation. The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model is used to investigate the effect of quasiperiodic forcing on the period-doubling route to chaotic oscillation. The study finds that new types of strange nonchaotic (SN) oscillations occur between regular and chaotic oscillations. These SN oscillations exhibit strange fractal geometry and give rise to aperiodic complex spikings, similar to chaotic oscillations. The study identifies various routes to SN oscillations, such as gradual fractalization, collision with a smooth unstable torus, and collision with a nonsmooth ring-shaped unstable set. The study suggests that these SN spikings might be observed in experimental works on the quasiperiodically forced squid giant axon. Overall, this research highlights the importance of investigating the dynamical responses of biological oscillators under quasiperiodic stimuli.", "The text discusses the collisional relaxation of a self-gravitating system in n-dimensional space. The system is described using the Boltzmann equation and the diffusion coefficients are computed using the Fokker-Planck approximation. Theoretical predictions are compared with molecular dynamics simulations and good agreement is found for the evolution of the velocity distribution. The text also explores the validity of the Chandrasekhar approximation and concludes that it provides a reasonable description of the collisional relaxation in the system. Additionally, the text discusses the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the impact parameter and the size of the system. Overall, the study provides insights into the collisional dynamics of self-gravitating systems in n-dimensional space.", "The text discusses the discovery of extrasolar planets and different methods used to detect them, such as the radial velocity technique and planetary transits. It describes a laboratory experiment using observations of the star HD 209458 to infer properties of the planet orbiting it. The experiment introduces concepts like Kepler's laws, orbital mechanics, data handling, and error analysis. The text also mentions the importance of introducing astronomy into the classroom and the limitations and benefits of the experiment. Additionally, it provides references to related articles and papers.", "Classical spin liquids, like the coulomb phase in spin ice, have behavior that is not captured by the standard Landau picture of broken symmetries. They exhibit fractionalization and topological order. In spin ice, fractional excitations called magnetic monopoles act as sources for the physical magnetic field. Transitions between phases where these excitations are confined and deconfined have interesting properties. Spin ice also has topological constraints on the magnetization. The authors investigate confinement phase transitions in spin ice across the full range of magnetization. They introduce a mean-field theory and apply it to a simplified model of classical spin ice, and discuss the phase structure and transitions. The phase structure consists of confined phases with fixed magnetization and a Coulomb phase where the magnetization varies smoothly. The authors argue that the phase structure can be understood by considering the interplay of confinement and flux in the Coulomb phase. They also discuss the prospects for including more realistic perturbations in the mean-field theory.", "This article discusses the correlations between record events in sequences of random variables. It explores various examples of record events, such as athletic records, climatic records, evolutionary biology records, and financial records.

It analyzes the correlations between record events and their dependence on the underlying probability density function. The article also discusses the behavior of correlations as a function of the distance between record events. It provides analytical expressions and numerical simulations to illustrate the different types of correlations observed in different distributions. The article concludes by summarizing the main results and discussing potential applications and open questions in this field of study.", "Experiments at RHIC and LHC show that the quark-gluon plasma is a nearly perfect fluid with small viscous effects. However, at low temperatures and nonzero baryon chemical potentials in the hadron gas phase, viscous effects may be more pronounced. This study investigates the effects of a nonzero shear viscosity relaxation time on wave propagation in relativistic fluids. Nonlinear waves in a hadronic medium can be caused by fluctuations in baryon number or energy density. The presence of a relaxation time coefficient affects the propagation of these waves, and understanding this can provide insight into the behavior of the quark-gluon plasma. The study finds that relaxation time effects are generally small, but can lead to soliton-like behavior in certain conditions. The presence of relaxation time can also lead to walls forming ahead of the pulse in some cases, while in others it can cause an increase in the amplitude of the pulse. The study also highlights the importance of considering small spatial gradients when studying wave propagation in hydrodynamics, as large gradients can lead to instabilities and unphysical solutions.", "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has provided valuable data for studying the properties of resolved stellar populations. By analyzing color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of stars, constraints can be made on distance, age, and metallicity. The CMD fitting analysis uses theoretical isochrones to compare with observed CMDs and find the best-fitting model. This analysis has been applied to SDSS data of globular clusters and nearby stellar systems to constrain their population parameters. The SDSS data has also led to the discovery of previously unknown faint local group members. The cold dark matter (CDM) theory predicts an abundance of subhaloes around Milky Way-type galaxies, but the observed number of satellites is lower than predicted. Further discoveries of satellite galaxies are to be expected. Additionally, studying the stellar populations of satellite galaxies can provide important constraints for galaxy formation and CDM theory. This paper adapts CMD-fitting software for use on SDSS data and applies it to the newly discovered Milky Way satellites. The software produces uniform analyses of these objects and constrains their population parameters. The SDSS data is of high quality, complete to a certain magnitude and accurate in terms of astrometry and photometry. CMD fitting can also be used to detect faint stellar overdensities in", "Modelling and forecasting electricity loads is a well-known problem in both the academic and applied statistics community. Various approaches have been used, including univariate time series models, non-parametric approaches, and models that incorporate exogenous variables such as temperature. Seasonalities and weekly and daily patterns are often present, leading to accurate models. The use of informative hierarchical priors can improve the estimation and prediction of these models, particularly when data is limited. The approach involves using a long dataset with similar features to inform the prior distribution for a shorter dataset. The method is shown to be effective in simulation experiments and when applied to French electricity datasets. The results demonstrate the benefits of using informative priors, particularly in cases where data is scarce. The study also highlights the importance of including exogenous variables, such as temperature, in electricity load forecasting models.", "This text discusses the use of the microlensing technique in the search for extrasolar planets. The first part of the text provides background information on the detection of extrasolar planets and the need to determine the abundance of planets similar to our own solar system. Microlensing is described as a method where a massive object passes near a background star, causing a change in brightness that can reveal the presence of a planet. The text explains how the presence of a planet can be detected through the disruption of the symmetric light curve produced by a single lens. It also explains the importance of high magnification events for the detection of small mass planets. The text mentions several specific microlensing events that have shown potential anomalies that could be caused by planets, but notes that no clear planetary detections have been made so far. The text also discusses the characterization of microlensing events and the challenges involved in detecting and characterizing Earth-mass planets. Finally, the text mentions ongoing efforts to improve microlensing techniques and the potential for future discoveries.", "The determination of the mass content of galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (DSphs) are particularly interesting because they are dark matter-dominated objects. However, it is still unclear whether DSphs have cusped or cored dark matter profiles. Traditional methods for determining the mass of DSphs, such as a Jeans analysis, are subject to degeneracies. Recent observations have shown that DSphs can have multiple stellar populations with distinct properties. In this study, the authors determine the mass content of the Sculptor DSph by considering it as two stellar components embedded in an extended dark matter halo. They find that a cored profile is favored over a cusped profile, and the total mass of Sculptor is larger than typical for other DSphs. However, there is no indication of a common mass scale among the DSphs in the local group.", "The text discusses the diffusion of particles in a narrow channel and the effects of repulsive interaction among particles. It proposes a generalization of the Fick-Jacobs equation to take into account the interaction. The text also describes the derivation of the diffusion equation and the Fokker-Planck equation for interacting particles. The accuracy of the equations is tested using numerical simulations in symmetric and asymmetric cavities. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and numerical results, even for large forces. The text concludes by discussing the implications of the results and further applications of the equations.", "Superclusters are the largest structures in the universe, ranging from a few times the size of a typical galaxy cluster to the lengths of great walls of galaxies. They have proven difficult to study due to their large size. Observational methods have been used to identify superclusters, and recent progress in observations and computational simulations have allowed for a better understanding of their properties. Superclusters are found to be triaxial in shape and have a multiplicity-size relation. Their abundance decreases with increasing redshift, and the largest superclusters are present at early times. Superclusters selected using higher mass clusters show similar properties, but with reduced amplitude. Overall, these results provide predictions for future observations and test the validity of the cosmological model.", "Vy Canis Majoris (Vy CMa) is a cool hypergiant star that is undergoing a rapid stage of evolution characterized by high mass loss. It is associated with a complex circumstellar nebula and is ejecting large amounts of gas and dust. The nebula shows evidence of multiple and asymmetric mass loss events, with arcs and loops of material being ejected from different locations on the star. The k i emission line in the ejecta is believed to be due to resonance scattering, although the exact mechanism is not well understood. The velocities of the gas and dust in the nebula suggest the presence of stationary or slow moving material, which is puzzling given the star's strong wind and probable mass loss history. Overall, Vy CMa is a unique and perplexing object, and further observations and modeling are needed to fully understand its nature.", "The spectroscopic technique has been successful in determining the atmospheric parameters of hydrogen-line white dwarfs. By comparing observed and predicted line profiles, important details about the mass distribution, luminosity function, and formation rate of white dwarfs can be revealed. However, the absolute values of these parameters may depend on the physics included in the models. One issue with the current models is the neglect of non-ideal gas effects in the line profile calculations. A proposed solution is to parameterize the critical field used in the non-ideal equation of state to mimic the non-ideal effects in the line opacity. This approach has shown improved internal consistency in the solutions obtained from fitting balmer lines. However, it has no physical basis and may not accurately represent non-ideal effects for different hydrogen states or atmospheric parameters. In this work, the authors provide a framework with no free parameter by improving the physics in the line profile calculations. They include non-ideal effects directly into the model and find that the new line profiles provide improved internal consistency and better agreement with trigonometric parallax measurements. Future work will extend the analysis to a wider range of white dwarf temperatures.", "Tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has received much attention due to its potential applications in magnetic memories, magnetic field sensors, and quantum computing devices. Efforts have been made to increase the TMR ratio, and recent studies have reported a large TMR ratio in Co-Fe/Al-O/Co-Fe junctions. Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSS) have also been investigated as tunnel barriers, as they can produce highly spin-polarized current and high TMR values. However, the cure temperature of FMSS is typically lower than room temperature. Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSS) offer a combination of ferromagnetism and semiconducting properties, making them suitable for spintronic devices. GaMnAs, a type of DMSS, has been studied for its spin-polarized transport phenomena. The paper proposes a theoretical study on spin-polarized transport in GaMnAs/GaAs/GaMnAs tunnel junctions, taking into account the effect of spontaneous magnetization. The authors describe the model, calculate the temperature dependence of the spin splitting energy, and present numerical results on the TMR and spin polarization at different temperatures, barrier", "Graphene, a mono-layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, was first synthesized a decade ago. However, its theoretical investigation had been done long ago, and its unusual properties are due to its Dirac-like band structure. Graphene has been used in applications such as single-electron transistor circuitry and as a conductive material attached to a nanostructure. The transport of charges in graphene-based quantum dots occurs at higher temperatures than in traditional semiconductor dots, and many-body effects like the Kondo effect can be observed. Recent measurements show that graphene offers high thermal conductance values, making it a promising material for thermoelectric applications. The thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to graphene electrodes has been analyzed, and it has been found that graphene transistors offer very high thermoelectrical efficiencies and do not follow the Wiedemann-Franz law. The figure of merit for heat-to-electricity conversion, known as ZT, has also been calculated and found to have values close to 12. The results indicate that graphene-based quantum dots could be effective in thermoelectric devices.", "Electron correlation is an important concept in electronic structure theory, and accurately describing it is crucial for studying various physical phenomena. Methods like Hartree-Fock and density functional theory provide approximations for electron correlation, but a more complete description is often required. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, like Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), allow for the estimation of expectation values for a trial wave function. The Jastrow-Slater wave function is a commonly used trial correlated wave function. This wave function is parameterized and approximates the exact eigenstate. In this paper, the authors focus on the optimization of Jastrow-Slater wave functions for the electronic structure of periodic solids. They apply wave function optimization to examine the consequences of inhomogeneity in the two-body correlation term for diamond and rhombohedral graphite. The authors develop a method for minimizing the energy with respect to a general inhomogeneous form of the Jastrow factor and use this method to optimize wave functions for large systems. They find that their optimized wave functions are well determined even when their contribution to the energy is small. The authors also discuss the convergence of their optimization method and note that it is robust even for systems with a large number of parameters.", "This paper proposes new methods for deriving functional equations for feynman integrals. These methods are based on algebraic relations between propagators and are suitable for multi-loop integrals. The paper provides detailed derivations for products of two, three, and four propagators, as well as for an arbitrary number of propagators. Functional equations are derived for one-loop and two-loop integrals with various mass configurations. Another method is also proposed for obtaining functional equations by finding algebraic relations for \"deformed propagators\" and converting integrals with these propagators to usual feynman integrals. The paper concludes by discussing future applications and developments of the proposed methods.", "The Belle collaboration recently observed three-body charmful decays for the first time. They also discovered a novel phenomenon where the mass spectra of kaon pairs peak near their mass threshold. In a recent paper, a factorization approach was proposed to study these decays. The approach factorizes the transition matrix element into a form factor and a weak form factor. The form factor is determined from experimental data for electromagnetic kaon form factors. The branching ratios obtained using this approach agree with experimental results, suggesting that the factorization assumption may be valid. The purpose of this study is to establish a theoretical foundation for the factorization of multi-body B-meson decays in QCD. The factorization approach for two-body B-meson decays has been used for a long time, and the QCD factorization method extends this approach into a rigorous and systematic framework. The main ingredient is factorization, the separation of perturbative and non-perturbative dynamics. The proof of factorization at two-loop order for B decays is given using momentum regions and ward identities. The all-orders proof is done in the soft-collinear effective theory. The exclusive three-body B-meson decays are more complicated than the two-body case, but the physics of these decays in", "Asteroseismology is a technique used to study the interiors of stars. Pulsators, which are found all over the H-R diagram, allow us to look inside different stars in different evolutionary stages. White dwarf stars, which make up the remains of 98-99% of stars in the sky, provide an archival record of their main sequence lifetime. Pulsating white dwarf stars, known as ZZ Ceti stars, are effective at harnessing this archival record. Recent studies have shown that the ZZ Ceti instability strip is about 1000-1200K in width. In this paper, the authors gather pulsation spectra of known ZZ Ceti stars with the purpose of studying their ensemble pulsation characteristics and how these properties change across the instability strip. They find that the number of observed independent modes increases with decreasing temperature and that the pulsation amplitude increases near the blue edge and declines prior to the red edge. They also propose a new classification scheme for ZZ Ceti stars based on their weighted mean pulsation period. The results of this study have implications for our understanding of pulsation models.", "The text discusses the concept of an \"obscured macroscopic view\" in quantum electrodynamics. It explains that certain quantum effects can be observed and even practically used without necessarily recognizing them as such. The paper also introduces the concept of \"response formulation\" which allows for a classical interpretation of quantum electrodynamics. The text highlights the mathematical patterns in quantum equations that allow for looking at the quantum without recognizing it. It also discusses the distinction between macroscopic and microscopic conditions in quantum mechanics and the implications for studying electromagnetic interactions. The paper concludes by stating that the formal structure of quantum electrodynamics supports the idea that truly quantum dynamics is limited to microscopic conditions, while macroscopic dynamics share their structure with classical stochastic electrodynamics.", "This article discusses the dynamics of carriers in metals and semiconductors in the presence of external electromagnetic fields. It describes how semiclassical transport theories have been used to accurately describe carrier dynamics and transport phenomena in these materials. The article also discusses recent efforts to extend semiclassical theories to spin transport and generation. The finite extent of carriers in real and reciprocal space is shown to have important consequences for transport theory, and the article introduces the concept of wave packets to describe carrier dynamics. The article also discusses the relationship between the wave packet formalism and the density operator formalism. The density operator formalism is used to formulate a theory of carrier dynamics and to describe the macroscopic quantities associated with carriers, such as charge and spin densities, currents, and torques. The article concludes with a discussion of the gauge covariance of these quantities and their physical significance.", "The text discusses the role of melanin, a pigment found in the skin, hair, and eyes, in photoprotection and its potential involvement in melanoma skin cancer. The most extensively studied type of melanin, eumelanin, has a broadband absorption spectrum that is not typically seen in biological pigments. The cause of this broad absorption has been a topic of scientific debate, with theories suggesting it may be due to the organization of small oligomers or extreme chemical disorder. Optical scattering, which can affect the measurement of optical properties, is also discussed. Various studies have attempted to measure scattering and absorption coefficients of eumelanin, with results indicating that scattering does not significantly contribute to the absorption spectrum. However, it is important to note that the scattering coefficient does appear to depend on the wavelength of the incident light. The structural organization of eumelanin particles is still not well-understood, but estimates of particle size have been made using scattering measurements. The text concludes by stating that eumelanin absorption spectra can be confidently interpreted as actual absorption without the need to consider scattering effects, as long as the solutions are well-prepared and solubilized.", "This article discusses a 3D simulation of the Earth's magnetotail and the instabilities that occur during the reconnection process. The reconnection converts magnetic energy into plasma flow and heating. The Earthward flow is accompanied by a dipolarization front, which is susceptible to the interchange instability. The simulation shows that the kink instability of flux ropes leads to the formation of pillars and the distortion of the dipolarization fronts. The simulation also predicts specific scales for the warping of the fronts, which is consistent with observations from the THEMIS mission. The results of the simulation indicate that the instabilities proceed in a sequential manner and that the dominant kink and interchange modes have scale lengths of 4 and 2, respectively. The agreement with observations suggests that the scales are determined by the initial equilibrium rather than the size of the simulation box. Further research is needed to investigate the stability of flux ropes in different flow patterns and to include these in a complete model of the reconnection process.", "The Saffman-Taylor instability occurs when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous fluid in a thin gap of a Hele-Shaw cell. This instability has been extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, but less research has been done for non-Newtonian fluids. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a wide range of behaviors, such as shear thinning and shear thickening, which can lead to the formation of different patterns compared to Newtonian fluids. Theoretical studies of non-Newtonian fluids in Hele-Shaw cells rely heavily on numerical simulations, but this paper presents an analytical weakly nonlinear analysis. The paper considers both shear thinning and shear thickening cases and investigates the influence of weak shear effects on finger tip-splitting and side branching. It also discusses the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in rectangular Hele-Shaw cells and compares the results to those in radial geometries. Theoretical predictions from the mode-coupling approach are in agreement with experimental and numerical findings. The paper concludes by suggesting further experimental and numerical work on non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flows, particularly in rectangular geometries.", "Quantum dots are artificial electron systems that can be treated as artificial atoms with tunable physical properties. They have been intensively studied using various techniques, and theoretical approaches have been applied to understand their properties. Recent interest has been in studying the properties of quantum dots in zero magnetic field, particularly in relation to the Fermi liquid-Wigner solid crossover and the metal-insulator transition in two dimensions. However, there is still a lack of understanding and conflicting results in the literature regarding the ground state properties of quantum dots with different electron numbers. In this paper, the author presents a complete theoretical study of a three-electron parabolic quantum dot using exact diagonalization. The energy spectrum, densities, pair-correlation functions, and thermodynamic properties are calculated as a function of the interaction parameter. The results show a transition in the ground state of the dot at a critical value of the interaction parameter, accompanied by a change in the total spin quantum number. The physical properties of the dot dramatically change at the transition point, corresponding to properties of a Fermi liquid at low interaction parameter and a Wigner molecule at high interaction parameter. The heat capacity also exhibits a characteristic peak related to the gap between the ground and first excited states. The densities and pair-correlation functions of the ground and excited", "This text discusses cataclysmic variables with very low mass transfer rates and highly magnetic white dwarfs, which are referred to as larps. These systems provide a unique opportunity to study how angular momentum losses and heating of the white dwarf affect binary evolution. The white dwarfs in larps have lower temperatures than normal polars, suggesting that they may be pre-polars or preps. However, the terminology and behavior of these systems is not always clear-cut. The text also discusses the effects of low levels of accretion on the white dwarf, which can be observed through time-resolved UV observations. The authors used GALEX to obtain UV observations of two larps and one system with a brown dwarf secondary. They found that all three systems have areas of enhanced emission, indicating that some accretion is still occurring despite the low accretion rates. The authors also modeled the UV light curves and found that simple circular isothermal spots can approximate the observed light variations. However, more complex spot geometries may be needed to fully explain the observations. The authors also discuss the uncertain nature of the accretion mechanism in these systems and the need for further observations and modeling.", "The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is a candidate for physics beyond the standard model. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN can be used to discover the strongly interacting superpartners, gluinos and squarks, with a mass lighter than 2.5 TeV. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) plays a key role in cosmology as a candidate for dark matter in the universe. The signals of the supersymmetric particles at the LHC depend on the nature of the LSP, which could be the lightest neutralino or the gravitino. This study focuses on the scenario where the LSP is the gravitino and the long-lived next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) carries charge, such as the lightest scalar tau. A large detector, such as the water tank detector proposed in this study, can be used to measure the lifetime of the charged NLSP. The measurement of the lifetime of the CNLSP provides direct information on the hidden sector and can be used to determine the total SUSY breaking scale in the hidden sector.", "Population dynamics is an important subject that has been studied for decades. It is interesting in itself and has applications in various practical problems such as the spread of diseases and strategies for pest control. The oldest population models are relatively simple rate equations that take into account basic events such as births and deaths. These models have been expanded to include fluctuations in the population and other sources of stochasticity. Recent models have also considered the spatial distribution of populations using reaction-diffusion equations. The study of population dynamics is crucial for understanding the conditions that lead to extinction and for protecting against it. In this study, the authors examine the effect of internal fluctuations on the risk of extinction. They propose a criterion for substantial risk of extinction and calculate the critical size of a refuge needed to avoid this risk. They find that fluctuations increase the risk of extinction and that the critical size of the refuge is larger than predicted by deterministic models. These results have important implications for the design of refuges and the understanding of population dynamics.", "The quantum Ising chain is a theoretical model that allows for the study of quantum many-body systems. It has been extensively studied to investigate fundamental issues in quantum physics. In this paper, the authors extend previous results on the low-energy properties of the quantum Ising chain to the case where boundary fields are present. They consider two cases: parallel and oppositely aligned boundary fields. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, the boundary fields do not significantly affect the large-size behavior of low-energy quantities. At the critical point, the bulk behavior is independent of the boundary conditions, but the magnetic fields induce a surface phase transition with a corresponding scaling behavior. In the quantum ferromagnetic phase, the behavior depends on the direction of the boundary fields. For small magnetic fields, the ground state is ferromagnetic, while for large boundary fields, kink states are the relevant low-energy excitations. The two different phases are separated by a continuous transition, and the same transition occurs in Ising rings in the presence of a localized link defect. The results for the quantum Ising chain can also be applied to the two-dimensional Ising model in a strip geometry, providing new analytic expressions for systems at the wetting transition in the presence of boundary fields. The paper provides a detailed study of", "The authors discuss the concept of ratchets, which refer to the directed transport in a system that has no net bias force. Ratchets have been traditionally studied in dissipative systems where external fluctuations cooperate with a periodic force to bias transport, which is the basis of some biological motors. Ratchets can also appear without dissipation and can be extended to quantum mechanical systems. The authors propose a method to transport quantum states and distribute entanglement using quantum ratchets in an optical superlattice with ultracold atoms. They demonstrate that the ratchet effect can be induced for both free particles and particles with interactions. The scheme can be implemented using current experimental techniques with optical superlattices.", "This paper presents a computational framework for including fluid-solid interaction forces in a direct solver of the Navier-Stokes equations. The framework allows for the computation of fluid wetting properties (such as equilibrium contact angle) based on first principles and without restriction to small contact angles. The paper discusses the limitations of current models for fluid-solid interaction, such as the long-wave model, and presents a novel approach that overcomes these limitations. The approach is validated through simulations of wetting and spreading drops on a substrate. The results show that the approach accurately captures the wetting behavior of the drops, including the equilibrium contact angle. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of the approach and future research directions.", "The asteroseismology group at the Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics of Lige has been using an evolution code called \"CLS\" to study asteroseismology. This code was developed specifically for their studies and is continuously updated. It is written in Fortran 77 and has been developed on a GNU/Linux system. The code is not unique and has been customized for different features needed by different research projects. The code includes equations related to the quasi-equilibrium structure of stars, boundary conditions, the rates of change of element abundances, convection, overshooting, and diffusion. The code also includes a solar calibration to reproduce the observed properties of the Sun. The code can be used at different levels of sophistication depending on the user's needs. The current version of the code is numbered 18, but a new version 19 is being developed to incorporate new features. The code is still under active development and is supported by several funding sources.", "This text discusses the dynamics of thin liquid films covered by insoluble surfactants. It explains that the behavior of the surfactant depends on its concentration, which can lead to various effects such as changes in surface tension and wettability. The text then presents a gradient dynamics formulation that describes the evolution of the film height and surfactant concentration. It also discusses several extensions to the model, including nonlinear equations of state, surfactant-dependent wettability, phase transitions, and substrate-mediated condensation. The advantages of this formulation are that it is thermodynamically consistent and can be applied to various physical situations. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of these extensions and discussing future research directions.", "In this paper, the authors propose a method to probe ellis wormholes using lensed spectra of astronomical sources. They discuss the potential of gravitational lensing as a means to detect and study exotic astrophysical objects like ellis wormholes, which have not been observed but are predicted by some cosmological models based on fundamental theory. They explain that the gravitational interaction is the most reliable way to observe such objects and discuss previous studies on gravitational lensing by ellis wormholes. The authors propose using spectroscopic observations to probe ellis wormholes and calculate the amplification factor of gravitational lensing, taking into account the wave effect. They compare the amplification factor for ellis wormholes with that for a point mass lens and discuss the distinguishability of the two cases. They also mention possible observations and constraints on the abundance of ellis wormholes. Overall, the paper presents a method to probe ellis wormholes using spectroscopic observations and discusses the potential of such observations in detecting and studying exotic astrophysical objects.", "The Monte Carlo method is a widely used computational tool in science. It samples configurations in a given state space from a probability distribution. However, for multi-dimensional distributions, this direct sampling is usually not possible. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods overcome this problem by generating configurations starting from an initial condition and using stochastic algorithms to move towards the equilibrium distribution. However, determining when the sample has equilibrated is often difficult. Exact sampling methods aim to generate samples directly from the equilibrium distribution without any influence from the initial condition, but these methods are often not feasible for complicated problems. The concept of coupling from the past provides a way to generate \"exact\" samples by proving that a Markov chain has coupled with a simpler distribution. The local-patch algorithm is a specific implementation of exact sampling that allows for the monitoring of the entire configuration space of complicated systems. This algorithm has been successfully applied to spin glasses and hard disk systems. The forward and backward transfer matrices in Markov chains can be used to study the convergence towards equilibrium, with the largest eigenvalue determining the convergence time. Various algorithms, such as the bunching method, have been developed to analyze the convergence properties of Markov chain simulations. However, these methods are not always reliable, especially in disordered systems. In the limit", "This text discusses the phenomenon of discrete breathers (DB) in physical systems. DBs are spatially localized and have time-periodic dynamics. They are different from Anderson localization triggered by disorder. Nonlinearity is a necessary condition for their existence, and their existence has been proven for certain classes of systems. DBs have been observed in various real systems including low-dimensional crystals, antiferromagnetic materials, and molecular crystals. The text also discusses different types of DBs and their theoretical analysis. It summarizes the procedure for constructing an effective Hamiltonian for DBs and estimates the Peierls-Nabarro barrier for different types of DBs. The results show that DBs can exhibit different degrees of spatial localization and mobility depending on their type.", "A mathematical model is proposed to describe the dynamics of two nonoscillatory consumer-resource (CR) pairs that are coupled together. The model assumes that the consumers interact through the common resource, which is supplied at a constant rate and consumed according to a simple mass-action kinetics. The dynamics of the consumers are assumed to be much faster than that of the resources. The model considers two types of coupling: strong coupling, where one consumer dominates, and weak coupling, where both consumers exhibit antiphase relaxation oscillations. The model is applicable to various systems, including ecosystems, and can shed light on the emergence of collective oscillations in coupled nonoscillatory systems.", "Variable stars, such as Mira variables, RR Lyrae stars, and Type II Cepheids, change in brightness in a periodic way. Observations have shown that the periods of these stars can be fixed or variable. Mira variables have periods longer than 100 days, RR Lyrae stars have periods in the 0.2 to 0.9 day range, and Type II Cepheids have periods of 1 day to about 25 days. Period changes have been observed in all three types of variable stars, with some showing significant changes while others remain constant. The causes of these period changes are still not fully understood, but they may be related to thermal pulses, convective overshooting, or hydromagnetic effects. Stellar evolution theory predicts small rates of period change for these stars, and observations generally match these predictions for clusters of stars, but individual stars often show larger and more erratic period changes.", "Inflation has been successful in explaining the early universe and structure formation. The simplest models of inflation involve a scalar field coupled to gravity with a flat potential. However, there is still no deep theoretical understanding of inflation and the nature of the inflation field. One attempt to embed inflation in string theory is through brane inflation, where a pair of D3 and anti-D3 branes move in a compactified space. The field between the branes, called the inflaton field, has a geometric interpretation in string theory. However, the potential between the branes is too steep for a long enough period of inflation, so the idea of a warped throat is introduced. In brane inflation, branes annihilate and create particles during inflation, which can have effects on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, the authors generalize previous results to the case where the branes are moving relativistically, as in DBI inflation. They present the setup, background solutions, and perturbation analysis. The power spectrum of curvature perturbations and the spectral index are obtained. The transfer function, which encodes the effects of brane annihilation and particles creation, is also analyzed. The authors find that the spectral index is more blue-tilted for super-horizon", "Galaxy clusters play an important role in cosmology, especially in measuring dark energy parameters. Current surveys use various techniques to study galaxy clusters, but they still face challenges like sample error and sample bias. One important property to measure in galaxy clusters is their mass, which cannot be directly observed. However, there are observable properties that correlate with mass, such as the temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM) inferred from x-ray spectra. This paper investigates the possibility of using temperature inhomogeneity in the ICM to correct for scatter in the mass-observable relation. The authors find that cluster structure, as quantified by power ratios and centroid shift, correlates with departures from the mean mass-temperature relation. However, there is little correlation between these structural measures and the temperature ratio. The paper concludes that temperature inhomogeneity measures are not very effective at reducing scatter in the mass-temperature relation. Additionally, the authors note that simulated clusters tend to have more cooling than observed clusters, which could affect the effectiveness of temperature inhomogeneity measures.", "The text discusses the computation of structures considered as waveguides with various symmetries. It mentions that waveguides can be uniform or periodic and that the vibration of these structures has been extensively studied. Different computational approaches for analyzing these waveguides are discussed, such as using wave approaches, finite element methods, and spectral finite element methods. The text then introduces a recursive method for computing the dynamic stiffness matrix of periodic structures, which allows for the efficient computation of frequency response functions. Two examples, a beam and a plate, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the recursive method provides accurate results with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional finite element methods. The paper concludes by stating that the proposed method can be applied to other types of one-dimensional periodic waveguides and complex structures.", "This text discusses the properties and comparisons of two types of nonclassical states of the electromagnetic field: lower-truncated coherent states (LTCS) and photon-added coherent states (PACS). LTCS are obtained by removing a set of contiguous, low energy Fock states from coherent states, while PACS are obtained by adding photons to coherent states. The text examines the nonclassical features of LTCS, such as squeezing and sub-Poissonian statistics, and compares them with PACS. It also discusses the entanglement potential of LTCS and PACS when used as input fields in a beam splitter. The results show that LTCS have higher entanglement potential than PACS and are better suited for generating entangled output modes. The text concludes by mentioning ongoing research on comparing the two states in the context of quantum teleportation.", "The text discusses the distribution of neutron star masses and the constraints it provides on the equation of state of condensed matter. The accuracy of mass determinations from millisecond radio-pulsars and high mass x-ray binaries is mentioned. It is noted that uncertainties can be large in determining masses in low-mass x-ray binaries due to various effects. The text also describes observations of the Cygnus X-2 system and the measurement of system parameters such as mass and rotational velocity of the companion star. The spectral type of the companion star is determined and compared with previous studies. The mass function is calculated and used to derive lower limits on the masses of the components in the system. The results are consistent with previous studies and provide support for stiff equations of state for nuclear matter. The text also discusses the discovery of kHz quasi-periodic oscillations and their implications for neutron star masses. The importance of dynamical mass determinations in constructing the distribution of neutron star masses and setting constraints on the equation of state of nuclear-density matter is emphasized.", "Liquid crystalline order is common in biological materials and can be analyzed using the Landau-De Gennes approach. However, this approach needs to be modified to take into account the polymer nature of the main-chain polymer nematogens. The connectivity of the mesogens in these polymers leads to a coupling between positional and orientational order. Recently, it was discovered that depending on the nature and symmetry of the mesophase order, a generalized form of the conservation law needs to be included in the Landau-De Gennes description. This new form of the conservation law accounts for the presence of backfolding configurations of the polymer chains, as well as the presence of localized hairpins and kinks. The two conservation laws are not equivalent and lead to different consequences, especially in the presence of backfolding configurations. A new, generalized conservation law is proposed that incorporates both the vectorial and tensorial conservation laws. The vectorial conservation law for the nematic director can still be used in the case of perfect orientational order, but is generally inaccurate. The tensorial conservation law is necessary to describe the macroscopic properties of polymer nematics. The connection between the vectorial and tensorial conservation laws depends on the density of chain backfoldings and the degree of orient", "Semi-supervised learning, or learning from labeled and unlabeled examples, has gained attention due to the ease of collecting unlabeled data compared to labeled data. It also has the potential to uncover insights into human learning. Multi-view semi-supervised learning aims to perform inductive learning using different kinds of information. Support vector machines (SVMs) have been proposed as a state-of-the-art method for multi-view semi-supervised learning. The proposed method, multi-view laplacian SVMs, integrates three regularization terms on function norm, manifold, and multi-view regularization. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms other related methods. The layout of the paper includes introducing the objective function and optimization, theoretical insights on generalization error and empirical rademacher complexity, and experimental results. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the proposed method and possible future improvements.", "The paper investigates a renewable energy powered cognitive radio (CR) network, where a primary user (PU) shares spectrum with a secondary user (SU). The objective is to minimize the average buffer delay by scheduling the allocated renewable energy in each slot. Two algorithms, the greedy algorithm and the power re-allocation (PA) algorithm, are proposed. The greedy algorithm is optimal in special scenarios and gives an upper bound on the optimal buffer length, while the PA algorithm gives a lower bound. The paper also explores the case where the PU's private information is not accessible by the SU. Simulation results show the performance of the algorithms in terms of average buffer length.", "This text discusses the formation and evolution of globular clusters (GCs) in the early universe. It explores different scenarios for GC formation and the effects of tidal stripping on their structure. The text highlights that the presence of dark matter (DM) in GCs can explain observed features such as apparent tidal cutoffs in radial density profiles. The simulations show that GCs with DM halos can survive severe tidal stripping in the potential of the host galaxy, with DM still being the dominant mass component in the tidally stripped remnant. The results suggest that GCs can form in the early universe and that the presence of DM does not significantly change their overall structural and dynamic parameters.", "The text discusses the use of point-like nucleons interacting with a two-body potential and three-body forces in low-energy nuclear systems. It highlights the ambiguity in nuclear physics due to the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energy scales. The text mentions different high precision meson exchange models of the two-nucleon force, as well as model-independent treatments based on chiral effective field theory (EFT). It proposes a renormalization group (RG) decimation approach to integrate out the high momentum components of the interactions and obtain an effective low momentum potential. The resulting potential, called Vlowk, is shown to be model-independent and reproduces the nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and deuteron properties with similar accuracy as high precision potentials. The text also discusses the scaling properties of Vlowk and its application in few-body and many-body calculations, demonstrating its promise as a starting point for microscopic nuclear many-body calculations.", "The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project conducted a site monitoring campaign to find the best location for the observatory. They measured the turbulence profile of the atmosphere at each location using various instruments, such as balloon-borne turbulence sensors and remote sensing techniques. The measurements showed that the turbulence strength at each site differed based on factors such as altitude, local terrain, and wind speed. Seasonal and nighttime variations in the turbulence profile were also observed. The results helped in understanding the factors influencing the optical turbulence at each site and will be used in the design of future astronomical instruments.", "The concept of inflation in the early universe is now widely accepted in modern cosmology. It is used to explain various features of the universe, such as its overall properties and the origin of cosmic structure formation. Despite the significant progress in measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation by missions like WMAP and Planck, there is no observational evidence that contradicts the idea of inflation. Inflation is important because it allows us to explain the initial condition of the universe before the inflationary phase. The conventional understanding is that in the expanding phase of the universe, the energy density and the Hubble parameter increase with time. Therefore, in order to discuss what happened before inflation and how inflation started, one needs to know the information of very high energy physics and address the initial singularity problem. However, recent studies have shown that if the action includes higher derivative terms of a scalar field called the Galileon terms, it is possible to violate the null energy condition without encountering any ghost or gradient instabilities. In these scenarios, the energy density can increase with time, contrary to the conventional wisdom. This allows for a picture of the emergence of the universe from a static zero-energy state described by Minkowski spacetime in the infinite past, and the universe starting to expand with the increase of the", "Summary:\nThis paper discusses the dynamics of bursting neurons and their synchronization in neuronal networks. The authors use the Rulkov model to describe the bursting behavior of neurons and investigate different network topologies, such as global coupling, random networks, small-world networks, and scale-free networks. They find that bursting synchronization occurs in all network topologies as the coupling strength increases. They also compare their results to the generalized Kuramoto model and show that the behavior of the coupled Rulkov network is similar to that of the Kuramoto model. This work has applications in understanding the dynamics of neuronal networks and the synchronization of bursting neurons, which is important for conditions like Parkinson's disease.", "Fiber optical parametric amplifiers (FOPAs) are devices that use four-wave mixing to transfer energy from strong pump fields to a weak signal field. FOPAs can be used for signal-processing applications in optical communication systems and are also candidates for generating non-classical light for quantum communication. In quantum communication, information can be encoded discreetly on each photon or continuously in quadrature-phase amplitudes of an optical field. Continuous variable (CV) entanglement, which offers several advantages over its discrete variable counterpart, can be achieved with FOPAs operating in the high-gain regime. Previous experiments have shown the generation of CV non-classical light via pulse pumped FOPAs in fibers, but a quantum theory for these FOPAs in the high-gain regime has not been developed. In this paper, the authors develop a multi-mode quantum theory for pulse pumped FOPAs and analyze their noise performance. The results show that the noise performance of the FOPA depends on the joint spectral function (JSF) and the collection efficiency of twin beams, and that the intensity difference noise can be reduced to lower than the shot-noise limit in the high-gain regime. The authors also investigate the influence of factors such as quantum efficiencies of detectors, collection", "This text discusses the effect of chromospheric activity on photometric techniques for measuring the metallicities of stars. Several authors have explored this effect, and recent large surveys have allowed for a statistically meaningful analysis. The authors of this paper compared the calcium emission line index against metallicities calculated from Str\u00f6mgren photometry and found that highly active stars had surprisingly low inferred metallicities. They used soft X-ray luminosity as an indicator of stellar activity and a photometric metallicity calibration that is more accurate for higher-metallicity stars. They compared the calibration to previous calibrations and found that the new calibration was more accurate. They also investigated the effects of errors in spectroscopic metallicity values and found that the coefficients of the calibration do not strongly depend on the assumed errors. The authors then used data from the ROSAT satellite to investigate the possible biases and trends related to chromospheric activity and metallicity. They found that there was no significant evidence for compromised metallicities due to stellar activity. They also compared their results to a previous calibration and found similar conclusions. They concluded that for most normal single stars, there is no need to apply a correction for chromospheric activity in metallicity calibrations based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry.", "Modal logics, which are extensions of propositional logic, have proven to be valuable in mathematics and computer science. They are used to model the knowledge and beliefs of agents in artificial intelligence, as well as in cryptographic and other protocols. In many specific applications, there are tailor-made variants of modal logics.\n\nComplexity issues for modal logics have been extensively studied. There is a close correspondence between modal logics defined by axioms and logics obtained by restricting the class of considered graphs. Complexity results for modal logics have been obtained on a case-by-case basis, proving results for individual logics. Some complexity results include complete satisfiability problems for logics including negative introspection axiom and proofs that certain classes of modal logics can be seen as a decidable fragment of first-order logic.\n\nIn this paper, the authors focus on a large class of modal logics that contain many important representatives. They identify all cases that have a polynomial-time satisfiability problem and show that all other non-trivial logics in that class have an exponential-time satisfiability problem.\n\nThe paper introduces several methodologies and proves several lemmas to establish these results. The main results of the paper are the classification of logics into polynomial and exponential complexity classes and the identification of the cases with polynomial-time", "The early universe was a mix of dark and baryonic matter, with the baryonic mass of any given object being a fraction of the total mass. However, most of the baryons associated with dark matter halos are now missing, with some in the intergalactic medium. A study presents an inventory of the baryonic and gravitating masses of cosmic structures and finds that the mass of baryons known in each system correlates with the total mass. The rotationally supported systems follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, while observations of giant elliptical galaxies and small satellite galaxies provide additional data. The fraction of detected baryons falls short of the cosmic fraction at all scales, with the missing baryons potentially inhabiting their dark matter halos. Direct searches for hot halo gas have not turned up significant results, and the missing baryons are highly significant on the scales of individual galaxies. The detected baryon fraction varies systematically with scale, indicating a correlation with feedback processes.", "The detection and control of single spins has recently gained a lot of interest. One method of detecting a single spin on a surface is through a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This technique, developed by Y. Manassen and his collaborators, is based on monitoring the noise in the STM current and observing a signal at the expected Larmor frequency. Unlike electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments with many spins, the ESR-STM method observes a single spin and does not require an oscillating field. The observed frequency varies linearly with the applied magnetic field, confirming the detection of an isolated spin on the surface. This effect has been demonstrated on different surfaces, including oxidized Si(111), Fe atoms on Si(111), and various organic molecules on graphite and Au(111) surfaces. Recent extensions have also resolved two resonance peaks on oxidized Si(111) and observed hyperfine coupling. The spatial dependence of the signal shows a non-monotonic contour plot, with the signal being elongated and maximal at a certain distance from the spin center. The theoretical understanding of the ESR-STM effect is still not settled, but spin-orbit coupling is believed to play a role. In this work, the authors propose a model that allows for the ESR-", "The authors discuss the use of anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to study non-perturbative quantum field theories. They explain that the central charges of the dual theory relate to the coupling constants of its dual gravity, and that higher curvature terms need to be included in the gravity action to extend the duality beyond a limited class of conformal field theories with equal central charges. Lovelock theory is introduced as the most natural extension of general relativity with higher curvature terms, and the authors discuss the divergences and counterterms in the action of Lovelock gravity. They present an alternative construction of counterterms for Lovelock gravity that depend on the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the boundary and are regular on the asymptotic region. The authors then apply the counterterm method to the static solutions of third-order Lovelock gravity with curved horizon, discussing the finite action, mass, and thermodynamic quantities of black hole solutions. They show that the entropy calculated through the use of the Gibbs-Duhem relation is consistent with Wald's formula and that the mass obtained by the counterterm method satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. The stability of the black hole solutions in canonical ensemble is also investigated. The authors", "The text discusses the observations and analysis of eclipses of the 11th magnitude star, EE Cep, which have been observed with a period of 5.6 years since the early 1950s. The eclipses show the same features, being almost gray and asymmetric in shape. The most plausible explanation for this behavior is that the secondary star consists of a dark disk with an opaque interior and semi-transparent exterior that is tilted and precessing. The shallow flat-bottomed eclipse observed in 1969 can be explained by assuming a non-tilted projection of the disk. In 2003, a photometric campaign was organized which provided high-quality data, including color evolution during the eclipse. The results showed that the eclipse was shallow and almost gray. The color indices also revealed blue maxima before and after the mid-eclipse, indicating the presence of a hot star that is rotationally darkened at the equator and brightened at the poles. Two eclipse models were presented, one with a solid disk and one with a disk with a gap, with the latter fitting the observed color changes better. However, many questions remained unanswered, such as whether the be star in the EE Cep system is indeed eclipsed by a dark, precessing disk,", "The text discusses the concept of nodal volumes in the context of eigenfunctions of the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation on a smooth, connected, compact Riemannian manifold. The nodal set is defined as the set of points on the manifold where the eigenfunction vanishes. The size of the nodal set is measured by its hypersurface volume, referred to as the nodal volume. The text explores the statistical distribution of nodal volumes for different cases, including regular shapes with separable wave functions and irregular shapes with chaotic ray dynamics. It also presents results for the cuboid and the boundary adapted planar random wave model. The text concludes with conjectures about the universality of the limiting distribution of nodal volumes and the differences between regular and irregular shapes.", "The future measurement of the distribution and number density of galaxy clusters will provide important constraints on our understanding of the universe. Upcoming surveys such as SZA, APEX-SZ, SPT, and ACT are aiming to map the millimeter and sub-millimeter sky with unprecedented power and resolution in order to detect clusters through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. In this paper, the authors examine different survey strategies and signal processing techniques to enhance the detection of clusters using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. They test and compare three filtering techniques: discrete wavelets, continuous wavelets, and Fourier methods. The results show that all three filters successfully improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the maps, but the optimal filter performs at least as well as the wavelet based filters. The authors also investigate different survey strategies and find that multi-frequency measurements are necessary to account for point source contamination. They conclude that a well understood catalog of massive clusters across a large fraction of the sky will be a major achievement for cosmology and will likely be available in the near future as powerful surveys begin operation.", "Microtubules, which are polymeric filaments in cells, have unique assembly and disassembly processes called dynamic instability. They play a central role in cell division and their assembly into the metaphase spindle is crucial for chromosome alignment. Microtubules can randomly search for chromosomes by growing and shrinking, and are stabilized when they encounter a kinetochore. The search time for a fixed target depends on the cell size and the frequencies of catastrophe and rescue events. In small cells, minimizing cytoplasmic rescue and catastrophe events optimizes the search time, while in larger cells, the rescue frequency needs to be minimized. In very large cells, tuning the catastrophe frequency becomes important. The optimization of microtubule kinetics in mitosis is consistent with experimental observations.", "The text discusses the problem of power control in cellular, ad-hoc, and cognitive underlay networks. The main goal is to support all links in the network at their desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) levels using a minimum total transmission power. However, this often becomes infeasible, so a joint power and admission control approach is used to selectively remove some links from the network in order to support the remaining ones. The problem of joint power and admission control is known to be NP-hard, so various heuristic algorithms have been proposed. The text introduces the Linear Programming Deflation (LPD) algorithm and the New LPD (NLPD) algorithm as existing approaches to solve this problem. The proposed algorithm in this paper is based on minimum norm minimization and is shown to outperform existing approaches in terms of supported links, total transmission power, and CPU time. The algorithm is tested through numerical simulations.", "The text discusses the concept of epidemiological line lists and proposes a framework called \"guided deep list\" for automatically extracting line lists from open source reports. The framework uses neural word embeddings and dependency parsing to extract demographic information, disease onset features, and clinical features from the reports. The authors present their evaluation of the framework's performance and demonstrate its utility in understanding and analyzing Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. They provide insights on the demographic distribution and symptoms-to-hospitalization period of the affected individuals. The authors claim that their work is the first to automate the creation of line lists and highlight the novelty, real-time capability, and automated nature of their framework.", "In situ measurements and ground-based observations have shown that Jupiter has high-energy electron van Allen radiation belts. The exact energy spectrum and spatial distribution of these energetic electrons is still a topic of debate. Jupiter emits X-rays from its magnetic poles through charge exchange interactions with the solar wind and bremsstrahlung emission from energetic electrons. Previous instruments have not been sensitive enough to detect extended hard X-ray emission from Jupiter's radiation belts. However, a recent analysis using data from the Suzaku X-ray satellite has detected extended hard X-ray emission around Jupiter, indicating the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons in the radiation belts. The emission likely originates from inverse Compton scattering, where solar optical photons are scattered by these high-energy electrons. The emission is also seen in soft X-rays and is associated with Jupiter's aurora and the Io Plasma Torus. Further observations and investigations are needed to fully understand the origin and nature of this diffuse X-ray emission.", "Colloidal systems are a type of metamaterial with unique optical and mechanical properties. One challenge in using these materials is assembling them into structures with controlled symmetries. One method that has been successful is using topographic templates to assist in the assembly of the colloidal particles. These templates, created through micro-fabrication techniques, can control the orientation and symmetry of the colloidal structures. This technique offers advantages over traditional methods as it produces structures with fewer defects and longer range order. Additionally, the use of templates with patterns commensurate with the colloids enables size selectivity. The use of topographic patterns on surfaces can also influence the interaction between the colloids and the surface, resulting in either attraction or repulsion depending on the anchoring conditions. The surface chemistry of the colloids can be modified to switch between different anchoring conditions, further enhancing the selectivity of the assembly process. By combining topographic patterns with specific surface chemistry, colloidal particles can be selectively assembled based on their surface chemistry. This selective assembly process has potential applications in the fabrication of photonic devices and in microfluidic chips.", "The text discusses neutrino emission from reverse shocks in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It explains that the leading model for GRBs involves a relativistic fireball jet produced by the collapse of a massive star, and that high-energy neutrinos can be produced through photomeson interactions of accelerated protons in the jet. The paper investigates neutrinos produced by protons accelerated in the reverse shock while the jet is still inside the star. It shows that protons can be accelerated to high energies in this process, and that the resulting neutrinos can be detected by neutrino detectors such as IceCube. The paper also discusses the effects of proton and meson cooling on the neutrino emission and the detectability of high-energy neutrinos from reverse shocks in GRBs. It concludes that despite the suppression due to cooling, a reasonable number of neutrino events can still be expected from reverse shocks.", "The author discusses the construction and properties of a generalization of the Dirac monopole called the Dirac sheaf bundle. The Dirac sheaf bundle is formed by considering a more flexible mathematical framework that allows for nonintegral charges and interactions with different types of fields. The author shows that the Dirac sheaf bundle can be used to describe interactions with scalar fields, spinor fields, and gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The author also discusses the possible physical implications of the Dirac sheaf bundle, including its relevance to grand unified theories and the possible existence of nonintegral electric charges and magnetic monopoles. The author concludes by suggesting that a sheaf-theoretic formulation of quantum theory may provide insight into these phenomena.", "Topological states of matter are characterized by bulk invariants, such as Chern numbers or a Z2 invariant, depending on whether time reversal symmetry is broken or conserved. These invariants can be used to classify topologically protected states at the edges of a system. In the case of a 2D topological insulator, the edge states are formed by time reversed modes called Kramers partners, which propagate in opposite directions along the edge. The number of Kramers pairs on the edge determines whether the system is topologically trivial or non-trivial. Experimental measurements of quantized edge conductance have confirmed the existence of topologically protected states in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. The topological order in these quantum wells can be controlled by the thickness of the HgTe layer. In addition to edge states, the bulk conductivity can also carry information about the topological properties of the system. It has been proposed that a non-monotonic conductance as a function of the geometrical aspect ratio in metal/HgTe/metal junctions with a characteristic maximum describes the topological insulator regime. However, previous analyses have been limited to periodic boundary conditions and neglected the existence of edge states. In this paper, the authors analyze the properties of a single", "This paper focuses on the interference control in OFDMA-based cellular systems. It explores two approaches - interference coordination and network MIMO - for mitigating inter-cell interference. The paper proposes a new approach that utilizes interference alignment and frequency-domain precoding to design cooperative resource allocation. The performance of this approach is compared to a traditional subcarrier-separation approach. Additionally, a hybrid scheme is proposed for practical cellular systems with heterogeneous channel conditions. Numerical experiments show that the proposed IA-based scheme performs better than the traditional scheme when the cross-cell link has comparable strength and the SNR is large. The hybrid scheme achieves a balanced performance by exploiting the advantages of both traditional and IA-based resource allocation.", "Understanding the physics of gas is important for studying galaxy formation and evolution. Gas is essential for the formation of stars and galaxies in the universe. Diffuse gas exists in the intergalactic medium and around galaxies, known as the circumgalactic medium. QSO absorption lines are used to detect the low column density circumgalactic medium. Absorbers are often found near galaxies, but not all of them are directly related to individual galaxies. Galaxy clusters contain a large number of galaxies, and the gas properties of these galaxies are influenced by the hot intracluster medium. A survey of background QSOs in the Virgo cluster found 43 absorbers. This study allows an examination of the circumgalactic medium in a cluster environment. The properties and association of absorbers with galaxies in and around the Virgo cluster are discussed. The study shows that the gas properties vary with the environment, and the circumgalactic medium in the cluster environment is different from that in the field environment. The presence of the circumgalactic medium around galaxies is determined by the environment, rather than the galaxy type. Truncation of the circumgalactic medium removes future fuel for star formation and can cause galaxies to evolve onto the red sequence through a process called starvation. The cgm truncation is", "The emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals is a well-studied problem in game theory. Traditionally, cooperation has been investigated using models such as the prisoner's dilemma and the public goods game. The public goods game, in particular, is relevant in many real-life situations such as protecting the environment and avoiding overfishing. In this game, individuals decide whether to contribute to a common pool or not, and the accumulated contributions are multiplied by a factor and shared among all group members. From the perspective of each individual, it is rational to defect and free-ride on others' contributions. However, if everyone defects, the group fails to reap the benefits of cooperation, leading to a \"tragedy of the commons\". \n\nTo study cooperation in more realistic scenarios, researchers have developed different versions of the public goods game and explored various mechanisms, such as punishment, reward, reputation, and network reciprocity. The use of complex interaction networks has provided a framework for studying the public goods game in structured populations. Additionally, factors like noise, social diversity, and success-driven distribution have been incorporated to study their effects on cooperation. It has been found that social diversity can greatly promote the emergence of cooperation.\n\nIn this study, the authors propose a coevolutionary rule for the public", "This text discusses the construction of an asymptotically flat supersymmetric black lens solution in the five-dimensional minimal supergravity. The solution has a horizon topology of a lens space and is obtained by imposing suitable boundary conditions. The conserved quantities of the black lens solution, such as mass, angular momenta, and magnetic fluxes, are computed and analyzed. The existence of magnetic fluxes is shown to be essential in supporting the horizon of the black lens. The conditions for the absence of closed timelike curves and conical singularities in the spacetime are also discussed.", "The paper discusses the stability and convergence properties of finite elements on evolving surfaces. It focuses on a linear parabolic equation on a given moving closed surface and examines different velocity laws, including a regularized velocity law, a mean curvature flow, and a dynamic velocity law. The paper provides optimal-order error bounds for piecewise linear finite elements and investigates the stability and convergence of the finite element method. It also compares the regularized velocity law with mean curvature flow and presents numerical experiments to support the theoretical results.", "In this paper, the authors propose that space domains with deformed small extra dimensions could serve as dark matter particles. They discuss the concept of extra dimensions and how they can be described using different geometries. They focus on stationary geometries of two-dimensional manifolds with sphere topology and show that there are two subclasses with different properties. They also estimate the mass of the dark matter particle and discuss its interaction with ordinary matter. The authors emphasize that the observable physical parameters can vary depending on the initial conditions, leading to a wide range of possible values. The paper concludes with thoughts on future research and the need for new methods to detect dark matter.", "This passage discusses the characteristics of the magnetic cataclysmic variable RX J1313.23259. It is a polar system consisting of a low mass main sequence star and a magnetic white dwarf. The strong magnetic field channels the accretion flow onto the surface of the white dwarf, resulting in the emission of reprocessed radiation in the soft X-ray regime. The passage also describes the observations and analysis of the system, including light curves, spectra, and flux contributions. The investigation of RX J1313.23259 provides valuable insights into the properties of cataclysmic variables and the formation of white dwarfs.", "The paper discusses the properties and evolution of the high-energy transient Swift J164449.3+573451 (SW J1644+57), which was initially thought to be a gamma-ray burst (GRB) but later identified as a star being tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of a galaxy. The paper presents a model to calculate the parameters of the jet blast wave at any given time using the observed radiation spectrum and finds that the jet of SW J1644+57 transitions from a conical structure to a cylindrical one as it propagates outward. The paper also suggests that the jet of SW J1644+57 may be collimated by the surrounding cocoon, similar to long-lived active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. The study concludes that SW J1644+57 is likely a result of accretion onto an SMBH, similar to AGNs.", "The paper discusses the capacity of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel (DM-CIC), which consists of two transmitter-receiver pairs that interfere with each other. The authors introduce the notion of a \"less noisy\" DM-CIC, where one receiver is less noisy than the other. They propose two inner bounds for the DM-CIC, one based on superposition coding and another using independent coding. They also prove an outer bound on the capacity of the DM-CIC and show that for the \"cognitive-less-noisy\" DM-CIC, the inner and outer bounds coincide, establishing the capacity region for this class of DM-CIC. The paper compares the results with existing capacity results for the DM-CIC and summarizes the capacity regions for different cases of the DM-CIC.", "This paper explores the relationship between jets and equatorial tori in proto-planetary nebulae (proto-PNe) and discusses various theoretical ideas about their formation. The first part of the paper focuses on observations and finds evidence that jets and tori are related and develop almost simultaneously, suggesting a torus-jet sequence. The second part uses this relation to evaluate different formation scenarios and rules out some while favoring others. The paper concludes that jets and tori are traumatic events in the transition from the asymptotic giant branch to the PNe phase and provides insights into their formation.", "In this paper, the authors discuss the problem of online updating of a Pareto archive composed of mutually non-dominated solutions in multi-objective optimization. They propose a new method called nd-tree for updating the Pareto archive, which allows for faster updating of the archive compared to existing methods such as linear lists and quad-trees. The nd-tree data structure is a tree with internal nodes and leaf nodes, where each node stores a set of solutions and approximate ideal and nadir points. The authors conduct computational experiments to compare the performance of nd-tree with other methods, and show that nd-tree performs well in terms of computational time reduction. They also discuss the potential applications of nd-tree in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.", "Noncommutative spacetime is an interesting candidate for a new notion of quantum spacetime. It is obtained by replacing the commutative algebras of functions in field theories with noncommutative algebras. Noncommutative spacetime is connected to string theory and quantum gravity. However, some noncommutative field theories do not respect the principles of special relativity or quantum mechanics. In this paper, the possibility of nonassociative spacetime is explored. Scalar field theories obtained from commutative nonassociative algebras are studied and it is shown that they satisfy the one-loop unitarity rule. A new commutative nonassociative product is introduced to avoid an exponential divergence in the one-loop amplitude, and it is shown that the field theory based on this product also satisfies the one-loop unitarity rule. Scalar field theories obtained from commutative associative algebras are also considered, but it is found that they do not exhibit non-trivial properties.", "In this study, the authors propose a family of mathematical models called 2D lattice liquid models to study the physical properties of membranes. They focus on single-component, single-layered, incompressible systems with no explicit viscosity. They construct two stochastic models on a finite honeycomb lattice and simulate these models to study their statistical properties. They find that the probability of the no-loop configuration decays exponentially with the area of the lattice. They also observe that the models exhibit anomalous diffusion and show statistical properties different from a collection of non-interacting simple random walks. The authors propose possible extensions of the models, including the incorporation of interactions between particles and the study of multi-component systems. They also discuss the relation of their models to other statistical models and possible applications to soft-material membranes.", "Low- and intermediate-mass stars play a crucial role in galactic chemical evolution by ejecting newly synthesized nuclear products into the interstellar medium. The nucleosynthetic history of carbon and nitrogen, in particular, has gained interest due to observations of high red-shift systems. In order to trace the history of chemical evolution and star formation, it is important to analyze the nucleosynthesis of these elements in low- and intermediate-mass stars. This can be done through synthetic models that summarize the results of complete stellar calculations. The present study provides new stellar yields for a range of initial stellar masses and metallicities. These yields take into account the effects of the third dredge-up and the occurrence of hot-bottom burning during the thermal pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. The yields show a dependence on metallicity, with positive yields increasing at lower metallicities. The study also compares the new yields with those calculated by other studies, highlighting the differences in the assumptions and model prescriptions. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and its impact on galactic chemical evolution.", "The text discusses the connection between chaos and diffusion in different models. It first introduces the diffusion equation and explains how it relates to the mean square displacement of a particle. It then discusses chaotic properties, such as the existence of periodic orbits and positive Lyapunov exponents, in both chaotic (Lorentz gas) and nonchaotic (wind-tree) systems. The grassberger-procaccia method is described as a way to calculate the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, but it is noted that this method does not distinguish between chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics. Instead, a new method called almost periodic recurrences is introduced, which focuses on specific types of recurrences related to periodic orbits. Finally, the text discusses the diffusive properties of the models and the behavior of particles near absorbing boundaries, showing that the diffusion coefficient can be determined for chaotic systems but not for nonchaotic systems with absorbing boundaries.", "The key question in star formation research is how jets are launched from young stars. Jets play a crucial role in removing excess angular momentum from the system, allowing matter to be accreted onto the star. It is believed that magneto-centrifugal forces are responsible for jet launching. There are two main models for jet launching: the disk-wind model and the x-wind model. However, validating these models has been challenging due to resolution constraints on observations and complex kinematics close to the source. Recent observations of jets from less embedded T Tauri stars have provided interesting results, showing evidence of rotation and supporting the canonical models. This study conducted an optical survey using the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to investigate whether jets from young stars rotate. They obtained observations of three sources: the bi-polar jets from TH28 and RW Aur, and the blue-shifted jet from LKH0321. The analysis of the data showed clear velocity differences between the two sides of the jet flow in all three cases, indicating the presence of rotation. The red and blue lobes of TH28 and RW Aur were found to rotate in the same direction, supporting the notion of helicity in opposite lobes. The results also showed consistent toroidal and poloidal velocities,", "The Opera experiment is a study of neutrino oscillations, specifically the appearance of tau neutrinos from muon neutrinos. The experiment uses a long-baseline neutrino beam from CERN to the Gran Sasso underground laboratory. The challenge is to detect the short-lived tau lepton produced in the charged-current interaction of a muon neutrino. The detector is a hybrid of emulsion/lead bricks, scintillator trackers, and a muon spectrometer. The experiment has successfully collected data on neutrino interactions and has been able to identify and reconstruct the interactions in the emulsion films. The experiment has also observed events with charm-like topologies, providing important information for background rejection. The Opera experiment is currently in its production phase and is expected to provide valuable insights into neutrino oscillations.", "The text discusses the glass transition and the microscopic description of precursory cooperative mechanisms in glass-forming systems. It mentions the two characteristic temperatures, one related to the onset of slow dynamics and the other predicted by the mode coupling theory. The text also mentions the role of these temperatures in the vitrification process and the coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom. It discusses extensions of the mode coupling theory for molecular compounds and the use of partially disordered systems to investigate the freezing process. The text presents the results of neutron spin-echo and x-ray experiments, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, on the glassy crystal difluorotetrachloroethane. It discusses the reorientational dynamics of the molecule and the use of self angular correlation functions and intermediate scattering functions to analyze the dynamics. It compares the experimental and simulation results and discusses the validity of the mode coupling theory in describing the dynamics. The text also discusses the role of static correlations in the dynamics and presents the results of the analyses. It concludes by suggesting further investigations to validate the results and improve the understanding of the glass transition.", "The text discusses the stability of peer-to-peer (P2P) communication in the internet. It explains how P2P networks work, with peers acting as both clients and servers, and how unstructured P2P networks distribute files. The text also describes various mechanisms used in P2P networks, such as rarest first piece selection policies, tit-for-tat participation constraints, and network coding. It then presents a model of a P2P file sharing network and determines the stability of the network based on different parameter values. The text also discusses the delay in endgame mode and the missing piece syndrome. It shows that the stability of the network depends on the upload capacity of the seed, and provides simulation results and a proposition to support this conclusion. The text concludes by discussing the implications of the missing piece syndrome and the stability of P2P networks under different settings.", "This paper proposes a novel architecture for an area efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor. The architecture utilizes a time control unit to reuse butterfly units multiple times, reducing the overall area required for the processor. The proposed architecture has been emulated and analyzed, and the results show that it significantly reduces the area without compromising the response time. The paper also mentions other related work in the field of FFT processors.", "The text discusses the experimental observations of the effects of low frequency microwave radiation on the conductivity and resistivity of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. It explains that at high microwave powers, the conductivity and resistivity of the 2DES are significantly suppressed, and that this effect is related to microwave-induced transport phenomena and zero-resistance states observed in previous studies. The text proposes an explanation for this effect, based on the suppression of electron scattering on impurities by the AC electric field of the microwave radiation. It suggests that the AC electric field causes spatio-temporal oscillations of the electron orbit center, leading to a spread of the wave function and a decrease in the probability of electron scattering. The text also discusses the effect of dynamic electron localization and its role in the suppression of electron transitions between states in neighboring quantum wells. It presents a theoretical model to explain these effects and shows that it can account for the experimental results. The text concludes by discussing the dependence of the effect on microwave power, frequency, and magnetic field strength, and notes that the heating of electrons due to microwave radiation is not responsible for the observed effect.", "Many currently used refrigerant gases have a negative impact on the environment due to their contribution to the greenhouse gas effect or the depletion of the ozone layer. In an effort to protect the environment, regulations have been implemented to prevent the production and use of certain refrigerant gases. Gas detectors are widely used in nuclear and high energy physics to detect and track charged particles such as muons. These detectors often use mixtures containing regulated refrigerants as a quenching medium. However, these mixtures need to be replaced with more eco-friendly alternatives that comply with regulations. The properties of gases used in particle gas detectors, such as their impact on the environment, stopping power, radiation length, and ionization production, need to be considered when selecting a replacement gas. It is also important to consider the safety and compatibility of refrigerants with materials and to understand the aging process of gas detectors. A study of the transport properties of currently used gas mixtures in high energy physics and the evaluation of eco-friendly gas mixtures has recently been published. The findings of this study can be used for the selection of replacement gases in various types of gas detectors.", "Graphene is being investigated as a potential replacement for silicon in nanoscale transistors. However, there are several technological challenges that need to be overcome in order to effectively control the properties of graphene. Recent experiments have shown that bilayer graphene has an energy gap that can be controlled by a vertical electric field. This property could be used to create a tunable-gap bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) with independent gate operation. In this study, the authors used atomistic numerical simulations to evaluate the potential performance of these devices. They found that the tunable gap in bilayer graphene is not sufficient to suppress band-to-band tunneling currents, making it difficult to achieve the desired switching characteristics. The authors suggest that further exploration of different device structures and biases is needed to find a solution to this problem.", "A vehicle moving through the stratosphere at hypersonic velocities is covered by a plasma sheath, making direct communication with the vehicle impossible. One approach to maintain contact is to use signals with higher frequencies, but these signals are heavily attenuated in the atmosphere. Another approach is to use low frequency signals with wavelengths larger than the plasma sheath thickness, but this has low bit rates and is not well supported by existing infrastructure. A third category of solutions involve manipulating the plasma, such as reshaping the vehicle or using powerful magnets. The fourth category, and the one of interest, uses the properties of the plasma itself to enable transmission. The idea is to use a high frequency pump signal to generate a scattered wave that carries the information encoded on the low frequency signal wave back to the vehicle. The ratio of the power flux of the scattered wave received at the vehicle to the power flux contained in the signal wave can be between 0.7 and 2 percent, making reception of GPS signals possible. The method also allows for communication from the vehicle by using a pump wave and a stokes wave as power sources for a propagating wave. The proposed method is feasible using standard devices available on the market. However, there are still open questions, such as the effect of the plasma", "The existence and nature of melting transitions in two-dimensional (2D) systems remains an area of interest and uncertainty. In particular, the melting of the vortex lattice in a thin film superconductor has received much attention. A continuous melting transition from an Abrikosov lattice to a vortex liquid via a phase of hexatic order, as proposed in the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, was first proposed over fifteen years ago. The current-voltage response of thin film superconductors has been seen to exhibit a transition in several experiments. The vortex system becomes depinned above a certain transition temperature, leading to an increase in resistivity of the film. However, the transition temperature varies with the strength of the pinning centers in the thin films. Films with weak pinning centers show no features in the current-voltage characteristics that may be attributed to a melting transition. The superconducting state arises from macroscopic correlations in the phase of the Cooper pair wave function. Thermal excitations of the shear modes of the vortex lattice are predicted to destroy long-range phase coherence. Monte Carlo simulations on a thin film superconductor have been performed using a spherical geometry to minimize finite-size boundary effects. No freezing transition", "The paper discusses the scattering of heavy rare gas particles from surfaces composed of atoms of smaller mass. It explains that most of the incident beam is trapped at the surface and then desorbed after spending time in the physisorption potential well. The paper introduces a theory that can track the trapped particles and follow them until they are desorbed. It describes the process of trapping and desorption and how it can be modeled iteratively. The paper also compares the calculations with experimental data for the scattering of xenon atoms with molten gallium and indium surfaces. It shows that the calculations agree well with the data and provides estimates for the physisorption potential well depths. The paper concludes that the theoretical model is useful for simulating scattering under conditions where trapping and desorption occur.", "The origin of the energy required to power the solar wind and heat the sun's corona remains a mystery in physics. One promising mechanism involves the creation of Alfv\u00e9nic waves near the solar surface, which can penetrate upwards through the sun's atmosphere with minimal reflection or energy loss. There is controversy surrounding the interpretation of periodic transverse motions as Alfv\u00e9n waves. Transverse kink oscillations may often be considered Alfv\u00e9nic in nature, providing they are incompressible and exhibit no intensity fluctuations along the structure. Spicules, dynamic magnetic structures found in the solar chromosphere, display periodic transverse motions and are longer lived than their jet-like counterparts. The underlying cause of these periodic motions is still speculative. Mode coupling and mode conversion between different wave modes seem to be important factors in generating these oscillations. Observations and simulations show that longitudinal pressure modes in photospheric magnetic bright points can convert into transverse kink waves in the chromosphere. These transverse oscillations in spicules have important consequences for energy transportation into the solar corona.", "One of the main findings from five years of studying gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at optical wavelengths is that about 80% of well-localized GRBs do not have a detected optical afterglow, known as \"dark bursts\". In some cases, a non-detection of the optical afterglow could be due to a failure to image deeply or quickly enough, but there are also cases where there is strong evidence that the optical light was extinguished by dust or absorbed by the Lyman-alpha forest. It has been suggested that a large fraction of dark bursts are due to dust extinction within the local environment of the bursts. However, it is important to have a clear understanding of the diversity of afterglow properties before making conclusions about dark bursts. In this study, the authors present optical and radio observations of a dim afterglow that would have been classified as dark if not for rapid and deep searches. The observations suggest that the afterglow is dim due to intrinsic faintness and a relatively fast decline, rather than dust extinction. The study highlights the importance of consistent and rapid follow-up observations of a large number of bursts to better understand the diversity of afterglow properties and the underlying causes of dark bursts.", "Prompt-photon production in fixed-target experiments is of interest because it can be used as a probe of the gluon parton density in structure-function studies. Prompt photons are historically our main source of information on the gluon density at large x, a region that has little influence on deep-inelastic-scattering structure functions. Understanding this region is crucial for disentangling new physics signals from QCD background in high energy hadron collider experiments. Resummation of soft-gluon effects has been performed at the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for prompt-photon production near the threshold limit. The inclusion of resummation significantly improves the factorization and renormalization scale dependence, reducing the uncertainty of the predictions. It also reduces the overall size of the resummation contributions, making them smaller than effects induced by intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons. However, the resummation does not remove the large discrepancies between theory and data at low transverse energies. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of non-perturbative effects in this region.", "The non-equilibrium random field Ising model (RFIM) is a model that was introduced to explain the behavior of ferromagnets and other systems that exhibit hysteresis and jerky behavior when driven by an external force. This model captures the complex free energy landscape and the jumps between metastable states that occur in these systems. The RFIM with a single-spin-flip dynamics has been shown to accurately model this behavior. In this paper, the authors investigate the robustness of this model by studying the RFIM with a one-spin-flip dynamics. They compare the results with the standard two-spin-flip dynamics and find that while the hysteresis loops are reduced with the one-spin-flip dynamics, the main features and the disorder-induced transition remain the same. They perform a finite-size scaling analysis and find that the critical properties are identical to those obtained with the two-spin-flip dynamics, indicating that the dynamics do not change the universality class of the transition. The authors suggest that the equilibrium and non-equilibrium transitions of the RFIM belong to the same universality class, and that the disorder-induced transition has a universal character that does not depend on the specific choice of the dynamics.", "The presence of molecular hydrogen (H2) emission is a reliable indicator of bipolar structure in planetary nebulae. The molecular emission is strongest in the waist regions of bipolar planetaries, which are thought to be remnants of circumstellar disks or tori formed during previous phases of the central stars. The onset of H2 emission indicates the beginning of a high-velocity, collimated post-AGB wind. The authors conducted spectroscopic mapping of near-infrared H2 emission from pre-planetary nebulae and planetary nebulae to study the kinematics of these regions. They found that the polar lobes show velocity gradients, while the equatorial regions have a combination of radial expansion and azimuthal (rotational) velocity components. The results support the presence of circumstellar disks and high-velocity polar flows in these regions. The authors also analyzed H2 emission data from three specific objects, rafgl 2688, rafgl 618, and NGC 2346, and found evidence of rapid transitions from slow, spherically symmetric winds to faster, collimated post-AGB winds in the polar axes. They also observed distinct kinematic components in NGC 2346, including an equatorial ring or disk expanding at low velocity and polar", "The paper discusses the establishment of two theorems that provide a reduced Grbner base of the syzygy ideal of quaternionic polynomials. It also examines the normal forms of quaternionic polynomials with respect to the Grbner base. The results are applied to the multilinear case and the paper concludes with a proof of the theorem in the multilinear scenario.", "Neutrons emitted from the muon-stopping target of the comet experiment could cause fake veto signals in the cosmic veto counter (CVC) and damage the silicon photomultipliers (MPPCs) used in the CVC. On average, neutrons appear in six out of ten muon captures by aluminum nuclei, resulting in a certain number of neutrons per second for the comet phase - i. The neutrons affect the CVC through gamma rays from neutron captures by materials in the comet detector and by kicking out protons and ions in the CVC. There is a threshold for signal amplitudes in the CVC, so low-energy neutrons are rejected and only those with kinetic energy from 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV (fast ones) and up to 10 MeV (medium-energy neutrons) are discussed. \n\nSimulations have shown that fast and medium-energy neutrons interacting with a 7 mm thick polystyrene scintillator predominantly interact elastically, producing charged projectiles (protons and carbon ions) that deposit their kinetic energy through ionization and cause scintillation in polystyrene. The resulting light yield per path length lessens due to saturation effects described by the Birks empiric law.", "Sn 1986e was discovered on April 13, 1986, and initially received little attention. However, interest in the supernova has recently revived due to the discovery of late-time optical emission. There were predictions of possible radio emission for Sn 1986e, but a search in 1995 failed to detect any. However, new observations taken closer to the explosion date confirmed the presence of radio emission from Sn 1986e. The emission is weak but significant and likely originated from the supernova. The radio properties of Sn 1986e are similar to other type IIL supernovae. The lack of radio emission at later times is likely due to limited sensitivity and the age of the supernova. The results suggest that Sn 1986e was a fairly typical type IIL supernova in terms of its radio behavior.", "The standard model (SM) has been successful in explaining many phenomena in particle physics, but there are still unsolved problems such as dark matter and the origin of inflation. One possible explanation for inflation is the Higgs inflation model, which involves the Higgs boson and a real singlet scalar and right-handed neutrinos. This model can explain the recent BICEP2 experiment's observation of a non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio, but the required values of the Higgs and top masses are slightly different from the experimental values. However, with the inclusion of dark matter and the right-handed neutrino, the model can still explain the observations within the experimental range of the mass parameters. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between the dark matter and right-handed neutrino masses. Future experiments will be able to confirm the range of dark matter masses predicted by this model.", "Recent advances in fabrication techniques have allowed for the creation of quantum wires with a hard-wall potential confinement. These wires can be fabricated using technologies such as the implantation-enhanced interdiffusion technique and the molecular beam epitaxy double-growth technique. The theoretical description of quantum wires relies on the concept of edge states, which are determined by the intersection of Landau levels with the Fermi energy. However, the presence of electrostatic screening in strongly modifies the structure of the edge states, leading to compressible and incompressible strips. Many studies have been done on quantum wires with smooth confinement, but the theory for edge-state structure in hard-wall wires accounting for electron-electron interaction and spin effects has not been reported yet. In this paper, the authors present a detailed theory of the magnetosubband and edge-state structure in hard-wall quantum wires, taking into account electron-electron interaction and spin effects using the density functional theory (DFT) in the local spin density approximation (LSDA). They analyze the magnetosubband structure and find that it is qualitatively different from the smooth confinement case. They also find that the exchange and correlation interactions dramatically affect the edge state structure, resulting in spatial spin polarization, periodic spin polarization of the electron density, and modification", "The advent of quantum information science has led to the emergence of two new fields: quantum computation and quantum information networks. Quantum computation involves the use of quantum states called qubits to perform computations that outperform classical computers for certain problems. Quantum information networks are similar to the internet but transmit quantum information through quantum channels. Both quantum computation and quantum information networks require protocols for the secure distribution of quantum states. One such protocol is quantum state sharing, which allows for the secure encoding and distribution of quantum states. This paper presents an experimental demonstration of threshold quantum state sharing in the continuous variable regime, using coherent states as the secret states. The author describes the dealer protocol for encoding and distributing the secret state, as well as several reconstruction protocols for the authorized groups. The state reconstruction is characterized in terms of fidelity, signal transfer, and reconstruction noise. The experimental results show that the fidelity exceeds the classical limit, demonstrating the quantum nature of the state sharing scheme. Additionally, the security of the scheme can be enhanced using classical encoding techniques. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of quantum state sharing for secure quantum communication and information systems.", "The noncommutative Chern-Simons theory has been extensively studied in recent years. Important results include the vanishing of ultraviolet/infrared divergences and the quantization of the Chern-Simons coefficient. The theory has also been linked to the fractional quantum Hall effect. In a previous paper, the interaction of the theory with matter was investigated and it was found that ultraviolet/infrared divergences cancel even when matter is included. In this paper, the investigation is extended to the non-abelian case, showing that the cancellation of singularities requires the gauge group generators to be in the fundamental representation. The finite one-loop quantum corrections to the effective action are also calculated, revealing the generation of nonlocal Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms. The work concludes with a summary of the main findings.", "The best solution for solar neutrino oscillation is believed to be MSW-LMA, which is supported by numerous experiments. This solution predicts that the survival probability of neutrinos in the low energy region is higher than in the high energy region. To observe this low-energy upturn in the spectrum, Super-Kamiokande needs to reduce background and systematic uncertainty below 5.5 MeV and lower the recoil electron energy threshold. Since Super-Kamiokande III, improvements have been made in reducing background and systematic uncertainties, including upgrading the water purification system to reduce radon background events and improving the timing linearity to reduce vertex shift. Other improvements include measuring the time variation of water transparency and water coefficients, and tuning the optical properties to improve the angular resolution. With these improvements, Super-Kamiokande III has taken good solar neutrino data and is currently analyzing it. Preliminary results show the observed neutrino flux, angular distributions, flux time variation, recoil electron energy spectrum, and day/night asymmetry.", "The text discusses the concept of inflation in the early universe and its implications for the distribution of matter and radiation. It explains that inflation is a consequence of the expanding space-time and quantum fluctuations in the scalar field responsible for the expansion. It also discusses the challenges and limitations of studying inflation due to the remote nature of the early universe and the difficulty of testing its predictions. The text concludes by mentioning the trans-plankian problem of inflation and the potential effects of symmetry-breaking at small scales.", "The text discusses the importance of nuclear physics in understanding astrophysical phenomena and the role of nuclear matter in determining the properties of stellar matter and nucleon-nucleon interactions. It also explains the methods used to study nuclear matter, such as the lowest-order constrained variational method (LOCV), which is used to calculate correlation functions, pair distribution functions, and structure functions. The results show the effects of nucleon-nucleon interaction on the properties of nuclear matter and the dependence of these properties on the proton to neutron ratio and isospin channels.", "The text discusses the harmonic oscillator potential for the relativistic spin 1/2, known as the Dirac oscillator. It explores its physical applications and various studies that have been conducted on it. The text also focuses on the thermal properties of the Dirac oscillator, including the degeneracy of the stationary states and the thermodynamic functions. It presents the partition function, mean energy, entropy, and specific heat of the system, and discusses their behavior at high temperatures. The results show that the functions are twice as large as those of the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator and that the specific heat is three times larger than that of the one-dimensional Dirac oscillator. This study provides valuable insights into the thermodynamic properties of the Dirac oscillator and its potential applications.", "The text discusses the addition of a fourth generation of fermions to the standard model of particle physics. The interest in this fourth generation has varied over the years, but recent studies have shown that it is still possible for a sequential fourth generation to exist without conflicting with experimental data. The text also discusses the production and detection of heavy charged leptons from the fourth generation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). It is suggested that detection of the heavy charged lepton may be difficult at the LHC, but can be more easily achieved at the ILC. The text also discusses the implications of the two-Higgs doublet model and the Randall-Sundrum model in relation to the detection of fourth generation fermions. Overall, the text suggests that the presence of a fourth generation of fermions is still plausible and can be studied in future experiments.", "The problem of estimating local expectation values in interacting systems is computationally difficult, especially for disordered systems with glassy behaviors. The cavity method of statistical physics provides efficient algorithms for approximating the local expectation values in finite-connectivity models with locally tree-like interaction graphs. In this work, the authors propose an approximate Bethe free energy for the quantum transverse Ising model using a set of locally consistent reduced density matrices. They compare their results with other quantum cavity methods and exact numerical simulations. The authors also present optimization algorithms to minimize the Bethe free energy and find the optimal reduced density matrices. The results show good agreement with exact solutions and other quantum cavity methods, with the mean-field approximation performing well at high temperatures. The work provides a framework for estimating local expectation values and studying the properties of interacting quantum systems.", "The text describes a numerical simulation of a wave breaking. The computational domain moves with the wave and has periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions and free-slip boundary conditions in the vertical. The wave is characterized by the Froude number, which is unity. The density ratio between the two fluids is 1000:1. The governing equations for the simulation are given, and the temporal integration is handled with an explicit RK2 scheme. The simulation goes through four distinct stages: atmospheric forcing, potential flow before breaking, breaking (which consists of plunging, spilling, and splash-up events), and potential flow after breaking. The simulation is visualized in videos, which are available for download. The scenes in the videos show the evolution of the wave through different stages and highlight features such as the formation of a jet during splash-up and vortex tubes. The work was supported by the United States Office of Naval Research and performed on high-performance computing systems.", "The quasinormal modes (QNM) analysis is a useful tool for studying gravitational perturbations of stars and black holes. It has been extensively used to analyze various types of black hole solutions, including non-asymptotically flat, charged, and time-dependent solutions. The QNM frequencies carry information about the thermal properties of the associated conformal field theory, according to the AdS/CFT conjecture. The Vaidya metric, which describes the spacetime outside a radiating star, has been widely used in the study of time-dependent black holes and the formation of naked singularities. In this paper, the authors present a numerical analysis of the QNM frequencies for a general Vaidya metric, with a focus on nonstationary effects. They also investigate the QNM frequencies in the case of a Vaidya metric evolving towards a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m naked singularity. The results show that the QNM frequencies deviate from the stationary behavior as the mass and charge of the black hole vary, with larger deviations for faster variations. The authors also find that the QNM frequencies are more sensitive to charge variations than mass variations. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the behavior of QNMs in time-dependent backgrounds and their potential to", "The recent discovery of a new particle with properties consistent with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson is the most significant news from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This discovery completes our understanding of the SM, but there are still many open questions. One of the most pressing issues is that the SM does not explain the value of the Higgs mass. In a recent study, it was found that the SM expectation for the Higgs couplings is more than 7 standard deviations away from fits in which there are non-SM contributions to the Higgs coupling or where the sign of the top quark coupling to the Higgs is opposite to that of the SM. This suggests that new physics contributions to the effective couplings of the Higgs are preferred. The extent to which current data constrain invisible decays or undetected decays of the Higgs-like particle was investigated. It was found that the limits on invisible decays from global fits to LHC data depend on the higgs sector model, with the most stringent limits obtained when the Higgs decays into dark matter particles. These limits can be turned into bounds on the dark matter scattering off nucleons, mediated by Higgs exchange. The results suggest that precision measurements of the properties of the H", "Cosmological numerical simulations predict a specific shape for the dark matter density distributions of galaxies, but observations of dwarfs and late-type galaxies show a different shape. This disagreement is known as the \"cusp/core problem\". There have been concerns and criticisms from both observers and simulators regarding the validity of the observations and simulations. Rotation curve data from observers have been criticized for inconsistencies, but these are mostly sociological effects and can be attributed to spin and systematic effects. Furthermore, pointing errors or offsets between dynamical and photometric centers do not explain the observed shallow slopes in rotation curves. Observations of rotation curves of LSB galaxies from different independent groups show good agreement. Some claims in the literature suggesting that rotation curve measurements are unreliable can be debunked when all aspects of the data are taken into account. Simulations of dark matter halos in a cold dark matter universe also do not resolve the innermost scales where discrepancies between observations and simulations occur. The data overwhelmingly prefer soft cores, there is a large range in inner slopes, systematic effects are not significant, observations probe an unexplored regime for simulations, and crucial baryon physics is still missing from simulations.", "The discovery of the planet around 51 Pegasi in 1995 has led to the identification of almost 700 confirmed planets to date. These planets display a range of different characteristics, such as short orbital periods, extreme orbital eccentricities, and strong resonant interactions. Observations have also shown that lower mass planets are more common than gas giants at short periods, and that they appear to form a distinct population for orbital periods between a few and several tens of days. This is in contrast to current planet population synthesis models, which predict a population of partially-accreted giant planet cores in this mass range. The Kepler satellite has begun to release data from its large-scale transit catalogue, supporting the claim that low mass planets outnumber more massive planets. The origins of these low mass planets and their formation on small scales are still poorly understood. Migration models originally proposed for the formation of gas giants are not applicable to the formation of low mass planets. The migration and timing of planet formation is still uncertain, as evidenced by the large numbers of low mass planets seen at short periods. The in situ accumulation of rocky planets without significant late-time gaseous migration is a possible explanation for the formation of these low mass planets. The model predicts that the planets with short orbital periods have both rocky and", "Neutron scattering is a powerful tool for studying the structure and dynamics of condensed matter. It is particularly useful because neutrons are not influenced by the electron cloud of atoms, only interacting with the nucleus. However, when studying molecular systems, additional care is required because neutron scattering is sensitive to orientational correlations. Previous approaches have tried to correct for these effects, but recent studies have shown that the assumptions made in these approaches are not valid for strongly supercooled liquids. With advancements in computer simulations, it is now possible to examine the orientational degrees of freedom in molecular systems in more detail. This paper presents a study on a liquid of diatomic rigid molecules, showing the connection between the neutron scattering function and molecular correlation functions. The results demonstrate that the existence of a prepeak in the static structure factor is closely connected to orientational degrees of freedom. The paper also discusses the limitations of neutron scattering for studying molecules and suggests experimental strategies for determining molecular correlation functions.", "In this paper, the authors investigate the implementation of a two-qubit controlled phase gate in an asymmetric GaAs/AlGaAs coupled-double quantum well (QW) structure. They show that by using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a giant cross-kerr nonlinearity can be achieved, allowing for a nearly unconditional nonlinear phase shift and the creation of a maximally entangled state. The authors propose a practical experimental scheme to identify the maximally entangled state. They also discuss the potential applications of this quantum phase gate in quantum computing and quantum information processing.", "The recent advances in cosmology have led to the discovery that the universe consists of approximately 30% matter (cold dark matter and ordinary matter) and 70% dark energy. This discovery has been made through observations of the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and Type Ia supernovae. However, there are potential sources of error in these measurements, such as intergalactic dust obscuring the light from supernovae, the unknown evolution of supernova brightness with redshift, and gravitational lensing. The magnification of supernovae by gravitational lensing can be calculated using the multiple lens-plane method, which has been implemented in a program called q-let. This program has been used to estimate the magnification of a supernova called sn2003es, which was discovered in the Hubble Deep Field North. The results show that sn2003es is likely to have been significantly magnified by gravitational lensing, which must be taken into account when using the supernova to estimate cosmological parameters. The program q-let can be used to estimate lensing effects on point sources or obtain the intrinsic shape of an elliptical image. The program has been applied to sn2003es and has found that the observed elliptical shape of the host galaxy", "The paper discusses the Fr\u00e9chet distance, a famous distance measure in the field of abstract spaces, and its application in measuring the similarity of polygonal chains. It is well known that the Fr\u00e9chet distance between two two-dimensional polygonal chains can be computed in polynomial time. In three-dimensional space, the minimum Fr\u00e9chet distance between two chains can be computed in different running times depending on the allowed movements of the chains. The paper also introduces the discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance, which is a simplified version of the Fr\u00e9chet distance, and shows how it can be computed in polynomial time. The discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance is applied in aligning the backbones of proteins, and the paper presents an efficient heuristic for this problem. The paper also discusses the protein local structure alignment problem and shows its hardness when many proteins are given, but its solvability in polynomial time when only a small number of proteins are given. The paper concludes with open problems and future research directions.", "A major gap in our understanding of low-mass star formation is the origins of binary stars. About 30 to 50% of low-mass main-sequence stars have companions, and the frequency of young T Tauri binary systems is nearly twice as high. Binary systems have been observed in all stages of evolution and there is evidence for proto-binary systems. It is believed that binary systems form during the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores. To understand this process, high angular resolution studies of the earliest stages of star formation are required. Initial results from a program using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array show the presence of a circumstellar disk in a low-mass protostar associated with a bipolar nebula. The program aims for even higher resolution studies with ALMA. The presence of circumstellar material is confirmed by the detection of molecular gas components at both positions. The double core system of the protostar is gravitationally bound and consistent with the assumption of rotational fragmentation from a single cloud core. The projected separation of the two sources is at the upper end of the pre-main-sequence binary separation distribution, suggesting the presence of a true wide binary protostar system.", "Circular polarization (CP) in extra-galactic radio jets was previously thought to be a very small fraction of the synchrotron emission, with no reliable measurements of CP above 1%. However, computational models showed that local levels of CP could be higher and that it was strongest near the optically thick core of the jet. Faraday conversion was found to be the dominant process for producing CP. The authors emphasized the need for high-resolution studies using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). \n\nThe authors conducted VLBA observations of two quasars and found that CP was associated with the radio core. They detected CP ranging from 7-28% and found that the sign of CP remained consistent across epochs. They also found that levels of CP did not correlate with linear polarization. In a separate study, they observed 40 sources and found CP in 11 objects at levels around 9%. Changes in the sign of CP were rare over long observing periods. \n\nThe authors discuss the challenges in interpreting CP observations and propose that long-term monitoring campaigns are needed to understand the preferred sign of CP in individual sources and its connection to the black hole/accretion disk system. They present VLBA images of two quasars which show CP associated with the core region.", "In condensed matter physics, studying electron transport in an electron lattice driven far from equilibrium is a challenging theoretical goal. Dissipation is a central issue in nonequilibrium systems and must be taken into account explicitly for an accurate theoretical description. In the case of quantum dots under a finite dc bias, the dissipation process can be simplified and the electron transport can be viewed as a transmission problem. The scattering state formulation has been proposed as a solution for studying transient behaviors of interacting models and for describing nonequilibrium steady states. In this paper, the authors introduce a steady-state formulation for lattice models with fermion baths and analyze the properties of the system. They find that the system exhibits a divergent effective temperature in the limit of small damping. They also derive a general dc current relation as an extension of the Meir-Wingreen formula to lattice models. The results suggest that the fermion bath model is a good minimal system to study nonequilibrium strong correlation physics.", "Gait analysis is an important tool in studying human motion. It involves measuring various parameters of a person's gait, such as symmetry and segmental kinematics and kinetics, to evaluate their walking ability and assess any physical injuries or impairments. The motion of the center of mass (COM) of the human body is influenced by external forces like ground reaction force, gravity, and resistance. Previous studies have shown that analyzing the motion of the COM is a reliable method for evaluating gait. However, due to the unique shape, coordination, and strength of each individual, establishing standard gait parameters is challenging. In this study, the authors aim to establish the relationships between ground reaction force, COM velocity, average kinetic energy, and the time of initial foot contact (TIFC) in a stride cycle. They analyze the force distribution in different directions and the dispersion of force, as well as the acceleration, velocity, and displacement of the COM. Their results show that TIFC has a significant impact on the dynamic characteristics of the COM and that the least-action principle plays a role in optimizing gait. The authors suggest that their findings could be applied in various fields, such as rehabilitation therapy, biometric identification, and the control of bipedal robot gaits. However", "Active learning is a process where labeled data is used to construct a classification rule. With the increasing availability of unlabeled data, it becomes important to efficiently utilize this data to construct a classification rule. Active learning algorithms aim to select the most uncertain subjects to be labeled, which are then included in the training set. This process continues until a stopping criterion is reached, such as a predetermined number of labeled subjects. Active learning is related to sequential experimental designs and stochastic approximation processes. This paper proposes a modification of existing active learning algorithms by combining a Bayesian sequential design with an uncertainty sampling method. The proposed method is shown to be more stable and efficient, especially in higher dimensional data sets. The effects of different initial training sizes are also studied, as well as the effects of unequal group sizes. The performance of the proposed method is compared to an existing active learning algorithm using simulated data as well as two real data sets. The proposed method is shown to outperform the existing algorithm, especially when starting with a small amount of labeled data. The performance of the proposed method can be further improved by adjusting the cutting threshold based on the ratio of group sizes.", "The text discusses the development of an effective field theory formalism for describing hadronic scattering processes. The authors introduce the concept of bootstrap equations, which are restrictions on the parameters of the effective Hamiltonian that ensure consistency of the perturbation series. The bootstrap system cannot be solved explicitly, so the only way to check the consistency is through numerical testing. The authors use experimental data to fit the parameters of the theory, and they show that the results are reasonable, providing strong evidence in favor of the consistency of the approach. The authors then apply their formalism to the case of elastic scattering and discuss the resonance spectrum of the reaction. They show that certain sum rules can be well saturated by known experimental data, while others allow speculation about possible scenarios to improve the situation. The authors also explain the theoretical background of their calculations and describe the construction of tree level bootstrap constraints. They show how the tree level amplitude can be determined by minimal parametrization and the method of Cauchy forms. The authors discuss the renormalization invariance of the bootstrap system and its relation to observable physical spectrum. They present numerical tests, including the estimation of coupling constants using sum rules, and demonstrate the consistency of their approach with experimental data. However, they acknowledge that the bootstrap system cannot be solved explicitly", "The text discusses the behavior of low-dimensional electronic systems, particularly in the one-dimensional case. It mentions the Luttinger liquid theory, which describes the low energy dynamics of metallic one-dimensional systems. The text also introduces the concept of chiral Luttinger liquids, which describe the physics of edge states in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The effect of impurities on these systems is discussed, as well as the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a single level attached to a Luttinger liquid. The Hamiltonian for this system is also described. The text then discusses the thermodynamic properties, such as the level population, entropy, and specific heat, which can be derived from the partition function of the model. The coulomb gas expansion is introduced as a method to calculate these properties. The level density of states (LDOS) is also discussed, which is related to the imaginary part of the level retarded Green function. The possibility of having the same level occupation for a Luttinger liquid system and a Fermi liquid system with a properly chosen level-wire coupling is mentioned. Numerical calculations are presented to support these findings, showing that the level population is universal, while the LDOS is not. The population vs. level energy curves are shown to become wider as the", "This paper presents a formal statement and a proof of a discrete version of the Jordan Curve Theorem (JCT) using hypermaps and rings. The JCT states that in a finite subdivision of the plane, breaking a ring of faces increases the connectivity of the subdivision. The paper provides a purely combinatorial proof of the JCT and introduces new planarity and connectivity criteria. The proof is developed and verified using the Coq proof assistant. The paper also summarizes related work in computational topology and provides a brief explanation of the mathematical materials used. The paper concludes by stating that the hypermap framework used in the paper is a useful tool for modeling space subdivisions in geometric modeling and computer imagery.", "Mass segregation is the process in which massive objects in a star cluster become concentrated in the core due to interactions with less massive objects. This phenomenon has attracted recent interest due to the possibility of forming exotic objects such as very massive black holes. The timescale of mass segregation, which is the time it takes for segregation to occur, is an important parameter. Analytical studies of mass segregation have been limited, with most studies using numerical methods. In this study, the authors analytically study a two-component star cluster and derive the timescale of mass segregation. They compare their result with previous studies and use it to discuss the origin of a very massive black hole found in a young star cluster in the galaxy M82. The authors find that the timescale of mass segregation is less than the age of the star cluster and discuss possible implications for the formation of the black hole.", "Quarks are fundamental particles with fractional electric charges that are difficult to observe due to the phenomenon of confinement. However, in certain condensed matter systems, there are excitations carrying fractional quantum numbers that are deconfined and have been experimentally detected. The confinement of these excitations can be observed in quasi-1D spin ladders, where spinons, the quarks in this system, are confined into integral spin-1 excitations called magnons. Recent neutron scattering experiments have observed a finite temperature confined-deconfined crossover in a weakly coupled ladder material. In this paper, the authors use ultracold atoms in optical lattices to study the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of a two-leg spin ladder model and visualize the confinement mechanism. They find that two spinons initially decoupled will become confined due to a linear potential between them, leading to oscillations in their dynamics. The authors also verify their results with numerical simulations and discuss the experimental realization of their model with ultracold atomic superlattices. This work provides insight into the dynamics and manipulation of quasiparticles in strongly correlated systems and has potential applications in the study of domain wall dynamics.", "Neoplastic diseases cause 7 million deaths annually, making up 12% of deaths worldwide. Mathematical and computer modeling can aid in understanding cancer progression and selecting therapeutic strategies. Continuous models have been proposed to describe tumor growth, with avascular tumor growth following different rules such as Gompertzian and logistic functions. Discrete approaches can capture the time-spatial patterns of tumor growth and have been used in cellular automata models. The response to therapy is also studied in mathematical models to identify optimal treatment strategies. A two-dimensional cellular automata model is proposed to describe avascular tumor growth, taking into account the competition between normal and cancer cells, nutrient availability, and necrosis. The model captures the Gompertzian behavior of tumor growth and the effects of therapy. Parameter analysis shows the importance of early initiation of treatment and highlights the relevance of certain parameters in tumor dynamics. Further studies to compare the model with in vitro tumor growth and to include the angiogenic process are suggested.", "Solar activity, including sunspots, flares, and eruptions, varies cyclically with a period of about 11 years. The current cycle is among the weaker ones compared to previous cycles. The weak activity of the previous cycle can be attributed to a low polar magnetic field and low heliospheric open flux. Surface flux transport (SFT) simulations can accurately represent the large-scale solar surface field by considering the emergence of sunspot groups and the transport of magnetic flux by plasma flows. The strength of the polar fields depends on the tilt angle of the sunspot groups, the distribution of emerging flux, and the speed of the meridional flow. SFT simulations have been able to reproduce the polar fields for cycles before cycle 23, but cannot reproduce the very weak polar field during cycle 23. The tilt angles of the sunspot groups are a likely cause of the weak polar fields, and the scatter of the tilt angles can cause variations in the resulting polar field. The weak polar fields in cycle 23 have a significant impact on the amplitude of cycle 24. Simulations using actual individual tilt angles produce a closer match to the observed evolution of the surface field and axial dipole moment than simulations using Joy's law for the tilt angles. The discrepancy between the simulations", "Large sparse networks are common in transportation and communication systems, both man-made and natural. These networks exhibit randomness and self-induced structure, which affect the flow of transport and resilience against congestion or breakdowns. One notable feature of communication networks is the highly skewed distribution of the degree (number of neighbors) of vertices. Avalanche breakdown in networks where edges or vertices are sensitive to overload is a serious threat. In this paper, the authors investigate the overload breakdown problem when edges are sensitive to overloading using the Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) model. The load on the edges is defined by the betweenness centrality, a measure of communication and transport flow. The authors explore the effects of preferential attachment and random attachment in the growth of networks. They find that random attachment leads to a more stable network in the presence of overload breakdowns, while preferential attachment results in large successive avalanches that fragment the network. The authors also study the effects of network size and show that larger networks are more robust against overload breakdowns. The results suggest that in real-world communication networks, vertex overload is a greater threat than edge overload and congestion control strategies should focus on balancing the load on vertices.", "This text discusses the opacity of dust in galaxies and its impact on observations. It highlights the questions of when galaxies started to be enriched in metals and dust, where the dust is located within a galaxy, and how much dust is present. The text also discusses the fraction of stellar radiation that is reprocessed into the infrared, and the cosmic infrared background observed by COBE. It mentions that heavy dust extinction in nearby starburst galaxies prevents the establishment of the stellar initial mass function and biases measurements of galaxy star formation rates. Additionally, the text addresses the relationship between dust content and gas content in galaxies, as well as the limitations of interpreting galaxy data due to dust extinction. It summarizes the main results obtained so far in determining the dust opacity of galaxies and discusses the different methods used for measuring dust opacity, such as tests of surface brightness dependence on inclination, multi-wavelength comparisons, and statistical analysis of color and number count variations. The text also discusses the dust properties in different types of galaxies, such as spirals, ellipticals, and starbursts, and highlights the differences in dust obscuration and reddening in these systems. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding dust opacity in order to interpret galaxy observations and trace the chemical evolution of galaxies.", "The paper discusses the possibility of studying the properties of dark energy through long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. It explores two models of neutrino dark energy - one with a quintessence-like scalar and the other with a phantom-like scalar. The authors calculate the spatial variation of the dark energy field inside the Earth for both cases and find that the evolution of neutrino masses differs significantly. They argue that this difference can be used to probe the nature of dark energy. The work is supported by various grants from the NSF of China and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.", "The article discusses the use of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method for calculating properties of quantum impurity models. The authors compare DMRG with other methods such as numerical renormalization group (NRG) and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC). They show that DMRG is a highly accurate method for calculating ground state properties and can be used for calculating spectral functions directly in the real frequency domain. The authors also introduce a method for calculating peak structures in the spectral function by using complete diagonalization of an effective Hamiltonian. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for calculating spectral functions of single and multi-impurity models.", "The text discusses the theory of electroweak baryogenesis, which is a mechanism for explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It explains that the necessary ingredients for this theory are baryon number violation, CP violation, and non-equilibrium conditions. The text also discusses the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking and how it leads to the generation of a baryon asymmetry. It explains that the Standard Model of particle physics satisfies the Sakharov criteria for baryogenesis, but it cannot generate the required value of baryon asymmetry. The text suggests that the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) provides a more promising framework for electroweak baryogenesis. It explains that the MSSM includes additional sources of CP violation and can generate a larger baryon asymmetry. The text concludes by discussing the importance of measuring the CP-violating phases in order to verify the theory of electroweak baryogenesis.", "Radiative recombination (RR) is a process that occurs in various plasmas and in collisions between heavy ions and electrons. Detailed studies on RR have been conducted for many elements and at different collision energies. Recent studies have focused on the capture of electrons into excited ionic states and the subsequent decay of those states. These decay processes are closely related to the magnetic sublevel population of the excited ions. While most studies have only observed the decay photons, there is growing interest in measuring both the recombination and decay photons in coincidence, as this can provide more information about the collision dynamics. This type of coincidence study can also be valuable for developing new experimental techniques, such as determining the polarization properties of heavy ion beams. However, little attention has been paid to the theoretical foundation of these coincidence RR experiments. In this study, the authors investigate the polarization correlations between the recombination and subsequent decay photons in the radiative recombination of bare, high-Z ions. They use the density matrix theory based on Dirac's relativistic equation to describe these correlations. The authors derive the general expression for the double-differential RR cross section and analyze two specific scenarios: the correlation between the angular distribution of the recombination radiation and the linear polarization of the subsequent decay photons, and the correlation between", "Research activities on single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have increased in recent years due to their unique properties. However, future applications require a better understanding of their growth mechanisms, as well as the production of pure SWNTs in large quantities. SWNTs are typically synthesized using high-temperature techniques, such as arc discharge or laser ablation, or medium-temperature techniques like chemical vapor deposition. The presence of a transition metal catalyst is necessary for synthesis, but its role is still uncertain. The vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) model is often used to describe the growth mechanism of SWNTs, where carbon segregates towards the catalyst surface and forms carbonaceous structures. Computer simulations and theoretical models have confirmed this model, with differences between high temperature and medium temperature routes. In chemical vapor deposition, the size of the tubes is determined by the size of the catalyst particle. Carbon atoms at the catalyst surface self-organize and form graphene-like sheets, which can detach to form nanotubes. However, in high temperature routes, nanotube bundles grow perpendicularly to the surface, and it is not fully understood why this is more advantageous than tangential growth. Theories based on classical nucleation and growth thermodynamic models have been proposed, suggesting", "Blind quantum computation (BQC) is a secure computation protocol in which a client instructs a server with a quantum computer to perform computations on the client's data without revealing any information. BQC protocols should have the properties of blindness, correctness, and verifiability. Several BQC protocols have been proposed, but most require the client to have some quantum abilities. However, a modified double-server BQC protocol has been proposed that allows a completely classical client and allows the two servers to communicate with each other. This protocol is secure even if the servers communicate and can be easily modified to be a single-server BQC protocol. These protocols are practical for cloud quantum computation as they only require a trusted center to prepare bell states and do not require the client to have any special equipment.", "The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope has made significant discoveries in the field of high-energy astrophysics, including the identification of gamma-ray emitting pulsars. Some of these pulsars, known as millisecond pulsars, have been found in binary systems, where their gamma-ray radiation is ablating their companion stars. These pulsars are called black widows or redbacks, depending on the mass of the companion star. Previously, only pulsars that emit both gamma-rays and radio waves have been identified, but there is a possibility of \"radio-dim\" millisecond pulsars that emit gamma-rays but not radio waves. To identify these sources, the authors selected gamma-ray sources that exhibit variability, have a high galactic latitude, and have a spectral shape that is not well-fitted by a power-law model. They identified the first \"radio-dim\" millisecond pulsar candidate, named 2FGLJ2339.60532, but further observations revealed that it is not \"radio-dim\" after all. In this letter, the authors report the identification of a new \"radio-dim\" millisecond pulsar candidate, 2FGLJ1653.6-0159, and its possible association with an ultracompact x-ray binary", "The text discusses the formation and evolution of white dwarf stars. It is known that stars of low and intermediate mass will end their lives as white dwarfs. There is a maximum mass for white dwarfs, known as Chandrasekhar's mass. Below this critical mass, there are three different families of white dwarfs with different chemical compositions. The upper limit for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs is still subject to debate but is estimated to be around 1.05 times the mass of the sun. White dwarfs with a carbon-oxygen core are believed to have a minimum mass of around 0.5 times the mass of the sun. Stars with masses lower than about 0.5 times the mass of the sun do not ignite helium-burning and die as white dwarfs with a helium-rich core. However, it has been shown that in close binary systems, stars with initial masses of 3 times the mass of the sun can produce white dwarfs with a significant carbon-oxygen core. The text presents detailed evolutionary computations that show it is possible to produce carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses as low as 0.33 times the mass of the sun. These low-mass white dwarfs have a different cooling evolution and are more expanded than helium-core", "The text discusses the discovery and characterization of the soft gamma repeater sgr1627-41. It was discovered in 1998 by multiple observatories and was found to be consistent with a magnetar, a neutron star with a strong magnetic field. An observation with the ASCA satellite was conducted in 1999 to search for periodicity and measure the spindown rate. No bursts were observed during the ASCA observation, and spectral analysis revealed a preference for a power law fit. A search for periodicity found a prominent peak at 0.10821 Hz, consistent with the earlier BeppoSAX observation. The text also discusses the fading trend in the quiescent emission of sgr1627-41 observed in earlier BeppoSAX observations and confirms that the trend did not continue in the ASCA observation. The mechanisms for variability in quiescent soft x-ray counterparts to soft gamma repeaters are not well understood, but further observations with the Chandra satellite could provide more insight into sgr1627-41 and its precise position.", "The text introduces the fundamental theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which has both a local gauge symmetry (color symmetry) and an approximate global symmetry (chiral symmetry). For low temperature and density, quarks and gluons are confined into colorless hadrons. The chiral symmetry predominantly determines hadronic interactions in the low-energy region. The text then discusses the two different ways in which chiral symmetry can be realized in effective field theories: linear and non-linear. It focuses on the linear representation of chiral symmetry and the study of a linear sigma model. The model is used to analyze two different scenarios for the assignment of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. Scenario I assumes that scalar fields correspond to quarkonium states, while scenario II assumes they correspond to tetraquark or mesonic molecular states. The text presents the lagrangian of the model and discusses the parameters that do not enter the fit of the decay widths and scattering lengths. It then provides formulas for the decay widths and pion-pion scattering lengths and presents the results of the fit and comparison to experimental data for scenario I and scenario II. The results of scenario I are inconsistent with experimental data, while scenario II is consistent with the data, although with some uncertainties. The", "Dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors (DFSs) are materials that exhibit semiconducting charge transport behavior along with ferromagnetic order induced by a small amount of magnetic impurities. These materials have been the subject of significant fundamental research into dilute magnetism and have important applications in the field of spintronics. Recently, a new family of DFSs based on the chemistry and structure of iron-based superconductors has been discovered. These materials possess attractive characteristics such as the ability to control the charge-carrier and spin concentrations independently and the availability of bulk-form and single-crystal specimens. In this study, the authors investigate the atomic and magnetic structures of one particular DFS called KFe2As2N2 using temperature-dependent atomic and magnetic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements. They found that the material undergoes a local orthorhombic distortion as the temperature is lowered, and this distortion relaxes back to the average tetragonal structure at low temperatures. The neutron PDF measurements also revealed short-range ferromagnetic correlations between nearest-neighbor Mn spins persisting up to 300 K. These results provide important insights into the atomic and magnetic behavior of DFS materials.", "The text discusses the problem of Quality of Service (QoS) management for web-based applications and proposes a solution called Self Overload Control (SOC). The SOC policy aims to handle sudden surges in traffic and adaptively manage system resources to meet the QoS requirements. It incorporates a change detection mechanism to detect sudden changes in traffic and switches between two modes: normal mode and flash crowd management mode. In normal mode, the policy regulates the admission of new sessions based on a dynamically adjusted upper limit on the admission rate. In flash crowd management mode, the policy increases the rate of performance controls to quickly adapt to the surge in traffic. The SOC policy is designed to be fast reactive, autonomous, and requires no modification to client or server software. The text compares the SOC policy to other existing approaches and demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of performance and stability, particularly in managing flash crowds.", "Researchers have developed high-quality type IIA diamond crystal plates with (111) surface orientation for use in advanced x-ray crystal optics at synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). The production of defect-free (111) crystal plates is challenging due to the high atomic density of these planes. These diamond plates are primarily used in high-heat-load double-crystal monochromators at synchrotron undulator beamlines. The use of diamond crystals instead of silicon for beam-multiplexing XFEL monochromators allows for greater stability and higher transmittance of the x-ray beam. Mounting-induced crystal strain and crystal defects can affect the crystal diffraction performance and disturb the radiation wavefront. To minimize these effects, the researchers developed a special mounting method using diamond materials. The mounting-induced strain was evaluated using double-crystal x-ray topography, and the strain was found to be smaller than the angular divergence of the XFEL beam. The diamond crystal assemblies were successfully installed in a beam-multiplexing monochromator and demonstrated the capability of splitting the XFEL beam into a pink and a monochromatic branch.", "The behavior of rare earth metals and their compounds under pressure has been studied for decades, with the volume collapse transition attracting attention. Volume collapse transitions have been observed in cerium, praseodymium, gadolinium, and dysprosium, while no significant collapses have been detected in neodymium, promethium, and samarium. High temperature experiments have shown signatures related to the localized-itinerant transition in neodymium and samarium. There are two main viewpoints on the volume collapse transition: the Mott transition and the Kondo volume collapse. The Mott transition involves a change from localized to more extended states, while the Kondo volume collapse involves the loss of Kondo screening of the local moment. The behavior of the rare earth metals under pressure has been studied using various methods, including density functional theory and correlated band theories. The results suggest that the magnetic moment in the rare earth metals remains stable under pressure, with no significant moment collapse. However, the pressure at which the moment begins to decrease is still a topic of debate. Overall, the behavior of the rare earth metals under pressure is complex and involves a combination of effects, including changes in electronic structure and magnetic moments.", "The quasar APM 08279 + 5255 was discovered in a survey for high galactic latitude carbon stars. It has a redshift of z=3.91 and is strongly gravitationally lensed. Although it does not have a strong infrared excess, it is a bright source in the IRAS catalog. The presence of large quantities of gas and dust in this high redshift system makes it a prime candidate for studying complex molecules at high redshift. The spectral energy distribution of APM 08279 + 5255 is well-fitted with a black body of temperature 4220K and has a smooth continuum. Only two emission lines, corresponding to redshifted hydrogen recombination lines, were detected in the spectrum. The overall continuum is consistent with a model of dust in an accretion disk heated by an underlying central source. The non-detection of organic molecules in the spectrum is consistent with previous observations of quasars. The observed line ratios and widths suggest the need for more detailed physical models of the broad line regions in quasars.", "Trapping and controlling neutral atoms has become a highly active area of research in physics. These systems allow for experiments to study fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and have potential applications in quantum information processing. Advances in technology have allowed for progress in this field, particularly in the control and preparation of single atom states. One area of interest is the controlled movement of atoms between different regions in space. Direct tunneling is a method that can achieve this, but it is difficult to achieve high fidelities. Recently, a process called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) has been proposed as a way to achieve robust transfer of atoms with high fidelity. STIRAP is a technique that was originally developed for transitions in optical systems and makes use of a two-photon Raman process. In this work, the authors focus on atom-chip systems and investigate their suitability for observing the STIRAP process. Atom-chip systems consist of current-carrying wires mounted on a surface, which can be loaded with ultracold atom gases. The authors present simulations to demonstrate the viability of STIRAP in these systems, showing that a counter-intuitive approach leads to larger transfer and can be distinguished from direct tunneling. Overall, this work provides insight into the potential use", "Stellar geriatrics refers to the study of the aging process of low- and intermediate-mass stars and the mass loss they undergo. This mass loss results in the ejection of material into the interstellar medium and has implications for the chemical makeup of galaxies. Understanding the mass loss process can provide insights into the formation of dust and molecules in the stellar wind. Observations with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) could help to study the dust formation process, maser emission from gas in the stellar wind, and the chemical structure of evolved stars.", "This paper presents a generalized universal cover for a large class of uniform spaces called coverable spaces. These coverable spaces include various types of spaces such as geodesic metric spaces, connected and locally pathwise connected compact topological spaces, peano continua, as well as some more pathological spaces like the topologist's sine curve and totally disconnected spaces. The generalized universal cover is associated with a functorial uniform space invariant called the deck group, which is related to the classical fundamental group. The paper also discusses the importance of topological groups, compact topological spaces, and metric spaces. The traditional definition of covering maps is discussed and it is shown that the lifting property of covering maps can be generalized. The paper concludes with various results and examples related to metric spaces, including the existence of a deck group and the relationship between the deck group and the fundamental group.", "The authors describe a method called Fixed-Node Monte Carlo (FNMC) for lattice systems, inspired by a similar method for continuous systems. They explain how FNMC can be used to obtain approximate information about the true ground state of a system by extending the method, as well as the importance of the trial wave function in determining the quality and accuracy of the results. The authors provide examples of applications of the method, comparing their results to those in the literature, and discuss the limitations and need for further investigation of wave functions.", "The study focuses on the behavior of electron pairs in superconducting rings under the influence of an external electric field. The rings are described by the attractive Hubbard model, where the attractive interaction between electrons leads to superconductivity. The breaking of electron pairs depends on the strength of the electric field and attractive interaction. The flux quantization and off-diagonal long-range order are key characteristics of superconductors. The study also investigates the time evolution of the pair correlation function and the time-averaged current as a response to the applied electric field. The results show that the applied electric field can induce a transition from a superconducting to a metallic phase.", "The text discusses the effects of charging on single layer graphene and other nanomaterials such as graphane, fluorographene, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide. It explores how the properties of these materials can be modified by creating excess electrical charge and the potential applications in nanotechnology. The study shows that the conductivity of graphene can be controlled by tuning the charge carriers between electrons and holes. It also investigates the exfoliation of single layer graphene, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide under static charging. The results suggest that the bond lengths and lattice constants increase as a result of electron removal, leading to phonon softening. The excess positive charge accumulates mainly at the outermost atomic layers, causing repulsion between these layers and eventual exfoliation. The study concludes that caution must be exercised in studies involving negative charging with large vacuum spacing, but positive charging can be treated safely with large vacuum spacing. Overall, the research provides insights into the effects of charging on the structural and electronic properties of these nanomaterials.", "Modified versions of general relativity are gaining interest as alternatives to Einstein's theory of gravitation. These modified theories can accurately describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. It has been shown that the explicit form of the curvature function can be reconstructed from the expansion history of the universe. Although modified versions of general relativity are mathematically equivalent to scalar field theories, they do not always exhibit the same physical behaviors. Therefore, it is not necessary to always use this mathematical equivalence to justify modified gravity. The text discusses various models of modified gravity and analyzes their properties using the noether charge method. The entropy of black holes in these models is calculated and compared to the classical result. The models considered in the analysis pass solar system tests and exhibit interesting features. The text concludes by comparing the different models and providing a brief summary of their characteristics.", "This text discusses the fragmentation of molecular clouds (MCs) induced by supersonic turbulence and its importance in the star formation process. It explains that previous statistical studies on turbulent fragmentation have been based on idealized simulations and do not address issues such as the origin of the turbulence, the formation and dispersion of MCs, and the finite lifetime of clouds. The authors present a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of MC turbulence driven by supernovae explosions, which allows them to test the effect of a realistic driving force. They analyze the compressive ratio of the turbulence and its relation to the statistics of density fluctuations within MCs. They find that the compressive ratio follows a lognormal distribution and is lower than the equipartition value found in simulations with purely compressive driving. Gravity does not significantly affect the compressive ratio. The authors also study the overall expansion/contraction and rotation of MCs and find that they are a small fraction of the total velocity dispersion. The density fluctuations in MCs are found to follow a similar relation as in idealized simulations, but with a large scatter. The authors suggest that models of star formation based on supersonic turbulence should take into account the distribution of the compressive ratio derived in this work.", "Researchers have measured the scattering length for the highly magnetic and heavy lanthanide atom dysprosium (Dy). The scattering length is a parameter that characterizes the contact-like potential approximation of the van der Waals potential, and it plays a crucial role in predicting the cross section of ultracold atomic collisions. The measurement was achieved by comparing the observed rethermalization dynamics of an ultracold gas of Dy to numerical simulations that account for the effects of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The results show that the scattering length for Dy is about 0.63 times the Bohr radius for the isotope Dy-164 and about 0.47 times the Bohr radius for the isotope Dy-162. These values are consistent with previous theoretical and experimental work and provide valuable information for engineering and interpreting quantum many-body systems involving Dy.", "The text discusses the properties of isostatic lattices, which are networks that have the same number of constraints as degrees of freedom. The elastic properties of these lattices depend on their coordination number, which is the average number of connections each node has. When the coordination number is large enough, the lattice behaves like an elastic solid, while if it is small enough, the lattice has floppy deformation modes. As the coordination number increases, there is a transition from floppy to rigid behavior, called rigidity percolation. The rigidity of the lattice also depends on the boundary conditions imposed on the lattice. The text focuses on a particular class of isostatic lattices derived from the kagome lattice. These lattices have interesting properties, such as a vanishing bulk modulus and maximally auxetic behavior, where they expand in one direction when stretched in the orthogonal direction. The text also discusses the effect of boundary conditions on the modes and spectrum of the lattice. Additionally, the text mentions other types of isostatic lattices and points out their potential applications in different systems.", "The nature of dark matter (DM) is still unknown and is a central problem in particle physics and cosmology. One possibility is that DM is made up of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which could be produced in the early universe and account for the observed DM density. Many theories, such as supersymmetry (SUSY), propose WIMP candidates. There have been various attempts to detect DM, including direct detection experiments that look for scattering of DM particles off nuclei. The DAMA/LIBRA collaboration reported a possible DM signal, but this has been challenged by other experiments such as COGENT, CDMS, Xenon, and Zeplin. The CDMS-II collaboration has also reported two events compatible with a WIMP signal. However, more evidence is needed to claim a discovery of DM. Collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can also provide information about DM. Combining data from different experiments can lead to a better understanding of DM properties.", "Barred spiral galaxies are an ideal environment for studying star formation because they have various regions with different levels of star formation activity. In these galaxies, the star formation rates can vary dramatically, with higher rates observed in the circumnuclear region compared to the bar itself. Observations have found that the molecular gas and HII regions in these galaxies are usually offset, with HII regions preferentially located towards the leading side of the molecular gas. This offset is believed to be evidence of star formation induced by a spiral density wave. However, there are cases where this offset is absent or even inverted along the spiral arms. In this study, the authors focused on the unique region between the bar ends and the nucleus, known as the bar. Using observations from the BIMA survey of nearby galaxies, they found that the majority of the HII region emission was offset towards the leading side of the molecular gas in all six galaxies studied. The offset between the two varied from 0-800 pc, with larger offsets observed in stronger barred galaxies. The authors discuss two possible gas flow models to explain these observations: n-body/sticky particle models and hydrodynamic models. They find that both models can explain the observed offset, but neither is entirely satisfactory. Overall, the study provides insights into the", "The text discusses the role of spinor fields in the evolution of the universe. It explains that spinor fields can play a crucial role in solving problems such as the initial singularity, isotropization, and late-time acceleration of the universe. The text also explores different scenarios where spinor fields can be used to simulate perfect fluid, dark energy, and quintessence. It concludes that the non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor of the spinor field have a significant impact on the evolution of the universe.", "The text discusses the importance of laser frequency stabilization for various applications such as atom cooling, high resolution spectroscopy, and precision measurements. It describes different techniques for frequency locking, including Doppler-free techniques, and highlights the use of tunable Doppler-free dichroic lock (TDFDL) spectroscopy as a new method for laser frequency stabilization. The TDFDL signal is generated by overlapping a weak probe beam with a counter-propagating strong pump beam in an atomic vapor cell placed in a weak magnetic field. The text presents experimental results showing the dependence of the TDFDL signal's amplitude and slope on various parameters such as pump beam power and magnetic field strength. It also discusses the use of the TDFDL signal for locking the laser frequency in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) setup. The frequency stability of the laser system is demonstrated, and the reduction in fluctuations of the number of cold atoms in the MOT after locking the laser frequency is shown. The text concludes by highlighting the advantages of the TDFDL technique, including its robust locking capability and large tunability without compromising the signal's slope.", "The text discusses the performance of wireless communication systems in the low-power regime, specifically in terms of the spectral efficiency and bit-energy tradeoff. It focuses on the impact of limitations on the input signals, such as fourth moment constraints and peak power constraints. The results show that achieving the minimum bit energy in the low-power regime is challenging and requires efficient signaling schemes. The text introduces the oobpsk and ooqpsk signaling schemes, which are found to be optimal in certain cases. The wideband slope, which captures the tradeoff between bandwidth and power, is also analyzed. Finally, the text discusses the spectral efficiency of the average power limited Rician fading channel with phase noise.", "The text discusses the discovery and study of actively star-forming galaxies that are routinely discovered through color selection. These galaxies, known as \"dropouts,\" are important in the early universe due to their ubiquity. The text also mentions the ongoing effort to study young galaxies without AGN at the earliest cosmic epochs. The text also describes the spectral characteristics of these galaxies, including the variation in emission and absorption strengths, as well as the presence of p Cygni line profiles. Dust reddening and extinction are also discussed as important factors in understanding these distant starburst systems. The text also mentions the observation of multiple velocity components in some galaxies and the potential for galactic superwinds in young systems. The text concludes by discussing ongoing observations and the future potential for studying these galaxies at even higher redshifts.", "The paper discusses the geodesic motion of test particles around charged black holes in gauged supergravity theories. The authors study both massive neutral particles and massless particles in the exterior region of these black holes. They analyze the effective potentials and derive the equations of motion for different types of orbits, including stable and unstable circular orbits, planetary orbits, and terminating bound orbits. The authors also calculate the time periods and the advances of perihelion for massive test particles and discuss the cone of avoidance for massless test particles. They find that the presence and behavior of the horizon and the orbits depend on the number of charges and other parameters of the black holes. The results obtained in the paper are consistent with those of well-known black hole spacetimes, such as Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-AdS black holes.", "The text discusses the search for the lithium isotope in metal-poor stars and the reasons for the interest in this research. It mentions previous detections of the isotope in certain stars and the need for more data to further test models for the formation and evolution of lithium. The text then discusses the use of high-resolution spectrographs to obtain data on a metal-poor halo star, including the use of both 1D and 3D model atmospheres. The results show a possible detection of the isotope in the star, but caution that further analysis is needed due to uncertainties in the determination of stellar line broadening. The text also discusses the discrepancy in lithium abundance between this star and another similar star, and suggests possible explanations for this difference. Finally, the text mentions the potential for future surveys using high-resolution spectrographs to gather data on the lithium isotope in stars with a wide range of metallicities.", "The paper presents an algorithm called Dynamical Generalized Polynomial Chaos (DGPC) for solving stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with uncertainties. The algorithm combines polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) with the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion to capture the randomness in SPDEs. The algorithm dynamically constructs PCEs and uses adaptive restarts to mitigate the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the Burgers equation and the stochastic Navier-Stokes system. The results show that DGPC achieves similar accuracy to the Monte Carlo method for a smaller computational cost. The algorithm is also able to capture long-time behavior and converge to invariant measures for the SPDEs.", "This text discusses a non-linear sigma model that includes scalar and gauge fields. The model is a gauged O(3) sigma model with a nonminimal coupling, which includes both Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms. The self-dual soliton solutions for this model are obtained at a critical value for the nonminimal coupling constant. These solitons have quantized energy and magnetic flux for topological solitons, while nontopological solitons do not have quantized magnetic flux. The presence of a neutral scalar field is important for obtaining self-dual solutions. The energy functional and the equations of motion for the gauge field in this model are also discussed. Numerical calculations are performed to obtain the soliton profiles for both topological and nontopological solitons. The results are compared to those of a pure Chern-Simons model and show similar behaviors for certain values of the coupling constant. This model could be used to analyze the relation between Maxwell, Hopf, and Skyrme terms and break the scale invariance of the sigma model.", "Helium is the only known element to become a superfluid at low temperatures. Parahydrogen, which consists of molecules of spin zero, has the potential to become a second superfluid, but its crystallization at higher temperatures has prevented its observation. However, the freezing temperature of a fluid can be lowered by confining it in a porous medium. Previous attempts to confine parahydrogen in a vycor matrix did not show any evidence of superfluid behavior. Computer simulations of parahydrogen in confinement showed that nanoscale confinement greatly enhances its superfluid response. The superfluid response is dependent on the strength of the adsorption and the size of the cavity. Weakly attractive cavities enhance intermolecular quantum exchanges and increase the superfluid response. Theoretical predictions and simulations suggest that the superfluid response of confined parahydrogen can be detected by neutron scattering measurements. The study was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).", "Dwarf satellites of large galaxies, known as dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies, tend to be gas deficient compared to isolated dwarfs. Dwarf irregular (dirr) galaxies, on the other hand, have ongoing star formation and show indications of rotational support. Transition dwarfs, which are gas-rich, have little or no detectable HII regions but show indications of recent star formation. It is believed that internal feedback, such as winds from supernovae, and environmental influences play a role in the gas loss of dwarf galaxies. \n\nIn this study, the authors compare the structure of the isolated dwarf galaxy Pegasus (DDO 216) and show that it displays the characteristic signature of ram pressure stripping, providing evidence for the existence of a hot gas associated with the local group. They obtained photometry of Pegasus and observed its stellar and gaseous structure. They found that Pegasus is significantly more extended than previously recognized and that its HI distribution has a cometary appearance, similar to gas undergoing ram pressure stripping. \n\nThe authors calculate the density of the medium required to strip Pegasus and conclude that it is strong evidence for the existence of a local group inter-galactic medium. They suggest that the source of the gas stripping is associated with the local", "The text discusses observations of the lobes of Pictor A, a radio galaxy, using the Chandra and XMM-Newton space observatories. The study aims to understand the physics behind the x-ray emission from the lobes and investigate the assumption of minimum energy (equipartition) in the lobes. The results suggest that the x-ray emission is non-thermal and due to inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. The magnetic field in the lobes is estimated to be a factor of 2.7 below equipartition, indicating a dominance of particle energy. Spatially resolved analysis reveals an increase in magnetic field behind the east lobe hot spot and a correlation between magnetic field and radio flux density variations. The results support the idea of magnetic field decay and particle diffusion in the lobes. However, the equipartition assumption is not completely satisfied.", "The MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) instrument is a large integral field spectrograph that will be commissioned as a second-generation VLT (Very Large Telescope) instrument starting in 2012. It has a wide-field mode with a 1 arc-minute field of view sampled at 0.2 resolution, and an adaptive-optics supported mode with a narrow-field mode with sampling at 0.75. Each exposure delivers about 90,000 spectra using 24 slicer integral field units (IFUs), each equipped with a separate 4kx4k CCD. The full wavelength range from 465 to 930 nm is covered with resolution between 2000 and 4000. The spectrograph in each IFU disperses the light and focuses the spectral pattern on a 4kx4k CCD. The raw data is about 800 MB in size, and a processed exposure can require about 4.5 GB of storage. The main goals of the MUSE data processing pipeline are to reduce all exposures into ready-to-use datacubes, track bad pixels, propagate error information, and minimize the rebinning steps. The pipeline uses a one-step resampling approach to avoid adding noise through multiple resampling steps. The final design", "This text discusses the idea of reading classical data using quantum states in the context of quantum information and quantum technology. It presents the standard implementations of reading based on optical technologies and introduces the concept of quantum reading capacity. The text then discusses two main coding protocols used in optical settings - amplitude shift keying (ASK) and phase shift keying (PSK). It shows that in the low-energy regime, the maximum probability of error decreases with the amount of quantum correlations present in the transmitter state, as quantified by the discord of response. It compares the performance of classical and quantum Gaussian states of light and shows that strongly discordant squeezed thermal states possess a higher reading efficiency than classical states with the same energy. Finally, it compares different families of discordant Gaussian states and shows that thermal squeezed states have enhanced quantum advantage over the corresponding noisy classical resources.", "The low mass x-ray binary 4u1608@xmath052 was first observed in 1971. It is the same source as the Norma Burster, which was the first to discover x-ray bursts. 4u1608@xmath052 is classified as an atoll source and shows outbursts at varying intervals. It has a hard power law component in its x-ray spectrum and exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations at a frequency of 29 hz. The authors of the study report the discovery of a new quasi-periodic oscillation at a frequency of 650-850 hz in 4u1608@xmath052. They observed the source using the Proportional Counter Array on board NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during an x-ray outburst in 1996. They found that the qpo peak varied in frequency and amplitude during their observations. The authors also compared their results to those from another atoll source, 4u1728@xmath034, as well as the z-source Sco X-1. They discussed the beat frequency model as a possible explanation for the 800 hz qpo in 4u1608@xmath052 but noted that their data did not support this interpretation.", "The triple junction (TJ) is a line where three grain boundaries (GBs) meet together. TJs are believed to greatly influence properties of nanocrystalline materials and can play a significant role during plastic deformation and diffusional creep. However, TJs are less studied than GBs or dislocations. Experimental investigations of TJs are complicated by factors such as their high mobility. Some theoretical models assume fast TJ diffusion to explain the behavior of nanocrystalline materials, but there is currently no reliable experimental information on TJ diffusion. Atomistic simulations offer a way to predict self-diffusion coefficients, but they face challenges in studying TJ motion at finite temperatures. In this work, the authors use three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations to compute self-diffusion coefficients along a representative TJ and compare them with those in the adjoining GBs. Copper is chosen as the model material. The simulations show that TJ diffusion is faster than diffusion in the GBs, and that both diffusivities increase with temperature. The results also suggest that GBs can be more efficient for atomic transport in polycrystals than TJs. At high temperatures, the diffusivities of TJs and GBs converge to the diffusivity of bulk liquid. The authors conclude that T", "The X-ray emission properties of different types of non-accreting neutron stars, such as rotation-powered pulsars, anomalous X-ray pulsars, and soft gamma repeaters, can be extremely diverse. Anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters are well-known for their variability in the X-ray range, showing a wide variety of bursting behavior during active periods. Recent discoveries have shown that the link between magnetars (neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields) and rotation-powered pulsars is poorly understood, suggesting that some rotation-powered pulsars may have more variable X-ray emission than previously thought. In this study, the authors present a search for X-ray variability in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR B1509-58 using 14.7 years of data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). They find no evidence of pulsed flux variations, pulse profile variations, or magnetar-like bursts, indicating that the X-ray emission from PSR B1509-58 is stable on long timescales. The study also extends the timing solution for the pulsar by 7.1 years and refines measurements of its braking index and second braking index. The results provide a baseline for the quiescent X-ray emission of PSR B", "Woven graph codes are a type of code that can be used for error correction. They are a generalization of low-density parity-check (LDPC) block codes. Woven graph codes are suitable for iterative decoding and can be considered competitors to turbo codes. The minimum distance of a woven graph code is important for the error-correcting capability of iterative decoding algorithms. Graph codes usually have smaller minimum distances than linear codes, but a larger minimum distance can lead to better performance of the belief-propagation decoding algorithm. Woven graph codes can have either block or convolutional codes as constituent codes. The block length of the constituent block codes in a woven graph code coincides with the graph degree. Distance properties of bipartite graph-based codes with constituent block codes have been studied. It has been shown that if the minimum distance of the constituent block codes is larger than or equal to a certain value, asymptotically good codes can be achieved with fixed constituent codes. Random graph-based codes with block constituent codes also satisfy the Varshamov-Gilbert lower bound for some range of rates when the block length of the constituent codes tends to infinity. One disadvantage of graph-based codes is that they require long block lengths for good performance, leading to high decoding and encoding complexity. W", "The physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) have a significant impact on the dynamics of galaxies and are related to the life cycles of stars. To understand the composition and phases of the ISM, various observational techniques have been used, such as radio emission, infrared, and UV absorption spectroscopy. Recently, X-ray high-resolution spectroscopy has become a useful method as it provides unique data that complement other techniques. By using bright X-ray sources and grating spectrometers, it is possible to model observed absorption features and unravel key ISM conditions. Reliable templates are needed for diagnosing absorption signatures in such a diverse and complex plasma. Several photoabsorption models have been developed to render ISM features and have been incorporated in X-ray spectral fitting packages. The currently available models, such as WABS and TBNEW, have limitations in that they neglect contributions from charged ions, molecules, grains, and abundance enhancements. To address these limitations, a new model called ISMABS has been developed, which includes photoabsorption by neutral and charged atomic species. This model has been benchmarked by fitting high-resolution X-ray spectra from X-ray binary sources and has been compared to the TBNEW and WARMABS models. The results show that ISMABS improves the fits compared", "The study of how human behavior forms large-scale phenomena in society has a long interdisciplinary history. One popular model is the majority rule model, in which agents update their opinions based on a local majority rule. This model is commonly used to solve conflicts and make decisions in democracies. The size of the critical mass, which is the minimum number of agents needed to reach consensus, has an impact on the efficiency of the system to reach consensus. In simulations, it is found that increasing the critical mass makes it easier for the system to reach consensus up to a certain point. However, for very large critical masses, the system quickly reaches consensus. The optimal critical mass for consensus formation depends on the size of the interaction group. The dynamics of the system also change with different critical masses, with smaller critical masses leading to longer transients and larger critical masses leading to quicker consensus. The existence of an optimal critical mass suggests that there is an optimal threshold for decision-making in social systems.", "Hot molecular cores are small pockets of warm, dense molecular gas that show rich submillimeter spectra. This review focuses on hot cores heated internally by young high-mass stars. The review outlines basic properties of hot cores and recent developments in the field. Hot cores are one of the four observationally different groups of objects that make up the embedded phase of high-mass star formation. They have large masses of warm and dense molecular gas and high abundances of complex organic molecules. The chemistry of hot cores involves ice evaporation, leading to the formation of large molecules. The competition for protons between NH3 and CH3OH is an important determinant of the chemistry in hot cores. High-resolution observations and interferometry can provide valuable information about the temperature and density structure of hot cores. Future missions, such as ALMA and HIFI, will greatly enhance our ability to study hot cores.", "This paper explores the structural formation of late-type star-forming galaxies, such as the Milky Way, through various approaches. The authors analyze the ages, metallicities, and kinematics of stellar populations within the Milky Way itself to understand the assembly of these galaxies. They also use theoretical simulations and lookback studies to gain insights into the structural properties and evolution of late-type galaxies. The authors systematically select progenitors of Milky Way-like galaxies using the evolution of the star-forming sequence and analyze their structural evolution using HST WFC3 near-IR imaging. They find that most of the stellar mass growth in these galaxies occurs in the outer regions, leading to an increase in the half-light radius. They also observe ongoing stellar mass assembly in the central regions, indicating the importance of secular processes in bulge growth. The authors compare their results to the solar neighborhood of the Milky Way and find good agreement.", "The galactic center magnetosphere is still not well understood, but determining the magnetic field in this region is crucial to understanding the dynamics of the galactic center. Non-thermal filaments (NTFs) in the galactic center radio arc provide evidence for the existence of magnetic fields in this region. These NTFs are aligned with their long axes within 20 degrees of perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy, suggesting they trace the inner part of a dipole or poloidal magnetic field. The magnetosphere is of interest because it plays a role in the dynamics of galactic center molecular clouds and active galactic nuclei. Polarimetry at far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths has been used to measure the magnetic field configuration in the galactic center, and the results show that the magnetic field in dense molecular clouds is generally toroidal, while in less dense regions it is poloidal. The presence of molecular clouds and NTFs suggests that magnetic reconnection between magnetic fields in the cloud and flux tubes could generate the relativistic electrons required to create the NTFs. The field strength estimate of the magnetic field in the galactic center using submillimeter and far-infrared polarimetry is approximately 80 milligauss. The potential effect of reference beam contamination on", "In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in systems where strong correlations between particles are induced by pair-wise scattering. One example of this is parametric down-conversion, where photon pairs are generated during the propagation of a laser beam through a non-linear medium. These entangled photon pairs can be used to probe fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, such as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox or the violation of Bell inequalities. In addition, entanglement can be applied in practical applications such as teleportation or metrology beyond the shot-noise limit. Recent experiments with entangled states of atoms have been a major breakthrough in this field. These experiments have used two-body interactions to prepare non-classical squeezed states of trapped atoms and have demonstrated the presence of many-body entanglement. Stimulated four-wave-mixing processes and dynamic instabilities in moving optical lattices have also been implemented to generate entangled pairs of atoms. In this work, the authors develop a theoretical model for experiments where particles scatter in pairs into two well-separated regions. They derive the Bogoliubov dynamics governing the pair formation and calculate the density, number of scattered atoms, and two-body correlations between them. They demonstrate the presence of ideal number-squeezing and violation of", "The text discusses the concept of quantum open systems and their application in various fields of study. It explores the problems associated with understanding the dynamics of irreversible systems and why macroscopic systems can be treated classically instead of quantum mechanically. It also discusses the use of different equations of motion, such as the quantum master equations and the Redfield equation, to model quantum open systems.\n\nThe text further explores the limitations of these equations and the need for a new approach, such as the time convolution-less (TCL) master equation and the hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM). It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, including their ability to treat non-Markovian systems and calculate nonlinear response functions.\n\nThe text concludes by describing how the HEOM can be used to study dissipative dynamics in realistic situations and provides examples of its application in various fields, such as vibrational spectroscopy, photosynthetic antenna systems, and quantum ratchets. It also discusses the limitations of the HEOM and the possibility for further research in this area. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of the study of quantum open systems and their applications.", "Slender bodies capable of spontaneous motion in viscous fluids are common in various contexts such as biology, chemistry, physics, and technology. Examples include microtubules driven by molecular motors in biology, self-assembled bundles of microtubules in chemistry and physics, and synthesis of slender bodies capable of spontaneous motion in technology. These bodies share three common features: they produce flow in the ambient fluid, they are small enough for Brownian fluctuations to be important, and they resist deformation. A theory of active slender bodies is constructed by modeling them as filaments with slip velocities or non-equilibrium stresses at the fluid-structure boundary. The fluid flow is computed through a discretization method using spheres connected by non-linear springs. The resulting equations of motion describe the dynamics of active filaments and their interaction with the surrounding fluid. The dynamics of these filaments can exhibit linear instabilities, spontaneous motion, and oscillatory states.", "Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which a weak input signal is amplified and detectable due to the presence of noise in a system. It is a universal feature of barrier crossing events over a periodically modulated potential. The optimal level of noise and the periodic modulation result in the amplification of a weak periodic signal. The effect of stochastic resonance can be measured using various measures such as signal-to-noise ratio and spectral power amplification. While it is commonly assumed that noise in physical systems is Gaussian, the presence of heavy-tailed fluctuations has been recorded in various situations. This research extends previous studies on stochastic resonance by considering non-equilibrium, heavy-tailed noise. The results show that the properties of the system depend on the stability index, asymmetry parameter, and scale parameter of the noise. The optimal noise intensity for stochastic resonance shifts towards larger values as the threshold level increases. The asymmetry of the noise can also affect the performance of the model, weakening or enhancing the stochastic resonance. Overall, the strength of the non-dynamical stochastic resonance can be significantly influenced by the type of noise present in the system.", "The observations of distant supernovae show that our universe is undergoing accelerated expansion. There are two different approaches to explain this phenomenon. The first approach suggests the existence of dark energy, which is some unknown exotic matter that violates the strong energy condition. Scalar field models like quintessence and the tachyonic scalar field have been proposed to model dark energy. Another type of scalar field called the phantom field, which has super-negative pressure, has also been considered. The presence of a phantom field can lead to the accelerated expansion of the universe. The second approach, known as the cardassian expansion scenario, proposes that the standard FRW dynamics is modified by an additional term in the Friedman equation. This term can be interpreted as a phantom field. The behavior of the phantom cosmology is different depending on whether the phantom field is minimally or conformally coupled to gravity. In the case of the spontaneously symmetry breaking, the phantom cosmology exhibits chaotic behavior, while in the case without symmetry breaking, the system behaves as a non-chaotic scattering process.", "The paper discusses the study of a class of one-dimensional quantum Ising models with single-ion anisotropy, focusing on the effects of dimerization and the presence of holes on the system's physical properties. The authors use the hole decomposition scheme to divide the total Hilbert space of the system into subspaces labeled by the number of holes, allowing for an exact solution of the model. They investigate the ground state, low-energy excitations, quantum phase transitions, and thermodynamic properties of the model. They find that dimerization does not affect the exact solvability of the model but does alter the phase diagram and high-energy behavior. The authors develop a recursion method to efficiently calculate the partition function and other thermodynamic quantities for both uniform and dimerized chains. They find that the presence of holes enhances thermodynamic fluctuations and suppresses the characteristic temperature below which quantum criticality persists. The results are robust against dimerization, and the recursion method can be applied to other physical systems with similar structures.", "The paper discusses the concept of coherence as a quantum resource and explores its relationship with mixedness in quantum systems. It introduces the measures that quantify quantum coherence and mixedness, and shows that there is a trade-off between the two quantities. The distribution of coherence in multipartite systems is also examined, and it is found that there is a non-monogamous relationship between coherence and mixedness. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings.", "Multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are important for understanding the active emission mechanisms. Optical and near-infrared (NIR) data carry the most detailed information, as they are less affected by dust obscuration. GRB990705 was detected by the BeppoSAX satellite and promptly localized. NIR and optical observations were carried out to search for a counterpart. A bright NIR transient was detected inside the error box, suggesting it is the afterglow of GRB990705. Optical observations also detected a fading object consistent with the afterglow. Radio observations detected three sources within the error box, but none were consistent with the GRB location. The possible host galaxy of GRB990705 was also identified and appears to be an irregular star-forming galaxy. The afterglow exhibited a steep decay, possibly indicating a break in the light curve. The red color of the afterglow suggests heavy obscuration within the host galaxy. Overall, the observations of GRB990705 provide important insights into the nature of GRB progenitors.", "The text introduces the concept of small-world networks, which are large systems that can be traversed in a few steps. Many different types of networks, including social and technological ones, have been classified as small worlds. The text explains that the average distance between nodes in a small-world network is at most a logarithm of the total system size. This scaling behavior is a basic property of random graphs, but networks with low clustering are not considered small worlds in the strict sense. The text then discusses the distinction between small-world networks and fractal networks, which are characterized by power-law growth in the size of neighborhoods. The main point of the paper is to demonstrate that this dichotomy can be observed in real-world networks. Social networks like scientific collaborations and the internet are examples of small worlds, while networks with geographical constraints like power grids are examples of fractal networks. The text also discusses the possibility of mixed behavior, where a network exhibits fractal and small-world scaling at different length scales. The authors provide examples of networks that exhibit either small-world or fractal scaling, and they argue that the fractal/small-world dichotomy is central to understanding the structure of real-world graphs. They also discuss the significance of this dichotomy for social contact networks, such as the network of human", "The text discusses the study of hydrodynamic pattern forming systems, particularly focusing on the Faraday experiment. The experiment involves exciting surface waves on a liquid-air or liquid-liquid interface using a vibrating fluid layer. The text highlights that while there has been progress in understanding pattern formation in systems like Rayleigh-Benard convection and Taylor-Couette flow, the Faraday experiment remains less understood. The text proposes a systematic quantitative investigation of the surface elevation in the Faraday experiment and presents a measurement technique to quantify the surface elevation. The measurements cover a wide range of parameters and are compared with theoretical predictions. The text also discusses numerical simulations of the Faraday experiment using the full Navier-Stokes equations. The simulations show good agreement with experimental data at elevated drive amplitudes. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach between theory and experiment in understanding hydrodynamic pattern forming systems.", "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data has improved the accuracy of cosmological parameter evaluation. However, there are concerns about the reliability and consistency of the data. Some studies have found evidence of non-Gaussianity and north-south asymmetry in the data, possibly due to residual foreground contamination or observational effects. This paper applies analytical methods to study the foreground or observational effects in the WMAP data and finds a systematic pattern in the gradient maps that cannot be removed by filtering procedures. The analysis also reveals a south-north asymmetry in the signal variance distribution, suggesting the presence of galactic foreground effects. The findings indicate that the analysis and interpretation of the large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) structure in the WMAP data may be affected by these effects and must be properly considered. The study also discusses the possible influence of the observational time non-uniformities on the large-scale CMB structure analysis.", "This text discusses the production of charged particles with high energies in cosmic plasma. It mentions that these particles, known as cosmic rays, can be produced in various astrophysical bodies and are believed to be accelerated by magnetic fields. The text then explains the Fermi-Ulam model, which demonstrates that particles can gain energy when reflected between two moving magnetic mirrors. It also mentions that energization of particles can occur in chaotic magnetic fields. The text goes on to describe a study of particle energization in a helical magnetic field with sinusoidal spatio-temporal dependence. The results show that the energy of charged particles can increase as a power law in time. The text also discusses the properties of particle trajectories in magnetic fields and the growth of particle energy with time. Finally, it mentions that the proposed mechanism of particle energization is different from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests that it could help resolve the injection problem. The text concludes by discussing future investigations and acknowledging the support received for the research.", "The early studies of the galaxy using the 21 cm - line absorption and emission of HI led to the two-phase model of the interstellar medium. This model proposed that there were dense, cool HI clouds in pressure equilibrium with a warm, low-density medium. However, the temperature of the warm medium was not accurately known. In this study, HI 21 cm - line absorption was detected in the warm neutral medium towards the source Cygnus A. The optical depth and spin temperatures were measured to be (8.9 \u00b1 1.9) x 10^7 and 6000 \u00b1 1700 K at 70 km/s, and (8.5 \u00b1 2.0) x 10^7 and 4800 \u00b1 1600 K at 40 km/s respectively. The volume filling factor of the warm neutral medium was estimated to be 0.4. The spin temperature measurements are consistent with the temperature range predicted by the two-phase model. The authors also detected HI 21 cm - line absorption in high-velocity clouds in the outer arm of the galaxy, and found multiple temperature components in these clouds. The spin temperatures of these components were estimated to be 200 K and >1000 K. These results provide valuable insights into", "In this paper, the authors study the dynamo transition in both the Taylor-Green (TG) and convective dynamos using low-dimensional models. They first explain the concept of supercritical and subcritical transitions in dynamical systems and their relevance to the dynamo transition. They then derive a 3-mode model for the TG dynamo and show that it captures both supercritical and subcritical dynamo transitions. They also construct a similar 3-mode model for the convective dynamo and show that it exhibits the same transition behavior. The authors compare their models to numerical simulations and find good agreement. They conclude by discussing the implications of their findings and the limitations of their models.", "In microelectronics manufacturing, nondestructive parametric testing using metal probe tips greatly increases fabrication yield through statistical process control. However, for the testing of glass and semiconductor photonic lightwave circuits, there is a lack of a simple, local probe for wafer-scale, nondestructive, optical characterization of on-chip components. Traditional optical coupling methods include end-fire or butt coupling and prism-based coupling. While these methods are effective, they have limitations when it comes to wafer-scale coupling to micron-scale photonic elements. This paper introduces a variant of the silica optical fiber taper evanescent-coupler that is designed for rapid, wafer-scale diagnostic testing of on-chip photonic components. The authors have developed a microscopic \"dimpled\" fiber taper probe that allows for low-noise local probing of individual devices on a wafer. The dimpled fiber taper probe is made from a standard straight fiber taper that is pressed against a mold and heated. The tension in the taper is increased to reduce fluctuations in the taper-chip gap, resulting in low-noise measurements. The utility of the dimpled taper optical probe is demonstrated through the characterization of two types of devices on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer platform: a dense two-dimensional array", "The text discusses a new line of research that explores the effect of dark matter particles on the first stars to form in the universe. The researchers found a new phase of stellar evolution called \"dark stars\" which are powered by dark matter annihilation rather than fusion. The text outlines the criteria for the formation of dark stars, including high dark matter densities, trapped annihilation products, and the dominance of dark matter heating over other cooling mechanisms. The researchers also discuss the structure and evolution of dark stars, and the possibility of large black holes as an end result. They suggest that dark stars may have a role in explaining the presence of supermassive black holes at high redshifts. The text concludes by discussing the potential for detecting dark stars and the incorporation of dark matter capture into the models. Overall, the text highlights the important connection between particle physics and astrophysics in understanding the formation and evolution of the first stars in the universe.", "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat psychiatric disorders, and the seizure generalization hypothesis states that the seizure in the entire brain is necessary for effective ECT. However, there are cases where seizure is not induced by the maximum dose of electrical charge. This study presents a case of a schizophrenic patient where long brief pulses of ECT successfully induced seizure, while ultrabrief pulses did not. This contradicts previous randomized control trials that found ultrabrief pulses to be more effective. The study speculates that the strength-duration curve of the patient's neurons may be right-shifted, resulting in a prolonged chronaxie. Further research is needed to confirm these observations.", "This text discusses the unsolved question of the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, specifically the knowledge of the thermodynamic conditions at which the transition to quark matter would occur. The analysis is complicated by uncertainties in the equation of state above the nuclear saturation density and the lack of a satisfactory description of both hadronic and deconfined matter. The text suggests using a two-phase description, extrapolating a hadronic model to higher densities and a quark model to lower densities. Recent work has been done to determine the effect of different equations of state and different astrophysical environments on the deconfinement transition. The text also mentions the importance of flavor conservation during the transition and the role of color superconductivity. The paper analyzes the deconfinement transition in protoneutron star conditions, using a nonlinear walecka model for the hadronic matter and the MIT bag model for the quark matter, including the effects of color superconductivity and neutrino trapping. The text discusses the equations of state and the effect of different parametrizations, as well as the inclusion of hyperons. The article concludes by mentioning the need for further investigations into the formation of mixed hadron-quark phases and the effects of rotation on the final configuration of the star.", "Optical emission in low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) is triggered by reprocessing of the x-ray luminosity in the gas around the compact object. This reprocessed light can be observed through various features, such as colors, x-ray bursts, and emission lines. The spectroscopic features of the weak companion star are usually swamped by the disc's reprocessed light, making it difficult to study. However, recent discoveries have allowed for the detection of emission lines from the companion star in certain LMXBs. This opens up new possibilities for studying the dynamics and deriving mass functions in a population of LMXBs with optical counterparts. Echo-tomography, an indirect imaging technique that uses time delays between x-ray and optical lightcurves, can be used to map the reprocessing regions in a binary system. The reprocessed flux is mainly dominated by the contribution of the accretion disc. By studying emission-line reprocessing, the response of the donor's contribution can be amplified and the transfer function can be computed more easily. In a study of the LMXB Sco X-1, simultaneous x-ray and optical data was obtained, showing evidence of delayed echoes consistent with reprocessing in the companion star. Further analysis and future work are needed to search for correlated", "The plasma membrane is a complex structure that plays a crucial role in cell communication. One of the ways that molecules move across the membrane is through lateral diffusion. However, the dynamics of proteins and lipids on the plasma membrane do not always follow the expected behavior of normal diffusion. This hindered diffusion can be caused by various factors such as macromolecular crowding, transient binding, heterogeneities, and membrane compartmentalization by the cytoskeleton. Previous studies have shown that interactions with clathrin coated pits and diffusion within a fractal topology can cause anomalous diffusion in the plasma membrane. In this study, the authors used superresolution imaging and single-particle tracking to investigate the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane by intracellular structures. They found that potassium channels exhibited anomalous diffusion on the cell surface and were transiently confined by the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Further analysis revealed that the cortical actin had a fractal dimension, indicating a hierarchical organization of the plasma membrane. These findings provide new insights into the complex dynamics of the plasma membrane and its role in cell function.", "The Egg Nebula, also known as the , is a proto-planetary nebula consisting of a central star and a circumstellar shell. The structure of the shell, including the presence of concentric arcs, is not fully understood. In this study, the authors analyze two epochs of data from the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the proper motion of the bipolar lobes and the concentric arcs. They find that the lobes are expanding linearly, confirming previous studies. They also find that the arcs are being ejected at a constant speed and show an increasing radial velocity towards the equatorial plane. This suggests that the arcs are being disrupted by a fast equatorial outflow. The authors speculate that these observations provide evidence for the binary modulation of stellar winds. Further observations are needed to confirm these findings and better understand the dynamics of the Nebula.", "The text discusses the use of the metric space technique (MST) to analyze and compare astrophysical maps of the universe. The MST is used to quantify the morphological differences between the observed galaxy distribution and two sets of simulation data. The results show that the simulations are able to approximate the observed universe, with one simulation (nyur) closer in resemblance to the observations than the other simulation (mpar). The MST provides quantitative information on the complexity and structure of the galaxy distribution through various output functions, such as density, volume, pixels, and components. The results also highlight the importance of velocity determinations for accurately matching the simulations to the observed data. Additionally, the definition of the filament index is modified to better characterize non-convex objects. Overall, the MST proves to be a useful tool for comparing and understanding the morphological properties of the universe.", "The paper discusses the nonequilibrium single impurity anderson model (SIAM) in condensed matter physics. The authors analyze the behavior of the nonequilibrium self-energy and the dot spectral function for the SIAM in various scenarios, including the ph symmetric SIAM and the ph asymmetric SIAM. They find that in the ph symmetric case, the kondo resonance is suppressed by increasing bias voltage, leading to a crossover from the kondo resonance to the coulomb blockade behaviors. In the ph asymmetric case, the spectral weight of the kondo resonance gradually shifts towards the coulomb peaks with increasing bias voltage. The authors also examine the multi-terminal SIAM and show that the number of terminals affects the enhancement of the kondo resonance. The paper provides a solid analytical description of the behavior of the nonequilibrium self-energy and the dot spectral function and serves as a useful tool for future studies in this area.", "The conventional single-electron transistor (SET) has a large output resistance which limits its operation frequency. To overcome this limitation, the radio-frequency SET (RF-SET) has been developed. The RF-SET operates based on microwave reflection from a tank (LC) circuit, allowing for higher operation frequency and improved performance. The RF-SET has been used in various applications including the readout of charge qubits in a solid-state quantum computer, monitoring quantum dynamics of nanomechanical resonators, and as an electrometer in classical single-electron devices. The sensitivity of the RF-SET is shot noise limited, and the ultimate sensitivity depends on various factors such as the tank quality factor, operation temperature, set resistance, carrier frequency, and set asymmetry. The performance of the RF-SET can be optimized by adjusting these parameters. Experimental results have shown that the RF-SET can achieve high sensitivity, and further improvements are expected in the future. In summary, the RF-SET is a promising technology for high-frequency, high-sensitivity measurements in various quantum and classical applications.", "Over the past decade, many experiments have provided strong evidence for neutrino oscillations and physics beyond the standard model. The Super-Kamiokande detector has used atmospheric neutrinos to provide evidence for neutrino oscillations, and larger detectors like AMANDA, IceCube, and KM3NeT have the potential to detect even more atmospheric neutrino events. The IceCube Deep Core Array (ICDC) has been proposed to improve the detection of atmospheric muon neutrinos and extend the detection capabilities to low energy neutrinos, down to GeV energies. ICDC could detect up to several atmospheric neutrino events per year, providing rich opportunities for detailed oscillation studies. The analysis focuses on the detection of cascade events in ICDC, which could provide evidence for tau neutrino appearance from atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The analysis takes into account the uncertainties in neutrino oscillation parameters and estimates the number of cascade events from charged current interactions, neutral current interactions, and tau decays. The background from other interactions is also taken into account. With good muon track reconstruction, the statistically significant detection of tau neutrinos from atmospheric muon neutrinos could be achieved in a few years of observation. ICDC offers a unique opportunity to study atmospheric neutrinos and their oscillations in", "Researchers have developed ultra-thin gratings that can absorb nearly 100% of light, according to a new study. The gratings are made of weakly-absorbing semiconductors and can be used to achieve total light absorption in a wide range of wavelengths. The research team used theoretical modeling and experimental demonstrations to show that total light absorption can be achieved in both TE and TM polarized light. The findings have important implications for applications such as photodetectors and optoelectronic devices. The gratings are simple to design and fabricate, making them potentially useful for a wide range of practical applications.", "The paper discusses the concept of symmetric spaces and Lie triple systems in numerical analysis. It explains the properties of symmetric spaces and how they are related to Lie groups. The paper also explores the application of these structures to the numerical analysis of differential equations with symmetries and reversing symmetries. It discusses various methods for retaining symmetry in numerical methods and presents algorithms for improving the order of approximation and symmetry retention.", "Current understanding suggests that dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) are the two major components of the universe. The densities of DM and DE, denoted as \u03c1_DM and \u03c1_DE, respectively, are approximately equal today but have varied significantly in the past. This has led to the exploration of the possibility of an interaction between DM and DE. However, such an interaction poses problems when DE is interpreted as a dynamical quintessence scalar field. In order to overcome these problems, a scalar-tensor gravity (ST) theory is proposed, where matter has a purely metric coupling with gravity. It has been shown that in this framework, the scalar field can behave similar to general relativity during the matter-dominated era and also lead to the correct evolution of DE. ST can have major differences in the past evolution of the universe, leading to observable consequences in nucleosynthesis and the relic abundance of DM. By considering ST theories, it is found that deviations from standard cosmology can occur due to differences in the expansion rate of the universe, which affect phenomena dependent on timing. The aim of this work is to study the modifications of the expansion rate at the time of cold DM freeze-out, focusing on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as potential", "There is a great interest in nanoscopic systems, such as magnetic impurities on clean noble metal surfaces, quantum corrals, small clusters on surfaces, and systems of quantum dots. The Kondo effect is present in many of these systems. The unitary limit, which is the maximum possible conductance through a quantum dot, has been reached experimentally. The Kondo model out of equilibrium brings new challenges to the theory. Effects of interference in quantum paths and the Aharonov-Bohm effect have been demonstrated in mesoscopic rings with embedded quantum dots. Calculating the transport through a mesoscopic ring with both interference effects and the Kondo effect is not trivial. The conductance through strongly correlated rings has been studied and for a ring described by the ionic Hubbard model, it has been shown that the conductance is related to the quasiparticle weight. Spintronics, which involves creating and controlling spin polarized currents in nanoscale systems, is also an area of interest. Spin-orbit coupling, which is present in quantum wells, has been investigated and recent experiments have shown the conductance oscillating as a function of the applied electric field perpendicular to the ring. The aim of the present work is to provide a method to calculate the conductance through a", "The key principle governing the onset of superconductivity is the breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry through the non-zero vacuum expectation value of a charged field. This leads to the generation of a photon mass and the formation of vortices in type II superconductors. Lattice studies of dual superconductivity in SU(N) gauge theories aim to establish the underlying principle governing color confinement. The lattice Higgs theory, treated as an effective theory, provides a model for interpreting simulations of the pure gauge theory that can reveal these important connections. Different abelian projections in the lattice pure gauge theory, such as the Polyakov gauge and the maximal abelian gauge, have been explored, each revealing different mechanisms for confinement. The choice of abelian projection affects the behavior of static sources and the distribution of fields such as the electric field and the curl of the magnetic currents. The Polyakov gauge with the @xmath112 prescription suppresses these fields and screening due to the presence of charged coset fields. The maximal abelian gauge provides a more quantitative description of confinement.", "Astronomy is entering a new era with the detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos using non-photonic detectors like Virgo and LIGO. The merging of two compact objects, such as neutron stars, is a promising source of gravitational waves and is believed to be associated with short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). However, the detection rate of these events is low due to the limited distance at which the detectors can perform detections. In this study, the authors aim to estimate the rate of simultaneous detections of electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves from binary neutron star systems. They use a selection method to identify SGRBs and derive the local rate of these bursts. The scarcity of SGRBs and the correlation with redshift pose challenges in the selection process. The authors use duration, hardness, and the absence of a plateau phase as criteria for selecting SGRBs, resulting in a small sample size. They discuss the limitations of their study and the implications of their results in terms of detectability.", "This paper is the second in a series of four papers that discusses the geometry behind directed networks on surfaces. The paper focuses on the Poisson properties of these networks on an annulus. The authors modify the definition of the boundary measurement map and show that the analogue of Postnikov's construction leads to a map into the space of loops in the Grassmannian. They define universal Poisson brackets for networks in an annulus and show that these brackets induce a two-parameter family of Poisson brackets on rational-valued boundary measurement matrices. They also prove that this family of Poisson brackets can be pushed forward to the space of loops in the Grassmannian. The paper concludes by discussing future papers in the series that focus on particular graphs in an annulus and solving the inverse problem of restoring the weights from the image of the generalized Postnikov map for graphs in an annulus.", "Electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime are used for diagnostic and heating purposes in plasma experiments. They are particularly important for stabilizing neoclassical tearing modes in tokamak plasmas and for obtaining spatial distribution of temperature. However, density fluctuations in fusion plasmas can disturb the microwaves and reduce their effectiveness. This paper presents full-wave simulations of microwaves propagating through a turbulent plasma density layer, considering various parameters such as correlation length, depth of turbulence layer, fluctuation strength, beam size, and background density. The simulations show that the scattering and beam broadening of the microwave beam depend on these parameters. The results have implications for the diagnostics of microwave radiation emitted by the plasma and for the localized absorption of high-power microwaves in the plasma. Further study is needed to apply these findings to specific experimental cases.", "The Opera experiment, conducted at the Gran Sasso lab in Italy, aims to study neutrino oscillations using a long-baseline neutrino beam from CERN. Neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos have mass and their flavor eigenstates are a superposition of their mass eigenstates, were first discovered through studies of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The Opera detector, made up of lead/emulsion bricks, scintillator tracker detectors, and muon spectrometers, is designed to detect the appearance of a different neutrino flavor, specifically the tau neutrino. The construction of the CERN neutrino beam, called CNGS, has been completed and the first run of the Opera experiment took place in August 2006. During this run, neutrino interactions were detected and preliminary measurements were made. The success of this run is an important step towards the full operation of the Opera detector.", "The text discusses the possibility of studying black hole physics using its sonic analogue. Quantum liquids and gases are considered, and they are seen as similar to the quantum vacuum of fermionic and bosonic fields. The text suggests that the quantum vacuum can be viewed as a condensed matter \"ether\" where the physical laws we have now can emerge as the energy or temperature of the \"ether\" decreases. The presence of an event horizon is discussed, and it is assumed that in the absence of a horizon, the fermionic vacuum belongs to either a trivial class or a class of fermi points. However, in the presence of a horizon, the fermionic vacuum belongs to the class of the fermi surface. The properties of the quantum vacuum in the presence of a horizon are discussed, and it is suggested that the emergence of planck physics and the violation of time reversal symmetry by the horizon are the main sources for the appearance of the fermi surface. The text also discusses the painlev-gullstrand metric, which describes the black hole spacetime and allows for the introduction of the planck physics. The energy spectrum of fermions in the painlev-gullstrand metric is derived, and it is found that there are no exact fermion zero modes in the presence of a black hole", "In this paper, the authors study the orbit of a photon in the gravitational field of a binary system. They assume that the photons move in null paths and are influenced by the binary system, which consists of two equal mass objects in circular motion. They use the post-Newtonian approximation to describe the deviation of the photon trajectory from a straight line. The authors introduce the concept of osculating trajectories, which are families of null geodesics characterized by a set of constants of motion, and use them to analyze the dynamics of the system. They calculate the tidal forces acting on the photon using a metric derived by Taylor and Poisson for a black hole, and find the evolution of the osculating elements, which describe the constants of motion, in the presence of the binary system. They find that the deflection angle of the photon depends on the position and orbital phase of the second body in the binary system. The authors also discuss the implications of their results for astrometric missions like Gaia and for the study of microlensing light curves.", "The nature of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) has been a mystery since their discovery nearly 20 years ago. AXPs exhibit X-ray pulsations and have high X-ray luminosities. They spin down regularly, but their X-ray luminosities are much greater than the rate of loss of kinetic energy from their spin-down. They have thermal emission spectra with evidence for a hard tail in some sources and are found in the plane of the galaxy. Recent research suggests that AXPs are young, isolated, highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars. High-precision timing observations of two AXPs, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 2259+586, using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have provided high-precision spin parameters. The observations demonstrate that these AXPs are extremely stable rotators. The observed spin-down is regular, and there have been no deviations from a simple spin-down law. The data also suggest the possibility of radiative precession in 1E 2259+586. This study opens the door for further observations to test the magnetar model and look for glitches and precession.", "Nonlinear frequency conversion of far-infrared or microwave signals into the optical domain has been actively used for signal detection. Optical signal detection is easier compared to sub-THz range signals, leading to increased attention in this method. However, the main drawback is its low conversion efficiency. The highest conversion efficiency achieved so far is about 0.5%. Highly efficient and noiseless upconversion of microwave radiation into the optical domain would have significant applications in microwave imaging and communications. The key to achieving this is reaching unity conversion efficiency using an all-resonant whispering gallery mode (WGM) configuration. Experimental studies using WGM resonators with optical nonlinearity have shown promising results. Phase-matching conditions and numerical simulations have been used to determine the optimal ring resonator design for efficient up-conversion. The simulations show that both type I and type II up-conversion can be achieved, with type I conversion efficiency approaching unity with an optical pump power of 50mW and type II conversion efficiency approaching unity with an optical pump power of 120mW. Experimental results have demonstrated efficient coupling of microwaves into the resonator's WGMS and have shown promising potential for nearly unity-efficient microwave-to-optics conversion.", "The paper discusses the correlation between mean multiplicity and triggers in high energy heavy ion physics. It presents results for the number of interacting nucleons and the multiplicity of produced secondaries based on geometry. The dispersion of the distribution on the number of interacting nucleons is large in minimum bias interactions and small in central collisions. The paper suggests that these results can be used to test for the formation of quark-gluon plasma. It also discusses the impact of different ion collisions and the dependence of multiplicity on the average number of inelastic interactions. The paper concludes that triggers cannot significantly change the average multiplicity in central heavy ion collisions, which can be used to differentiate between collective effects and conventional mechanisms.", "The text discusses the physics and chemistry of clusters, focusing on sodium and gallium clusters. It mentions that while ground-state investigations have been extensively studied, finite temperature properties are also important. The text highlights the challenges faced in understanding the melting behavior of sodium clusters and the absence of a correlation between melting temperature and magic numbers. It explains that classical interatomic potentials were insufficient in explaining the experimental data and that density-functional molecular dynamics simulations provided better agreement. The text then mentions similar observations in the case of gallium and aluminum clusters. It discusses the role of order and disorder in the geometries of clusters and their impact on the melting curve. The study concludes by stating that more research is needed to investigate the size sensitivity of sodium clusters and the correlation between ground state and specific heats.", "The BATSE spectroscopy team is studying the existence of spectral lines in burst spectroscopy. They are searching for lines, analyzing the capabilities of the detectors, and studying statistics of detections and non-detections. The detection probability depends on signal-to-noise ratio and the angle between the detector and the burst. They have calculated probabilities of detecting a line in a burst and combined these probabilities to determine the consistency between BATSE and Ginga. They have run simulations to study different line parameters and detection probabilities. Preliminary results show that BATSE and Ginga are marginally consistent and lines are present in only a few percent of all bursts. The number of trials in detecting lines is calculated using a Bayesian formalism. The work is supported by the CGRO guest investigator program and NASA contract NAS8-36081.", "Broadband molecular line surveys are effective tools for studying the molecular inventory of star-forming regions. These surveys provide information about the chemical abundances and physical properties of molecular clouds. They also serve as a resource for other researchers to search for new molecular species. Recently, new radio astronomical observatories with improved bandwidth and sensitivity have been developed, leading to an increase in the number of publicly available spectral surveys. Efficient methods for modeling and visualizing the data are necessary due to the large number of data channels. In these surveys, the dense line forest of chemically rich regions contains blends of features from multiple molecules. By characterizing the spectral signatures of known molecules, new species can be identified. This manuscript presents early results from a spectral survey towards the Sagittarius B2(n) molecular cloud using the Herschel space observatory. Methanol is studied as an example, and the spectrum is modeled using the LTE approximation. The survey covers a largely unexplored frequency range and provides a comprehensive chemical inventory of the source. The techniques described in this study will be applicable to future wide-band chemical surveys, such as those conducted by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy.", "The text discusses observations of the star formation site Cepheus A East using the infrared spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The observations detected gas-phase CO emission, which indicates the presence of a post-shock gas component. The co-emission mainly arises at the surfaces of the cavities carved by the outflows, indicating interactions between the outflows and the ambient molecular gas. The gas-phase CO molecules are predominantly excited by the 15 micron continuum photons emitted from the protostellar region HW2. The column density of gas-phase CO was derived and found to be consistent with a scenario in which a few percent of the grain material has been subject to shocks that sputtered CO ice mantles. The observations also detected CO ice absorption features in most spatial positions, indicating the presence of CO ice in the region. Overall, the results provide insights into the shock physics and chemistry at finer scales in Cepheus A East.", "The text discusses the phenomenon of partial gapping of spectral weight in strongly correlated electron systems, known as the pseudogap phenomenon. It is observed in various systems such as charge-density-wave (CDW) systems and high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The nature of pseudogaps is still under debate. The charge ordering is a universal property of hole doped cuprates, and its onset temperature is much before the superconducting transition temperature. The authors present a study of the charge stripe ordered system Nd-LSCO using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). They observe an antinodal spectral gap in the overdoped regime, which can be closed by increasing doping, increasing temperature, or moving in momentum. In the underdoped regime, there is a significant suppression of spectral weight in the antinodal region, which is discussed in terms of quasiparticle decoherence and competing orders. The authors also discuss the possible influence of static long-range charge density-wave order.", "The research on quantum turbulence has been growing in the past few years, with a focus on the decay of quantum turbulence at low temperatures. One important aspect of this decay is the Kelvin-wave cascade, which operates on length scales smaller than the distance between vortex lines. Due to circulation quantization, the classical Kolmogorov decay does not work at these scales. At low temperatures, the Kelvin cascade is expected to push the energy down to the scales of the vortex core, where it can be dissipated due to phonons. However, the Kelvin wave cascade also operates at finite temperatures with nonzero mutual friction, but its range is expected to be limited to scales larger than the mutual friction limited dissipation scale. The researchers conducted simulations to study the Kelvin spectrum using a vortex filament model. They found that the spectrum depends weakly on mutual friction and observed that the absolute value of the Kelvin amplitude depends linearly on the drive amplitude. The simulations also showed that the spectrum saturated below a certain value of mutual friction. However, the researchers noted that the vortex filament model does not properly capture the limit of dissipation at scales smaller than the pinning point. The dissipated power due to mutual friction was found to increase rapidly with the number of Kelvin modes and did not show a saturation for", "The CODALEMA experiment is an observation of ultra high-energy cosmic rays using a radiodetection technique. The experiment uses a set of log-periodic antennas and has been operating since 2003. In the first phase of observation, one antenna was used as a trigger and the signals from other antennas were filtered and recorded when a voltage threshold was reached. In the second phase, four particle detectors were added to the setup, and the antennas were passband filtered to increase signal-to-noise ratio. The experiment has observed coincident events on antennas and particle detectors, providing evidence of radio signals from air showers. The deposited energy distribution in scintillators allows for the inference of the air shower core location and the reconstruction of the shower axis. The addition of five more antennas in a east-west line will allow for the study of different effects contributing to the radio emission of a shower.", "The text discusses 1-particle inclusive lepton-hadron scattering and its importance in studying the quark and gluon structure of hadrons. It explains the hadronic tensor and its different components for unpolarized and polarized leptons and hadrons. The text also discusses the diagrammatic expansion and the calculation of structure functions using parton distributions. It introduces the soft parts, such as distribution and fragmentation functions, and their interpretation in terms of momentum space densities. It explains the relevant dirac projections and their relation to the twist-two and twist-three functions. The text also mentions the various cross sections and asymmetries that can be measured in experiments and their connection to the distribution and fragmentation functions. It discusses the importance of target fragmentation, gluon inclusion, and QCD corrections in the analysis. Finally, the text acknowledges the ongoing collaboration and funding for the research.", "In this paper, the authors explore the vacuum solutions of quadratic gravity and uncover new black hole and wormhole solutions. They emphasize that these solutions are supported only by the vacuum and do not require any unusual states of matter. The authors also discuss the challenges of determining which solutions should be considered physical solutions in general relativity, and how the null energy condition restricts the construction of many spacetimes, including traversable wormholes. They show that the new wormhole solutions can be traversed by both light rays and timelike observers, and discuss the properties of these trajectories. The authors also find that the wormhole solutions can have attractive or repulsive gravitational forces near the throat, and that the asymptotic observers view the wormhole as a black hole with a varying charge. They emphasize that these values should not be associated with conserved charges, as is the case in general relativity. The authors speculate on the dynamical nature of these quantities and suggest further research on exotic solutions in general quadratic gravity theories.", "The formation and evolution of galaxies over time is a fundamental question in astronomy. Understanding this process is crucial for accurately interpreting observations of galaxies throughout the universe. Galaxies are formed from the star formation that occurs over their lifetime, and the chemical composition and remaining stellar population provide evidence of this. To accurately understand what is observed in galaxy surveys at high redshift, it is necessary to understand how galaxies change over time and what they look like when they are young. Different techniques can uncover information about individual stars and their properties, which can help distinguish between different types of galaxies. By studying nearby galaxies, which are representative of the overall population, researchers hope to obtain a representative picture of galaxy evolution and use it to predict what galaxies look like at all redshifts. Different types of galaxies have different star formation histories, with some having a constant rate and others experiencing bursts of star formation or ceasing star formation entirely. Understanding the star formation history requires analyzing the fossil record of ancient star formation, which can be done by measuring the star formation rate as a function of time. Advanced techniques and instruments have allowed for the study of galaxies in the local group and beyond, providing insights into their star formation properties. Dwarf irregular galaxies have shown similarities to dwarf elliptical/spheroidal galaxies, suggesting that the", "This paper discusses the design of distributed differential space-time codes (DDSTCs) for cooperative wireless relay networks. DDSTCs allow users to communicate with a single destination using cooperative strategies. The paper focuses on amplify and forward based relaying strategies, which do not require relays to have knowledge of the codebook used by the source or the fading coefficients. The authors propose a differential encoding/decoding setup that does not require knowledge of fading coefficients between users at the destination. They provide a construction for DDSTCs using extended Clifford algebras, which achieve full diversity with a low complexity sub-optimal receiver. The paper also includes simulation results comparing the error performance of the proposed codes with existing codes in the literature. The proposed DDSTCs outperform existing codes in terms of decoding complexity and error performance.", "Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are explosions of massive stars. These explosions are not immediate, as the internal structures of the stars change over millions of years. The evolution and ultimate explosion of these stars can be influenced by factors such as mass loss and binary companions. More than 70% of massive stars that eventually explode have been found to be in close binary systems. The effect of binary companions on stellar evolution and SN properties has been studied extensively. It has been suggested that certain types of core-collapse supernovae, specifically those with little to no hydrogen, may come from binary systems. Light curve modeling also supports this idea. In a binary system, both the SN and the companion star can be affected by the explosion. Several SN properties, particularly the early optical brightness and the decline rate of the light curve, can be strongly influenced by the presence of a companion. Specifically, collisions between the SN ejecta and the companion star can lead to increased early optical brightness and a slower decline in the light curve. This collision provides extra heating that counters adiabatic cooling after the shock breakout, resulting in a slower decline in the light curve. However, the separation required for this collision to occur and explain observed SN properties is considered to be unrealistically small. Other possible", "Researchers have observed the integral quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in graphene, a single-layer hexagonal form of carbon. The IQHE occurs at filling factors of 2 and 3, which can be explained by the four-fold degeneracy of Landau levels in graphene. The pseudospin degree of freedom, representing the two inequivalent Dirac cones in graphene, does not couple to external fields if the two sublattices are equivalent. The effective Hamiltonian for low energy electronic states in graphene has a linear dispersion, resulting in an offset for the IQHE. While the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) has not been observed in graphene, theoretical exploration has been done assuming SU(2) symmetry in the presence of a high Zeeman energy. The FQHE problem in graphene maps to the problem in GaAs in the zero Zeeman energy limit, with the pseudospin of graphene playing the role of spin in GaAs. Composite fermion theory has been applied to graphene to explain the FQHE, and new FQHE states have been found that result from the interplay between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. The su(4) symmetry of the interacting electrons in graphene breaks spontaneously at certain fractions, resulting in ground", "The diffuse intra-group light (IGL) component is a useful tool for measuring the intensity of tidal interactions between galaxies and mapping the extension and shape of a group's gravitational potential and dark matter halo. The authors used a wavelet transform with a multi-scale vision model to isolate the IGL, which detects different characteristic size structures and separates different types of light sources in the image. The authors studied three compact groups (HCG 79, HCG 88, and HCG 95) as a pilot study and were able to detect IGL in HCG 79 and HCG 95. HCG 79 had an irregular IGL distribution, possibly a mix of stripped material and blue dwarf galaxies destruction, while HCG 95 had an almost spherical IGL distribution with colors typical of old stellar populations. The non-detection of IGL in HCG 88 indicates an early stage of dynamical evolution. The presence of IGL indicates gravitational bound configurations with stripped mass from member galaxies and advanced stages of dynamical evolution, which can be used to test formation and evolution models of groups.", "The problem of within-network classification in partial labeled networks has gained attention recently. The goal is to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes in a network based on known labels and network structure. Many algorithms have been proposed for this task, which can be applied to various fields such as hypertext categorization, fraud detection in cell phone networks, email classification, and predicting disease-related genes. The existing methods can be classified into two groups: collective classification and semi-supervised learning. Collective classification uses three types of correlations to make predictions: node label and attributes, node label and neighbor's attributes, and node label and neighbor's label. This method has the advantage of learning dependency structures but struggles with accurate classification when labeled nodes are sparse. On the other hand, semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training and assumes consistency with label information, but its performance degrades when this assumption doesn't hold. In this paper, the authors propose a method that adds ghost edges between labeled and unlabeled nodes to allow the flow of information from labeled to unlabeled nodes. They assign weights to ghost edges based on the even-step random walk with restart algorithm. Experimental results on real-world data showed that their method can solve the sparsity and negative correlation problems and outperform existing approaches.", "In this paper, the authors explore the theory of phase transitions in multilayers, specifically focusing on large-scale ordering in superlattices. They study a simple superlattice geometry constructed of atomically thick layers of two ferromagnets and examine how long-range ferromagnetic order appears in the superlattice and the critical behavior observed at that temperature. They find that the critical behavior of the superlattice can be largely universal depending on the bulk critical properties of the two components and the geometry of the superlattice. The authors analyze the different geometrical elements present in the superlattice, including surface critical phenomena, bulk critical behavior, and film-to-bulk crossovers. They also discuss the limitations of their model and the potential for future research in this area.", "Large-scale electromagnetic fields of bright crab-like pulsars have been described using force-free electrodynamics (FFE). FFE allows for the calculation of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere, where the entire spin-down power is carried by the large-scale Poynting flux. However, FFE predicts zero radiation, which is not consistent with the observed luminosity of crab-like pulsars. To account for radiation, dissipation needs to be added to FFE. A dissipative extension of FFE called strong-field electrodynamics (SFE) has been formulated. It has been shown that in the high conductivity limit, SFE reduces to FFE with small dissipative corrections in regions with space-like currents. Singularities and failures of the model are not the same thing, as singularities can be physical. It has been argued that SFE, regularized by small diffusion, is well-defined everywhere. SFE can be used to study dissipation in FFE and potentially calculate the dissipative pulsar magnetosphere. The emission of bright pulsars is expected to primarily come from the magnetic separatrix where the current is space-like. FFE describes electromagnetic fields with special geometry, where the electric field is smaller than and perpendicular to the magnetic field. SFE, on the other", "The properties of spin and isospin symmetric nuclear matter are still not well understood. Different physical pictures exist in relativistic and non-relativistic approaches, and different mechanisms are used to describe saturation properties. Constraints on spin and/or isospin polarized states of nuclear matter are limited. This paper focuses on the spin degrees of freedom of symmetric nuclear matter and the spin-dependent symmetry potential. The results show that the spin-up and spin-down potentials become more attractive and more repulsive, respectively, with increasing density. The spin symmetry potential is found to have a similar behavior to the symmetry potential for isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for more empirical constraints to better understand the spin-dependent part of the nucleon-nucleus optical potential.", "The text discusses the concept of wormhole solutions and their association with violations of the energy conditions. It mentions the use of exotic matter in wormhole solutions and suggests minimizing its usage. The text also describes the construction of wormhole solutions using the cut-and-paste technique and analyzes the surface stress-energy tensor components of the exotic matter. It explores the stability of thin-shell wormholes and discusses the effects of a cosmological constant on the stability. The text provides an analysis of stability for different types of wormholes, including charged and schwarzschild-de sitter wormholes. It concludes by discussing the limitations of the analysis due to the lack of a detailed microphysical model for exotic matter.", "The text discusses the surface structure of quasicrystals and the relationship between the surface and the bulk structure. It mentions the use of various techniques such as dynamical low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to study the surface. The authors present a theoretical model based on tiling and polytopes to explain the observed surface structure. They also compare their model to experimental STM images and show that it is consistent with the observed surface. The text concludes by discussing the implications of their findings and acknowledging their funding sources.", "The resolution of any optical instrument is limited by the wavelength of the light it uses. However, sub-wavelength information can be obtained by probing the near field, which contains both propagating and evanescent modes. Near-field imaging techniques involve using a scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) to probe the near field. SNOMs have a surface that is illuminated from above by laser light passing down an optical fibre with a tapered end coated in metal. As the tip is scanned over the surface, the transmitted light is collected and an image is built up. Theorists play a critical role in interpreting the images produced by the microscope and optimizing the tip and illumination system. One group has dominated the theory of the near-field microscope by introducing an iterative green's function based method. However, their method relies on a real space discretization, which can be limiting. An alternative approach is to use an adaptive mesh scheme, which allows for a more accurate representation of the tip shape. This can be applied to other techniques such as Girard's method or finite difference time domain methods. The resolution and signal strength of a SNOM can be improved by using a coaxial tip design, which allows for the propagation of a guided mode called the TEM mode with no cut-off. The", "The text discusses the theoretical and experimental investigations of silicon surfaces, with a focus on the high index surfaces. The (001) and (111) surfaces have been extensively studied, while the (211), (311), (331), and other higher index surfaces have recently gained attention. These high index surfaces are of interest due to their potential role in technological applications. One interesting property of these surfaces is the occurrence of steps and terraces. For example, the Si(211) surface can be seen as a stepped arrangement of narrow (111) terraces. The text also discusses the possible reconstructions of the Si(211) surface and the adsorption of other elements, such as As and Te, on this surface. The results of extensive first-principles calculations are presented, showing the binding energies and structures of these adsorbed elements on the Si(211) surface.", "Neutrons are a significant source of background for underground experiments studying phenomena such as neutrino oscillation and dark matter. They can be created through interactions of cosmic-ray muons with matter in underground laboratories. These neutrons have a broad energy distribution and can penetrate into detectors without being vetoed, leading to fake signals. The Aberdeen Tunnel experiment in Hong Kong aims to study the production of spallation neutrons by cosmic-ray muons at a depth of 235 meters of rock. The experiment uses a tracking detector for tagging muons and a neutron detector filled with a liquid scintillator for detecting spallation neutrons. The experiment\u2019s details, calibration, data acquisition, and simulations are described. The Aberdeen Tunnel laboratory is located at the mid-point of a 1.9-km long tunnel with a rock overburden of 611 meters of water equivalent (m.w.e.). The underground laboratory is accessed through a cross passage connecting the two traffic tubes. The laboratory is constructed in granite and vitric tuff rocks. The chemical and physical properties of rock samples collected near the tunnel are analyzed. The energy scale calibration of the neutron detector is regularly performed using calibration sources to check operational stability. The high-voltage power supply for the photomultiplier tubes (P", "The interplay between disorder and many-body interactions is an important topic in condensed matter physics. In one-dimensional quantum many-body systems without disorder, the Bethe ansatz has been a useful tool for studying integrable models. It was initially believed that integrability would preclude the study of disordered systems. However, in 1984, it was shown that the Bethe ansatz method could be applied to the Kondo problem, which is a single magnetic impurity in a bath of conduction electrons. This led to the construction and solution of integrable spin chains with embedded spin defects. Another approach to integrable impurity models was considered, where impurity vertices were introduced by varying the local interaction parameters while preserving integrability. These studies have led to further investigations of impurities in various systems. The resulting models have impurity terms that couple to the charge degrees of freedom and look similar to generic impurity terms. However, the energy spectrum is independent of the spatial distribution of the defects, and there is no localization of the ground-state wave function, unlike what is expected for generic impurities. This behavior can be explained by the fact that integrability implies a purely forward-scattering mechanism at the impurities. Back-scattering can be introduced by choosing suitable boundary conditions.", "Neutrino masses provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model, but there are still many unanswered questions about neutrinos. It is unknown whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles, and the pattern of neutrino masses is not well understood. The dynamics by which neutrinos acquire mass and the scale at which this occurs are also unknown. One possibility is that the Standard Model neutrinos acquire mass through the seesaw mechanism at or close to the weak scale. This mechanism could be accessible to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC could detect right-handed neutrinos produced through decays of gauge bosons. There are different types of seesaw models, such as Type I, Type II, and Type III, which could be exciting for the LHC. In this article, the authors show that the pattern of neutrino masses is correlated to the spectrum of new particles at the weak scale in order to avoid the washout of any pre-existing baryon asymmetry. They provide predictions for each type of seesaw model and discuss the implications for LHC phenomenology.", "The paper discusses a new analytical approach, based on the flow equation method, to solve the real-time evolution problem in quantum many-body systems. The method combines the advantages of perturbation theory and renormalization group theory, and can be applied to a wide range of problems including dissipative quantum systems and lattice models. The authors demonstrate the accuracy of their approach by comparing their results to exact solutions in the dissipative harmonic oscillator and spin-boson models. They also show that their method can handle non-equilibrium correlation functions and two-time correlation functions. Overall, the paper presents a promising new approach to studying the real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems.", "Neutron stars are a type of compact star with high mass and small radius, resulting in very high density. General relativity must be taken into account when studying these stars due to the curvature of spacetime. Baade and Zwicky first proposed the idea of neutron stars in 1934, suggesting that they would be formed in supernova explosions. The forces acting on a star include gravity and pressure, with thermal pressure for ordinary stars and degeneracy pressure for white dwarfs and neutron stars. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, derived from Einstein's field equation, gives the pressure gradient of neutron stars. A modified TOV equation for calculating the maximum mass of a neutron star can be obtained for an accelerating universe. Anisotropic models for compact self-gravitating objects have also been studied extensively. The derivation of the new equation and the numerical calculation of maximum neutron star mass are discussed. The equation of state for neutron stars is used to relate pressure and energy density. The influence of a cosmological constant on the stellar structure is examined, and the modified TOV equation may also be useful in calculating surface tension of compact stars.", "Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure along the line-of-sight can affect the observed number density of galaxies on the sky. This effect, known as magnification bias, can either enhance or suppress the number density of galaxies, depending on the slope of the number counts of galaxies in a sample with a limiting magnitude. Magnification bias can also lead to an excess correlation of quasars and foreground galaxies associated with the lensing mass distribution. There have been several measurements of the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation, but there are discrepancies between these measurements and theoretical predictions. Observational effects, such as bias in the selection of quasar samples and physical associations of quasars and galaxies, as well as improved theoretical modeling of lensing, have been discussed as possible resolutions to this problem. In this paper, the authors use the halo model of clustering to model the galaxy distribution and compute the quasar-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy cross-correlations. They compare these model predictions to previous linear bias models and discuss the sensitivity of the results to various parameters. The authors also discuss the potential of forthcoming surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the CFHT Legacy Survey, in measuring magnification bias and improving our understanding of galaxy clustering.", "Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is a rapidly advancing technique that is used to study the electronic excitations in solid state systems. RIXS experiments are performed using high flux photon beams with energies tunable to resonant edges. The probability for x-rays to be scattered from a solid state system is greatly enhanced when the energy of the incoming photons is in the vicinity of an electronic eigenmode. The core-hole lifetime effect in RIXS is normally introduced as a broadening of the core-hole and disregarded in theoretical treatments. However, recent studies have shown that the short lifetime of the core-hole can have advantages in the theory of RIXS. The ultrashort lifetime leads to a systematic expansion of the scattering cross section in terms of the lifetime. The most important consequence of the ultrashort core-hole lifetime is that the effective scattering cross section is proportional to the charge structure factor and the longitudinal spin structure factor. RIXS experiments have the potential to measure low-lying electronic excitations such as magnons, plasmons, orbitons, excitons and single-particle-like continua related to the band structure. The scattering cross section for RIXS is expressed in terms of physical correlation functions, such as the dynamical charge and spin", "The paper discusses light-cone gauge string field theory in noncritical space-time dimensions. It presents a brst invariant formulation of the worldsheet theory and shows how to calculate correlation functions. The authors also discuss the use of dimensional regularization to regularize string field theory. They calculate the correlation functions for the closed bosonic string field theory and show that they are well-defined and have the desired properties. They also discuss the construction of interaction vertices and the possibility of using the theory to study d-branes.", "This paper discusses different rulesets in combinatorial game theory based on various data structures such as arrays, sets, stacks, queues, priority queues, linked lists, and binary trees. It explores the algorithmic difficulty of determining winning moves, outcome classes, and values of game positions in these rulesets. It provides formal definitions for each ruleset and presents known algorithmic results for solving them. It also mentions the importance of understanding number values, nimbers, outcome classes, as well as game-set notation in comprehending the concepts discussed in the paper. The paper further highlights the computational complexity of solving different rulesets, ranging from solvable in polynomial time to intractable. It concludes by stating the three open problems concerning the computational difficulty of some of the games discussed.", "Intermediate scale disk galaxies with starbursts are relatively common in the nearby universe. They are characterized by blue colors, strong emission lines, and gas-rich systems. These starbursts are similar to faint blue compact narrow emission line galaxies that are common at high redshifts. The starbursts in nearby galaxies show evidence of being dynamically cool, with strong spiral arms or bars. The processes that produced these starbursts did not severely disrupt the disk or the disk reformed during the starburst event. Moderate interactions, such as glancing collisions or minor mergers, are likely triggers for many starbursts. There are three possible explanations for this behavior: 1) Near face-on systems can transmit UV light through areas where the disk has been cleaned out by supernovae and other events. 2) Low inclination disks can mimic the kinematics of low mass galaxies. 3) Undisturbed intermediate mass galaxies, such as extreme late-type and superthin spirals, can store interstellar gas over cosmic timescales and fuel starbursts. UV-bright regions of starbursts frequently occur in features associated with disks, such as rings or arms.", "Supersymmetry is a promising extension of the standard model, but it must be broken in our four-dimensional world. One way to break supersymmetry is through a toroidal compact dimension, which leads to spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to the different boundary conditions of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. The effective potential of the theory determines when supersymmetry is broken, and it can be avoided in theories with compact spatial dimensions. In this article, the authors study a 4-dimensional supersymmetric model with one toroidal compact dimension and find that supersymmetry breaks dynamically as the size of the compact dimension changes. They also discuss the similarities between this phenomenon and inverse symmetry breaking at finite temperature. The authors consider different scenarios where supersymmetry is broken or unbroken depending on the parameters and provide cosmological implications of these results. They also discuss the relevance of their findings to the physics of extra dimensions and the theory of reheating after inflation.", "In this paper, the authors discuss the implications of parity violation in supersymmetric models of particle physics. They focus on the resonant production and decay of supersymmetric particles at hadron colliders, specifically the production of a primary resonance that undergoes a charged-current transition to a secondary resonance, which then decays to two jets. The authors argue that this topology can lead to interesting signatures at colliders and may explain recent experimental observations of resonances in dijets produced in association with a W boson. They also discuss the implications of this topology for the search for dark matter and alternative models of new physics. Finally, the authors consider other scenarios, such as the resonant production of left-handed sleptons through a different type of parity-violating coupling. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of further exploration of the collider signatures of parity-violating supersymmetric models, even if the recent experimental observations are not explained by new physics.", "The x-ray transient, XTE J1752-223, was discovered by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer on October 23, 2009. The 2010 outburst of XTE J1752-223 was monitored by the MAXI and Swift observatories in the x-ray domain. The outburst exhibited an evolving behavior consistent with that of a stellar mass black hole binary. During the outburst, the radio counterpart of XTE J1752-223 was identified with a flat spectrum and a 10-fold increase in flux density. This suggested that a major ejection event was imminent, and indeed, a transient jet was detected. Follow-up observations found that the transient jet showed significant deceleration, possibly due to interaction with the surrounding medium. The paper also presents additional observations that reveal a new transient ejection event and a stationary feature identified as the core. The paper discusses the proper motion of the transient ejecta, analyzes the compact jet region, and discusses the possible interaction with the large-scale medium. The observations were conducted using VLBI and WSRT imaging, and the results showed an extended jet and a profound one-sided morphology. The paper also discusses the variability of the compact jet during the soft to hard x-ray state transition and the re-activation", "Neutrino oscillation measurements have had a significant impact on theory and will continue to do so. The small masses of neutrinos allow us to probe physics at high energies, and neutrino oscillation is a unique tool for studying this. Recent neutrino oscillation results suggest a connection to the energy scale of apparent gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Neutrino oscillation data has also revealed surprising patterns in neutrino masses and mixings, challenging previous expectations. The underlying flavor symmetries behind these patterns are still being determined, and future measurements of the type of hierarchy, CP violation, and mixing angles will be critical. These measurements will help us understand the dynamics behind flavor and may lead to even more surprises. Additionally, the LSND experiment may have a significant impact on theory depending on the outcome of further studies. Overall, neutrino oscillation physics has already had a big impact on theory, and there is still much more to learn.", "The text discusses the importance of interfacial properties in first-order phase transformations and specifically focuses on the solid-liquid interfacial free energy (@xmath0). Accurate data for @xmath0 is not widely known, and there are limited experimental techniques to measure it. The text introduces different methods to calculate @xmath0, including the capillary fluctuation method (CFM), cleaving methods (CM), and classical nucleation theory (CNT). The authors propose a novel technique using metadynamics to compute @xmath0, which aims to be robust, efficient, and transferable. The method involves reconstructing a coarse-grained free energy surface using metadynamics simulations and utilizing a specific order parameter to distinguish between the solid and liquid phases. The authors describe the computational details of the simulations and present results for a simple Lennard-Jones system, comparing them with other available methods. They also discuss the potential application of their approach in conjunction with ab-initio molecular dynamics. Overall, the method shows promise for accurately computing @xmath0 and extending the scope of interfacial energy calculations to more complex systems."]
