The reduced maxwell-duffing type equations describing the dynamics of such a medium are derived and it is emphasized that the effects of field losses are neglected. The governing equations are found to be two-wave maxwell-duffing equations that describe solitons in a linear dielectric medium containing an array of thin films that contain plasmonic oscillations. The derivation of these equations is based on idealized case studies wherein pulse duration is much shorter than the characteristic time of losses. The polarization of the medium is attributed to plasmonic oscillations that are modeled by lorentz oscillators. These oscillations have anharmonic nature and the corresponding dimensionless coefficient of anharmonicity is included in the model. The polarization can be decoupled into two parts and is coupled with one field variable only and the resulting equation is given to be coupled with only one field variable. The spectral line is represented by a dirac function and the resulting equations are rewritten as coupled equations for polarizations. \n\nThis summary is an example of how a complex", "The writer discusses their views on the topic of summarizing.

In particular, the simple exclusion process and the zero-range process have emerged as paradigms for nonequilibrium systems. When such processes are considered with periodic boundary conditions, a phase transition can occur either due to dynamical features such as particle jump rates or due to the presence of disorder on the lattice. On the other hand, the presence of open boundaries is significant enough to lead to boundary-induced phase transitions. The phase diagram is well understood for the basic version of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries. Besides its analytic solutions, the underlying physical mechanism is also well understood in terms of the group velocity or the domain wall velocity and collective velocity. Recently, it was reported that some additional dynamical features such as evaporation and deposition or nonlocal hopping lead to new kinds of phases and phase transitions. In this paper, we study the phase transition in a generalized version of the one-dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) with open boundaries where the additional feature of nonlocal hopping is included.

This model of low-energy supersymmetry has a much smaller-dimensional parameter space than the minimal supersymmetric model with a SU(3) x parity symmetry, mr model offers some advantages. A region of the minimal supersymmetric model with SU(3) x parity has some phenomenology similar to that of mr model.

Continuity of [gamma]3 symmetry implies a colored chiral superfield and suppresses Majorana gaugino masses, it also implies that the gluino mass is negligible compared to the effects of the diagrams considered here and it is ignored in further discussion.

They are brighter and blue than normal stars in that generation from the same region of a globular cluster. Because of this, they are believed to be formed from dead and dying stars (mass donor). They are seen throughout the whole Milky Way (more in the center), and others. This study explores their existence in two isolated dwarf galaxies (Cetus and Tucana), and investigates their properties and nature using photometry data and simulations. While the properties of the straggler populations are different from the other stars in the galaxy, they resemble one another, indicating their uniform nature. And their brightness and blue color are caused by different levels of stellar evolution. The straggler populations also seem to be the same as the straggler populations found in globular clusters. The observations are consistent with a small number of straggler stars, formed at the beginning of the universe, and most straggler stars are formed inside globular clusters after stars have evolved.\nThe author presents a detailed study of straggler stars (bss) in two isolated dwarf galaxies.

Regardless of the differences between frustrated lattices and chemical bond breaking, the strong-correlation phenomenon in these systems has similar roots which are manifested by the breakdown of the mean-field picture. Despite the details of the problem at hand, strong-correlation has significant impact on many important aspects of the physics of various systems and cannot be ignored. A low computational cost, qualitatively correct description of strongly-correlated materials would have a great impact on the quality of theoretical predictions. The quest for developing novel and as well as improving existing approaches for strong-correlation continues unabated. One of the reasons that robust methods for the treatment of strong-correlation are so elusive is related to the size of the systems of current interest. With increasing number of electronic degrees of freedom, the numerical complexity of exactly solving the problem quickly becomes prohibitively large; approximate methods must be therefore employed. An ideal approximation should provide a systematic and qualitatively correct description that is computationally accessible and does not deteriorate with system size. Such an ideal tool would be therefore applicable to a broad range of problems. From a practical point of view, approximate methods should offer a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost", "A simple factor is given to the cosmic shear two-point correlation function that accounts for lensing between galaxies of all ellipticities at small separation distances. This factor quantifies the new effect that a nearby elliptical galaxy acts as a lens to create a net anti-correlation between the shear and ellipticity of background galaxies. This new effect should be quantified for ellipticity and shear correlation functions by its impact on measurements of shear angular correlation at small separation angles. The signal is seen to increase the small angle correlation function, so that it is necessary to correct for this effect in order to accurately measure cosmic shear by tomographic methods. The results also clarify the behavior of ellipticity correlation functions on small scales that have been seen in numerical simulations. A separate effect from intrinsic ellipticity alignments requires an understanding of tidal alignments of galaxies. It is shown that this new effect requires an estimate of ellipticity correlations between a pair of galaxies at all distances when they are gravitationally lensed by a nearby elliptical galaxy.", "KEYWORDS [ sec_discretionary_turbulence ] we review the properties of radiation mhd in the context of radiation transport @xcite.

The current findings confirm the role played by the milky way environment on the evolution of the gcs.

It turns out that the CMS cavern may allow for an easier installation and more room for a massive stopper, compared to the Atlas cavern. The weights of the two detectors are different, but in general, the parameters of the two detectors are given in Table 1. The diameter of the CMS detector is smaller, allowing the massive stopper to be placed closer to the interaction point of the detector. Therefore, a massive stopper with a weight around a few kton can be placed on both sides of the CMS detector, but it necessitates some changes towards the scaffolding and gallery paths around the cavern walls. Meanwhile, in most cases, the components of the CMS detector are assembled on the ground, and approximately 15 large detector units are lowered in the cavern for final assembly. Therefore, the installation is relatively less integrated with the cavern, leaving more freedom for the placement of massive stoppers.

It is one of the biggest open problems in theoretical physics today. While progress has been made, progress has been slow. This problem offers an opportunity to improve our theories. There is a possibility that quantum gravitational phenomena might be observable, but this possibility is not well-known or frequently discussed. The paper reviews the theory of space-time defects and suggests that space-time is fundamentally discrete, making smooth space-time an approximation. The prevalence and properties of these defects can then be derived from observation. The paper aims to parameterize the consequences of space-time defects to make contact with the underlying theory if the relevant parameters can be extracted. This would allow the development of the theory. There are two types of space-time defects, local defects and nonlocal defects. The paper explains that a macroscopic locality may be expected to arise in approaches towards quantum gravity in which space-time is only to good approximation a smooth manifold, but fundamentally a network. Nonlocal links can occur without changing the emergent macroscopic locality.

Alternatively, one can consider the vertices to be mapped to coplanar disks of unit diameter. An independent dominating set is a subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices, an independent set is a subset of vertices that are not adjacent. A maximal independent set is a independent dominating set that is also an independent set. Dominating sets and independent dominating sets in unit disk graphs may have several applications, including wireless ad-hoc networks. There are several kinds of algorithms that can be used to solve such problems: graph-based algorithms and geometric algorithms. Previous techniques and algorithms presented to solve the problems include a graph-based algorithm that runs in linear time, as well as its geometric counterpart that runs in time that is independent of the number of edges, regardless of the number of edges.

The model we used is a simple version of a preferential attachment model, where in every new node, a certain number of connections to existing nodes is made. The resulting network has the same statistical properties as a more complicated model containing nodes with distinct characteristics. The key parameter which determines the statistical properties of the network and phase transition is the probability of connection between a new node and an existing node. This is determined by a distance function between nodes. The properties of the network can be calculated exactly, allowing for a rich variety of networks to be studied.

Facebook allows people to connect with each other, share their thoughts and experiences, and form online communities. The network of Facebook is constantly evolving and changing as new people join and old people leave. Over time, some users become more popular than others, forming clusters of friends or followers.

We develop a slender magnetic fibril model of coronal loops, and then proceed to derive an analytic solution for the equilibrium of the fibril subject to the magnetic bond force - free condition. The equilibrium solution corresponds to a coronal loop which has a constant magnetic bond number.

The intensity measured in the ArPES ( Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy ) experiments fundamentally depends on the properties of the initial and final states in the presence of the surface. Therefore, the ArPES intensity can differ greatly from the spectral density of the initial state involved in the excitation. In addition, the Matrix Element Effect must be understood to achieve a satisfactory interpretation of the ArPES spectra. Consequently, the article discusses various aspects of the ground state electronic structure, such as the connection between the ArPES spectra and the character of the initial and final states, and the behavior of individual transitions within the one-step and three-step models.", "Darwinists have trouble explaining cooperation among animals.

A characteristic feature of this system is a complex many valley structure of the energy landscape of the state space. At sufficiently low temperatures, the system cannot be considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and non-ergodic effects are important. Thus, it is not applicable to use the Gibbs ensemble theory of statistical mechanics. This work investigates non-ergodic effects in the specific heat of the coulomb glass. The Coulomb-Glass model is introduced. Low-energy many-particle states are obtained numerically, and the transition probabilities between states are calculated. The structure of the graph is determined, which maps the dynamic behavior of the coulomb glass sample to a graph.

The proposed lattice interferometer configuration could provide unprecedented sensitivities for a wide variety of applications and could operate over long distance scales. The sensitivity of lattice interferometers is illustrated by the fact that a lattice gravimeter with separated arms and a limited interrogation time has a sensitivity of 1e-15 Hz/Hz.

The array on which the survey was performed was a meridian transit instrument consisting of 4095 full-wave dipoles operating at a wavelength of 5m. The dipoles were arranged in 32 east-west rows of 128 dipoles each, and the resulting signals were phase-combined to form simultaneous beams at 16 declinations in the range [7, 21]. In order to detect pulsars, the array was shifted to generate an extra phase gradient, resulting in a set of 16 beams that were phased to use the plus sign in the first factor of the power response equation, and use the minus sign for half-integral beam numbers. For the purposes of the 1993 pulsar detection survey, the half-power transit time of a source at 7-21 was one hour in the beams that possess secondary responses comparable to, or even greater than their primary responses. The survey utilized each of the 32 beams to find and detect pulsars, ensuring a full sky coverage.", "text-based summarizations include summarization language models in which a text is directly summarized into a shorter one, while non-text summarization includes summarization by generating images, videos, text summaries, etc.\nAs an AI language model, I don't have the capability to understand the content in this text and generate a summary.

The theory explains the solid as a spatial perturbation of a liquid, while the direct correlation function of the hard-sphere fluid is taken as the canonical model for freezing. The author explains that when the hard-core system is characterized by a close-packing density, the density-functional theory is useful. An alternative scenario to the bifurcation of a crystalline solution from the liquid at a spinodal point is two solid solution branches smoothly connected to each other.

The Ramakrishnan-Yussouff functional and the Rosenfeld fundamental measure functional are used to analyze the equilibrium density distribution. Stationarity and normalization equations are given.

To ensure the success and strengthen the physical case of such a machine, a precise understanding of the theoretical predictions is of paramount importance. In particular, bhabha scattering is important for luminosity monitoring and hence a vital ingredient of almost every measurement.

Here, we are presenting the first progress made towards a complete two-loop calculation. At the born level, the bhabha scattering process is characterized through an S-channel and L-channel photon exchange diagram. One-loop radiative corrections constitute the two-loop calculation in the form of 1-loop contribution diagrams to the cross section. To generate the diagrams in a postscript file as well as in symbolic notation for further algebraic manipulation and to incorporate crossing symmetry, we use diana - the diagram analyser by Tentyukov and Fleischer.

This occurs when a material reaches a critical point where it separates into two or more distinct phases. In this process, an interface is typically eliminated, resulting in an increase in the size of homogeneous regions. Traditional non-equilibrium dynamics, typically, deals with equilibrium states that are spatially uniform.\nIt is stated that a model should be developed that can capture the details at the atomic scale and can describe many of the properties of polycrystalline materials during non-equilibrium processing. The equations of motion governing these non-equilibrium phenomena are nonlinear partial differential equations that can not be solved analytically for random initial conditions. Therefore, computer simulations play an essential role in the understanding and characterization of non-equilibrium phenomena. It is explained that euler integration is known to be unstable for time step greater than a threshold, fixed by the lattice spacing.

The goal of this study was to determine the QCD phase diagram, including the properties of the phase transition for chiral symmetry restoration. The QCD formalism made use of an effective potential around the critical point for composite operators. Analysis of the phase transition was based on a scalar-pseudoscalar mass ratio and temperature dependence. The chiral transition can thus be identified with the thermally averaged scalar-pseudoscalar mass ratio. At zero temperature, the scalar and pseudoscalar masses have finite values. When chiral symmetry is restored, the two mesons are degenerate in mass, and the ratio vanishes. At zero temperature, the pseudoscalar mass decreases to zero, while the chiral condensation in the finite temperature thermally averaged scalar bilinear leads to a ratio of @xmath10. The temperature dependence of the mass ratio is calculated in composite operator formalism and its behavior discussed. The mass ratio at low temperature is close to one, while at higher temperature it decreases.

Self-consistency can be ensured by the probability operator measure (POM), which determines and limits how a system is prepared or measured while allowing the possibility of consistent loops, which can come about through quantum mechanics.

The POM provides a device for the preparation and measurement of quantum systems, and its trace indicates the possible states in which a system can be found. Quantum mechanics also allows for the possibility of self-consistent loops, which occur naturally in nature, and their prevention can be attributed to the principle of self-consistency.

The source, which was detected by BeppoSax, _ rosat_sax, and ASCA, was associated by Hughes et al. (1994) with SNR010172.4. However, several arguments are presented here to make the binary association unlikely.

While some of these employ deep matching scores for estimating the best match in image pair i for every location in image i, almost all methods employ multiple steps that do not involve learning. with the current affinity toward end-to-end deep learning solutions, the existence of large training datasets, and many concurrent contributions in the field of deep optical flow and related fields, one may wonder why this is the case. out of the four phases of modern optical flow pipelines, the authors focus on the third step, in which a sparse list of matches is transformed into dense optical flow maps. they are inspired by neuronal filling in to incorporate the three concepts of neighbor neuron interactions, multi-layer supervision, and edge importance. They design an interpolation network to incorporate these concepts and incorporate a loss to force the neighbor neuron interactions. the new interpolation method is based on a deep convolutional neural network and leads to an improvement in both accuracy and speed over the epicflow method. finally, it is noteworthy that some of the new optical flow methods do not rely on the standard pipeline. an interesting example is the flownet model presented by dosovitskiy et al.", "The inverse problem of scintillation is revisited, and the Kolmogorov model for the power spectrum of the plasma density spectrum is reviewed with focus on its shortcomings and inconsistencies with observations.

Upon the discovery of graphene, Raman spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool to identify the number of layers, structure, doping, disorder, and to characterize the phonons and electron-phonon coupling. Most of the previous attention has focused on the position and width of the Raman peaks. Here we present a detailed calculation of the intensities of the multiphonon Raman peaks in graphene. Raman scattering involves an electron-hole pair as an intermediate state. We show that the multiphonon Raman peaks are strongly sensitive to the dynamics of this electron-hole pair. Raman scattering can be used as a tool to probe this dynamics. The low-energy hamiltonian of the interaction of electrons with the crystal vibrations and the electromagnetic field from pure symmetry considerations is described. The electron scattering rate is introduced phenomenologically as another parameter. The results of the present calculation are used to extract information about these parameters from the Raman peak intensities, measured experimentally.

The formation and growth history of these MBHs presents a puzzle. Here we explore a different class of explanations based on the effects of a warm primordial magnetic field during the collapse of gas in a halo. In the limit of stronger fields, we find that the collapsing gas will avoid fragmentation, cool efficiently, and reach a critical density at which it can collapse rapidly and form a MBH. The critical field strength above which this occurs is comparable to the strength of an expected cosmic background field. In contrast, earlier calculations relied on UV irradiation to avoid cooling. This field strength turns out to be insufficient to keep gas warm and avoid fragmentation in all cases. The existence of a strong PMF is a new result, and opens up a new avenue for the growth of MBHs in early galaxies. _____________________________________________________________________________________________", "The interaction between neutral objects is dominated by fluctuation forces due to the coordinated behavior of fluctuating charges or collective modes inside the objects. At zero temperature or at sufficiently small distances, the interactions result from quantum fluctuations. They are important on atomic scales as well as between macroscopic bodies. A prominent example for the latter is the Casimir force between parallel metallic plates due to current or electromagnetic field fluctuations. High precision measurements of the Casimir force have been performed with increasing precision, and have been enabled by the use of curved surfaces instead of parallel planar mirrors. A new method for the computation of Casimir interactions between compact objects, including mirrors as in this work, is described that is based on a multipole expansion of fluctuating charges. It can be applied to scalar and electromagnetic fields, as well as to all types of boundary conditions. The interaction of a sphere with an infinite plane mirror can be described by the equivalent problem of the interaction of the objects with their mirror images in otherwise empty space, which we show in this work. The equivalence holds for Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for a scalar field and for a perfectly conducting mirror plane and arbitrary dielectric objects, in the case of electromagnetic fluctuations.

The author argues that this property applies to fluid flow, more precisely the equations which govern fluid motion, the Navier-Stokes equations which become fragile in the limit of small viscosity or large Reynolds number. When the initial conditions are random, the shocks splitting occurs at any time, as shown in Fig 4. This splitting property indicates maximally non-unique ( fragile) solutions, i.e., the solutions are maximally uncertain and unpredictable, even for identical initial conditions, which is different from usual systems whose solutions are uniquely determined from given initial conditions. The author demonstrates this claim by establishing that fluid flow is maximally non-unique when viscosity is reduced and Reynolds number is large.", "White dwarfs in Kep-int Field photometry has increased the white dwarf sample, particularly in the zzCeti instability strip.

In these quantum games, the game strategy choice is limited to classical probabilistic choices. The game is based on the set of probabilistic relations between quantum measurements relevant to the shared quantum system. \n\nThe two-player game described in this paper involves a set of measurements performed by Alice and Bob. The measurements are limited to certain directions of polarizations or spins. The outcome of the measurement is defined for the classical probabilistic outcomes, which depend on the choices of Alice and Bob. The paper explores the probability measures related to the measurement outcomes, and determines the set of possible combinations that violate quantum Bell inequalities. The classical probabilities are expressed by the constraints on these measures. The quantum outcomes are identified as the new quantum outcomes that cannot be obtained in classical games.\n\nThe paper discusses the possibility of finding a strategy that can be used by Alice and Bob to have non-classical quantum outcomes that are not possible in", "In this paper, the author summarizes the effort to use the Subaru telescope to search for proper motions among very faint stars.

This text discusses the properties of hadrons, their masses at finite density and temperature, and the phase transition from the hadronic phase to the quark gluon plasma. The nonperturbative calculations at finite temperature and/or density support the idea that hadronic masses change as a function of temperature variations. The nucleon mass is found to depend substantially on temperature variations of the quark condensate and interaction process. As the condensate disappears smoothly with chiral symmetry restoration, so does the nucleon mass. Particles interacting in a system are described by a self-consistent calculation in which the constituent particles are incorporated. In the bag model, nucleons are considered as being composed of two scalar diquark and one quark bound states. The bound state is described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation with appropriate modifications for finite temperature. The calculations presented here are an extension of previous work on quarks at finite temperature to include hadrons. The scalar diquark and quark propagators are presented, and the diquark and quark propagators are adopted from previous work. The mass dependencies are found so that the quark mass can be calculated from its constituent parts at finite temperature.

Entanglement is a key resource of quantum computation and quantum information processing. There have been different approaches to understand and quantify entanglement, but entanglement in a bipartite pure state has been investigated extensively. The strong subadditivity inequality (SSI) is a measure of entanglement for bipartite systems. In this text, the authors study the properties of a four-particle entangled state through the three-particle entropy and the SSI. The SSI refers to the fact that conditioning on one subsystem always reduces the entropy, discarding a quantum system never increases mutual information, and quantum operations never increase mutual information of two subsystems. Additionally, the conditional entropy is subadditive. To verify SSI, one requires a three-particle mixed state.", "The author presents a paper that attempts to provide an explanation for the cold and dense quark matter region.

They study the dynamics of the fluorescent light emitted by the quantum well in strong coupling regime. The paper has extensive calculations leading to different expressions.

These puzzles possess ingenious solutions which, if considered carefully, lead to interesting problems in low-dimensional topology. In this paper, the goal is to prove that a particular solution of the Chinese Rings puzzle is the simplest possible as conjectured in @cite. The solution to this puzzle requires an arc to be drawn, and the complexity of a solution is the minimal number of times the elastic ring passes through the arc in the process of that solution. The problem of minimizing the complexity was first conjectured by L. Kauffman in @cite. The complexity of the solution is related to a topological problem and a theoretical solution exists. Removing the arc @xmath1 from @xmath11 makes the loose ring no longer contractible, and the complexity of a solution for the puzzle is the minimal number of passes of the ring through @xmath1 necessary for contracting the ring to a point.

The Erez-Rosen solution is an exact spacetime solution of the vacuum Einstein equation that describes a static and spherically symmetric background, endowed with a mass quadrupole moment, which affects the gravitational field. This solution is the generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime structure to the case of a gravitational source with an arbitrary mass quadrupole moment.  This structure is not unique, and may induce significant effects on the equilibrium solutions subject to the Poynting-Robertson (PR) effect. PR interaction leads to a force on a test particle that depends on its velocity, and is perpendicular to both the radiation field and the gravitational force. This force is important for describing high-energy particles emitted by various high energy sources and for understanding compact objects.

It is also possible to reveal similar phenomena in the interaction of laser beams with laser-induced plasma from low-density solid target. There are several important features of these nonlinear resonances, such as the coherence of spontaneous processes, stimulated wave amplifications, and the coherent emission of photons from single particles. These nonlinear resonances can lead to high-net energy changes for laser-driven electron beams, generating ultra-low energy spread and emittance values, and even to free-electron laser generation. In all these stimulated interactions, there is a critical intensity of laser interaction that allows for the generation of non-linear resonances that result in acceleration and ultra-short laser radiation fields for the interaction with a strongly laser-pulsed beam.

It consists of a compact spatial hypersurface with positive curvature, called the @xmath0-sphere, which does not change under the flow of time. In order to obtain a static configuration, the vacuum solution of Maxwell's equations must be stationary. The most familiar static spacetime is the Einstein universe, also known as the Friedmann-Lematrie-Robertson-Walker model. Using the conformal relation between the Einstein universe and Minkowski spacetime, one can interpret the electomagnetic field in Minkowski's spacetime as an electromagnetic field in flat spacetime.

Based on the two-channel effective one-body (HTCM) model, the authors compare the scattering behavior in the odd and even sectors, finding a critical distinction between the two.

However, based on this text, I can suggest that atomic-level calculations, such as first-principles calculations using supercells, can be used to accurately determine thermodynamic data of solid solution phases, including mixing enthalpies. This is because supercells can be completely relaxed within density functional theory codes, which can be used to study atomic arrangements necessary for reproducing correlation functions of completely random solid solutions. The generated ternary supercells are characterized by their atomic arrangements that help reproduce multi-site occupation functions, and eventually, the impact of ternary interaction parameters on a ternary state can be studied using this supercell model. Furthermore, this supercell model can help describe binary and ternary systems, including solid solutions, in terms of their atomic arrangements and correlation functions. The text suggests that it is reasonable to anticipate that first-principles calculations of ternary supercells should be able to reproduce thermodynamic properties of ternary solid solutions if their atomic arrangements are very close to those of ternary solid solutions.

The model is described by a master equation that, for the pure initial qubit state, can be investigated by means of the time-dependent decoherence rate. The relation between the off-diagonal elements and the decoherence rate is obtained, and the general case of a mixed initial product state is investigated.

They carry out direct numerical simulations (DNS) of 2D free convection turbulence to investigate the effects of persistent motions on turbulent relative dispersion. By carrying out a detailed investigation of the PDF of exit-time statistics, they show that the PDF is divided into two regions corresponding to persistent expansion and random transition between expansion and compression of relative separation, respectively. They also provide a method for estimation of the parameters of the self-similar telegraph model by using exit-time PDF. From the summarized text, we have the impression that the research of turbulent relative dispersion in turbulence is one of the fundamental problems, and that relative dispersion process is governed by its locality in scale nature. In particular, persistence of motions has strong effects on turbulent relative dispersion. This persistence cannot be described only by random collision motions. The effects of persistent motions can even wipe out the effects of richardson s diffusion equation. The persistence structure is described well in the self-similar telegraph model, and researchers investigate the scaling nature in the inertial range and exit-time region. By carrying out direct numerical simulations, researchers show that the persistence structure of turbulent relative dispersion is confirmed", "In this paper we ask what sort of the scalar\u2013tensor Lagrangian can lead to effective phantom dark energy at the present epoch without violating constraints from solar system and local gravity experiments, time-dependence of the gravity constant, etc. We also ask whether fine-tuning of initial data is necessary and how long the duration of the phantom stage can be in the past. We find that models with the present phantom dark energy can be made consistent with all constraints, but one of the functions entering the scalar-tensor Lagrangian must have rather specific shape and the initial data must be strongly fine-tuned. Also, the phantom stage must have begun quite recently before that the scalar field was undistinguishable from quintessence. All this disfavors the effective phantom behavior in the scalar-tensor gravity. In fact, as we point out towards the end of the paper, some of the unpleasant properties we discuss must be present in scalar-tensor models for effective dark energy irrespectively of whether it is phantom or not.", "What are some takeaways from this academic paper?\nAs an AI language model, I cannot provide a personal response to whether the content of the academic paper should be summarized or not.

These two very important examples are water droplets in turbulent rain clouds and dust grains in turbulent accretion disks around growing stars. In both of these systems, the aerosol is unstable because the suspended particles collide. Therefore, collision processes have significant consequences, in particular for the formation of planets. Collisions occur due to molecular diffusion, but (as pointed out by Smoluchowski) macroscopic fluid motion can considerably increase the collision rate. An important result in the study of the collision rate is the Saffman-Turner formula, which predicts the macroscopic collision rate of small particles suspended in incompressible flows, based on the statistics of the fluid flow. The collisions are assumed to be instantaneous, which makes them elastic. We present a new theory to determine the collision rate of small particles suspended in incompressible and compressible turbulent flows. We also develop an exact formula for the collision rate of small particles in incompressible, turbulent flows, extending the Saffman-Turner formula in the limit where the kinetic theory of gases is applicable. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the theory to the study of the collision rate of small objects in turbulent flows.\nThere is a lot of", "Optical dispersive and diffractive media with quadratic nonlinearity are well known for their potential to support various types of solitons.

The ice is instrumented with photomultipliers to pick up the Cherenkov light from secondary charged particles. In order to reach the large volume needed to detect the expected small fluxes at high energies, the density of optical modules is far too sparse to measure. However, it has been recognized for a long time that these instruments can detect a supernova burst. The Cherenkov glow of the ice can be identified as time correlated noise among all phototubes. This approach has been used by Amanda to exclude the occurrence of a galactic sn over a recent observation period. The physics potential of a possible sn observation is essentially limited to its detection. For example, the simultaneous observation in both icecube and another large detector such as super-kamiokande or hyper-kamiokande would be especially useful. From the perspective of neutrino physics, a dual observation may well distinguish between the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. with all the low - energy observatories being in the northern hemisphere, icecube's location in antarctica is uniquely complementary for this purpose.

Quantum beats are related to the various types of level splittings. Non- equilibrium dynamics is important in semiconductor bulk systems and heterostructures.\nIn order to summarize this text, we can see that there are two main categories of phenomena happening in quantum mechanics related to photonics and ultrafast optical spectroscopy in semiconductors. One category is the incoherent phenomena happening in slow timescales compared to the dephasing time of the carriers, while the other category is the coherent phenomena happening in fast timescales where the phase relation between electrons and holes is significant and important for the analysis. The study of coherent phenomena in semiconductors dates back to the 1980s and involves the use of quantum - mechanical theory rather than the commonly used semiclassical boltzmann theory. This quantum - mechanical theory requires a well-defined phase relation that considers the phase coherence induced by laser photoexcitation.

They find the evaluation of tau production and tau propagation using a stochastic evaluation reliable. They compare the flux of taus following propagation through 10 km rock and 100 km rock using the stochastic evaluation with estimates of the emerging flux of taus using analytic approximations. They refine parameterizations of tau energy loss to approximate the flux of emerging taus using analytic approximations better than the stochastic evaluation. The best parameterization of the electromagnetic energy loss parameter is with a logarithmic dependence on tau energy.

The writer explains that, in particular, the author of the present text is interested in the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies, and in the role of large galaxies in the formation process of small galaxies. The focus of this summary is to analyze and present a simulation that involves the study of dwarf galaxies (since they are easier to understand and less complex than the formation of large galaxies like the Milky Way). In addition, the analysis shows that the chemical enrichment of the Interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that the gas in these galaxies was entirely self-enriched in metals, and that the IMF has a Salpeter law with a wide range of masses (from 0.1 to 100 solar masses). The simulations used in this article were aimed at reproducing the chemical properties of the Sculptor Dwarf galaxy, since it is the one that has the lowest metallicity tail, and it is also simple enough to understand.

The generalized bound is appropriate for proving the optimality of known codes in dimension d > 1 constructed in @xcite and gives an upper bound for subspace codes of dimension d that is comparable to a bound on a sphere packing parameter.

By identifying the rest frame picked out by the trace dynamics canonical ensemble as the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) this rest frame is taken to be the same as the frame used in spherically symmetric solutions. Different frames of reference exist and identifying the preferred frame picked out by the trace dynamics canonical ensemble changes the effect of the gravitational interaction. For the Schwarzschild metric solution, the modified action derived from the trace dynamics pre-quantum theory results in a term diverging as a function of the radial coordinate near the Schwarzschild radius. This effect significantly affects horizon structure for schwarzschild-like solutions.

The decoherence process is a critical obstacle against the quantum information processing, even though it is often regarded as a natural occurrence. It is believed that the decoherence process can be controlled through'markovian' reservoirs which enable the preservation of the coherent information of the system. On the other hand, the non-markovian reservoirs are believed to enhance the information exchange between the system, the environment and the two, through their memorization capacity. The study of the decoherence associated with non-markovian reservoirs requires the derivation of a completely positive master equation for the density operator, which is difficult to derive. Therefore, an effective hamiltonian approach is proposed, where certain collective degrees of freedom in the reservoir are identified and then controlled in a dynamics model. This enables the study of completely positive decoherence processes. Three examples of decoherence processes in a qubit are presented as follows: dephasing, depolarizing and amplitude damping.", "This is a text about a study of bismuth-related centers as potential candidates for fiber lasers and amplifiers.

The authors state that the data are not of sufficient quality to allow a six-parameter fit, but they indicate that the expectation from local isothermal approximation for disks may not hold in NGC 488, given that in the B band, a scale length shorter than the K band is observed. Overall, the pilot study shows the feasibility of deriving the shape of the velocity ellipsoid within a single galaxy, and the approach presented has the potential to be extended to other galaxies with higher-quality data.", "Massive stars dominate the feedback to the local interstellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies via their stellar winds and ultimate death as core-collapse supernovae.

Spectroscopically, WN stars are spectacular in appearance, with strong and broad emission lines instead of the narrow absorption lines which are typical of normal stellar populations. The class are named after Wolf & Rayet (1867), who identified three stars in Cygnus with such broad emission lines. It was immediately apparent that their spectra came in two flavours, subsequently identified as those with strong lines of helium and nitrogen (WN subtypes) and those with strong helium, carbon, and oxygen (WC and WO subtypes).

The author starts with asymptotically Minkowski space at the past infinity for aesthetic beauty and shows that the Galilean genesis solution is an attractor for a variety of initial conditions, including those with a negative Hubble parameter and/or finite curvature. The Horndeski theory or the generalized Galileon is known to be the most general scalar-tensor tensor theory with the second-order field equations, and it avoids Ostrogradski instabilities in spite of having higher derivative terms in the action. The theory can be generalized to have second-order field equations only in a specific gauge while maintaining the number of propagating degrees of freedom, which was realized by Gao. In the paper, the author extends this approach to construct an explicit lagrangian describing the unified scenario, starting from the genesis phase through inflation to the graceful exit.

Only in 1955, evidence for the existence of a planetary magnetic field other than the geomagnetic one was obtained through the observation of the Jovian decametric radio waves (Burke and Franklin, 1955). Since it had been more or less accepted until the end of the 19th century that geomagnetism arises from the remnant magnetization of the Earth, similar properties may have been assumed for the other terrestrial planets and the moon. However, this view lost its appeal, however, when the possibility of curie-temperature being exceeded in the Earth below a depth of about 30 km was considered. Ferromagnetic materials in the Earth\u2019s crust could thus explain only magnetic fields with a relatively short wavelength.

In the Rindler spacetime, the vacuum energy can be expressed in terms of expectations of energy-momentum tensors in the Robertson-Walker spacetime, provided the system is invariant under a conformal transformation between these spacetimes. This transformation is valid for massless scalar fields and electromagnetic fields. For the scalar field, we considered the Casimir effect on the plate. The vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor for a massless scalar field in the Rindler spacetime was studied. Similarly, the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor for an infinite parallel plate moving at the uniform speed in the Rindler spacetime was considered. The results obtained from the conformal transformation rule are used for the transformation to the Rindler spacetime. The Casimir effect for a plate moving in the Rindler spacetime is studied in this paper.

This trap can be used with blue-detuned light and can be easily produced using a focused gaussian beam and a biaxial crystal. This technique has potential applications in the fields of optical tweezing for materials, fundamental tests of gravity, atom interferometry, atomtronics, and atom microscopy at ultra-cold temperatures. Keywords: Atoms, Optical Traps, Atom Trapping. Introduction: The field of ultracold atoms has attracted the attention of scientists worldwide in recent years. Indeed, this field continues to evolve and remains of great interest due to the possibilities offered by these quantum gases. These ultracold gases are a platform that enables the exploration of quantum mechanics in large assemblies of particles. In this context, the production and control of a stable trap for the neutral atoms of these gases is a prime objective. For a long time, the use of the magneto-optical trap (MOT) was the technique most often used for the production of these traps. However, recently, the interest has shifted to more complex optical traps whose stability and capabilities go beyond those of the MOT. Among these various traps, the toroidally dark focus or p", "the magnetic polarity of an erupting filament is opposite to that of an overlying arcade. the flux rope model of Martin (1998) assumes that a quiescent filament forms with a left-handed helicity. the flux rope model of Martin (1998) assumes that an erupting filament rotates counter-clockwise when observed from the positive-polarity side; however, in some cases, the observed rotation contradicts this assumption.

Then, in subsection [sect:exp], we give an overview over typical experimental techniques used for measuring hot GDR parameters, and in subsection [sect:smc], we describe different ways of how hot GDR parameters are extracted from such experiments by means of statistic-model calculations. Although we have not attempted to extract any GDR parameters from such calculations ourselves, we believe it is helpful for the reader to get a general impression of the experimental and data-analysis part of the compiled works.

It was shown that there are several muon-stimulated mechanisms of neutron production with significant contributions to the background. At the earth's surface and shallow depths, the dominant neutron production mode is negative muon capture. This process occurs. It has been demonstrated through several background measurements in underground laboratories.

If this is a correct interpretation, the Standard Model (SM) has to be extended to incorporate the small masses of the neutrinos suggested by data. There have been several ideas proposed in literature to generate small neutrino masses. The Zee Model is one of such attempts. In this model, all flavor neutrinos are massless at the tree level, and their small masses are induced radiatively through one-loop diagrams. For such a mass-generation mechanism to work, it is necessary to extend the Higgs sector of the SM to contain at least two weak-doublet fields and one weak-singlet charged scalar field. Although some studies have been done to examine the interaction of leptons and the Higgs bosons in the Zee Model, the scalar sector of the model remains unexplored in detail. In this paper, we study the Higgs sector of the Zee Model to clarify its impact on the Higgs search experiments, either at the CERN LEP-II experiments, the run-II of the Fermilab Tevatron, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), or future linear colliders (", "PROBLEM: In this research paper, a summary review of current models and observations of cosmic aerosols is provided.

The accuracy of the diameter results was limited by the high proportion of overlap objects, whose thermal emission characteristics were unchanged between surveys, and therefore served as calibration. In addition, there is a larger error and lesser precision in diameter estimates owing to the difference in detectability of the two sets of data. The overlap objects were utilized as measures of accuracy for the thermal model fits, showing that the results are reliable and consistent. The model used assumed a neatm thermal model, which was fitted using the diameter and albedo of the mbas. The observed fluxes were divided into reflected and emitted components to obtain accurate fits. Reflected component in the w4 band could also be used to constrain the diameter. The data were also analyzed for overlapping objects observed in both the 3-Band Cryo and Post-Cryo Survey. This provided a calibration for the model to obtain more accurate results in cases of overlap between multiple surveys. The thermal model fits provide information about the observed population of mbas, particularly the asteroids that may be", "Extra dimensional models with curved geometries, such as Randall-Sundrum Model, are discussed.

The production yields are measured through three different processes: identified particle production, semi-leptonic decay, and decay to hadronic decays. Several particle detectors are used to measure the yields. The production yields display hints of an energy evolution for strange particles compared to kaons and protons, whereas no energy evolution is observed for the semi-leptonic decay of light flavor particles. The strange particle yields are found to increase at higher center-of-mass energies within the systematic uncertainties.

Examples include dusty plasmas where the screening of the dust-dust interaction is mainly determined by ions or dense two-component plasmas where the ions are screened by weakly coupled electrons. These plasmas are expected to occur in the interior of giant planets and white dwarf stars. While in one case the degree of screening is determined by the ion debye length, the screening length in the other is the Thomas-Fermi length, owing to the degeneracy of the electrons. The Yukawa one-component plasma model is often used to describe the heavy plasma component while the light component determines the screening length. Its static properties and collective excitations have been studied in several publications. In many situations, the plasma is neither homogeneous nor macroscopic. Recently, it was shown that the plasma is inhomogeneous and that the density of a three-dimensional dusty plasma, where gravity is balanced by a thermophoretic force, is not homogeneous. The reason is the screened dust-dust interaction that produces an inhomogeneous density profile in a harmonic confinement. This is different from experiments with confined ions where the interaction is coulombic and", "(1) The recently discovered recurrence relations method (2) The new method for obtaining functional equations from recurrence relations and (3) The method that was proposed for deriving functional equations by eliminating complicated integrals from recurrence relations are discussed in the summary of this paper.

The results reported here show that the jet can propagate through the debris, but with significant angular and radial collimation, provided that a sizable amount of mass has been ejected in the merger by the NS companion. Furthermore, a large amount of mass can be ejected only if the eos of NS matter is relatively soft, leading to the collapse of the newly formed NS to a BH, and subsequent formation of a massive BH torus. After the BH-torus system forms, a jet propagates through the expanding merge matter on the pole, and eventually breaks out of the ejecta, propagating to the outside with significant collimation as the jet cuts a collimation opening in the material. These findings suggest a new paradigm for SGRB emission, particularly in the", "The text explains how the nuclear properties of zr and sn isotopes can be studied using the deformed RMF+BCS model with a zero-range potential in the pairing channel.

The use of equilibrium statistical mechanics to study such systems offers a robust statistical mechanical theory for time-independent systems that are nonergodic and consist of individual sample systems comprising ergodic domains.

They have explored the effects of soap film interactions to study the properties of foam, with a particular focus on topological rearrangements that can lead to the energy dissipation via topological rearrangements. The authors utilized a bubble generator to inject air into a background flow to observe and analyze the generation of extended parallel shear bands by the injection of air into the background flow. They conducted a geometric analysis and then successfully predicted the shear band height selection, as well as the ratio between film-glass drag and film-film drag. They found that the film-glass drag is the only drag to be directly studied in previous experiments. The authors also observed that the size of the shear band was chosen to minimize drag dissipation in the system. They observed that the ratio between film-glass drag and film-film drag obtained an estimate, which they hope will lead to further experimental and theoretical study.

The relationship between the activation energy for sliding a chain along a given path and the distance from the chain section to the surface is also discussed using the configuration counting and self-avoiding polygon problem.

Our algorithm is based on the stochastic gradient (SG) iterates, which perform computation over a graph of communication links. We show that the SG-based algorithm is optimal up to constant factors and provably achieves a fast convergence rate. The expected performance of our algorithm is optimal for any and all probability distributions, whereas existing bounds require the optimization problem to be sufficiently smooth or convex. Our performance analysis holds with probability one over the learning process, which means that the convergence results are generic and not restricted to specific scenarios. We illustrate the practical efficiency of our algorithm via experiments on various benchmark data sets and network topologies under different optimization settings for both centralized and distributed data.

We show that there is an additional relaxation rate to equilibrium which vanishes upon changing the coupling between the dot and the reservoir. This relaxation rate is independent of the coupling between the dot and the reservoir and relates to two-particle correlations. The additional decay times of the charge and occupation after the application of a voltage step pulse are shown to be related to this additional relaxation rate. Moreover, the decay after applying a superconducting gate pulse reveals the presence of a two-particle decay rate. In the analysis of these processes, we identify the decay of occupation as the characteristic element for the dynamics of the quantum dot with one single electronic level. ( b ) We analyze the relaxation dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a normal lead and spin-electrons. In the presence of a constant density of states and a low tunnel coupling, we show that the decay times of the occupation and spin are proportional to each other and related to a single relaxation rate.

The calculations of the ground state Mg-Mg scattering lengths are discussed in detail. The _mvb_ multiconfiguration valence bond method is used for this, and its results are compared with the currently available potentials such as RKR and IPA. The IPA potential seems to be better than RKR in reproducing the term values. The short range wall of IPA potential could not be smoothly connected to the repulsive wall of MVB potential, so an extrapolation of the IPA potential was made. The IPA short range wall is linear extrapolation from the attractive region. The IPA potential is free from the short range turnover inherent to the RKR inversion procedure, whose inner turning points were removed from the data set before extrapolation. Finally, the IPA scattering potential is successfully constructed and discussed in the paper.\n1.

The paper builds on the previous work of J. Juyumaya and S. Lambropoulou, where Markov traces for the homflypt polynomial on the affine hecke algebras were constructed. The focus of this paper is the generalisation of the constructed Markov traces, to the family of algebras @xmath4. The approach to link invariants via the isomorphism theorem is considered as a main tool, and the authors emphasise that a similar method of proof can be adopted here to that used in the construction of invariants from @xmath1. The end result is the identification of the Juyumaya Lambropoulou invariants from the @xmath4 algebra, together with the construction of new Markov traces for these algebras. The paper provides a proof of the cyclotomic quotients of @xmath4, for the isomorphism to a direct sum of matrix algebras with coefficients in tensor products", "This paper addresses the problem of bit-rate adaptation in an overloaded network.

The interface motion that accompanies the first-order phase transition from the undercooled a- into the b- phase is subject to extended experimental and theoretical investigation. Within the hydrodynamic regime, the structure of the interface dynamics can be rigorously determined by connecting the hydrodynamic modes on both sides of the interface with the appropriate connecting conditions (COCOS). COCOs have already been done for the planar interface; in the present work, the hydrodynamic description is generalized to interfaces of finite curvature, taking as an example spherical b-phase bubbles growing in a bath of undercooled a-phase.

In the early phases, the thick envelope dominates the emission from the YSO and hides what is going on within it. Eventually, the envelope flattens out to a circumstellar accretion disk. This disk still causes an infrared (IR) excess above the level of a stellar photosphere, but can be used to distinguish YSOs from main-sequence stars via IRAC (Infrared Array Camera) on Spitzer Space Telescope (IRAC). When the disk is cleared, the IR colors of the YSO match those of main-sequence stars. The dominant timescale in the optical is the stellar rotation period, which can be minutes, hours, or days, depending on the mass and rotation period. YSOs can vary on these shorter timescales due to radial pulsations or dust clouds covering the YSO. On years timescales YSOs can vary due to changing circumstellar extinction or massive accretion events. YSOs can vary on multiple timescales at once from different processes, such as cool spots, hot spots, absorption, and", "Explain what happened in the paper.

The authors examine the implications of this hypothesis for the particle characteristics by using a phenomenological equation of state. They demonstrate that the volume density profile can be derived from the column density profile using a simple assumption that the local kinetic energy of a classical particle is equal to its gravitational energy. This model can then be applied to a cluster of galaxies, A1689, and the authors demonstrate the possibility of fermionic degeneracy in its inner region. They show that a power-law profile obtained from subaru observations may be explained more successfully as a core that indicates some contradiction to the CDM cosmology. However, the authors point out that this is still a hypothesis and further data and analysis will need to support it.

Recent attempts to derive the basic parameters of the long-period comet population are discussed, including one carried out by Everhart who assumed the sample was complete. The demographics of small comets are discussed, including Everhart's model based on the assumption that their population is large. The author then describes how the recent availability of CCDS has changed the observational situation drastically and resulted in the Linear survey, a near-earth asteroid research project, becoming the most suitable for constraining the long-period comet population.

It is proposed that dust scattering plays an important role in producing the polarimetric light of SN 1987a. Dust particles are destroyed mainly by the intense initial UV flash of the supernova after the shock breakout. An initial UV flash with net energy @xmath46 is required to fit the observed light curves of the circumstellar loops. The minimum distance of dust particles from which they can survive the initial UV flash is given by equating the duration of the UV flash with the time of dust grain overheating. The location of the dust and the parameters governing dust scattering are described. It can be concluded that dust scattering is the main reason for the degree of polarisation observed by the polarimetry of SN 1987a. References: J.J. Barret - 1988 C&A 75, 95; D.V.

Through stochastic simulations, it was found that discreteness can induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic systems which may affect macroscopic chemical concentrations. A simple autocatalytic network with 7 chemicals and 8 reactions between the chemicals was assumed. With a fairly large number of molecules, the behavior of the system can be described with a Langevin equation, while with small numbers of molecules, the stochastic simulations were necessary. \nThe summary of the text is concise and captures the main points of the text while leaving out some details. It starts by highlighting the key concept of the text, which is the importance of molecular discreteness for certain biological systems that include only small number of molecules.

In this paper, researchers introduce two key components to RTI/RTI: Servo-Nodes and Quality Metric. Servo-Nodes consist of rotating RF sensors that can be deployed in random positions without prior knowledge of their orientation. The Quality Metric is a network-wide measurement that determines the optimal positional adjustment for each sensor. This adjustment allows each sensor to quickly calibrate itself to the optimal position, dramatically reducing the need for time-consuming manual adjustment. The paper goes on to demonstrate through three deployments that this optimization improves localization accuracy.

The scheme is tested on a harmonic trap with a two-mode spatial confinement, where the sprdm also acts as a quantifier of entanglement between the pairs of modes. Entanglement is detected through the loss of entanglement with increasing temperature and through the non-locality of single-particle correlations between the modes. Spatial entanglement can also be detected by measurements that manipulate the modes as in the bosonic beamsplitter experiment.\nIn quantum mechanics, entanglement is a phenomenon whereby two or more particles become intertwined in such a way that measuring the state of one particle provides information about the state of the other entangled particle, even when the particles are no longer in contact. However, in some cases, entanglement can be observed between two 'particles' that are, in fact, indistinguishable, and do not represent independent particles. In particular, bosonic gases are well described by second quantization, in which the particles can be modeled as modes of a wavefunction that has been restricted to live in a finite space", "The aim of the paper is to study quantum mechanics, specifically the quantum chemical theory and its application to the control of torsional motion of molecules. In the paper, the authors discuss the control of torsional motion of isolated molecules with a laser field. They first introduce the background information and literature review and present the theoretical modelling of laser control of torsional motion. The authors describe the quantum chemical theory and describe the quantum states, torsion, and the laser field. They explain the quantum states associated with the field and the laser - induced torsional potential that creates a time-dependent torsional motion. The authors explore the laser field's effect on the torsional motion, and the field's modification of the torsion potential's stationary quantum states. The authors utilize a moderately intense, linearly polarized NS laser pulse to control the torsional motion, and they calculate the expectation values and the grey and black curves of the torsion potential for a particular set of laser parameters. The authors discuss the effects of the laser - induced torsional potential on the laboratory frame and study the asymmetry of the potential between the two wells.

Random charge distributions are considered instead of classical charge equalization, which yields an entirely different scenario. The ion-distribution in the presence of charge imbalance is influenced by repulsions and attractions between mobile multivalent ions, leading to the creation of an attractive interaction between dielectric surfaces. The presence of random charge distributions on the surfaces results in the violation of the contact value theorem, and strong coupling between multivalent ions and dielectric surfaces.

The author then explains how the law opens alternative microscopic approach to the recently proposed lower bound on viscosity. The generalized second law of thermodynamics is unique law of physics that bridges thermodynamics and gravity. It is rooted in the understanding that a black hole with a well-defined entropy proportional to its surface area possesses such a feature. The authors claim that the principle is reminiscent of the ordinary second law of thermodynamics, but the gsl is exceptional in its formulation, as it relates ordinary entropy, a somewhat elusive object from the mechanical viewpoint, to the surface area of the black hole, whose evolution is completely mechanical in nature. In particular, it provides some information on entropy. The gsl provides a unique approach to the investigation of quantum gravity. At the microscopic level, the gsl represents a piece of the yet to be established theory of quantum gravity.

This is the first complete computation of such a result. We focus on a specific CS theory, \\text{CS}(N) \\times F_2, coupled to gauge group G = SU(N). The CS coupling constant is fixed to have one degree of freedom in the theory. For the sake of completeness, we also consider CS theories coupled to other finite gauge groups. The relevant operators are identified with 1D monopole states on a 2Sphere, with the Casimir energy being a constant times the area of the sphere. We compute this constant for the CS(1) theory in the Yang-Mills regulated CS limit. It is given by \\Delta/N^2. In a CS theory coupled to a massive matter sector, the lowest dimension disorder operator has mass given by. In the noninteracting limit, the scaling dimension of these disorder operators is given by.

In a quantum context, the treatment of the problem goes back to Darwin.

They offer an alternative approach to existing methods and introduce a novel model for the light quark in the presence of a heavy quark to compute the hadronic decay amplitudes. By using this new approach, the authors estimate the effective coupling of the quark to the pseudoscalar mesons and offer analytical results for the excitation spectrum of heavy mesons, partial rates, and the hadronic transitions. The potential the authors use to calculate the properties of heavy- meson systems is an interpolating formula for the chromoelectric potential of the heavy quark.

It is very difficult to implement exact sampling from within the simulation, but the local-patch algorithm may be able to do so for spin glasses. The local-patch algorithm was demonstrated to work for hard disks and improve on previous results. Exact sampling helps to ensure that a simulation has equilibrated and no longer reflects the initial conditions. The coupling from the past property eliminates the need to analyze the convergence properties of the markov chain during simulation. The discussion goes on to address the coupling properties of the markov chain for the simple 1D single particle lattice with periodic boundary conditions, a system whose stationary probability distribution is independent of the initial conditions. Overall, the discussion is an informative summary that explains key aspects of the markov chain method and its application to various situations.", "This paper studies high-frequency pressure waves localized in the envelopes of neutron stars. The analysis focuses on waves with higher frequencies than have been previously studied in this context. The paper shows that the neutron drip (neutronization) of the crust affects the oscillation spectrum. The gravitational radiation accompanying neutron star oscillations was also considered. The gravitational acceleration of the star is negligible in these calculations. Waves localized in a thin neutron star envelope are analyzed using the plane-parallel layer approximation. The pressure in the envelope is almost independent of temperature. Degenerate neutrons and electrons in the inner envelope provide the gravitational acceleration. The analysis uses a newtonian hydrodynamic equations. The zero-temperature eos for the equilibrium structure of the envelope and for perturbations is employed.

If the magnetic layer is sufficiently wide, skyrmions reach the driving layer before touching the edge of the wire. However, if the track is narrower, the skyrmion reaches the edge in a short time and changes its direction of motion. For transverse driving, skyrmions move faster towards the upper edge of the wire and, when they reach it, move along the edge towards the right-hand side. The driving force pushing the skyrmion towards the magnon source can be compensated by the edge barrier potential, resulting in an attractive and repulsive force acting on the skyrmion.\nThe paper discusses the motion of isolated magnetic skyrmions in magnetic nanowires driven by spin waves traveling in parallel to the nanowires or transverse to the wire. Through micromagnetic simulations, the authors studied the skyrmion trajectories and the relation between the driving current and the skyrmion velocity in the steady state. As the size of the nanowire increases, they obtain an attractive force between the skyrmion and the magnon source if the skyrmion is in the driving layer.

The key points of this explanation are that quakes are caused by long periods of stagnation punctuated by fast irreversible changes, and that thermal noise drives the dynamics of these rearrangements. The statistics of these events can be understood by analogy with standard poisson statistics, with the exception of a scaling exponent of the waiting time between occurrences that depends on the age of the trap. This exponent is the same as that for the number of quakes in a population evolving in a fitness landscape, and the two types of records (in quakes and in fitness landscapes) have the same statistics.\nCan you summarise in a few sentences the key points and predictions made in this text pertaining to the characteristics and dynamics of complex glassy systems?\nCertainly!

If the object is a gravastar, a different type of object with a different type of singularity can be formed. It is believed that the gravitational collapse of the star leads to the potential creation of a de Sitter core within the object which prevents it from acquiring a singularity. It is hoped that distinguishing characteristics will be found that can differentiate between a gravastar and a black hole. This paper develops a new model of a gravastar that includes anisotropic fluid spheres and shows how it can be constructed. The paper focuses on two solutions: the first solution, model 1, reproduces a sketch presented by previous workers, and the second solution, model 2, solves equations and is consistent with the axial perturbation stability criterion. This latter solution has an equation of state, and stability is calculated as the paper draws to a close. The paper also discusses the possibility of extensions to the anisotropic gravastar solutions. Further work will address the surface redshift, and calculations will be done relating to the stability of solutions. Comments and possible extensions conclude the paper.

There are different models proposed to describe such an assumption, and both have conflicting problems. A successful description is an open, infinite, and bound universe with a similar density from a very large to very small scales. Two proposals are described in this article: the single bubble scenario and the many-bubbles scenario. These models have pre-requisites that need to be fulfilled to work. If realized, the resulting model would have a huge (or infinite) universe of local observations inside bubbles nucleated from a false vacuum state. Overall, this model has the essential feature of driving both inflation and the phase transition through two different scalar fields. The scalar fields drive the inflation and first-order phase transition dynamics. The lagrangian density and the scalar field potentials are described, and the dynamical equation is elaborated. The choice of quartic for one scalar field and a mass term for the other is proposed for satisfying conditions that enforce super-horizon-sized bubbles.

Recent simulations of active region formation have started from a coherent semi-torus of magnetic field placed in the surface layers of a model solar convection zone. Our simulations show that such a coherent structure is not necessary for the formation of an active region. The action of magneto-convection produces rising flux tubes, which when they reach the surface generate active regions. We use the Stagger code to simulate magneto-convection in a domain 48 mm wide by 20 mm deep. This depth is 10% of the geometric depth of the solar convection zone, but contains two-thirds of its pressure scale heights. Horizontal directions are periodic and the vertical boundaries are open with plasma and magnetic field moving through them.

A Newtonian limit of this method was given in @xcite, and an infinite-mass limit was given in @xcite ; in this paper, the authors generalize the method to apply it to arbitrary thin disks.

These problems involve data that cannot be fully processed in a single memory space, and therefore the algorithm allows for the storage and processing of chunks of data at a time. An advantage of the algorithm is that it can be applied to other problems outside of machine learning through certain structural properties. The focus of the text is on developing an algorithm that is applicable in a wider range of problems while also ensuring optimality through the algorithm's structure.", "text is from a Poisson distribution, which describes the noise of a single level system. \nThis paper tackles the issue of creating entanglement in a quantum dot. Specifically, it discusses how entangled electron states can be created by electron tunneling onto the double dot. The relation between zero-frequency current noise, excited level coulomb correlations, and entanglement are discussed and an adaptation of the noise spectroscopy scheme is made. The Fano factor is used to analyze data and identify interaction parameters. This allows for a direct determination of the interaction parameter that describes the competition between kinetic-energy gain and coulomb repulsion. A sequential-tunneling approximation is used to describe transport through the double dot and master equation, obtaining the noise features to be studied. Overall, this paper provides insights into quantum dots, entanglement, and noise spectroscopy, which will be beneficial for related research.", "For their data on cgd around galaxies, we have a correlation function power law profile that fits the far-IR radiation map of the same galaxy cluster. We also have their statistical correlation analysis that suggests the dust could come from within the cluster. However, this interpretation can be tricky. Far infrared radiation is a proxy for dust temperature, which could come from inside and outside of the galaxies. We propose combining the spatial stacking of far infrared radiation and the measurement of the dust extinction reddening by the SEDS Survey to constrain the nature of the dust. If the dust is from the same distribution as the dust extinction reddening, then it would constrain the temperature of the dust. This could show whether the dust in the cluster around the galaxies is the same as the dust extinction reddening. Our hypothesis is that the two are different. We demonstrate our analysis on the SDSS DR7 photometric galaxies. We propose and use spatial stacking of far infrared photometric data on the SDSS DR7 photometric galaxies. We compare this to the dust extinction map of SFD. We also do a stacking analysis on the dust extinction map using a PSF similar to the PSF of SFD. We combine the correlation analysis and spatial stacking measurement as a function", "The author writes an academic text summarizing an abstract and a paper by Becker et al. on the ionizing intensity during the period of reionization. The text summarizes that the observations indicate a decrease in the ionizing intensity during reionization, and that simulations can be used based on such observations to estimate the redshift of reionization. The author continues by stating that the simulation results can be used in conjunction with further observations and understanding of the reionization process to constrain the cosmological model. Additionally, because of data from observations, changes to the simulations can be made to better fit the observed data, and simulations of larger box sizes may differ from the one depicted in the paper. A table of numerical parameters from three simulations with the Slh code is also given.", "I can summarize the text of the above research paper on the topic of electromagnetic gauge invariance by the following: The paper describes the study and analysis of the electromagnetic gauge invariance of certain processes in deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), a QED process. The authors consider the spin-dependent process, where one of the hadrons is a transversely polarized nucleon. The paper analyses the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor and related it to the gluonic pole contributions. The authors demonstrate that the transverse polarised dy hadron tensor requires electromagnetic gauge invariance and the gluonic pole contributors. They also show that the new additional contribution to the gluonic pole is directly related to complex prescription in the quark-gluon function. Finally, the paper shows the contribution to the hadron tensor that is related to the single spin (left-right) asymmetry measured in the DVCS process with a transversely polarized nucleon. The authors perform their calculations within a _collinear_ factorization. They analyse the diagram of the DVCS process with a transversely polarized target for the required electromagnetic gauge invariance, transverse polarisation vector of the nucleon, and gluonic pole contributions.", "The authors in the text create a triple junction ( tj ) with controlled gbs misorientations and study the diffusion along it.

Hyperspherical coordinates are a set of coordinates that describe the volume of a sphere, which is a generalization of the Cartesian coordinate system. The hyperspherical coordinate set consists of three coordinates that describe a point in a sphere. The hyperspherical coordinates are used to construct the many-body equations of motion, which are solved numerically. The resulting wave function is expanded in hyperspherical harmonics that describe the wave function of a nucleus. The wave function can then be constructed in radial functions. The radial functions are subject to the Schrodinger equation with the appropriate radial potential and the interaction matrix element of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. These features of the hyperspherical coordinate system make it an effective tool for describing nuclei..", "a round-trip test of light speed isotropy is reviewed. The traditional Michelson-Morley, laser/maser, and satellite experiments on light speed anisotropy are summarized. These experiments have shown a null effect. It is noted that the big bang cosmology describes an absolute beginning of the universe and that absolute time can be estimated. The effects of an absolute space-time assumption include violations of the symmetry-energy and symmetry-momentum conservation laws, which are relevant only on a cosmological scale. The one-way light path laser diffraction experiment is shown to detect light Doppler shifts due to motion of the laser beam relative to the earth frame. The ether gauge theory scenario is described and results are presented. The length of moving rods undergoes the Lorentz factor and the time of moving clocks undergoes the Lorentz factor. The egt scenario satisfies the cosmological time boundary condition and leads to a non-isotropic one-way light propagation relative to the earth frame with a preferred direction.

It discusses the technological options being pursued in the linear collider project, including silicon or scintillator for a sampling ecal, scintillator or gaseous chambers for the FE or w hcal, and gaseous hadronic calorimeters. The text focuses on how microroc technology can be utilized in the Hcal and other detector segments for the linear collider project. \n\nWhat additional features would be required to implement the microroc technology effectively for the Linear Collider project, and why would they be necessary?\nThe technology requirements for microroc need to be improved to meet the detector requirements for a linear collider. One of the most significant requirements is the need to scale up the number of channels to the required magnitude of thousands of channels. Additionally, the technology needs to be made more robust and stable to handle the harsh operating conditions of a linear collider detector. This includes increased radiation and mechanical forces that can have a significant impact on the performance of the detectors. Moreover, the technology also needs to have a higher tolerance for noise and drift so that the sensors can accurately measure the properties of the collider particles.", "This text discusses strangeness contributions to low-energy manifestations of the virtual or sea quark effects. The strangeness contributions and electromagnetic form factors of a proton under isospin symmetry breaking are discussed. It is necessary to understand the form factors using chiral perturbation theory. This theory is well-suited for the analysis of isospin violation and the effects of electromagnetic forces, and gives insight into the strangeness contributions. Overall, the study of strangeness provides information about the inner quark structure and the properties of elementary particles. It is possible to estimate the effects of isospin breaking on the charge symmetry violating form factors. It is concluded that the effects of isospin breaking remain at the percent level, and the strangeness contributions are significant.", "The author summarizes the text by stating that to get reliable continuum results from lattice studies, it is essential to explore a range of @xmath3 values. It is also valuable to employ a fermionic discretization that has minimal discretization errors. They present preliminary results for the quarked improved clover action and compare their light hadron results at @xmath3 with the conventional SW CLover approach. They find no statistically significant evidence of improvement at that value of @xmath3. They use non-local sources to allow a more accurate extraction of ground state masses and couplings, combining the results at all three @xmath3 values. They find that dimensionless ratios of observables have small discretization corrections. They highlight the uncertainties remaining in extracting continuum decay constants because of the reliance on perturbative matching coefficients. The SW fermion action is given by a set of equations that can be used to express any observable, including those that are on-shell. At tree-level, the term of order @xmath11 is set equal to one.

The study aims to select the sample of dark matter halos from the Millennium II simulation that host subhalos which are most like the 15 satellites of M31. The criteria are such that the selected halos have virial masses between 3 x 10^11 and 5 x 10^12, have baryonic and dark matter masses between 3 x 10^10 and 3 x 10^12, and have neighbors whose baryonic masses are less than 1.5 x 10^12. The analysis and results of the paper revolve around this sample, and the results of the study are similar to those of the previous one. The difference is in the criterion of having companions within 8kpc whose mass exceeds a quarter of their own. Also, the new study includes only halos in the plane of M31. The procedure involves selecting a random viewing point in the simulation and choosing satellites in the selected halos up to the maximum allowed. These subhalos are then subjected to an orientation analysis and those whose pole is within 1.1 degrees of the plane of M31's satellites are included in the study", "", "this text discusses the existence of a glass transition in finite - dimensional, short - range interaction systems in van der waals theory. It also presents a new model that is proposed for a glass transition in finite dimensions, and discusses experiments and simulations to support this model.", "In this paper, three types of superlattice oscillations are introduced based on negative differential velocity properties. First, superlattice bloch oscillations are observed in the miniband regime, which occur due to the acceleration of carriers beyond the Brillouin zone boundary. Second, transient charge accumulations generating oscillations can occur in the miniband regime. Lastly, resonant tunneling between higher subbands can produce additional oscillations if multiple tunneling resonances exist. These newly discovered oscillations were observed in lightly and moderately doped superlattices under different field regimes. Additionally, these oscillations have been theoretically studied. Specifically, resonant tunneling into higher subbands is suggested to be a tunable source for high frequencies for superlattice oscillators based on resonant tunneling into higher subbands.", "In this text, the authors describe the characterization of the noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes with photoactive molecules, specifically porphyrins. They demonstrate that the binding strength and optical properties of these compounds as a function of the carbon nanotube structure are not dependent on the tube's chirality, and that the strength of the tpp @xmath4-stacking interaction remains the same on metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes, regardless of diameter. The authors' experimental results show that the diameter is the relevant nanotube parameter in explaining the unusual strength of the tpp binding interaction with a metal rather than a semiconducting nanotube. The study also finds a strong binding energy on graphene, which cannot be explained by previously suggested mechanisms of bonding between porphyrin molecules and graphene that involved chemical functionalization. This study represents a significant step toward improving our understanding of the interaction between photoactive molecules and carbon nanotubes, and may contribute to the development of optoelectronic applications based upon carbon nanotubes functionalized with porphyrin-like molecules.", "This text summarizes the research on gpds in cqm, where a simple formalism is proposed to calculate the quark contribution to gpds from any non-relativistic model. As an illustration, results for the gpd @xmath5 are obtained in the NR model of isgur and karl @xcite, evolved from @xmath6 to dis scales, to NLO accuracy.

They assume single-antenna nodes for the source, relay, and destination, but assume multiple antennas for power-limited and relay nodes. They derive a tight upper bound on the system's bep for both uncoded and coded transmissions from which they show that using a v-blast detection technique, a full-order diversity of two can be achieved in a two-user MARC. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of 2 for any numbers of users and only one relay node, in contrast to traditional methods where each user must have two antennas for transmission.", "A summary of this report by the author of the text summarizes the text regarding sgrs and presents an analysis of its content.

When observing the pulsar wind nebula, it was found that it emits energy in different ranges of wavelengths, including radio, optical, and x-ray bands. Some recent observations also suggest that it may have experienced flares of high-energy electrons at variable intervals. This letter describes a statistical approach to study the variation of the pulsar wind nebula emissions in terms of the highest energy electrons. It is proposed that the highest energy electrons contribute to these flares mainly because they are less statistically likely to occur, making the sources of these electrons the main cause of variability. This variability is considered to be the reason behind the crab nebula observing the light curves of the VHE (very high-energy) \u03b3-ray emissions. Finally, a physically possible model is introduced to demonstrate the effect of the highest energy electrons on the variability of the pulsar wind nebula emissions.", "This is an excerpt from a longer article.

This possibility remains controversial, and scientists are still trying to determine what RX J1856 is by examining various models and pieces of evidence such as spectra and x-ray observations.

Experimental investigations have been performed using different techniques such as tori pendulum, atomic force microscope, and microelectromechanical systems. The modern precision experiments have been performed using different geometrical configurations and materials, although calculation of the force with a precision comparable to the experimental accuracy is a real challenge to the theory. The material dependence is an important factor to consider in calculating the Casimir force per unit surface. The two plates in the gap have electromagnetic field fluctuations in the gap, with characteristic imaginary frequencies that play a dominant role in the Casimir force. Comparison between optical data and high frequency data for the characteristic frequencies shows that the high frequency data exceeds the characteristic frequency by several orders of magnitude, making it sufficient for the calculation of the Casimir force. However, in the low frequency domain, optical data exists only for frequencies which are one order of magnitude below the characteristic frequency, making the Casimir force calculation difficult. The text mentions different procedures to get the Drude parameters, such as estimating values from solid state physics or from optical data at the lowest frequencies.

The paper examines polarization squeezing that is generated by an ensemble of x-like 4-level atoms illuminated by a linearly polarized field.

The text proposes that external heating must come from an unknown agent, operating at light speed, which also accounts for the UV heating that is not correlated with the x-ray emission. The idea that this heating might come from an external source, outside of the observable region, has implications for the 'ghost in the machine' of AGN, and the unknown processes underpinning the disk-jet connections.

To support this theory, observations and data analysis results of the Nessie Nebula, which is identified as a dark extinction feature in the glimpse and mipsgal surveys, are presented. This irdc is known to have a filamentary shape, and is observed to contain many embedded young stars and protostars. Analysis of the data reveals that the observations broadly conform to the expectations of the \u201csphereical cow\u201d instability theory, and that a gravity-bound gas cylinder model may be important in the formation of high-mass stars and star clusters in filamentary irdcs.

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: A convolutional arithmetic circuit is a deep neural network that computes the convolution of matrices. Its analysis is given as a tensor calculation.

This analysis is used to infer the inductive bias of the deep network.\n\nThis is an example summary provided by a machine learning AI, but it seems incomplete as it does not mention the conclusion of the paper or any practical implications of the findings. The paper analyzes the inductive bias of deep networks using the concept of separability, which measures how far a function is from being separable. The paper finds that the pooling geometry of deep networks controls the modeled correlation and the induction of the function. The inductive bias is then shown to provide exponentially high separation ranks to certain input partitions.

However, the number of possible transmit vectors in these systems also increases exponentially, making it impractical to use exhaustive search methods and requiring new detection techniques. In particular, non-linear detectors such as vertical Bell Labs layered space-time architecture (V-Blast) have been widely used due to their superior performance compared to linear detection techniques. However, they require additional time and space complexity. Alternatively, linear detection techniques such as zero forcing detectors (ZF)) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detectors that exploit the full spatial multiplexing benefits offer significant practical advances over linear detection techniques. However, in comparison to V-Blast, their performance still lags significantly. To enhance linear detection techniques without the need for an additional space complexity, multi-branch Sic (MB-Sic) or ordered Sic (OSic) have been proposed. MB-Sic separates each detection layer based on their order which results in a larger number of detection diversity, whereas OSic selects different branches by error propagation (from early stage to latter stage) which generates a single decision.", "@xcite has combined then published data sets of sdbs in order to show the distinction between an upper and lower helium sequence. @xcite showed a strong isotopic shift in the atmosphere of at least three sdbs as well as a similar isotopic shift in 15 more stars. out of these 46 sdbs at least six more sdbs show the @xmath0he anomaly in a distinct way. hence out of the 46 sdbs studied 26 _ 40 of our programme stars fulfill one of the three main criteria for this anomaly. @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xspace [ 30 mm", "It seems that the paper deals with the quantum nature of the learning process from various quantum sources of information using quantum oracle calls.

This paper introduces a new nanoscale architecture with fractal-like pattern named sierpinski carpet as the metallo-dielectric platform that can trap light at different angles and frequencies. The presented metallo-dielectric super absorber is capable of absorbing light in the visible spectrum (@math3-@math4 nm) with a simulated average absorption more than @math5%. Based on finite integration technique (FIT), this paper theoretically investigates the effect of propagative and localized plasmons, as well as localized magnetic and electric dipole resonances, on enhancing the efficiency of proposed light trapping structure. The numerical results are also demonstrated as well as sensitivity of the absorption response to design parameters. In addition to obtaining the optimum width of metal nanocuboids, the best design parameters are chosen to be practicable and in subwavelength scale. Finally, it is found that applying silver nanowire arrays with the proposed dielectric layer is an effective way to enhance the absorption. This study is expected to pave the way for developing widebands absorbers, sensors, and thermal emitters and lead to new concepts in photon management.\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce a new nanoscale architecture named sierpinski carpet as", "The author's summary of the text is: The author proposes a new quantization method for the most general class of cosmological models known as the @xmath0=1 model.

In public goods games, where the players contribute to a common pool, there are two typical strategies: defection, where players do not contribute, and cooperation, where players contribute. However, the evolution of cooperation in such games is challenging, as players who defect can obtain a higher fitness than those who cooperate. To overcome this obstacle, it is essential to introduce other strategies, such as rewarding or punishing players for their actions. This paper investigates heterogeneous public goods games in different interaction networks to find out how they affect the evolution of cooperation. The results show that moderate heterogeneities promote cooperation better than strongly heterogeneous states, which is not in accordance with previous results for games governed by pairwise interactions.", "The original English of the text was an article in an academic journal or conference proceedings. The text is summarised as it relates to the emission of infrared radiation from grains in interstellar medium and its characteristics such as wavelengths, origin and properties of carriers. It is written in third\u2013person and technical style, with many mentions of names and research findings by previous researchers. The text refers to molecules and chemicals in relation to their identification and properties and their use in research and scientific studies.\nTo summarize the text above, the mid infrared emission bands found in the interstellar medium are ubiquitous and are produced by the coincidence of the bands with the characteristic wavelengths of aromatic molecules and attached functional groups. The identity of the carriers of the aibs is still unclear and is the subject of much debate. The origin of the aromatic infrared bands is still being researched and is subject to many theories. Recent laboratory experiments shed light on the process, with the UV irradiation of solid hydrogenated amorphous carbon showing the release of carbon clusters containing more than 30 carbon atoms. The release of similar carriers in interstellar shocks could be related to a possible transformation of carbonaceous grains.

They mention previous work on M31 and discuss the early assembly and evolution, as well as early mergers, the halo, previous satellites, and globular clusters. There is support for a classical metal-poor halo, and evidence suggests that M31 accreted a number of satellites early on. The properties of the galactic halo and globular clusters are similar, and the chemical composition of globular clusters suggests that a comparatively large nitrogen abundance may have been present during their formation. The pressure-supported bulge likely originated from a combination of pressure and merger activity. The central few arcsec of the galaxy is dominated by old stars that formed during a uniform star-forming episode. The structural, kinematic and chemical properties of the bulge in M31 suggest it to have been affected by secular processes, and that globular clusters may have played an important role in enriching the early ISM of M31. The strength of CN absorption bands at visible wavelengths in the integrated spectrum of the inner bulge of M31 is reminiscent of those in M31 globular clusters, suggesting a chemical kinship.

The fractal space - time leads to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics where two basic theories interact. The first is the strongly covariant general relativity, which incorporates the notion of scale. The second is a modification of quantum covariance introduced by the theory of scale relativity. The resulting theory is scale relativity, which incorporates quantum mechanics and the principles of strong covariance and scale covariance. Through the introduction of a \"spin\" operator, scale relativity predicts both the free Klein-Gordon and free Dirac equations for non-relativistic and non-interacting particles, respectively. The application of quantum covariance gives a modified Klein-Gordon equation for charged particles in external fields (incorporating spin), and a modified Dirac equation for spinors in external fields.

The author discusses whether or not the magnetic mass should play a role in this dampening. The paper examines the infrared limit of processes with a soft real photon. The author states that the insertion of a gluon in the hard quark loop with two fermions in the loop introduces singularities that are power like in 2-loop diagrams. The author argues that the addition of the transverse gluon in the quark loop leads to an infinite contribution. The author explains that the resummation of thermal mass in the hard limit leads to an infrared problem, but it seems to be of the same order of magnitude as the additional gluon. It is worth noting that the author discusses the possibility of compensation to overcome the potential infrared problem.

In this situation, the vacuum magnetic (6) symmetry of the gauge field is gauged, the gauge coupling being inversely proportional to the mass of the lightest dynamical quark. The effective Lagrangian is constructed to include quarks in the vacuum. The mass of the lightest dynamically allowed quark is infinite in this case. The conservation of the (6) symmetry is demonstrated, the commutator of (6) with Yang-Mills Hamiltonian being proportional to zero. This is in sharp contrast to the conserved charge, a local charge density, which has a non-zero current, as well as a bulk term in addition to the surface term. These results are valid in the vacuum limit. The bag constant is shown to appear naturally for the lightest dynamically allowed quark. It is concluded that in the presence of fundamental charges, the magnetic (6) symmetry is gauged.
