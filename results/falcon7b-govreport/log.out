(See figures 1, 3, and 4.) Table 1 is based on the analysis of IRS\u2019s cybersecurity risks and is presented independently. As part of IRS\u2019s comprehensive risk management strategy, data security is assessed on an annual basis. In the report to Congress on 7/13/20, IRS disclosed the annual assessment of data security risks. The following security vulnerabilities were identified, according to the report:\n\u2022 Anomaly detection \u2013 The IRS has to detect unusual events that could be indicative of potential malware and other incidents.\n\u2022 Patch management \u2013 Software updates, patches, and patches can be deployed in minutes. They are used for Windows workstations, servers, and databases.\n\u2022 Configuration management \u2013 The IRS needs to use a tool to configure their IT infrastructure. This allows the IRS to maintain the same configurations and ensure that they were consistent with the new system and software release.\n\u2022 Access control \u2013 Employees have the ability to access multiple databases and systems outside the scope of their work. They may try to access unauthorized data or systems by modifying their password.\n\u2022 System security monitoring \u2013 Security tools are needed to monitor systems and networks for threats such as system crashes due to the failure of a device or application on a workstation or server, as well as the detection of fraudulent activity.\n\u2022 System security assessment process \u2013 IRS has implemented a risk-based assessment that is tailored to the scope of the systems and software applications the IRS has.\nIn the report to Congress on 7/13/20, IRS noted that their assessment involved analyzing information security vulnerabilities, such as those that were seen in a malicious attack or an accidental release of confidential information. With respect to security, DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity Center of Innovation (CyCoI) Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISAA) 5, along with the security measures found in IRS\u2019s security risk management strategy report, is part of the process to establish a new security assessment and evaluation process. A new, automated assessment process has been incorporated into the reporting process to better manage this security and IT management process. The assessment process will involve IRS using software for analysis. The results will be reported to IRS in accordance with the report to Congress on 7/13/20. The IRS has implemented a risk-based assessment that is tailored to the scope of the systems and software applications the IRS has. Table 1 presents the Security, IT and data risks associated with the risk based assessment. Table 2 includes the security tools that IRS may use to perform these assessments. Table 3 displays the annual security assessments that were required to be conducted for IRS. Table 4 is an example of a vulnerability that was detected during IRS\u2019 annual risk based assessment. The IRS recommends that taxpayers periodically check their account access data to verify that it is current and accurate. IRS has found it is not uncommon for taxpayers to think they have security control access on their accounts and are subsequently surprised by IRS\u2019s findings. IRS is aware that the technology and resources it uses to keep its systems and software programs free from malware and other malicious attempts may become outdated. Due to this and other reasons, IRS recommends that all taxpayers use a third-party security software and/or service provider to further enhance their defense against cyber threats. Table 5 shows some of the products that IRS recommends for its taxpayers to use.\nThe table to Table 8 includes the type of computer security risk that IRS found in 20 percent of more than 20,000 information and data security assessments conducted in 5, 5(b)(1) and 5(b)(2)(1) of the National Security Act to ensure that IRS\u2019s systems and information assets continued to be protected from potential security threats. In 5(b)(2)(3), IRS recommended that taxpayers who store IRS-protected electronic data files in \u201conline\u201d storage services keep records of access by the data storage and service company for a period of one year. The IRS is aware that this is an area of concern for taxpayers and is working with a number of data storage companies to ensure their compliance with IRS requirements. Table 6 provides a list of the current online storage and service companies that provide services to IRS. The IRS requires that taxpayers have access to their data and data stored in a private or government cloud server based on a need to share. Table 7 provides an overall list of 30 cloud storage service providers, with IRS data information as provided in their 5(b)(2)(3) and OMB A-130 data storage specifications. TABLE 10.6(1) (e) (5) (f) (9)", "The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and regulations allow CCDF lead agencies to administer CCDF funds to a state that has a centralized child-care regulatory authority that performs a certain number of functions under state law for children with financial needs. In this context, a child care provider, which is a service provided to children and families by a private or public nonprofit entity, may be eligible for CCDBG funding. One such child care provider serving 6 months-5 years and who, therefore, serves at least 1,000 children annually, is required to report on the number of children, monthly fees, and other information related to the children in order by OCC to oversee this CCDF program. 1. According to the National Council on State Taxation 5/2016 report, child care costs the taxpayer $7 billion and 75 million dollars in 2015 2. According to the National Urban League, 6-12-year old children represent 4.3 percent of all child care in their respective zip codes 3. The CCDF currently includes $9,345.6 million per fiscal year for fiscal years 2018 through 2021. The money is used to provide access to child care services and other services that might be considered necessary to assist children. 4. As mandated in the CFAD Act, to support the goal of decreasing poverty, the CCDF has also focused on increasing the availability of child care resources. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), a federal-funded meal assistance program, ensures that every child served in a child care center may get a healthy, well-balanced meal daily. Children also get access to health care, early care and education, and child care information. In FY 2017, over 9 million children received free or reduced-price meals through CACFP 5. The Child Care Financial Stability Act of 2012 requires that states, territories, or possessions set up a Child Care Subsidy Program. The CCDF financial contribution for child care subsidies is based on the $9.45 billion per year in grant dollars given to states and is based on the poverty level of eligible families. 6. The CCDF/Waiver programs have a significant amount of overlap, with many children qualifying for both programs. 1. The CCDF/Waiver programs are administered by a lead agency based in each state. The lead agency is responsible for the initial assessment of each family, application for benefits, and case management services. 2. The Child, Health, Education (WIC) and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Act provides a nutrition program that is used to help reduce the occurrence of poor nutrition among children or to help increase the number of children served, in general, so that the overall number of children in need (the poverty level) is reduced. 3. The Child Care Financial Contribution (CCCF) Act established in 2016, required each U.S. state to be responsible for providing and overseeing their own CCDF. 4. The Family First Safety Net (FFFSN) provides funding for all health care, tax benefits, and social services. Child care is offered through various programs, including Medicaid, and each state has differing regulations regarding child care. 7. The Child Care Financial Subsidy Program was established in Fiscal year 2014 (H.R. 3) to require states to implement child care financial assistance, or \u201csubsidies\u201d. The program is based on the poverty level of the household, ranging from 19 percent for the poorest families to the federal poverty level. This program has allowed low-income children to access child care, and it continues to be a crucial piece of the state\u2019s welfare reform programs that are focused on supporting poor children and their caregivers. 1. According to the National Council on State Taxation, child care costs the taxpayer $7 billion and 75 million dollars per year, 2. According to the National Urban League, 6-12-year old children represent 4.3 percent of all child care in their respective zip codes 3. The CCDF currently includes $9,345,650,000 per fiscal year per fiscal year (2018-2021). The money is used to provide access to child care services and other services that might be considered necessary to assist children. 8. The CCDF provides federal funds to state child care offices, and these offices, in turn, provide direct services to child care recipients. The CCDF also provides state administrative funding for the CCDF to carry out certain functions as child care subsidies and direct services. The state has a role in the determination of funding levels and distribution on direct funding, which is based on the state\u2019s population in which an allocation of a minimum (6%) and a maximum (40%) of 100 percent of the Federal amount", "OMB is required to develop guidelines to: develop a program and project management performance measurement system for programs and projects; establish a new job series; and establish classification standards for positions.

Veterans are eligible based on certain rules, such as service-connected conditions. VBA sets policy and regulates eligibility processes. When a veteran is assigned to VA healthcare through a community care provider, the VHA pays the VA healthcare provider. VA Medical Centers are VA hospitals, and are commonly referred to as \u2018\u2018Veterans\u2019 Hospitals\u2019\u2019. Nonpublic/Private sector health care is paid for at 100% of normal fees \u2018VA\u2019 or \u2018Military\u2019 depending on which is involved in the event: VA fees are paid through the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 (VHA EFT); Nonpublic/Private sector health care is covered through a person\u2019s income tax bracket and not at a government rate. VA\u2019s Office of the Medical Director works with the Military Department of Veterans Affairs in the VA Office of General Counsel. VA operates two main areas of Veterans Affairs: Medical; Veterans Benefits Division; and the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Management System (see figure below). Other areas of government: 1. Veterans\u2019 Benefits Division VHA\u2019s Office of the Medical Director of the Veterans Department of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel Veterans Benefits Division Medical Benefits Administration (VA) Veterans Affairs Office (VA) Medical Benefits Administration (VA) In this text, the author discusses topics related to disability compensation. The author mentions that disability compensation is for veterans of the Gulf War, and that VA compensates veterans for disability, not employment or social status. The author also discusses the process for reevaluation and the priority system developed by VA to identify which vets will be granted the highest level of priority for medically-related disability compensation. The author also highlights that VA spends about 5 billion dollars a year on disability compensation. The figure below details the number of disability compensation claims filed each year. Since 2008, VHA has received over 900,000 disability compensation claims. VA reports that the total dollar amount spent on disability compensation benefits during fiscal year 2019 was approximately $50 billion, and, as a result of COVID-19, the total dollar amount spent on disability compensation was approximately $50 billion. The author notes that VA has experienced significant increases in disability claims over the last decade. According to VA, more than 45 percent of disability compensation claims are for veterans considered to be ineligible for employment, so the government has to pay for their disability services. There are 5 different categories of disability compensation. 1. 100 percent of disability for service-connected injuries. 2. 50 percent for service-connected injuries and certain injuries of veterans\u2019 spinal cord injuries. 3. 10 percent of service-connected injuries and injuries of veterans. 4. 100 percent of service-connected injuries - Vets with disabilities. 5. 100 percent of income earned at the 60-percent rate of retirement pay. Vets with disabilities may be eligible for disability compensation based upon the symptoms of some conditions that could contribute to long-term injury. Vets with disabilities may be eligible for disability compensation based on the physical disability caused by the injury. The author suggests that many veterans\u2019 disabilities are not treated as medical conditions. In this text, the author refers to Vets Compensated for Injuries (VetsCI -see page 3). VA is the only one who pays disability income, although certain VA disability benefits are a form of income replacement. Although VBA does not have a specific process to revalidate a veteran\u2019s veteran disability rating, VBA may conduct a reevaluation of the veteran if the veteran reports a change in their condition or symptoms. According to this text, most of the money spent by VA on disability benefits is for veterans with service-connected disabilities, with disability-related illnesses accounting for about half of disability claims within the group of veterans-related disability compensation claims. When veterans\u2019 disability rating of 100 percent is granted for service-connected injuries, the government may be liable for some of the financial burden associated with the injury. For example, certain veterans reported, for example in relation to injury-caused pain in their back, VA compensated them for years of additional medical care and rehabilitation. In 2006, the VA announced that, as of 2015, those veterans in need of continuing medical care may have their costs covered by Medicare. In March 2019, VA announced that its costs for providing medical care will be $400 million per year, down from 2018, and will be paid out by Medicare. In this report, the author discusses a veteran\u2019s disability rating to 100 percent, and what occurs when they are denied disability compensation. After receiving compensation for at least 10 years, certain veterans may receive an additional benefit, which is a monthly income for the rest of their lives for a disability rating of 20% of compensation under the old SSI regulations. The author refers that the current rating for disability of a veteran is", "Foreign students interested in studying in the United States must first be admitted to an SEVP-certified school or university before applying for a nonimmigrant visa at a USCIS embassy or consulate overseas to authorize travel to the United States.

That number has grown rapidly from its inception. In today's reality it is near impossible to keep track of all incoming threats, let alone respond to them in the amount of time that is necessary while running their operation and keeping their infrastructure in place and operational. This increase in cyber threats was a main motivation in the NCCIC's reestablishment of our cyber-security / cybersecurity function group into it's own command element. This command element, in turn, will expand with additional resources from our own military cyber units, the Army's Cyber Command and the Marine Corps' Information Security Division/Detachment 22, to create the cyber-mission element to ensure the security of this critical infrastructure. It has become very obvious that in order to effectively handle the threats from cybercriminal, terrorism and cyber warfare threats are not just to be in place at the Pentagon level, but needs to be expanded into specific military units that are actually executing military missions.

Tindal-Okey (\u201cTindal-Okey\u201d who died October 28, 2002 \u201cTindal-Okey\u201d during the course of his investigation). OIG interviewed all of the Air Marshals and Air Marshals are members of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Air Marshal Program. The OIG also interviewed the Air Marshals\u2019 supervisor, David W. Baker, who is an executive assistant in DHS\u2019s Federal Air Marshal Program Management Office. In addition, OIG interviewed 11 Air Marshals who had been involved with Tindal-Okey\u2019s investigation. OIG interviews were used to determine the feasibility of Tindal-Okey\u2019s investigation. Although DHS had previously provided the OIG with limited access to the details of Tindal-Okey\u2019s investigation, a significant number of DHS Air Marshals\u2019 refused DHS\u2019s request for interviews. These responses are a significant portion of DHS\u2019s investigation and cannot be included in the summary report as DHS must have the right to conduct an investigation on an individual\u2019s privacy rights. As DHS has not fully completed its investigation into Tindal-Okey, OIG considered it prudent to include the information that DHS reported to OIG in its report. However, DHS has not completed its report into Tindal-Okey\u2019s investigation into the Air Marshals. Thus, OIG included its investigation into Air Marshals\u2019 practices and procedures. With little more detail, DHS has been given three years in which to report the investigation\u2019s finding(s) to DHS for action. Tindal-Okey had received his security clearance on June 3, 2000. DHS\u2019s Federal Air Marshal Program was established because TSA was concerned with the lack of background checks individuals undergoing the application process. DHS believed that the investigation would disclose the truthfulness of all application materials required as part of an investigation. Tindal-Okey\u2019s background profile for DHS was made available for its Air Marshals in DHS\u2019s Air Marshals Database System. This database consisted of information on individuals applying for the program. Tindal-Okey received DHS\u2019s Federal Air Marshal Program in August of the year before his death. In addition to the investigation, the OIG also considered the results of the 1990 National Aviation Services Corporation Annual Audit. The OIG also interviewed the audit\u2019s author, David H. R. MacVean, who was a member of the National Aviation Services Corporation Advisory Board. He also performed the audit as well as served in DHS\u2019s office of Inspector General for two years. David W. Baker has been performing Air Marshal investigations since 1993 and during the study period, Tindal-Okey and Air Marshals did not suffer any physical damages due to his investigations. The OIG also interviewed Air Marshals that served with Tindal-Okey during his investigation. They were located approximately 3,000 miles from Tindal-Okey\u2019s office, but they received the same degree of oversight by DHS\u2019 Inspector General as did Tindal-Okey. Tindal-Okey had been a member of DHS\u2019 Federal Air Marshal Program for his entire Air Marshal career and DHS had received a number of very similar background profiles on Tindal-Okey. There appeared no significant difference in the application process between Tindal-Okey and other Air Marshals examined for the Study. The OIG noted that an incident was not common. On Tindal-Okey\u2019s death, DHS received a letter of investigation from DHS\u2019 Inspector General. To meet DHS\u2019 1999 year-long investigation of Tindal-Okey, DHS conducted an investigation of Air Marshals for one year following the year of the Tindal-Okey\u2019s death. Because of the OIG results, DHS implemented a new background investigation policy for DHS, but DHS had not completed DHS\u2019s investigation into Tindal-Okey. DHS also conducted several audits into DHS\u2019 Air Marshal Program with the OIG as a watchdog on DHS.

According to DOL, their estimates increased because of higher black lung medical cost inflation. Between 2016 and 2018. a total of 17 self-insured coal mine operators were deemed by DOL to be in financial distress. DOL officials stated that about $17.4 million in estimated black lung benefit liability will be transferred to the Trust Fund in the near future. The exact amount of the benefit liability depends on two specific factors--whether the payment can be made sooner and whether it can be collected in the future. *This post contains an error.

U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office and the Foreign Office jointly designate entities that engage in or contribute significantly to narcotics trafficking. Treasury is required to report on the personnel and resources that are dedicated to Kingpin Act sanctions each fiscal year. Kingpin Act designations are the result of an ongoing partnership between Treasury, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Foreign Office, and its other intelligence and law enforcement partner agencies. Treasury can designate up to 15,000 entities under the Kingpin Act, including: 1. individuals or entities that provide services to foreign nations to conceal the money in foreign assets, 2. individuals who knowingly provide assistance to foreign nationals to enable them to launder foreign assets (including an associated entity), 3. U.S. individuals or entities with property or interest therein within their possession or control, and 4. entities whose designations are subject to change for a period of two years. Treasury\u2019s approach differs from countries with more centralized financial systems. In most cases, Treasury uses a three-pronged process involving banks, entities, and individuals to carry out sanctions against bad actors. Under the kingpin provisions, Treasury\u2019s OFAC assigns designations to entities and individuals for three categories (Tier I, II, III). Treasury sanctions a person or entity once it has verified that he or she has been sanctioned one or more times under the Kingpin Act. The 1,000 people Treasury identifies under the Kingpin Act are usually people who launder drug assets, launder foreign assets, launder foreign currency, or set up shell companies. Treasury sanctions a 1,500-person designee list every calendar year under the Kingpin Act. Treasury designates designees and their property or interest to be blocked with the appropriate OFAC licenses. Treasury sanctions Kingpin Act designees up to 20 years of imprisonment per designee or entity, which is an increase from 10 years in the original Kingpin Act passed in 1999. The law authorizes Treasury to block assets, prevent individuals or entities from conducting transactions via bank or wire, require the sale of assets or property, or require individuals or entities to disclose information related to the Kingpin Act and to others who are a Kingpin Act designee. Each designee list that Treasury issues also includes information about individuals and companies the designee has control over to help Treasury enforce sanctions in the designee countries. According to officials from OFAC and Treasury's Office of Enforcement and Compliance, the Kingpin Act designations are essential to Treasury's approach to modern financial crimes, financial intelligence, and information sharing. The Kingpin Act designations are used as a tool in Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets and Trade Control (OFAC) to coordinate sanctions, the Financial Action Network, and the International Criminal Justice Organization. Treasury says the Kingpin Act sanctions \"tremendous\" financial gains, enabling crime syndicates not only to launder but to conduct other illicit activities around the globe. Treasury's OFAC says Kingpin Act sanctions are essential to Treasury's Financial Intelligence (\u201cFI\u201d), countering-terrorism, and cyber-crime efforts. Treasury's Office of International Trade and Financial Enforcement (OITF) reports the Treasury received 1,400 Kingpin Act designees list each fiscal year. In September 2007 Treasury expanded and updated the Kingpin Act to include new designees and procedures. The Treasury has a list of the designee countries. The process for designation and verification is also included in Treasury's 2009 Kingpin Act Designee List. The original Kingpin Act was passed in 1999 at the urging of the United States House of Representative, which had received reports from Treasury on the importance of sanctions. The Act also includes criminal penalties of up to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $5 million. These designees must be designated each calendar year by Treasury\u2019s Office of International Trade and Financial Enforcement (OITF) following an independent review process. The process for designations under the Kingpin Act follows an OFAC-led multilateral initiative involving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Working Group on Financial Action (WG). WG members include the United States and the following countries: European Union, Australia, Japan, the Swiss Federation, France, Germany, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the Northern Mariana Islands in the USA and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Working Group on Financial Action is the United States\u2019 principal law enforcement body responsible for developing the global Financial Action and Counter Terrorism Finance (FACTF).

Agencies are also to explain the legal basis for retainng employees, the manner in which operations will proceed, and how shutdown operations are to be managed. Agencies\u2019 contingency plans for ITA and CBP were prepared using a similar process. EOP\u2019s lack of content on the key information elements can be attributed to its being prepared at a higher level. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans in anticipation of a lapse in appropriations and to use key information elements to assess the selected agencies' plans. Agencies' contingency plans for ITA and CBP were also designed. EOP lacks information on each of these components. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans and the legal basis for retaining employees in a shutdown of operations. Agencies' contingency plans are not formally approved by OMB but OMB officials say agencies review plans. ITA had its own contingency plan, provided a description of operations during a shutdown. IRS did not have a standardized plan, but IRS officials said the component would use an existing contingency plan for EITA. IRS also confirmed that a shutdown plan is in place for IRS. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans in anticipation of a lapse in appropriations. Agencies' contingency plans for ITA, CBP, USTR, IRS and EOP are also designed. Agencies' plans that are based on a standardized approach did not address all of the key information elements or key elements that were needed for assessing the component's readiness for the shutdown. Exempt and excepted employees are exempted from a shutdown of operations because they are covered by the Anti-Lackluster Performance Accountability system, OMB Circular A-11. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to prepare contingency plans for the lapse in appropriations, and it lists the information elements needed for agencies to continue their operations. Agencies that are exempt from the application of OMB Circular A-11 are required to comply with the Anti-lackluster Performance Accountability system. Agencies generally address a majority of the key information elements in OBMS circular A-11, but these are not critical to agencies\u2019 readiness for the shutdown. Agencies\u2019 contingency plans are designed to provide information on which components in the agencies can help manage the shutdown, which elements are critical to agencies\u2019 readiness, and provide information on agencies\u2019 readiness. Agencies\u2019 plans that are based on a standardized approach that does not address all of the key information elements or key elements for assessing the component's readiness for the shutdown are not able to meet all the agencies\u2019 requirements and need for their continuing operations for the rest of fiscal year. Agencies with certain characteristics also may be at risk for having their continued operations jeopardized by a lapse in appropriations of less than a year. In December 2018, GAO identified certain characteristics that may put agencies in at-risk circumstances, including a lapse in appropriations that has lasted fewer than 30 days. These agencies tend to operate under a variety of legal mandates and are subject to federal, state and local laws, which may affect the ability of the agencies to continue operations during a lapse in appropriations. OMB Circular A-11 directs the development of contingency plans for agencies that may sustain their essential functions during a lapse in appropriations. The legal basis for agencies' continued operations during a lapse in funding is to be governed by a combination of legal, Federal Management, Executive Order, and other authority. OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans on how to cope with a lapse in financial aid. Agencies with characteristics indicating they may face problems have a greater risk of finding themselves in a shutdown situation. Agencies must address the legal, functional, and information requirements that make up a proper contingency plan. If agencies fail to develop and implement a properly designed contingency plan, it will not be able to protect their operations. Agencies are also required to comply with certain information requirements under OMB Circular A-11 for designing the management structure of the contingency plans. Agencies must keep in mind that a lapse in appropriations and lack of a contingency plan does not excuse agencies from having to continue operations until appropriations are passed. Agencies must also plan for a shutdown by reviewing available resources they possess and identifying areas of unmet and underutilized potential. Exempt and excepted employees are exempted from a shutdown of operations because agencies are required to apply the Anti-lackluster Performance Accountability system. Agencies have up to a few days to submit their annual financial report (October 1, for fiscal year (FY) 2019). OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to develop contingency plans and that contingency planning is a requirement of federal law. Agencies must develop a contingency plan on how to protect their essential functions, such as payroll and critical data, services, and contracts. Agencies must also plan for a lapse in funding, even for less than a few days, to ensure their ability to continue operations without interruption.", "The prescription drug supply chain in the US consists of manufacturer, manufacturer, and the federal government.

Key obstacles are fragmentation within the biodefense enterprise and tackling them requires a long-term, comprehensive biodefense approach. In this paper, we first discuss the importance of national resilience in managing biological risks and the nation\u2019s need to move from reactive to proactive to develop the necessary skills, tools, and capabilities to meet these challenges. Specifically, we address the importance of implementing appropriate information sharing protocols, enhancing information security to protect sensitive information, and developing a culture of risk communication across all levels of government and all levels of the workforce so that \u201cthe entire enterprise\u201d is engaged in all aspects of biodefense operations. Finally, we focus on a few key recommendations that will help achieve these goals: 1. Strengthen the nation\u2019s resilience: Implement a National Biodefense Readiness Program to build sustainable capabilities for each level of government agency and the private sector and workforce, while providing tools and guidance to implement risk mitigation measures. 2. Improve interagency and international collaboration: Establish a comprehensive, strategic information-sharing platform with appropriate security measures that can be used across all levels of government and the private sector. 3. Expand partnerships with the states: Strengthen the nation\u2019s capacity to use emerging tools and methods in biodefense activities at the state and local level. 4. Strengthen the public health component: Create a national infrastructure to receive and quickly disseminate critical health information, including public health alerts or real-time threat information, to the public and healthcare personnel to protect the public. Implementing these recommendations will strengthen national resilience and help protect against an array of biological threats that threaten America and its homeland security, public health concerns, and other critical functions in the homeland. The US should maintain an extensive program of biodefense activities and initiatives to protect critical US systems and infrastructures, such as communications, power, and water resources, while also enhancing its ability to detect and respond to external and internal threats to the nation\u2019s homeland security. It is especially important to continue to build and maintain a core capacity for managing biological threats in the US, where science and technology play essential roles, at the local level, but also that these activities are coordinated and standardized and integrated with local and regional capabilities. An overarching biological threat program is a critical aspect to achieving resilience across the government and civilian population. To this end, federal support can be provided at a critical level to help maintain continuity and operations at a critical biological-manufacturing, -testing, and -treatment site located on federal property (e.g., a former US Air Force base). These sites should be maintained and/or modified to expand their capabilities and to integrate with the existing US medical system to provide clinical care for patients who may be exposed to biological threats or the products they create. The Nation should also maintain core laboratory capabilities to support biomedical developments and testing, but also be prepared to implement advanced medical surveillance tools (Biosurveillance Program) to detect and respond to outbreaks at a federal level. Finally, the Federal Government should continue its role in supporting science programs in biological threats in order to meet the nation\u2019s urgent needs. These programs can be used to enable new biological threat testing capabilities, for developing vaccines and therapies, and for establishing the scientific and medical research required to support future biological threats prevention. The Nation must maintain adequate security measures that facilitate information sharing across federal agencies that can be used to develop and respond to an ever-changing and potentially unpredictable threat landscape. While the Nation also must work across international networks to develop capabilities with partners from other countries or organizations, its homeland security capabilities may not be sufficient or robust enough to meet these demands, and may require significant additional resources and efforts. To ensure the nation\u2019s ability to defend against biological threats, and to stay ahead of the threat curve, federal government and industry should work together for the purposes of increasing the nation\u2019s domestic bioterrorism R&D capacity. The US Government should maintain and develop a strong network of \u201cstalled-development biogenerics\u201d (e.g., smallpox) that are currently available or that have been abandoned but are in the way of developing therapeutic agents. This program should develop more reliable methods to detect and manufacture these drugs that can be adapted to the biologic threat situation (e.g., biosurveillance, clinical endpoints, and vaccine development). In addition to existing technologies, federal funds may also be required; these may be provided through a program that is separate from the National Biodefense Readiness Program, but which is intended to be complementary to that program. In summary, these recommendations address key challenges to national security and public health agencies and are designed to encourage and motivate government, industry, and society to move forward in these uncertain times, while also preserving the US government\u2019s unique and critical role in meeting the Nation\u2019s needs.

There is a wealth of information on how to identify and address child trauma, including a range of treatments. Many child welfare agencies are finding innovative ways to meet these needs, including by implementing trauma-informing practices into their work. The experiences and effects of adopting these practices can vary. While the long-term effects of child trauma can include a wider range of services beyond child welfare, such strategies should be integrated into any case plan for children in the child welfare system, particularly if the child is placed in a home where they will be exposed to trauma. Treatment of children affected by trauma- may include trauma-informed caseworkers, therapist, or mental health provider. While the benefits of traumatized children at the individual level are often far-reaching, social benefits of reduced children in the foster home system, such individuals often contribute to school district-level, or even city-wide, financial, resources. The aim of this paper is to provide a guide for child welfare and health agencies, including community-based organizations, to better serve trauma-informed children. It is meant to be read by practitioners and administrators that work within the child welfare system, health care, or other related disciplines. A key objective of this study was to synthesize the existing literature on trauma informed child welfare to provide information on the key interventions and strategies in the field. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods approach that included key informant interviews with a range of stakeholders, including child welfare agencies, a range of mental health professionals, and other key experts on child trauma. Following from our literature review, we specifically evaluated the key components, strategies and interventions that are used to address child trauma by experts in the field. This included examining information on trauma-informed child welfare practices, as well as interviews with experts in trauma to inform on how these practices are used in the field. For detailed results on this research we provided a list of publications on the topic at the end. The study was conducted using qualitative methods that included the use of key informant interviews, as well as a literature review review. We also included a review of current literature, as well as interviews with current child welfare supervisors in New Hampshire to assess current practices in the state. A number of these interviews were in-depth qualitative interviews with informants who are a range of stakeholders. Some informants were child welfare staff, child therapists, parent members of a child welfare organization, foster parents, and adoptive parents, while others participated as a member of key work groups on the New England Child Trauma Center. For the latter informants, trauma assessments or interviews were performed within the framework set up under the child welfare system. Results of our interview analyses and literature review were compared over time and a key theme of intersectionality was used to draw a number of conclusions. The study includes a discussion of what trauma-informed child welfare looks like as it exists in New Hampshire and how it might be used with children in the child welfare system. Our goal was to inform child welfare agencies and staff in New Hampshire of what it looks like at intersection between trauma and child welfare. There has been a lot of discussion in the news about trauma-informed child welfare in New Hampshire recently, so a number of our discussions included on this topic have also occurred in the state. New Hampshire is the only state that has a trauma-informed child welfare child welfare policy. The literature review included child psychology text and child abuse protocols. Our literature reviews identified a number of useful interventions, treatment approaches, and best practices and treatments in the child trauma field, including how trauma-informed assessments are conducted by key players. In our own research, we are relying on trauma-informed interventions and how we can find the necessary resources, including behavioral health-related providers and a Child Case Coordinator who have the necessary clinical competence to diagnose and treat children in their program. Child Case Coordinators working under a Trauma-Informed Care Protocol are critical to identifying a child\u2019 and their family\u2019s needs, as well as helping with treatment. This means that the child is referred to mental health service providers to assist with treatment. The literature included information from interviews with child welfare officials that are using the best practices approach in order to find the child the right resources. It would be helpful for this child to have a clinical assessment (such as a clinical psychologist or child psychologist). This assessment will often be used after initial screening by public providers to create a plan or treatment options for them. We were able to find examples of the positive impact of implementing trauma-informed practices, including therapeutic and therapeutic-type work, by interviewing key informants working in the child service system in Manchester, New Hampshire. One of the first things that people in this field were thinking about, to provide to the families or children in this field, is the positive treatment outcomes that occur among children. Trauma-informed treatments are inextricably related to both positive and specific treatment outcomes for children. For example, in order for children to receive the appropriate positive treatment outcomes", "This text concludes that agencies can effectively use a period of probation for individuals before removing them from employment.

Small businesses tend not to file their own tax returns to receive any form of EXIM financing, as they typically do not have taxable income, but larger businesses are sometimes in a position to file for this tax-free financing. The number of U.S. manufacturing firms has declined in recent years from 5,000 to 4,000. In response, EXIM assists US manufacturers in competing for export orders and in financing their business growth. In 2018, 23,000 U.S. businesses used EXIM to access financial support for exporting to more than 100 countries in over 135 markets. To help reduce export costs, EXIM offers financing under its Export Working Capital Program, which provides financing for U.S. manufacturers to enter the global marketplace. EXIM also provides financing for overseas expansion, helping U.S. businesses reduce expenses, capitalize on new opportunities, and gain competitive position. EXIM\u2019s Export Insurance and Export Product Bond programs can help businesses access valuable foreign sales markets. EXIM\u2019s products and services include financing and insurance products, trade and business financing, credit and counterbalance services, and information products. According to EXIM, most of the EXIM Bank\u2019s lending activity focuses on trade credit facilities and insurance, which account for about 99 percent of EXIM\u2019s portfolio. EXIM\u2019s commercial lines of business, available to eligible firms, underwrite insurance limits the amount and frequency of the financial risk the firms face resulting from the occurrence of a large claim. Commercial lines of business include the following: surety; business and commercial fleet liability; commercial liability; commercial property; commercial property; commercial property and casualty; commercial property and casualty combined; small general liability; small general liability and combined; and small liability and commercial property, auto, liability, and property combined. EXIM provides the following types of commercial financing to eligible firms: fixed-rate commercial mortgages (underwritten by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae\u2019s Single-Family Mortgage Programs) and commercial revolving loans backed by commercial insurance policies from the private market. By providing financing to its customer base, EXIM assists exporters and their business to take part of global market opportunities by providing flexible and reliable financial support when needed. EXIM\u2019s loans, insurance, and bonds can have terms generally up to 25 years. These lending and financial services are not available to individual personal borrowers. A. In its effort to help U.S. businesses pursue international Sales that are due to be paid in U.S. dollars (\"dollars\") of exporters and the International Trade Advisory Service and the Exporting Assistance Division. EXIM works with exporters on U.S. exporters/firms, there has been a decline in U.S. exports since 2010. EXIM works with U.S. exporters and firms to overcome challenges that may affect their ability to provide their export goods or services under U.S. dollar financing. EXIM can provide assistance to exporters/firms in foreign market segments through financial assistance, insurance and insurance-backed reinsurance to help with a U.S. dollar financing transaction, and in this regard can be referred to as trade finance. In its effort to provide trade assistance, EXIM works with the Eximbank to provide trade-related financing and insurance for exporters/firms, with additional efforts in the Eximbank program called the 'Exporter Bank Guarantee Program. EXIM has provided assistance to over 2,000 U.S. exporting companies and companies with business assets in China to gain access to $60.3 billion in international financing. EXIM provides financial assistance to small businesses in emerging financial industry sectors, including small business service suppliers and professional education services. EXIM offers financial assistance loans and insurance options for small businesses and micro businesses to access reliable credit for business expansion and growth. EXIM can finance capital goods (e.g., vehicles, machinery, and equipment) and commercial property (e.g., rental properties). EXIM can finance the purchase and construction of commercial buildings and leasing of commercial space and office equipment for businesses. EXIM also can address capital expenditure, providing financing for major renovations, upgrades, and renovations on commercial property. In response to economic challenges that can affect businesses\u2019 ability to repay their loans, EXIM can offer payment deferral. If a business that borrows money with a lender defaults, the lender may be able to repay EXIM for part of the debt. EXIM can also offer a borrower the following benefits: EXIM's Guarantee to its lending customers, including small businesses, can significantly reduce the risk", "A small, minority-owned business that does all things well (so they don't fail) is the #1 Small Business in the United States.

The firms developed spacecraft, with phase one focusing on design to mitigate hazards. NASA hoped to certify in 2024, but the uncertainty of schedule and testing delays has led to the current schedule for 2025-30 for crewed spaceflights. The uncrewed test flight concluded in March 2019. Crewed test flights to the ISS are currently scheduled for January 2024.", "Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms, collection of the ship repair industrial base, often including contractors outside the home port who competed under fixed-price, delivery order contracts with indefinite delivery or fixed duration contracts. The Navy manages and administers MAC-MO under the authority of NAVAIR, which served as the Navy's MAC-MO/MSMO Task Force. Since the MRSA system includes a MAC-MO element, each MRSA MAC/MO process was subject to Navy MAC/LO process. The Navy MAC/LO process is responsible for the Navy's MAC, including the MAC-SOI (Source of Information), MAC/SOI, MAC/LSP, MACO (Making Progress), MCMAC, MAC/TPA, and MAC/MOR (MAC/Major Orders). MAC/MAC/MORS also includes MAC/KEMT; MAC/MORS; NAVASU's MAFSO; MAFSOs; and, CMCP's MRO. The results of the current study showed that the Navy is managing MAC/MO in accordance with the guidance of the US Navy and has achieved significant improvements in overall contract execution, including reductions in duration and associated costs. Overall, the Navy is proceeding toward the goals for better management of the MRSA system's MAC/MO processes. Specifically, the Navy has improved the methods used for MAC/MO, including MAC/SOI, MAC/BSS, MCAD, MAC/LSP (the Navy is implementing MAC/LST), OLS, and MACP. The Navy has continued to progress in MAC/SOI, MAC/LSP, MAC/LOSP and OLS. MAC/LSP and NASSO's MAFSO continued to demonstrate improvement, but further improvement is necessary for adequate MAC/NOSSO integration. In MAC/KEMT, the Navy continues to improve both internal and external processes for MAC/SOI. In NAVASU and MAFSO, the Navy continues to work toward MAC/KEMT, but further improvement work is necessary. In MAC/LSO, MAC/LOSP is continually improving the overall process. In MAC/MAFSO, the Navy is continuing its efforts toward the MAC/MAFSO requirements, but further improvement is required. In MAC/GRSCO/SOC, MAC/GRSCO/SOC improved overall processes, including OASIS, MAC/GRSCO, MAC/GSA, and MAC/ASU. The Navy is continuing its MAC/APL process. MAC/HOSI continued its improvement. MAC/KEMT and MAC/MDT, however, are continuing to work toward MAC/KEMT. In MAC/KEMT, the Navy is having difficulty resolving issues from contract award to contract closeout, which has slowed progress. Overall performance improvements in MAC/KEMT and MAC/MAFSO occurred when the Navy's focus was on MAC/LOSP performance. This has resulted in improvements in MAC/LOSP and MAC/MAFSO performance in areas such as MAC/LOSP and MAC/MAFSO processes, which improved MAC/MORS and MAFSO execution. Under MAC/APM the Navy saw marked improvement in the MAC/MORS MAC/KOT and MAC/KEMT processes, and MAC/MAFSO also improved MAC/MAFSO and MAC/MOR processes. MAC/MERM decreased in MAC/MDT, MAC/SOI, and MAC/LOSP. These improvements in MAC/LOSP and MAC/MTD can be attributed in part to improvements in MAC/KEMT, MAC/SOI, and MAC/BSS. The Navy's MAC/KEMT process improvements in MAC/KEMT and MAC/MOR are largely attributable to success from both MAC/KEMT and MAC/GRSCO/SOC. Under MAC/MAFSO, processes have been improving. However, efforts in the areas MAC/GRSCO/SOC, MAC/GSA/ASU, and MAC/LOP have been slower due to specific issues encountered as a result. MAC/LAP also improved. MAC/LOSP remains limited. MAC/NOSSO is still improving in performance. MAC/LRSF remains stable. Overall, improved MAC/KEMT and MAC/MOR performance across all processes, MAC/GRSCO/SOC, MAC/GSA, MAC/ASU, MAC/LOP, and MAC/NOSSO were improvements the Navy identified as particularly favorable results since FY 12, as a group. The Navy is continuing efforts to perform all MAC/KEMT, MAC/GRSCO/SOC, and, MAC/GGAB - based process requirements using automation. MAC/G", "VA's human capital challenges persist, including hiring challenges, workforce shortages, and challenges in filling administrative, clinical, and technology positions. The current structure of VA's recruitment system leaves too many veteran positions empty. Agency policies address veteran's access to timely health care and disability benefits reforms, but additional workforce development activities are needed to ensure current and future VA workforce's access to timely, quality care. These problems are compounded by inadequate retention efforts. Actions for success: In June 2014, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki instructed in policy letter to the workforce executive vice chair to review the human capital strategy and develop a vision statement. An update of the Veterans Health Care Strategic Plan was also required. In August 2018 VA leadership implemented the National Call to Action on Ending Homelessness plan by requiring certain programs to conduct performance and case management plans with goals and objectives. The agency must also provide information about its workforce, including demographics, distribution, and salary levels. - OPM and VA In February 2018, OPM and VA implemented a centralized recruiting system. VA launched the new system in September 2018, and as of October 2018 the system was fully integrated. As of July 2019, OPM officials told VA that a new workforce planning system will be required, as current information technology plans are outdated. The system was previously planned to be a single source of the agency's human capital information and will be integrated with its future IT systems. OPM also stated that VA should provide more comprehensive workforce plans and that they will continue to monitor, in part, the agency's human capital reporting system. VA has developed a draft human capital strategy since OPM guidance in 2016. OPM's December 2018 human capital system of record report identified challenges with the current inventory of VA's human capital systems, including data quality, duplication, and high-risk activities. - OPM & VA Leadership practices The current leadership structure at VA should be aligned with strategic human resource management goals. To be aligned with strategic goals, the workforce management process needs to address strategic human capital management challenges as identified. The current structure of internal recruiting requires more coordination across programs to ensure veterans are considered for vacancies in clinical, administrative, and technology positions. OPM's guidance identified additional VA challenges: VHA challenges include retaining current employees and filling vacant positions, and in FY2016, employees leaving the agency more frequently than those staying. OPM also noted concerns and VA issues with recruitment, staffing, and employee retention. In April 2017, leaders stated that they were not making human capital investments in recruitment, and hiring challenges at the office of clinical human resources. Furthermore, VA leaders noted in September 2018 that the central recruitment system was only able to recruit certain types of clinical positions. Actions for success: In October 2018, VA's leadership launched the Comprehensive Human Capital Review. This project is designed to improve the current process and provide recommendations for human capital and business operations support. VA's strategic workforce plan needs to be linked to the agency's strategic goals. As of July 2019, VA had not completed the process, and the workforce development task force was only half way. VA will use the findings from the Comprehensive Human Capital Review to develop the workforce development strategy. VA will use the Comprehensive Human Capital Review to develop a plan for staffing, recruitment, and retention of current employees, including the development of a comprehensive training strategy. VA's human resources practices need to align with its strategic human resource management goals, which have three main components: personnel strategies management, employee benefits management, and employee development. VA will use the Comprehensive Workforce Assessment to align its practices with these three strategic goals. VA will begin implementing the Comprehensive Workforce Assessment in FY 2019 or earlier with the results from the Comprehensive Human Capital Review. VA will use the results to inform the development of the Comprehensive Workforce Management System. VA needs to align its workforce management practices with strategic human resource management goals. VA needs to develop a comprehensive management plan to ensure staff recruitment, retention, and proper training opportunities. VA needs to enhance recruitment efforts in the following areas: the Office of Clinical Human Resources, human resources, and the office of information technology, including data analytics, modernization, information technology policy, and service delivery. VA can streamline recruitment, retention, and human capital initiatives by increasing the use of employee mobility, compensation, and benefits. VA should develop a management plan for recruitment, retention, and development. As of July 2019, VA has not completed development of workbooks. VA is developing guidance to help address these challenges. VA's recruitment website uses a third-party analytics tool, which allows VA to collect demographic and geographic data. VA plans to assess the tools in the near future in order to determine how effective the tools are in identifying and attracting candidates. VA plans to update its recruitment policy to align with the requirements of the Comprehensive Human Capital Management System. VA plans to develop standardized guidelines that will incorporate VA's policies and", "U.S. Army CSTC-A provides an extensive variety of educational training to multiple U.S. Army commands, including ANDSF.

The Strategy seeks to address challenges faced by Northern Triangle countries in areas such as prosperity, governance, and security. Key areas of assistance that have been provided include combating corruption, funding for government agencies, and support for small and medium-sized businesses. In addition, agencies have targeted specific poverty- related, criminal justice, and public sector management issues, among other areas. The Strategy aims to address challenges that affect the region, including poverty, human trafficking, drug trafficking, security, and natural resource degradation. Multiple agencies implement the Strategy from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018, with a 2017 high of $127.3 million given to the Northern Triangle region.\nOverview of the Strategy. Introduction. The Strategy has four main goals: (1) supporting prosperity by addressing challenges related to poverty, human trafficking, and drug trafficking. (2) addressing governance challenges by promoting accountability, transparency, and the rule of law. (3) supporting security by assisting law enforcement agencies and the military in carrying out their missions. (4) aiding the human dimension of migration and migration-related services. The Strategy also has seven related programs. The first area of the strategy, the Human Development (HD) Program, works with Northern Hemisphere countries to provide assistance to address fundamental humanitarian, health, and development needs. Another program is the Central American Regional Cooperation Program (CARE), which works with Caribbean countries and the Middle East to expand trade, promote the rule of law, and provide emergency assistance and resources. There are multiple categories of funding under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, including education, public sector management and development, crime and justice, human capital and capacity development, and drug abuse control. The Strategy also manages 13 Foreign Assistance Offices (FAOs).", "School-age children in the US should have access to reliable and wired connections to the internet that would enable them to complete homework.

MEDIQUEST, INC.", "The federal government can choose from a range of contract types to efficiently acquire a variety of goods and services, including goods that are unique in character, requiring high risk to develop, and technical goods that support military missions and projects. FAR subsections 13.04 (c) and 13.04(c) define \u201cfixed-price contract\u201d) are most frequently employed acquisition contract types for government acquisition of goods and/or services. In recent years the FAR has evolved its guidance on fixed-price contracts. DOD programs are now using fixed-price contracts where appropriate, as they can be an effective contract type (and an attractive option for the government) to ensure that costs remain stable or do not increase over time. The FAR has defined cost- type contracts as those requiring the contractor to incur costs to continue performing throughout all performance periods. FAR 13.5-3 addresses cost-type contracts. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 17 required DOD to establish a preference for fixed-price (faster contract) contracts where the dollar thresholds are below $25M. With respect to those fixed-price contracts, DOD issued a memorandum in June 2017 that required contracting officials to identify all applicable FAR subtopics and milestones, ensure they are included in all relevant contract documents, and require acquisition officials to review them during the fixed-price contract. The purpose of the FAR guidance is to give guidance to contracting officials regarding fixed-price contracts, particularly for determining whether a fixed-price model should be used. DOD also identified the following cost-type contracts. Our past review work, in May 2017, identified DOD\u2019s use of fixed-price contracts as a preferred contract type over cost-type contracts. As part of our work to date, we examined a small sample of cost-type contracts to understand some of the differences between the cost-type and fixed-price-type contracts, and to consider the future of cost-type contracts. For several years, DOD\u2019s Defense Innovation Technology (DITO) division has been tasked with determining the current level of risk for the acquisition of military-specific devices and technologies and how a greater use of fixed-price contracts could be beneficial in supporting DOD\u2019s needs. The objective of this report is to gather and examine information about DOD\u2019s current use of cost-type contracts, identify patterns within the cost-type contracts regarding their associated costs, and consider ways that fixed-price contracts can be utilized for DOD\u2019s current portfolio of MDAPs. MDAPs, as defined in FAR 27.104, are military systems or products developed for use solely by the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Defense Information Assurance Directorate (DIAD), and the Department of Defense (DOD). MDAPs are produced at a contractor\u2019s facility (the MDAP site) at DOD expense. MDAP contracts are awarded to contractors under the FAR to fulfill the Government\u2019s immediate needs for goods and services. FAR 13.005 sets out the acquisition process for DoD MDAP contractors. Some (DOD) specific (DOD) MDAP contractors\u2014for example, DoD Medical, Dental, and Veterinary Services Contracting (METS) Office, the Army/Navy Supply and Readiness Center (ARNSRC), and the Civil Works Contracting Office \u2014 perform certain of their own work (such as manufacturing engineering, product testing) in addition to their production and distribution responsibilities. They may act as manufacturing, contracting, and/or financial intermediary for MDAP contractors. MDAPs and products are procured using the Army Acquisition Regulation System (ARRES ) and related manuals. FAR 13.6 describes the procedures for MDAP management. The MDAP management plan includes processes for determining MDAP availability, requirements, and test criteria for new MDAPs. FAR 52.1 establishes procedures for evaluating economic performance of MDAPs. MDAP contractors may be required to share the MDAPs or portions thereof (which includes the MDAP design data) with suppliers, in which case the government\u2019s ability to exchange classified, proprietary, and/or other types of critical data may be degraded. FAR 28.304-4 has been used to help contractors develop the MDAP technical and supply support needs and design specifications that are critical to successfully constructing the MDAP. FAR 55.001, when applicable to MDAPs, determines how DOD monitors the MDAP in order to assess risks and determine that cost-type MDAPs are used when appropriate. FAR 13.2-6 requires contractors to define their roles and responsibilities within their MDAP. FAR 13.003, when applicable to MDAPs, requires that contractor employees be trained before production and delivery of goods and services are awarded contracts. FAR 13.006 requires contractors to determine who will be responsible for cost of (ind", "The defense acquisition system consists of a series of milestone decisions concerning the acquisition of weapon systems, ranging from Acquisition Category I to Acquisition Category II or III (depending on program). At each milestone, the value and type of acquisition program are classified, including the three major milestone decisions affecting program offices and program officers. The Army\u2019s acquisition system classifies major acquisition categories into Acquisition Category I (acquisitions of $75 million or more) and Acquisition Category II (acquisitions between $25 million and $75 million), with costs escalating on programs in this group. Likewise, in DOD\u2019s acquisition system, the thresholds for an Acquisition Category A program are DOD\u2019s programs with the highest funding and costs of around $75 million. In contrast,, DOD only has small funds to provide a management plan. By law, DOD is prevented from providing the type of funding needed to execute this part. Figure 1 illustrates the value and type of the acquisition system. Figure /", "Summary points on DATA Act implementation, including issues and challenges that were identified in the 2018 and 2019 prior reports, and an update on Treasury and OMB\u2019s efforts to establish data governance to promote data quality and maintain its integrity over time. 3 DATA Act Implementation Report - Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Report Fiscal Year 2018 was the 11th iteration of the Treasury Department\u2019s Integrated Government Payments (IGP) Report Program. IGP is designed to improve U.S. Treasury\u2019s ability to account for the nation\u2019s payment system while minimizing government paperwork. Treasury continues to use IGP data to improve payments-related functions and systems. Prior to the start of the IGP Report Program in 2002, Treasury processed some 10 million payments in fiscal year 2018. Treasury conducted 25% of the payments in fiscal year 2018. Treasury processed payments from 12% of individuals with bank accounts, the majority of whom have both a personal and business account. In fiscal year 2018, the number of payments processed by Treasury decreased by 17 percent to 6.6 million from the prior year. Treasury and the banking industry continue to improve consumer experiences related to payments, and Treasury and Treasury\u2019s partners continue to work with the financial industry to integrate payments systems to benefit the U.S. population. Since its launch in 2002, Treasury has continued to gather payments information through IGP. This is Treasury\u2019s most reliable source of information regarding U.S. payments transactions. Data from IGP Report Program is integrated into the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Payment Systems Portal Data Set, which is the primary source of information on financial payments systems for Treasury. There are 19,000 transactions processed in IGP Report Program each day of fiscal year 2018, which is 20 million transactions per year. For fiscal year 2018, each bank account is estimated to process about 16,000 transactions per year. Payments by individual accounts were 6 percent of payments in fiscal year 2018, up from 3 percent in fiscal year 2017. IGP has allowed Treasury to capture payments data in fiscal year 2012 and 2018, but it has not been implemented until fiscal year 2018. All data products in the Treasury Finance Report must be delivered electronically to IGP. The Treasury is also working with its partners\u2014including major banks and credit card companies, PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay\u2014to integrate payments and payments-related systems for ease of access for taxpayers, to eliminate redundant processes and costs while providing more efficient services, and to make access to payments data easier to obtain. Treasury and its partners continue to work together to improve the user experience in payments and to integrate payment infrastructure to benefit the U.S. population. In fiscal year 2018, Treasury\u2019s partners added approximately 1 million active personal accounts from the prior year, which is still consistent with prior trends. Treasury continues to improve the user experience and reduce redundancy costs by working with its partners to integrate payment systems while continuing to provide value-added services. Treasury was on track with IGP Report Program implementation in accordance with the original IGP framework, with the exception being the development of the new Payment User Authentication Technology (PUK-2) System. Treasury also launched the Payment User Authentication Network (PUAN) in fiscal year 2018 that enables users to connect their accounts to Treasury using an interface to their mobile device. This allows users to be authenticated in real-time while accessing Treasury applications. In fiscal year 2018, Treasury reported on 1,090, 1,093, and 1,100 payment transactions per day, which correspond to approximately 4, 8, and 10 percent of total payment transactions per day across the U.S. Treasury financial account system. Treasury and its partners continued to develop and improve the Payment User Authentication Technology (PUK-2) System, launching the test in fiscal year 2018 with Treasury partners and the Treasury-Navy Federal Credit Union. Treasury is developing a new payment system prototype that provides new payment features, such as real-time money transfer, online and mobile payment services, and data analytics. Treasury also is developing an improved business structure to enhance the payment ecosystem by providing enhanced services to its partners while also providing innovative solutions to Treasury\u2019s partners. In fiscal year 2018, Treasury initiated efforts to improve information technology for Treasury Pay, including enhanced support that Treasury offered the system to identify and resolve problems. Treasury continued to develop the Payment User Authentication (PUK) system in fiscal year 2018, using Treasury partners and financial institutions to test its user authentication infrastructure. Treasury and Treasury partners continued to build financial, network, and process services that can be extended to external clients. Treasury, its partners, and external customers have integrated the Treasury\u2019s enterprise business systems with data analytics tools that enable Treasury to provide greater user access, improve data management, and", "Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps EOD personnel are the most qualified to mitigate the risk to life and property in the event of an explosion/incident, even after an incident is underway. To achieve a common understanding of how EO risk can be mitigated in high-risk environments, such a discussion was necessary. During joint planning, risk must be mitigated to sustain combatant morale. In practice, military leaders must always consider the relative risk when determining EOD or combatant risks involved in their decisions and contingency plans. Military leaders must include discussion of risk in their interaction between the military and civil authorities. Commanders use their understanding of risk to consider the potential outcomes of different EOD scenarios. For example, DOD requires that, when determining the level of EOD forces required in the context of a combatant commander\u2019s request, the commander must consider the likely risk and hazards associated with performing \u201cunprecedented\u201d EOWs. Additionally, risk must be addressed in commanders\u2019 EOD plans (see fig. 3 for typical risk mitigation) for 4,000 EOD troops. Military leaders have made it clear that they consider themselves the stewards of the Force. Although EOD forces are assigned to multiple military services, the services and their commands share a common understanding of how EOs can be used to mitigate the risk involved in managing large quantities of explosives in support of combat. The military services\u2019 processes for determining EOD manpower levels are based largely on combat-related missions. However, EOD personnel can also provide the most qualified force to mitigate the risk to life and property associated with high-risk environments. COMMENTARY: To illustrate the military\u2019s EOD mission in modern combat, since DOD does not keep statistics on EOD forces and how they are used, military leaders have been asked to make comments on EOD forces that are used in support of combat. EOD Personnel: A Brief History EOD personnel are a group of highly skilled military and civilian employees who serve in DSCA and have the highest level of EOD expertise possible (see fig. 5 for the typical enlisted EOD crew). Currently, civilian employees are responsible for 89.3 percent of EOD personnel. The Army manages more than 4,000 EOD personnel across approximately 17 states. Most EOD personnel are assigned across multiple units within an Army Division. They serve their entire enlistment in EOD. Navy EOD personnel are an integral part of every US Navy ship. EOD personnel are also assigned in front-line combat units, where their expertise provides an invaluable support role to the Navy\u2019s combatant commanders. In addition to serving in combat units, EOD personnel are also assigned to Military Humanitarian Assistance teams (MHATS). Their expertise in handling hazardous material is invaluable to the US Army. US Air Force EOD personnel are also a vital part of the organization. The Air Force\u2019s EOD personnel serve in combat-related missions; perform combat readiness missions; and protect military and civilian personnel from the dangers posed by explosives. Air Force EOD personnel have access to a wide range of modern weapons and technology (see figure 6 for example of Air Force EOD weapons). The Army Reserve\u2019s Force Chief Knowledge Officer provided insight into the Army Reserve EOD mission: US Army Reserve EOD personnel are deployed in an ever-increasing number of remote locations worldwide. Currently, Army Reserve EOD personnel are assigned to 24 Reserve units at 37 locations across the United States. In support of Army Reserve EOD operations, there are 63 individual and unit level EOD personnel supporting the Reserve\u2019s units. EOD personnel are also routinely deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to support combat and humanitarian missions. Figure 5: Current EOD Team Members EOD personnel are assigned to a variety of mission support roles within the US Army, as shown in figure 6. They are also assigned to Air Force units as air traffic controllers, as well as their own unit. EOD personnel from 17 different units across 17 states are deployed together in 4,000 of units EOD locations worldwide. EOD personnel also deploy under Navy and Air Force Reserve contracts to support Combat Humanitarian Assistance teams (MHATS). Figure 6: Weapons Used In EOD Operations Army Signal Support Foundation (ASF) EOD personnel are trained in many areas, such as signal, medical, and engineering. They also work with military and civilian personnel who work alongside their unit on specific tasks, such as the placement of explosive devices.

In response, VA created an access office in late 2016. On the same-day medical care services initiative, VA developed definitions of same-day services right aside, during regular business hours for primary and mental health care at primary care centers. They also provided guidance for implementing the same-day service initiative, including training, forms, and tools, such as face-to-face visits, telehealth, video visits, the ability to receive a secure electronic message, and a self-care toolkit for veterans. 3 The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke defines Epileptic Seizures, \u201cEpileptic Seizures are seizures that result in abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These seizures typically involve brief lapses in consciousness in addition to muscle twitching, seizures, or loss of consciousness. These seizures, if not treated promptly or appropriately, can be lethal. Seizures are classified according to their site, occurrence, age at occurrence, clinical features, duration of symptoms, frequency, and resistance to treatment.\u2026 Most seizures are spontaneous, the number of seizures per minute is\u2026about 100.

In February 2019, the Trump Administration took action to increase opportunities for small businesses under the law by revoking the 10 percent WOSB set-aside for all WOSBs, including those that had competed for contract set-asides, pending finalization of the proposed rule. PROCEEDINGS: - 18-2WOSBProcurementPrograms - Audit report reviews, 13th Annual Report to Congress on the WOSB program, and the Annual Financial Report (OIG). Reported WOSB set-asides are often used as a tool to help small businesses, especially women-owned businesses, access contracts. For years, many procurement officials and small business experts have complained that SBA\u2019s WOSB set-aside program\u2014established in 1988, and revised in 2012 under the WOSBCA\u2014is not effective. The WOSB set-aside program does not have a specific time frame for expiration. Instead, under current law, it is \u2018temporarily suspended every month until final rule is promulgated, with the program being reinstated after one month. There is no way to know how long the program will continue, or when it will be reinstated. This program also excludes set asides of new business development assistance grants that are only available to small businesses through SBA\u2019s New Business Development Center Network (NBDN). The WOSB set-asides do not include business development grants. In October 2015, in a new letter to SBA from a coalition of business and trade groups, they expressed concern that the WOSB set-aside was \u2018not working.\u2019 They stated that fewer than one,500 firms have received sole-source or set- asides or compete in the program, and that the program has 'not adequately enforced the rule provisions.' SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) in 2014 issued an audit report titled \"OIG Review of the WOSB Program.\" OIG\u2019s work found that WOSB program management practices did not align well with the program's mission. Additionally, a third part of OIG\u2019s report states that of the thousands of WOSB sole source contracts awarded, all but two were for firms in the United States. While the report does not state how much revenue the program generates yearly, the WOSB program received over $10 billion in fiscal year 2011. Additionally, the report did not cite any recent WOSB Program accomplishments, such as setting records for WOSB set-asides in fiscal year 2013, the highest WOSB set-asides ever awarded at more than 2,000 ($21 billion) in fiscal year 2017, and the largest number of new WOSB contracts awarded under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration (1,500 new contracts) in fiscal year 2018. However, since September 9, 2015, SBA reports that the WOSB set-aside program has been updated, so that the majority of sole source contracts made under the rules are competed in a competitive process. For every business that makes a sole source WOSB set-aside contract, SBA will also establish a Business Development Assistance Grants (BDAG) grant to help businesses set-up. The 15th Annual Report to Congress on the WOSB procurement set-aside is available on GOA.ORG(GIBUILDACTRICTIONALOCATEDRIVERS.ORG). The Office of Inspector General's (WIG) report to Congress on the WOSB procurement Set-Aside Program is available at. The WOSB program is covered by the Federal Acquisition and Contracts (FAR) Act. The FAR Act requires competitive bid awards for contracts issued to private firms that are \"small businesses\" as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (). The Small Business Administration also has a program to assist small businesses in expanding their business operations. For more information on Small Business Programs offered by SBA, please visit. SUMMARY OF WOSB PROCESS: The WOSB program is administered by the Office of Government Contracts and Business Development within the Department of Labor (DOL) and overseen by SBA. There are two main types of WOSB WOSBs are awarded in full-time increments of up to 5 years. WOSBs have been around longer than the federal procurement program. Since 1880, the number of women-owned and small business enterprises has risen. While the SBA has been administering WOSB contracts longer than other FEDERAL procurement programs, it has", "The LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual employed or retained by a client for compensation within lobbies of the Senate, House of Representatives, or the Committee established by Congress to advise the Senate and House on pending legislation or congressional investigations. Lobbyists disclose lobbies and certain reported lobbying expenses on the periodic LD-2 form each quarter. Additionally, lobbyists or registered individuals must designate their official website, which is a public entry point, to ensure compliance with the LDA \"Open\" rule. The LDA includes guidelines on a wider range of registration and reporting requirements, as well as information regarding compliance with a wider range of non-political events and reporting by former congressional employees. They also provide advice on what to do if a specific event occurs or if there are any issues that need addressing with the registration requirements. If a former employee is hired as a consultant and/or a contractor to provide professional advice to others, then registration must also be completed. The LDA also includes specific penalties for violating certain non-partisan requirements of federal law. The penalty can result either in a criminal sentence or a penalty. This statute requires penalties to be paid by nonpartisan employees not covered by it or by an entity controlled by them, where they are the ones violating it. NOTE: The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993 requires that persons who participate in trade or industry and engage in a political campaign to designate their official website and filing location. They must report an increase of $10,000 or more in income from a registered lobbyist or firm. They are required to report individual events that occurred on a specific date by providing a date, amount, and an event subject to which the information is provided. They are also required to report non-partisan events or non-political events; any event that is for non-partisan purposes and meets requirements, must be reported. Nonpublic reporting of public events and non-partisan issues may be made with the exception that their reporting cannot be publicly reported, and a violation of that requirement will result in penalties, fines or imprisonment. If an event needs to be reported on an additional time period, the reporting person or entity must be notified. It is advised that former employees seek the advice and counsel of tax or accounting professionals and to consult the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, the attorney for the United States, or a trial attorney if questions arise or the reporting person/individuals are unsure of the reporting process. The penalties for civil and criminal penalties for violating nonpartisan requirements of federal law include up to 4 years prison term. The 5th and 6th paragraph of the act provide penalties of a fine up to $1,000 or five years in prison, or both. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993 requires that persons (1) whose work is done for pay or that of property or of others are considered \"public servants,\" (2) who are engaged in making public statements on issues and matters of general public interest may disclose their official position to the public as to whether a member of their staff participates in these matters, and (3) who are the employer of a nonpublic official, officer or employee of a public body is required by a law known to be applied to his/her official duties to report any financial assistance received during a designated reporting period, provided he/she does not disclose any private financial or employment information that is necessary for official purposes in the case of a person known to be a public body official to receive a tax benefit. Penalties include 5 years in prison if convicted. (see the summary above) The act requires a person's employer or an agent who acts on the person's behalf to obtain any necessary tax information from any person who has had taxes withheld from his or her income. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993 also requires nonpublic entities, as opposed to those entities who are open to the public, to report certain events that occur within their facility or to a state regulatory agency. The list of events required to be reported in accordance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993, the tax return information that is to be reported, the period of time for which tax returns are to be reported, and the date when the reporting of the return is due are set forth in this section. Penalties range up to 5 years in prison and a fine at least $5,000 if the person convicted. A felony conviction may be required. \"Public body\", as defined in RULE 1.01.01 \u00a712, of the Ethics Commission Rules means governmental entities that are subject to Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993 requirements. Penalty of up to 4 years in prison or a fine ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 for violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993. The penalty can be extended for three years after a conviction.

We identified a number of concerns relating to DHS\u2019s CFATS management, including (1) DHS\u2019s lack of implementation of CFATS standards within its risk management process and (2) DHS\u2019s failure to include proper evaluation and treatment of potential CFATS violations. These findings raised significant questions about DHS\u2019s management of CFATS programs. For example, DHS was not implementing CFATS risk assessments often or sufficiently or conducting site security surveys for all facilities. DHS was also failing to assess the security of its CFATS-certified facilities by DHS reviewers. DHS is one of four federal agencies tasked with carrying out Homeland Security and Protection responsibilities in areas related to public safety. DHS has a high degree of accountability, both to Congress and the Department\u2019s executive leaders, and is thus considered an essential, high-impact function that can affect the entire nation.

The table reflects a contractor\u2019s progress payments, amount of performance-based payments awarded, and how each payment relates to the payment schedule. These table items are used to determine which and where DOD would apply performance-based payments. Some aspects are specific to the construction contracts within a specific category. DOD performance, which reflects how well a contractor performed relative to that of other companies in the same industry. DOD uses contract pricing based on the cost of a product. An analysis tool, known as DCPL3, allows DOD to evaluate how contract pricing effects contractor profitability. The tool, which compares DOD-based cost with a contractor\u2019s (or subcontractor\u2019s) proposal, is used by DOD to evaluate contractor financial statements on completion of the contract, 75 percent of which are based upon contractor financial statements in DCPL3. (See DCPL3, below.) DOD performs the following functions under the guidance of the DOD and FAR FAR RULE CONTRACTING LAWS IN 2015 2 Table 1, which specifies cost-based price payments and performance-based payments. The FAR, which is a manual for government procurement, is a resource for both the government and contractors. The FAR requires DOD to use this guidance in writing and to the contractors. FAR Appendix IV-J, which has a list of DOD categories of cost-based pricing is applicable to all solicitations that contain a FAR component, including non- FAR-based solicitations, because the FAR is applied to all DOD contracting programs. The contractors listed with each product category, based on classification in the FAR listing, are required to be able to provide adequate accounting to ensure the contract can be accurately monitored. As explained in the text of the FAR to contractors, all contractors are required to provide current and accurate financial information that will enable DOD to determine the contractor\u2019s financial condition. Contractors\u2019 Cost and Price (C&P)/Cost and/or the cost of a product within a product definition class. 1. DOD uses the Cost and Pricing Center (CPC) when considering the economic feasibility of awards where the price of the product is a portion of the total cost of the item. Contract Finan- cial Reporting System (CFS) is a DOD-created tool that assists contractors in submitting financial claims and balances. The system tracks the contractor\u2019s progress on cost. When a contractor submits an expenditure report, the information is reviewed and a balance is determined to see how much the contractor was paid vs. what they have sent to DOD to meet the goal of achieving equitable payments. The contractor then sends the item to the DOD Inspector Internal Auditor (IIA). In the event of non-payment, the contractor will not be able to continue payment until all payments are made. The contractor will also not receive future payments until they meet a timely receipt requirement. The FAR requires the contractor to continue payments unless a valid waiver is granted. These costs are to be assessed each calendar quarter, or more frequently if DOD has specific requirements that apply to the quarterly payment. The costs to DOD are determined quarterly by cost to cost type (cost) as opposed to time based (time) using FAR 1404-8 Costing Procedures. The cost includes the costs to contractors. 2. Cost and Pricing Center (CPC) reports to the Defense Contractual Terms Management Program (DCTMP) office. The CPC assists contractors in determining the economic feasible price and availability of cost proposals to be included in a contract. The cost (or price, as mentioned) is normally based on the total Cost Breakdown Schedule (COBS) of the contractor and/or subcontractor. The program will monitor and provide guidance to contractors. In addition, the CPC coordinates product-level, performance-based-payment information. It is also used by contractor suppliers to assess their own cost structures. The report of payments will help the contractor identify where any delays occurred. In the event of delay, the contractor will have a cost opportunity to make up the payments. There are additional tools offered in addition to the CPC, such as a contractor report card, contractor cost per-or-der and a contractor cost savings review. The Cost and Pricing Center works with a lot of contractors. The cost per contractor of submitting financial information ranges from 6 hours to 2 hours. The cost per contractor/contractor invoice range from $8 to $32/hour. (See the cost per hour. The cost is the same as that of the CPA fees.) The cost to maintain the systems alone is around $3 million annually. It is not part of a contractor\u2019s cost. Rather, it is a DOD cost. 3.

DHS is subject to several federal procurement regulations, in particular the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). DHS has implemented its own FAR policies to guide its service acquisitions. DHS relies on the FAR to provide policies and procedures to guide its service acquisitions. DHS also has multiple acquisition methods in place, such as OCP, that are designed to guide DHS's acquisition and management activities and provide a structure for managing DHS's vendor relationships. DHS also relies on various contract types, as described herein, for all its service acquisitions. DHS does not typically compete a wide range of services. Instead, DHS generally selects a specific set of services and associated risks for each particular contract and performs vendor selection processes that may be tailored by contract type and duration. DHS's service acquisition methods and contracting practices can range greatly depending on the type and scope of the acquisitions. DHS can buy off most of the products in its inventory with simple contracts, for example. But DHS also has a high level of complexity and is subject to many of its requirements, including some that may be relatively simple for other agencies (e.g., a data processing program). DHS has implemented its own FAR regulations and guidelines, such as the FAR Acquisition Policy and Procedures. DHS also maintains a comprehensive set of procurement policies, which includes the DHS Acquisition Manual. DHS may have separate contracting requirements for certain acquisition methods. DHS may also use a combination of its own acquisition methods and the Federal Acquisition Regulations. DHS can be subject to different requirements, depending on the type of acquisition and contract, that vary across multiple levels of its contracting process. DHS is subject to a large number of acquisition requirements, which all depend on the specific risk and type of the acquisition. DHS also offers a range of services, from those that are relatively simple, such as consulting services, to those that are complex, such as cybersecurity and intelligence analysis. DHS also offers unique services, such as providing transportation services or support for personnel travel that may be subject to specific contracting requirements. DHS uses a variety of different methods and tools for managing its acquisition and management resources. DHS has a diverse set of acquisition methods, such as contracts-based and contracts-neutral, that DHS uses to determine the best approach for each program. DHS generally selects a set of services and associated risks for each particular contract and performs vendor selection processes. DHS has adopted a diverse range of acquisition approaches, including both contractingbased and contractingneutral methods. DHS uses a combination of methods to perform acquisition, including a data processing program. DHS uses different types of contracts: contracts-based and contracts-neutral. DHS also uses a combination of methods, including competitive sourcing and procurement policies of FAR 52.20, to manage its procurement. DHS contracts can be subject to a range of FAR requirements, depending on their scope, type, and the specifics of the award. DHS can be required to implement specific contractual obligations, such as ensuring a delivery schedule of services. DHS generally selects a set of services and associated risks for each contract depending on type and scope, and DHS is subject to a range of FAR requirements depending on the specifics of the contract. DHS has a diverse range of acquisition methods, including both contracting based and contracting programs. DHS also utilizes a variety of methods to manage procurement, including competitive sourcing and procurement policies of FAR 52.20. DHS may be subject to FAR constraints when establishing OCP contracts. DHS can be required to perform specific contractual obligations. DHS is typically subject to a range of FAR constraints when establishing OCP contracts based on the specifics of the OCP contracts. DHS's procurement regulations are subject to FAR provisions and may be subject to additional FAR requirements depending on certain circumstances, such as the type of acquisition. DHS may be subject to specific FAR requirements depending on the type of acquisition and the details of its FAR contracts and contracts of FAR subcategory. DHS is subject to multiple FAR requirements depending on the type and scope of its program. DHS can implement an OCP program for goods and services. DHS can use multiple methods and tools to manage its procurement and performance. DHS can be subject to a diverse range of FAR constraints, depending on the details of the FAR contracts.

DOD can leverage existing hiring flexibilities to speed the hiring process of civilians in high-demand roles, such as engineering and contracting, while continuing to hire for the most technical skills in the military and civilian workforce. Currently, DOD\u2019s workforce management processes lack the necessary rigor to identify and capture the workforce\u2019 value, or the contributions the workforce makes to the department to meet federal missions. OPM has developed a method to capture workforce value information, known as the \u201cCivilian Federal Workforce Report,\u201d and provided it to OPM by DOD, in order for OPM to collect data and develop a roadmap for a future strategy for federal workforce planning. To better meet its hiring needs, DOD can use the Flexibility Act to expand apprenticeship opportunities for its personnel, with the caveat that DOD would be required to continue to provide in-house career training opportunities. The Trump Administration is pursuing a personnel mobility reform initiative. With the exception of the acquisition workforce, personnel mobility legislation cannot be implemented, as the acquisition workforce is unique across DOD. The Trump Administration is pushing for DOD\u2019s Acquisition Workforce Reform Initiative\u2019s implementation. The Secretary of Defense\u2019s Acquisition Workforce Task Force will soon provide its final recommendations. These tasks will require OPM to produce a comprehensive report for the Secretary of Defense, including the development of a comprehensive program. The Secretary of Defense, General Markedly, has set the acquisition workforce goal for Army, Navy, and Air Force (Army, Navy, and Air Force) to grow between 3 and 4 percent each year. The 2017 OPM High-Demand Hiring Flexibility Report found that DOD\u2019s hiring system is complex, with each position type requiring different time-to-hire measures. According to the report, in 2016, DOD had to process more than 5.6 million applications for positions, and that number has doubled since 2004. In-processing times, from the time an applicant submits an application to beginning of initial training and occupational skills assignment, has an average of five weeks. According to the report, in 2016 alone, more than 40 percent received an opportunity to work in an Acquisition Workforce Program. These programs were described as either requiring a two-year commitment or three-year commitment, which is currently required. The report also found that more than 2 percent of the 22,000 applications received in 2016 included veterans. Over 100,000 applicants were initially contacted with an estimated 8 percent of those applying for a position being selected. The report also highlighted DOD\u2019s significant human capital asset management challenges and their lack of long-term planning. The report went on to identify that the number of civilians in DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce has declined continuously, except for a rise between fiscal years 2010 and 15. The report\u2019s recommendations that would have DOD increase the size of its acquisition workforce included the following priorities: (1) increase the size of the civilian acquisition workforce and hire military/civilian conversion trainees. We found that DOD is adding more than the historical size of civilian acquisition workforce. However, this size increase cannot be sustained without a strategy on where additional staffing can be obtained to support the increase in workload. (2) focus on identifying critical hiring skills and processes and streamline hiring methods. (3) establish a plan to develop civilian acquisition workforce positions as military acquisition positions. (4) expand the use of the flexibilities provided to DHS and DOD civilian personnel to help bridge the gap in hiring civil servants. According to DOD\u2019s Acquisition Workforce Reform Initiative\u2019s website, the initiative will complete its report to the Secretary of Defense in December 2019. (5) use existing hiring flexibilities in Title 5 and other laws to hire civilian personnel where there is a critical gap in a specific technical skills area. (6) conduct critical assessments of existing programs to identify where changes or adaptations are required, in order to provide a more efficient and effective DOD acquisition workforce. DOD and OPM should have the ability to easily convert existing military talent to civilian roles. By using the Flexibility Act, which can allow DOD to create up to 130 civilian federal positions, including at the Associate level of the GS-13 level, the initiative was created to fill critical skill gaps in DOD. The report concluded that there was a growing momentum towards using a civilian workforce for DOD acquisitions, but more information needs to be provided on which positions, if any, would be added as civilian roles. OPM should be able to offer guidance to departments on where to start a pilot or a feasibility study in recruiting civilian talent in the acquisition workforce. The Secretary of Defense\u2019s Acquisition Workforce Reform Taskforce is on course to develop a report to be reviewed in July 2019, following which", "The current rate of completion of depot repair for air-born and ground-based fixed-wing aircraft, at approximately 75 percent average completion each year. Most delays occur due to aircraft being out of maintenance, but a number of \"other\" reasons are also involved, including unexpected repairs. Many more modernized aircraft experience issues not seen on the earlier aircraft. Most of these issues can be attributed to design modifications, or aging. The Air Force Life Cycle Management programs keep the system inventory on-time (the goal of 80 percent of completion). The Navy and Air Force aircraft maintainers are the most reliable component of depot workforce, and the fastest turnaround time occurs during the initial \"make\" phase. The Marine Corps fixed-wing aircrafts tend to be 90 percent complete on time. Due to the reliability of the Navy and Air Force aircraft, they are consistently at or near to their goal of 80 percent on-time completion of depot repair. Figure 1. Air Force Depot Maintenance Statistics. Table B-2 shows that DOD depot completion rate is 90 percent of all of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft, which includes in-house depot jobs and contractor depot positions. These numbers indicate that DOD\u2019s Depot Level Maintenance Program (DLMP) has a high success rate. The depot data collected for each type of aircraft in our study shows that these types of aircraft complete in-house repair and maintenance on an average time of about six months, depending on the severity of the aircraft. Even though completion rates are good on both the Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, their average times of completion is slower than expected. The depot repair and maintenance timetables for fixed-wing aircraft are in Figure 5. The DOD\u2019s DLMP is the most well-maintained military logistics system in the world. DOD data indicate that depot completion rate for the Air Force and Navy is actually closer to 80 percent. Most of these Air Forces and Navy units have in-house capability to complete the high repair timings. Most of the Navy and Air Force aviation depot personnel do the job on a rotational basis. The majority of DOD Depot completion statistics show high completion rates for the two depot types. Figure 5.

Depot Completion, Fiscal Years 2014 through 2019 includes information regarding the time the depot completion rate has been 80 percent. These percentages indicate that in fiscal years 2014 through 2019, most of the fixed-wing naval aircraft depot depot maintenance repair requirements were met. DOD depot completion statistics show that this number was in excess of 90 percent, which is similar to the Air Force and Navy success rates. Table 2. Examples of Depot, Air Force, Navy, Department of Defense, Air Force Marine Corps, Army National Guard, Marine Corps, Navy Medical Service, U.S. Navy, Navy Reserve, Air Force Logistics, U.S. Air Force Reserve, and contractor depot employees and their average completion times is shown in Table 6. Some statistical results show that only a few percent of this year's repair requirements could be met in fiscal years 2014 through 2020. Most of these repair requirements are the result of \"designated obsolescence\" with more aircrafts being retired earlier in the decade, causing a shortage of parts to perform the - - 17. - - 17.", "Tribes possess immense energy resources, including 80 percent of all utility-scale renewable energy potential in the contiguous area of the United States. Energy purchases may be possible if agencies follow GSA, DOD, and DOE direction and modify procurement regulations to assist tribal participation. Transmission infrastructure challenges are common impediments. Agencies\u2019 potential to develop tribal energy resources could be enhanced if authorities were to enable energy transactions at a large scale, rather than requiring agencies to purchase from their nearest federal partner. Technical assistance also may be possible to ensure that tribal energy providers understand the procurement process. GSA officials shared several ideas that would help agencies and tribal organizations engage in energy contracts. Suggestions also included better communication between agencies and tribal representatives in procurement processes, as well as additional funding from Congress for energy acquisitions.", "VBA reports in an annual report to the Secretary on its responsibilities and objectives, including disability benefits, for which it seeks to allocate contractor funds. VBA has not fully developed standardization processes for the submission of patient information, including diagnosis and treatment information, which is a critical factor in assessing patient claims to determine disability eligibility according to VBA\u2019s internal policies. VBA officials acknowledge the need for greater standardization in documenting and capturing care-related information in the patient\u2019s records. VBA has developed a document standardization manual (DSM 10.1) that guides agencies and contractors. However, we found that VBA in the past would not reliably retain information submitted by contractors on the DSM and VBA staff would often ask contractors to re-submit information. VBA officials acknowledged our April 2017 report to the Secretary on the challenges in capturing the patient data, which results in an inability to determine disability benefits. VBA officials also acknowledged the need to further develop the DSM to provide quality and timeliness. They previously said that they would develop an internal standardization process for the submission and management of the patient\u2019s information, including diagnosis and treatment information, and determine their data retention procedures. Although VBA reports that the information can be found in a specific patient\u2019s file, VBA does not have information on or know what specific information was submitted by contractors. Furthermore, VBA\u2019s current system does not allow its contractors much more than a monthly bill even though contractors are required to bill in half-price. VBA does not provide any information regarding this bill calculation. Finally, VBA officials acknowledged the need for a more sophisticated data collection system for the collection of the patient-related information. According to the report, VBA has been slow in the adoption of the National Health Information 2020 Standard (NHIS) which is a framework for exchanging, sharing, and using individual level health data as opposed to the limited use that the current data standard had achieved. VBA officials acknowledged the need for the implementation of the NHIS Standard among their contractors, such that contractors would use this standard as a tool for the collection of patient data to meet information requests. VBA officials acknowledge other challenges in capturing the patient and veteran information, including the need to address data entry procedures and timeliness in collecting the information. Currently, VBA does not have information on contractor performance, including the time it takes to conduct the examinations and review of claims per a contractor. Finally, VBA will not publish the report during the first year of NHIS but has stated that it ultimately will do so. In an internal report to the Secretary on VBA\u2019s future strategy, it will develop an internal data standardization process for the submission and management of the patient\u2019s information, including diagnosis and treatment information. VBA will create and provide a document standardization manual (DSM 10.1) to support the data collection process. The report also acknowledged the need to further develop the DSM and the implementation of standards and will use a more sophisticated data collection system for the collection of the patient-related information after the NHIS standard is integrated. According to our report in 2018, VBA is struggling to determine the timeliness of examinations and quality of the results to contractors. According to VBA officials in 2018, there have been discussions to develop an internal document standardization process for the submission and management of the patient\u2019s information including diagnosis and treatment information, which would be more accurate and consistent with the existing standards set by the VHA. In conclusion, as we reported in our July 26, 2018 report (Report to the Secretary), the current system is cumbersome and inefficient. Our report also found that VBA is struggling to determine the timeliness of examinations and their accuracy in diagnosing and treating disability and that the implementation of the NHIS standard is slow in adoption. We also suggested that the Department consider the use of electronic submission of data for further efficiency. However, VBA officials agree that it would benefit in the transition from their current system to NHIS. VBA officials acknowledge that their system needs to become more streamlined in collecting information and that better data collection is important to ensure accurate information from their contractors. The report concludes that VBA is currently struggling to maintain the effectiveness of its system in capturing accurate information from contractors. To ensure more timely responses, we conclude that the Department should consider transitioning a contractor to a more contemporary system. There are many benefits to modernizing a system, but it could be cost prohibitive and time consuming to implement. Finally, we close our report with a strong call to action. If VBA\u2019s current system is not improved, it could be costly to continue the inefficiencies in processing claims and other benefits. Instead of processing claims with VBA, VBA will ultimately be processed and processed via NHIS. To complete the change in process, VBA will assist its contractors with NHIS, which is a significant update to the current system. Moreover, our report calls for V", "\u2022 Aeronautics Engineering - related to: the Air Force and Navy; Engineering; Engineering - General; Engineering, Aeronautical, Aerospace and Astronautical \u2022 Aviation Maintenance Technology - related to: American Airlines, Boeing \u2022 General Aeronautics Certification Program.

The federal government does not make payment to hospitals, but will pay 90 percent for services delivered by government- or state-operated IMDs. Most of the remaining spending goes to Medicaid providers that include nursing homes, physician fees, or 24/7 access to primary-care physicians. The UPL is capped for each state. State Medicaid payments are the main source of hospital funding. The federal government paid a portion of Medicaid payments to hospitals in 2005, while starting in 2013, states were required to share in the Medicaid matching amount, if it exceeds the hospital\u2019s payment. This law has expired. Prior to 1997, Medicaid payments included the DSH component, which included payments to IMDs. From 1997-present, each state is required to pay up to 90 percent of the costs of a Medicaid-eligible hospital.

Since 2014, FAA has implemented the SMS approach to airmanship, risk management, and incident management, such as new process redesigning and simplifying process design techniques. The first implementation was its SMS for the Airline Industry, which was modified. After that modification, there was a revision of FAA\u2019s airspace standardization program, which impacted airport traffic management. FAA introduced the Air Traffic Safety Systems Certification Process in 2018, which will allow for the creation of new safety technologies for the current and next generation of commercial aircraft. The SMS approach is also applicable to drone operations. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) Office of Airports (OA) oversees every commercial airport with the exception of those operated by the military. OA\u2019s Airside Operations Directorate manages airspace operations, terminal area services, and airport gate operations for the commercial aviation sector from a central location. Airside Operations is part of the Aviation Operations Division at the FAA. In an audit report on FAA airside services, we found that there were weaknesses in the design of their communication systems, and recommendations to ensure that necessary information can be communicated in real-time. The FAA has more than 600 operational airports across the country. According to its 2017 Annual Performance Measure Report, there were about 30,000 airport-related safety events. In one of these events, an American Airlines flight had to go around due to another aircraft\u2019s departure from the runway. A similar event occurred with an Southwest Airlines flight to Puerto Plata (Dominican Republic). At the time of the audits, we found that the pilot of Southwest Airlines thought that taxiway 20E was the route to the aircraft to board the aircraft when instead, it was taxiway 10E. The FAA has no direct oversight of taxiways, airports, or their airfield operations (there are separate agreements in place). FAA\u2019s responsibility for the airfield is to inspect, monitor, and evaluate the environmental impacts of construction, operations, and maintenance activities performed on the lands and facilities used in connection with airports. In September 2012, we highlighted numerous operational safety incidents that resulted in runway overrun or other aircraft incidents. Many were due to air traffic control mishandles that failed to ensure (1) the aircraft cleared the runway before the vehicle came to the end of the runway; (2) the vehicle\u2019s runway clearances meet the FAA runway design standard; (3) the aircraft was not positioned where the runway was; and (4) the pilot failed to perform adequate checks for safety before the aircraft departed the runway for takeoff. Based on the recommendations contained in our 2011 report and several other reports and incidents, we found that the FAA has weaknesses in airport safety inspections, with the exception of the FAA Inspection System (FIS). One of several recommendations related to airport safety inspections stated that the FAA has not evaluated the efficacy of applying these inspections, and therefore, the frequency and frequency of these inspections should be examined and any deficiencies should be addressed. This evaluation of the frequency and frequency of the FIS inspections will be conducted no later than 2021. The FAA has more than 200 federally-operated airports that serve commercial air carriers and private operators. There were 3,000 commercial airline operations that moved in and out of airports and a total of 1.5 million commercial air traffic per day in 2018. The FAAS has 13 Offices on the airfield across the country that are responsible for the operations and maintenance for commercial airports. There were 63 incidents of overrun / excursion on commercial airlines at all time between October 1940 and September 2019. The FAA uses data analytics and the FAA Air Traffic Control (ATC) System to reduce risks. The ATC System is the FAA\u2019s primary control tower system, which manages a network of traffic airspace in more than 350 control areas. Each of these control areas is responsible for the air traffic through all phases of flight. The FAA also manages multiple electronic access systems, which provide data visualization capabilities. The FAA has implemented the FAA Airside Operations Data Analytics System (AODAS), which uses statistical/data analysis methodologies and artificial intelligence to process and analyze safety events and other critical incidents in a timely manner. The FAA\u2019s airspace modernization system known as the Terminal Airspace System (TAS) uses a database to dynamically route each aircraft along its route in order to optimize airspace safety. There are also a number of satellite-based systems, from which the FAA can acquire data. When events occur, the FAA uses analytics and various tools to evaluate and determine the appropriate way to address the situation until the situation is resolved. One example of an event the FAA analyzed was the January 2018 incident at the Atlanta International Airport, a collision between an Air Mobility Command cargo jet and a Delta plane on a taxiway. The", "As of February 2020, OCWR complied with numerous requirements outlined in CAA and was in compliance with all requirements from the Reform Act. However, OCWR did not always fully understand the requirements, which led to some delay in implementing new requirements. To ensure compliance, OCWR implemented a series of interim policies and procedures, including new reporting requirements. They are currently in the process of developing a permanent records retention program. During the CAA, OCWR received over 1,000 requests during an 8-month period, and, since July 31, 2019, there have been a 2,000-plus increase in requests per month. In January 2019, OCWR received 5,000 electronic cases in one day. In 2019, OCWR scanned more than 9,000 paper records. The CAA requires OCWR to publish summary of its work with each plaintiff and to keep their records in physical files and electronic files. A total of 3,400 files from 2016-2018 remained unopened, and in a 2019 study of closed claims, 7% of claims that had previously been closed due to lack of documentation included unopened files. OCWR received more than 3,100 complaints in the 2019-2020 period. OCWR has a strong history of providing excellent customer service. This year, OCWR received 91,600 service calls, which is 15% of their calls. There has been a slight decrease. In 2017, their backlog was 25, which resulted from a rise in demand due to a growing economy. In 2018 and 2019, their backlog was 17 each year. This could be attributed to fewer applications per year of the Reform Act, which decreased the number of claims filed. In 2019, the total backlog decreased to 17 as well. This year, the backlog is in the 14-17 range. In 2018, it was 31, which resulted from a decrease in staff workload due to the hiring backlog. According to OCWR, workload has doubled since the hiring backlog was completed. As part of their efforts to combat the backlog, OCWR hired and employed a new contractor to handle these services in September 2019. According to OCWR, by January 2020, it planned to have about 40 contractors in place, which would allow for quicker processing. One new feature OCWR began to provide in 2019 was an on-line form for submitting claims. This form allows customers the convenience of submitting a claim online, by phone or through a physical mail application. In 2017, an estimated 90% of the claims submitted by customers were submitted using this feature, or through OCWR\u2019s online process (which allows customers to fill out a claims form or submit through an email application). According to OCWR, the 2019 form submission percentage had increased to 97%. The online form allowed customers to submit their applications electronically, which included a fillable form along with supporting documents. The online submissions will be used for processing, which will reduce the amount of time required to complete the application process. There are several additional requirements that OCWR must comply with pursuant to the Reform Act, as well as the CAA, regarding claims processing. These include completing claims timely, conducting investigations of claims as necessary, recording the date and time in the claim\u2019s file, and keeping copies of all correspondence for claim processing purposes. Additionally, OCWR must document the nature and amount of each claim. These requirements were outlined in the Reform Act. The claims timeline was extended from 7.5 years up to 25 years. The Reform Act required OCWR to create a standard timeline for the claims process, and they completed this effort during 2010-2015. In 2015, OCWR reported that there had never been a backlog in their processing system in their history, and that their processing time has never been an issue in completing all claims. They have two offices, and they have implemented a number of IT efficiencies to accommodate their workload. Some of these changes include upgrading hardware and software to an \"IBM\" server, using advanced technology to process incoming documents more efficiently and efficiently, and introducing new technology to reduce processing times for document processing. The Reform Act also required OCWR to perform a process review. In October 2019, OCWR submitted its report. According to OCWR, they completed the Reform Act requirements, which included documentation of each processing that occurs to resolve each complaint. An itemized breakdown of all fees for processing, data storage, data processing, and mailing expenses were also provided. An example of the forms they use is the Electronic Claiming Form. While OCWR has historically processed paper documents, currently about 90% of its processing is electronic. After processing electronic documents, some are then reviewed by OCWR for accuracy.

No. 115-218, provided several methods for individuals in the CNMI to apply for INA parole. They may request a petition for either CNMI resident status under the INA when they meet eligibility criteria. The INA also authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations permitting INA parole applications by individuals otherwise inadmissible. After receiving a petition, DHS may exercise discretionary parole authority to permit an individual to remain in the United States. The INA and the President\u2019s Executive Order 13767, among other laws and regulations, collectively provided methods for individuals in the CNMI to apply for INA parity or other visas and permanent resident status.

Its fee work papers provide additional information on the processes. NRC calculates fee hours with data from quarterly reports. The NRC's Fees Transformation Initiative recommended process improvements for updating NRC's fee rules and associated work papers. NRC develops performance goals and objectives in a billing and accounting system that allows them to assess their billing processes. Source: Commission. NRC's activity code, CGC (BGE), allows the agency to link each of its work and cost elements to the fees it charges. For example, activity code GOV can cover direct costs of personnel, space, food, and equipment expenses that arise from NRC's work on behalf of NRC program offices, licensing, inspections, operations, and safety activities. In a recent review of NRC's fee collection process, we found that NRC's fee and payment schedule is complex, involving two methods, service fees and annual fees. Service fees are based on NRC's hourly fee work; each type of facility has its respective hourly fee rate. NRC's billing process for annual fees is based solely on NRC's hourly fee rate, which is set through the rulemaking process once the proposed fees are announced. In addition, NRC's billing process for service fees begins when a specific licensee initiates work for NRC. An invoice for service fees is based on the hours worked, the hourly rate, and other factors. Since NRC follows a sequential billing process and NRC program office staff and contractors perform the work, NRC uses billing codes for each of the steps listed in figure 2. In the fee work papers, NRC uses a range of hourly rates depending on the individual activity type, for example, from 1.3 dollars per hour to 90 dollars per hour. When annual fees are due, NRC must send a bill for the amount to the licensee. The following is included in NRC's annual invoice: An individual's hourly fee; the NRC's work code for an activity; and the NRC staff who performed the work. For each licensee, NRC uses a variety of hourly rates depending upon the type of work, for example, from 1.3 dollars per hour to 90 dollars per hour, for billing purposes. NRC personnel perform all billable work requested by customers. NRC has 14 regional offices where each licensee has a contract relationship with NRC. The NRC has a comprehensive training program to train NRC staff on regulatory procedures, compliance and enforcement issues related to licensing. Each NRC Regional Office has one or more compliance programs, which include the development and updating of NRC compliance policies and procedures; the monitoring of NRC licensee compliance with NRC program activities; monitoring environmental conditions and property adjacent to NRC facilities; reviewing the adequacy of NRC personnel' security clearances; and reviewing the NRC's environmental reporting program. NRC performs annual independent quality checks on each of these compliance program elements. NRC also has a performance management system that tracks compliance in areas such as financial obligations, the timely submission of NRC program activities, and the timely completion of NRC program requirements. NRC also tracks NRC program licensing activity through database collections and periodic quality analyses. In September 2019, we selected several methods to evaluate NRC\u2019s fee collection process. Our review included: A comprehensive literature review of NRC's fee collection process. The report included detailed information on each phase of NRC\u2019s fee collection process and identified several weaknesses and challenges in the process, including the complexity of NRC\u2019s fee collection process. A review of NRC's billing system. The review included NRC's billing system, the associated data elements, and an analysis of NRC's billing time frames. The analysis identified potential discrepancies between the billing system, payment collection methods, and payment collection efforts. We also developed recommendations to enhance the billing process and payment collection process to ensure more timely payment and billing efforts. The report included recommendations on ensuring the accuracy of NRC's fee billing rate and NRC's payment collection process. Our analysis concluded that NRC's billing process is complex and involves multiple methods. Additionally, NRC\u2019s billing processes are limited in scope, as their billing process is limited to their internal accounts. Although NRC processes their billing transactions through a payment system, the underlying accounting method is based solely on the hourly rate. We recommended that NRC's fees and annual fees, including the billing process for each of NRC's programs using the billing system, be standardized across NRC. Our review also concluded that NRC did not provide adequate customer service in responding to inquiries from licensing applicants. In the NRC's annual invoice for service fees, NRC charges the licensee for any non-working hour. One approach may be to use a method that takes into account NRC's hourly rate and the work performed rather than NRC's billing position. The Annual Fees Assessment Initiative, which is currently under development, has the potential to improve NRC's billing and payment systems. It is critical that NRC's", "CBP's Border Patrol is responsible for securing U.S. borders and apprehending individuals arriving at ports of entry. CBP conducts comprehensive checks on these individuals including interviews, body scans and biometric identification, using the Department of Homeland Security's biometric database to accurately screen individuals. A significant number of individuals are denied asylum in these proceedings, but are still allowed to enter the country on a temporary business visitor visa or on humanitarian grounds. DHS established an asylum office in 2016, called the Asylum, Refuge, and Citizenship Section (ARC), to adjudicate asylum cases, conduct credible fear screenings, and work with the Department of Justice's Office of Immigration Review (OIR) for the asylum adjudication process. Referrals for asylum processing to the Immigration Courts Office have increased by over 300 percent from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2018. In FY 2017, USCIS screened approximately 18 million inapplications and denials of all types between October 2014 and March 2017. DHS's credible case screening officers are responsible for adjudicating credibility and reasonable fear of individuals who are denied asylum. USCIS\u2019s credible case screening officers are responsible for adjudicating credibility and reasonable fear of individuals who are denied asylum. Each immigrant is processed in three stages: asylum processing, credible fear screenings, and finally a USCIS interview. USCIS's EOIR handles 7,000 to 9,000 credible fear caseloads, which the agency is able to manage with its current caseload. EOIR has implemented a new process for interviewing individuals that have been found to be ineligible for asylum. USCIS has implemented various strategies to better manage the caseload, which includes the use of alternative review methods. Tables 1, 2, and 3 provide additional information on DHS\u2019s role and responsibilities in the credible fear, asylum, and credible fear screening processes. DHS's Asylum Office (ARC) plays an active role in adjudicating asylum cases, conducting credible fear screenings, and working with the OIR on asylum adjudication. DHS receives approximately 1,700 cases of asylum/refugee each year, with approximately 50% of these cases processed by ARC. USCIS screens approximately 250,000 individuals each year, with approximately 20% or more being processed by EOIR. Asylum Office ARC screens approximately 13,000 individuals each year, with approximately 7.5% being processed by USCIS\u2019s EOIR.\nDHS\u2019s credible case screening officers are responsible for adjudicating credible and reasonable fear of individuals who are denied asyludefendant\u2019s asylum application. DHS\u2019s EOIR conducts credible and reasonable fear screenings for an applicant\u2019s and a beneficiary's asylum application. The USCIS Asylum Office conducts credible and reasonable fear screenings for asylum applicant\u2019s and their children\u2019s asylum application. The Asylum Office does not process any other types of applications. USCIS is responsible for adjudicating credible fear of an individual applying for asylum or other immigration benefits. In FY 2017 there were approximately 19,000 cases of ineligible individuals screened and approximately 4,500 applicants with pending cases. In FY 2018 DHS screened approximately 18 million inapplications and denials of all types between October 2014 and March 2017. The credible case screening officers adjudicate a case for asylum eligibility or to deny it, which is not a decision for the court. USCIS plays an active role in implementing screening for the credible fear of asylum applicants processing asylum applications. The Asylum Office conducts credible and reasonable fear screenings for asylum applicant's asylum application. The Asylum Office does not process asylum applications outside of asylum applications. USCIS conducts credible and reasonable fear screenings for asylum applicant's and their children's asylum application. USCIS conducts biometric interviews for asylum applicants to determine immigration eligibility.\nThe asylum process is designed to screen individuals\u2019 cases before application to USCIS and, if appropriate, to USCIS. USCIS conducts credible and reasonable fear of asylum case adjudication. The Asylum Office conducts credible and reasonable fear screening for asylum applicant\u2019s application.\nWhen an immigrant first submits an asylum application to USCIS, USCIS will review the application information (background, employment, criminal history, and more) before it is processed. USCIS conducts credible and reasonable fear of asylum case screening based on the information provided by the applicant to USCIS. USCIS conducts credible and reasonable fear of asylum case processing based on specific data provided by the applicant in the application. USCIS conducts biometric check that all individuals who apply for asylum undergo an in-person interview to determine the eligibility of a person's case. USCIS conducts biometric imaging and interviews at a remote location to determine an applicant's eligibility. USCIS conducts biometric interviews and check of all persons applying for asylum from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with additional biometric imaging and interviews,", "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation (e.g., robotics) are transforming U.S. job markets and industries, potentially increasing productivity but also impacting employment rates, skill demands, and task requirements.", "> Since 1941, the U.S. military integrated women into combat jobs. The current and historically wide variety of female roles includes 70 percent for combat and combat support jobs. However, the proportion of female combat support officers has dramatically risen from 25 percent in 1990 to 32 percent in 2019. Figure 2 depicts the change in the proportion of female combat support officers by each year. Our analysis found that there is a marked difference in the percentage of female combat support officers between combat and combat supporting roles (65 percent and 37 percent, respectively). Furthermore, 70 percent of combat support officers are active duty compared to almost 100 percent of combat support officers who remain in the military for their minimum service requirement versus only around 70 percent of combat support officers. The proportion who are in combat support roles overall has risen from 90 percent in 1941 to 62 percent in 2019. In comparison, there has been a statistically insignificant change in the percentage of male officers from 80 percent in 1941 to 71 percent in 2019. Our analysis of enlisted women in combat roles indicated that the percentage has risen from 4 percent in 1941 to 14 percent in 2019 (with nearly all of the women in combat supporting non-combat roles). The median age of all enlisted servicewomen, regardless of whether or not in combat roles, increased from 21.4 years in 1941 to 27.6 years in 2019. Figure 3 depicts overall changes in median age for enlisted females across years. A statistically significant decline occurred between 1941 (42.4 years) and 1946 (44.1 years) as well as a statistically insignificant increase from 1946 (42.2 years) to 1973 (43.5 years). From 1973 to 2019, there is an overall statistically insignificant increase in median age from 46.1 years in 1973 (which was at the bottom) to 47.2 years in 2019. Overall, statistically significant changes occur between fiscal years 2004 through 2018, with combat roles experiencing an increase in the proportion. Figure 4 demonstrates historical trends in overall service enrollment from an active duty perspective for all enlisted roles. There has been significant changes in overall service trends and the percentage of enlisted females in all roles. The largest decline occurred between 2001 (20 percent) and 2013 (4 percent), with the percentage of enlisted women remaining below 70 percent for each fiscal year. There has been a slight rise overall in the percentage of female combat support officers since 2010, while trends for female officers in combat roles are fairly flat each fiscal year. Overall, statistically significant trends occurred between 2010 through 2018 with a statistically significant increase in overall enlisted roles and percentages of enlisted female service members. Figure 5 presents the historical trends in enlisted female service enrollment for active duty roles. From 2002 (7 percent) through 2018, statistically significant trends occurred in overall trends for enlisted female service membership in favor of an increase. There has been a statistically significant increase in overall trends between 2018 (14 percent) and present (21 percent), with statistically significant increases in overall service trends each fiscal year, starting at 2000. Overall, statistically significant trends between 1951 and 2019 reflect a relatively slight decline in enlisted service since the wars started in 1951. Figure 6 depicts trends from 2004 to 2019 for enlisted female combat support roles. Overall, statistically significant trends occurred between 2006 (10 percent) and 2019 (22 percent) regarding overall trends, with statistically significant increases occurring between 2006 and 2012. Our analysis of overall and historical trends in the percentage of enlisted female combat support officers illustrates that the percentage of overall female combat arms roles have declined. The percentage has only been at statistically insignificant levels since the end of the Cold War in 1991, and there has been a statistically significant decline since 2010 (13 percent). Overall, statistical trends since 2010 have been flat, while enlisted overall in armed forces has been at a statistically insignificant decline since 2013. This trend, however, occurred slightly more rapidly in non-male and non-enlisted personnel compared to females. There has been a statistically significant trend in enlisted female service membership from 2000 (7 percent) through 2019 (21 percent). Overall, statistically significant trends occurred within individual years for enlisted female combat support roles from 2006 (10 percent) through 2019 (18 percent). Figure 7 includes the trends of active-duty female and non-army officer enlisted roles since 1972. From 1972 through 2016, statistically significant trends occurred. From fiscal year 1998/1999 (13 percent) through 2016", "The TEPSLF is a temporary expansion of the PSLF program that provides borrowers with eligibility criteria similar to those of PSLF when they meet certain requirements.

The main geologic features used for storage depend on the type of facility used in the country. Salt caverns have large capacity, but are located near the coastal area that faces the chance of hurricane damage. Depleted aquifers and salt formations have lower cost for their storage, but are limited to a few hundred feet of storage depth. Three types of underground geologic formations in the United States are used to store natural gas: salt formations, underground aquifers, and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Salt formations are the most common storage method in the country. The types of geologic formations used for natural gas storage vary, with salt caverns often located near coastal areas that are susceptible to hurricane damage. Salt fields vary in size and location, but generally have deep subsurface. The aquifer method is a smaller method of storage, with sites ranging to a maximum depth of 500 feet. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are used in limited markets for natural gas storage.", "To date, regulatory requirements applicable to aviation have not incorporated the unique needs of Americans with disabilities.

The federal government facilitates mortgage lending through entities such as the Enterprises and Ginnie Mae and plays a crucial role in stabilizing housing finance. 1. Mortgage origination takes place in three main segments: (a) banks, (b) mortgage insurers, and (c) other businesses that specialize in 1. Mortgage origination takes place in three main segments: (a) banks, (b) mortgage insurers, and (c) other businesses that specialize in the origination of mortgage loans. 2. Banks are the primary originators of mortgage loans ($23,000 billion in 2021). 2. Banks are the primary originators of mortgage loans. However, firms specialized in mortgage origination (such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac) account for a majority of the lending. 3. Mortgage lending accounts for the largest share of banks\u2019 balance sheet and profit margins ($1.75 trillion in 2021). The value of mortgage lending accounts for a majority of banks\u2019 balance sheet and profit margins, with almost 80% of their total deposit account interest ($17 billion in 2021). In 2021, about 90% of banks\u2019 lending ($1.75 trillion) is either mortgage or small-business loans. Banks\u2019 lending to small-business loans is much smaller ($7 percent of the bank\u2019s loans). Banks\u2019 lending to businesses for investments, trade, or inventory falls significantly in contrast. Banks\u2019 lending to consumers accounts for the majority of the $2 trillion in 2021 consumer savings ($1.07 trillion), with the largest share ($1.33 trillion) tied to consumer loans and credit card balances. The largest share of consumer loans ($1.08 trillion in 2021) is in mortgage assets. Mortgage markets account for approximately one-fifth of banks\u2019 lending ($24 billion in 2021, a sharp decline from $38 billion in 2020). Bank lending also accounts for a majority of the net consumer savings that banks generate per the Federal Reserve, totaling about $200 billion or approximately 1.5 percent of the nation\u2019s aggregate net output by 2021. Lending to consumers accounts for almost one-third of banks\u2019 net operating profits to consumers ($1.5 trillion in 2021), a decline from the peak of $2.7 trillion in 2008. Banks\u2019 lending ($18 billion in 2021) to corporate clients accounts for about a quarter of banks\u2019 total lending and the largest share of consumer loans are small businesses ($32.9 billion in 2021). Banks\u2019 lending is used to finance other businesses\u2019 assets, with the majority of lending to consumer-oriented businesses ($13.7 billion in 2021). In contrast to commercial lending, corporate lending accounts for an insignificant fraction of banks\u2019 net operating profits ($6.6 billion in 2021). In 2021, households deposited only $1.9 trillion in their banks, representing 40 percent of their total consumer savings. However, consumer savings accounts are almost exclusively small-dollar-value accounts ($1.3 trillion), with the next largest amount ($1.4 billion) in depository service accounts being only a fraction of banks\u2019 asset-based loans. Retail banks account for 80 percent of banks\u2019 assets in 2021, with commercial banks holding 63 percent of banks\u2019 assets. Only about one-tenth of the nation\u2019s total banks were federally-insured, meaning that nearly all banks reported to Congress. The larger banks also are called commercial banks, rather than business and investment banks, as has been historically used. 2. Mortgage lenders account for the majority of mortgage origination. 2. Mortgage lenders are the primary source of mortgage lending ($13.8 billion in 2002) and are the primary source in 2021, taking in about 75 percent of mortgage origination ($18 billion versus $23.5 billion in 2019). Mortgage lenders account for roughly one-fifth of the nation\u2019s housing units in 2016 (32,400,000 units and over 1.6 million commercial buildings). This number is up from 27,900,000 residential properties in 1980. Over-the-counter and institutional mortgage lenders accounted for some 82 percent of all mortgage origination and 79 percent of overall loans. The remaining 20 percent of mortgage origination is mortgage insurance companies, a variety of other banks (businesses and investment banks), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The most popular type of mortgage loan by origin is traditional fixed-rate mortgages in recent years. In contrast, variable-rate mortgages are more commonly used in the 1990s. Banks, including specialized mortgage lenders", "Older Americans are wealthier than younger Americans, but they still face financial challenges. They have greater accumulated wealth than younger Americans in retirement accounts and nonfinancial assets but lesser wealth than younger households in Social Security benefits. Older adults are less likely to own home equity. They face challenges including decreasing interest on savings account at lower and future discount rates. While Social Security income will be less in the future for young workers depending on the 2002 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act provisions (which are also discussed in this report), older Americans will continue to receive substantial, tax- exempt, non-contributory benefits from the programs, such as 2018 benefits from Traditional Workplace retirement plans and (since 1996) benefits from defined benefit plans and DC plans. These retiree benefits have become increasingly important in keeping a large share of older Americans from poverty. However, challenges are mounting, as a share of older Americans are facing increasing costs due to rising home mortgage interest rates and rising costs of Medicare premiums. Retirement benefits, even after receiving Social Security benefits, may be insufficient for full and secure retirement; thus, their own investments and that of a trust fund they can access at age 65 or later will be critical to ensuring adequate retirement income. The estimated net worth of older Americans (net total wealth, excluding any home equity, minus home equity and any debt obligations) is about $8.3 trillion (2017 dollars). This is nearly double the total wealth among all Americans, as older Americans have $13.3 trillion in wealth, net of any home equity and any debt. They are the largest holder of household equity and wealth. In the current 10-year period forecast 30-plus years, Social Security will remain a popular source of retirement income for older Americans. Older Americans will continue to face challenges from rising home mortgage interest rates, but the 10-year projected discount rates remain slightly less than in the 10 year averaged earnings of 2.5 percent. Older Americans are receiving substantial non-contributory tax-free retirement benefits from their work plans (Traditional Workplace programs). The net value of the tax-free retirement benefits received in the 2018 year is about $2.08 trillion. Older Americans are receiving their tax-free annual Social Security IRA in addition to a tax-free match of their employer-sponsored contribution, and the 2018 maximum annual IRA contribution is almost double that of the annual Social Security IRA amount ($9,500 versus about a half of million dollars). Older Americans are facing challenges in their pensions and 401(k) plans, due in part to their current reliance on defined contribution plans (\u201cdefined benefit...", "FFRDCs arise from partnerships between federal agencies and private-sector entities and often perform technical, engineering, and scientific work\u2014 such as systems design, model development, laboratory testing, and prototype development.

To identify households in need of assistance, government grants have often been directed toward federal programs. Most rentership occurred among older households and increased for all age categories between 2001 and 2017. Compared to past years, renters have older age households have experienced a decline in renter households, and renters are on average older than they were in the past. Renters\u2019 homeownership rates typically lower than those in the general population, and in the wake of the financial crisis, rents in these markets outpaced median homeownership rates. Households are on average older than they have been in the past. In addition, some neighborhoods with a history of older renters are not being kept up with the latest renovations or new housing, which has raised rents in those areas. Figure 1 Data from the American Community Survey indicate that renters of all age groups now occupy slightly more housing than do homeowners (see fig. 6-10). However, the overall rental ratio (the number of self-operated rental units divided by the number of owner-occupied units) has declined slightly in recent years (see fig. 11-18). The median rental expense has also increased in several recent Census reports, but more slowly than median owner-occupied housing costs (see fig. 21). Data compiled 15 years into the future also show that rental rates are likely to continue to grow as the number of low-income households grows. Although housing affordability is still an issue, these trends should be somewhat beneficial to households whose incomes increase over the next decade. Figure 2 The number of renter households by age and housing. Households The median rent of renters who live in owner-occupied households is slightly lower (median rental expense by $1,000) compared with renters in self-operated units, whose median rental expense is slightly higher ($1,100). Specifically, data from the 2015 American Housing Survey indicate that the median non-owner housing cost is lower than 81 percent of the sample of rental units by owner. Further, the median rental cost is lower in areas that are a higher proportion of single-residence units than areas with mostly two-residence units. Further, the median rental costs of renters are also slightly lower than those of homeowners, overall. Figure 3 The number of renter households, households, people, and housing units. Households The homeownership rate for individuals in their 20s\u201330s is less than half that of those 65 years old and older (65 percent), and 64 percent have been renting for more than 15 years. Most households, about 75 percent, have been renting since they were children. Although the homeownership rates overall have gone up (the 1995 mark is at 71%) and the homeownership rates in every age group have gone down (the median was 82 percent in 2015) the overall median renting rate has gone up over the past 30 years. In addition, those who rent a majority of their homes tend to do so as part of a small unit of dwelling, where a higher percent of expenses are covered. Since the 2001 year, for those households that rented in the year of 2015 (25 percent households), the median rental expense of $1,100 was lower than 81 percent for those renting in the year of 2015. Some housing markets have declined over the years, as a result of the financial crisis. In 2001, fewer homes than in 2015 were being built in the U.S., and they were building about half of the rental homes that were being built (see fig. 6-10 and fig. 13). Furthermore, for 2015, 50 percent of those households that rented in 2013 had lower housing costs than those in 2015 (54 percent) with the majority of households, nearly 67 percent of tenants, residing in single-unit dwellings. Households The overall income of renters has grown (see fig. 27) since the onset of the Great Recession. Similarly, the proportion of rental households has remained steady and has not declined, despite a decrease in the homeownership rate (see fig. 3-3). Most of the rise in renters, in relation to those living in owner-occupied housing, occurred in the last 10 years of the sample. While a majority of people living in rental housing are not home-owners, about half (43 percent) also pay to maintain a home, and 17 percent of renters ($7 percent of all households) have been in their current residence more than 20 years. About one in five renters, 19 percent of them, report paying half this rent (a $360 median rental cost) each month. Among the smallest rental sectors (single-unit dwellings by rent alone and 2-unit", "", "DOD's reliance on the Defense Acquisition System (DXC) in recent years is the catalyst to DOD's renewed focus on process improvement initiatives. These initiatives to date include $19M awarded to the US government to support a single supplier program, which is currently being conducted with a single manufacturer. The new strategy is supported by a series of programs currently worth about $10B. DOD now works continuously with its suppliers to implement their reliability programs, which has included DOD requirements training program content for DOD suppliers and their employees, as well as a Defense Technical Readiness Program. The US government has now implemented a Defense Readiness Program, a component of which DOD's reliability programs have been incorporated. The US government also now implements Product Service Line Management at supplier sites. According to DOD officials, this strategy has improved manufacturing efficiency and DOD test requirements, including product performance and reliability. Since 2016, USN and USMC have awarded over $130M in service support programs to companies executing on-time delivery of equipment. In response to this growing reliance on product performance and reliability, DOD's Technical Support and Maintenance Readiness/Performance Program (TSM-RP) has been implemented. TSM-RP is a Defense Readiness Program with $3B authorized for all DOD services to provide a comprehensive process for training, readiness, and product support. The TSM-RP program has been completed with current emphasis on the training of technical personnel at DOD and its services to learn how to perform tests on products that are 3D printed out of metal, and how to identify faults and take action to correct them. The TSM-RPM is now operating within DOD and will be shared with 13 military services in 2019. During the past eight years, DOD has implemented 17 of its own acquisition strategies, including an integrated acquisition ecosystem that is designed to support acquisition activities across the DOD portfolio. This includes both internal DOD efforts, as well as external industry efforts that have been incorporated into the acquisition process. The TSM-RPM has continued its implementation process in 2019 to the two armed services that were not included in the first round. The Navy implemented the program in 2018, and this month, the Marine Corps is implementing it. The Marine Corps is also incorporating the TSM-RPM into their Product Service Line (PSL) program at Marine Corps Logistics Command (Marine Corps Logistics Command at NSW) located in Norfolk, Virginia. CONCLUSION: The most significant factors that have led to this focus on the reliability of weapon systems are: 1) the importance of reliable data communications to weapon system performance, 2) the recent growth in use of 3D printed metal tools and components, and 3) Congress' mandates to focus on product performance, reliability, and other initiatives. In addition to the 2020 Army Modernization Strategy, these objectives provide a means to improve reliability and product availability as part of the Army\u2019s readiness process.", "A 22-point survey showed that more than half of U.S. Army Recruiting Command employees and civilian workers (in the Army Marketing and Advertising Research Center were familiar with the Army\u2019s advertising and marketing program. Two-thirds reported being aware of the Army\u2019s Marketing and Information Operations program, and even fewer reported being familiar with AMRG's main marketing and advertising contractor, AMC Marketing Group, Inc.

Although states can set their own eligibility criteria and process for identification, the federal government sets the minimum age of services, from birth to age 2 and 1/2, and the type of services that must be provided. IDEA allows states to provide a variety of services, but states have some flexibility in their interpretation of IDEA's requirements when determining eligibility, which has caused differing interpretations between states. Although IDEA places a strong emphasis on identifying and locating children for FAPE services, fiscal resources remain a challenge for states that seek to provide these services to all eligible children.

The National Operations Center is designed to better support the Coast Guard as it responds to an increasing range of national emergencies and events, such as terrorist threats or natural disasters. It is also intended to facilitate data sharing and coordination with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. In early January 2015, the Coast Guard\u2019s 24-hours per day, 365-days a year, Operational Services Command (OSC) was established as a Coast Guard expeditionary command. OSC has been specifically tasked to support DHS, DOD, the Department of State and the FBI; provide training and specialized services; and build and maintain interoperable systems with partner military and federal organizations. OSC is comprised of four geographic Coast Guard stations (Coast Guard \"A\" stations): Station Point Comfort, in Augusta, Ga.; Station Cape Race Associates, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada; Cape Canaveral, in Titusville, Fla., and Station Mobile Valdez in Alaska. They are supported by additional Coast Guard commands, such as Commandant, Coast Guard Public Affairs, Central Office of Personnel, and Operational Services Division. Each Coast Guard station is equipped with a National Operations Center, which provides enhanced 24/7 emergency response support. Table 2 identifies ways in which the Coast Guard is well positioned to accomplish the Coast Guard\u2019s priorities, in turn improving service delivery and supporting DHS, other federal agencies, and the Coast Guard. OCS provides Coast Guard and DHS with the following services: Human Capital Management Solutions; Technology Solutions; Interoperability Solutions; and Financial and Procurement Services. Coast Guard OCS facilities serve as an extension of the Coast Guard\u2019s infrastructure, including specialized centers for human capital management and information services, which are critical to maintaining the Coast Guard\u2019s readiness to support DHS, other federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement as part of the Nation\u2019s first responder. Coast Guard OCS also serves as a critical platform for the Coast Guard to provide technical advice and training to DHS, FBI, and military and civilian partners. Table 3 details the Coast Guard\u2019s specific priorities and initiatives, along with the expected results. The Coast Guard\u2019s priorities have been determined based on the federal requirements listed in DHS. To achieve these priorities, DHS has awarded two Coast Guard contracts totaling approximately $1 billion. DHS has agreed to fund 100% of the anticipated cost of personnel in the Coastal Security Operations Center to \"protect\" the ports, rail lines, and waterways. Coast Guard OCS is tasked with providing this security to DHS, other federal agencies, and local law enforcement agencies. Figure 4 identifies the following DHS components as DHS-customized Coast Guard programs. DHS is the primary source of grant funding for the programs, and DHS will continue to support funding for a Coast Guard component. The Coast Guard is in the process of transitioning the National Operations Center to an operational Coast Guard Readiness Center. Table 4 details the geographic locations of the DHS components listed in Table 3: DHS - Coast Guard Readiness Center. DHS - Coast Guard Station Cape Race Associates, Station Point Comfort, Station Mobile Valdez, and station Cape Canaveral, and DOD (Joint Information Service Centers); DHS - Homeland Security Readiness Center in Anchorage, Alaska, DHS - National Cyber Readiness Center in Alexandria, VA, DHS - FEMA National Readiness Center in Washington, DC, DoD (Joint Information Service Centers). DHS\u2019s OCS is a Coast Guard-wide system that includes the DHS-operated Coastal Security Operations Center in Albany, Ga., DHS-operated Coast Guard Emergency Readiness Center in Port Canaveral, Fla., DHS-operated Coast Guard Station Cape Canaveral (Coast Guard Readiness Center) in Port Canaveral, Fla., DHS-operated Coast Guard Station Cape Race Associates in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and DHS-operated Coast Guard Station Point Comfort in Augusta, Ga. DHS is also transitioning the National Operations Center to an operational Coast Guard Readiness Center (OCCRC) with DHS funding, as DHS customizes Coast Guard programs. DHS will continue to support grant funding from DHS, with a planned transition to an operational Coast Guard Readiness Center with DHS funding, as DHS customizes Coast Guard programs that were integrated into DHS-operated Center. DHS established the Coast Guard Division 401(b) Program. DHS reported its intention of consolidating several Coast Guard stations, based on Coast Guard stations that are no longer performing Coast Guard mission. Coast Guard readjusted resources according to DHS priorities, for example to move forward with DHS-funded Coast Guard Readiness Centers and OCCLC transition to an OCSRC. The Coast Guard has agreed to fund approximately 100%", "During the rulemaking process, agencies are generally required to provide a meaningful opportunity for public participation. At a minimum, agencies generally must provide a meaningful opportunity for the public (for example, through Regulations.gov) to comment, either by electronic means or otherwise, and must consider the most significant and most frequent comment and address it to the extent practicable. All agencies are required to include language that indicates the public may submit comments electronically.

So it is said. One of those, more unusual, words can no other definition be found in an FDA document. The word is in the \u201cGlossary\u201d at the end of the FDA\u2019s draft guidance \u201cUse of Terms and Symbols at The End of Paragraph Items in FDA Public Documents.\u201d There can be only one, it says. \u201c[R]elying on dictionary terms, such medical or scientific terms as, for example, `arbor,' `adiposity,' {medicine' and its terms, and `arbor,' `adiposity,' `arbor,' `adiposity,' etc. in FDA scientific documents and other documents,\" paragraph 2 says. It was explained in writing by one of the FDA's scientific coordinators (Dr Peter M. Scofield, PhD): \"The author is Dr. Richard D. Arneson, an anthropologist and medical statistician. He did not originate scientific words but coined their usage.\" He used to be an expert on FDA's drug database system, so when it asked for a definition of RINOS during its development, he got to work. \"I used scientific terms to be an expert on the subject. RINOS is just one of these medical terms that I coined,\" he said. ACORNS was a term used at the meeting he attended. This meeting led the drafting of the guidance document. He said that in order to draft the document, he had to find words that represented what he described as \"arbor\" that are not in the dictionary. \"It was my invention, my invention, but it was in the dictionary,\" he remarked. This new word appeared before the FDA in the 1949 \"Guideline System for Drug Submects Labeling,\" where he says in parenthesis: \"(arbor (arbor); see Figure III for diagram);). \"I wanted to know what the word means,\" Dr. Arneson said. So he turned to the dictionary, looking for possible meaning of the word. The dictionary gave him no meaning. This term was first seen in the \"Guide for Labeling of FDA Regulated Products,\" which he has seen in a copy that is in his lab at the NIH. There is no information on it in the FDA, according to him. He used the term for 18 years, the first time in the 1949 document for Drug Subject Labeling and the first time his name appeared in parentheses. \"So, yes, RINOS came in the 1949 System, which came out in 1949 and this was the first time that word came into the language for FDA,\" he said. He is happy to say that Arneson did an excellent job. When he was told they were going to have to get approval from a regulatory committee, he gave them this definition: \"arbor The tree of the United States whose genus is Arbor, which is a word derived from their own common names... (r)s. [Arbor] means the top of a single tree, at or near the top of a tree, including the root.\" His use of this word did not get his foot in the door with the FDA. This is a term in the glossary that FDA did not include, until 2009. \"FDA, FDA, and FDA came up with their own terms, some of them in the Guideline System, and this was my term. Some people have questioned whether there is a real definition.\" During a meeting with FDA's Dr. Arlen Spillane, she did not have any information on FDA's decision for that term. She was told about it in the 2009 Document FDA will begin using a word to identify the tree species. \"So there's nothing that FDA could do. As many are aware, there are numerous terms in the document that you cannot use like that,\" Dr. Scofield notes. The Guideline System states that the words \"arbor\" and \"arbor\" cannot be used in a medical device context. It appears to have been used less and less from 2004 to 2009. But in 2009, there is", "In the United States, school infrastructure and facilities vary by state, urban and rural location, and a number of school-level variables. Our analysis of a nationally representative survey of 2017\u201318 fiscal year school district level data indicates school systems can prioritize maintenance and replacement or improvement of building systems by using capital reserve funds if available in their district. Many districts also administer facilities condition assessments to identify their school systems' priorities. Most school districts maintain a minimum of six building systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.) and their corresponding major (e.g., roofs, doors) and support systems (e.g., lighting, water lines). There can be varying priorities on where the money goes when capital reserve funds are not sufficient. In terms of key building systems, schools need to understand what to do to keep the HVAC systems working in their buildings to maintain the learning environment of the students. We also heard that a lot of schools are getting older buildings that often have outdated heating and A/C ventilation systems and often have significant other renovation and maintenance work to do. The need for a regular maintenance of school system building systems, infrastructure, and features can vary by individual school districts when school system and district priorities are established. In this case, school districts are also getting older building and systems.\nThe majority of school districts prioritize maintenance and renovation of their heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and the related buildings and facilities, according to a current national survey. However, the survey also suggests building systems and maintenance funding priorities and strategies vary depending on geographic location, urban or rural location, and district-level assets. Most districts also administer facilities condition assessments to rank their building systems' priorities for repair and upgrade.", "CBP is equipped with a comprehensive range of resources to secure the northern border, including radar systems and IT/communications infrastructure that helps facilitate the coordination and execution of mission- critical intelligence and law enforcement operations.", "The FEMA Public Assistance program provides federal funds to states or territories impacted by natural or man-made disasters or emergencies for emergency work, temporary housing, essential services, debris removal, and permanent work including infrastructure, public housing, medical facilities, and water storage facilities, in order to recover more resilient and enhance public self-reliance and independence. The USVI is the first state in the US territory to implement the alternative procedure program under the 2017 hurricanes request. FEMA obligated a total of approximately $ billion for Public Assistance projects in Puerto Rico and USVI as of April 2019. The majority of the funding FEMA obligated and the USVI expended was in emergency and temporary work categories A and B. In contrast, the Public Assistance program allocated approximately $ million for permanent work and infrastructure repair or reconstruction for Puerto Rico, approximately $million for permanent work and infrastructure repair or reconstruction for USVI, and approximately $ billion for Puerto Rico and USVI combined. In addition, FEMA has issued several alternative procedures for Public Assistance grants in the wake of the 2017 hurricanes, in order to increase their efficiency and accountability.

It says that FTA grants up to $50 million in matching funds to communities for fixed-route bus, light rail, and 'transit related infrastructure' projects. According to the American Public Transport Association (), FTA grants up to 50% of a project cost. So, FTA grants are always up to $50 million per year, regardless of the type of project. The report should be rewritten to reflect this information.", "CMS uses the MFP system, where most physicians are paid a fixed fee per episode and clinical coding work is performed by a combination of physicians and a coding team through its processing center. Physicians and providers are able to bill directly to a processing center if they do not have a computer system capable of entering clinical data. For a physician/providers to bill for an LCCP, a key component of the service is a care plan developed with the beneficiary's goals, values, and preferences or if a medication concordance is completed at each encounter. Physicians and practices also provide clinical data to the processing center in the form of LCCP reports. The LCCP report should be in the patient's summary of benefits. The processing center is not authorized to release confidential or personal medical information. The processing center works only on claims submitted by Medicare physicians or their billing practices, which are usually paid direct through the processing center and paid directly from the physician or practice to its physician/claims management system for direct billed claims. LCCP is unique to the CMS in that clinical guidelines, documentation, and case management are included in the service and are paid a flat rate by the processing center, not on the individual claim basis. Providers can choose in which format to submit the clinical reports to Medicare and they will be paid per encounter or per patient as the processing services are provided using a fixed fee format. The LCCP was developed as part of a system in Medicare and the costs are built into the claims processing functions. There is no cost to Medicare for the LCCP. The processing center maintains the clinical reports in electronic format, so it is an electronic record keeping system, as opposed to a paper system. A care coordinator or physician would use the electronic LCCP patient report and data file as a reference to coordinate care of a patient to whom they are assigned. The electronic file is stored outside the claims office and can be accessed at any time to review the patient's data in a manner that is consistent with that data and is helpful in coordinating care. The care coordinator or physician would enter data into the electronic clinical reports as required with the patient data and medication concordance for submission to Medicaid. The reports/transactions/records will be stored with the patient, physician, and/or practice until submitted to Medicaid or to a centralized billing office for reimbursement or payment. Providers may choose to submit any LCCP data reports a week or a month in advance. LCCP supports a physician/claims management system that allows a physician or practice to submit clinical data to the claims processing center, when necessary, instead of providing the same data \"manually\" at each individual patient interaction. This is different from the old claim format used to create and submit LCCP reports. The processing center is not compensated for patient-level encounters. Only physicians and/or their billing practices or other related business partners can complete LCCP reports on behalf of medical practices. The processing center is not required for patient level information. Only LCCP patient-level data and clinical reports are available. The processing center is not compensated on each occurrence, instead a flat fee for each encounter, and any additional costs required by a physician/claims business office or processing business office are outside of the system. There is no requirement for the CMS processing center for authorization to accept records that would normally be subject to an individual patient's HIPAA rights to privacy, including medication information. There may be a charge on an individual patient's direct billed claims. All medications will be subject to physician billing, and will be billed to a patient/patient billing account, which must be in a physician\u2019s name. Physicians must accept a lump sum payment of a fixed fee, and as previously noted, they do not retain interest in the fixed fees on each patient in which they are included. The payment amount each day should reflect the patient\u2019s physician\u2019s time and the amount of direct payments received from the patient by the physician. Clinical data will be a part of a patient\u2019s reports, which is required for all clinical data to make the report complete. This includes the care planning report. LCCIQ does not require a specific timeframes for each report in contrast to CMS. When the healthcare event does not require an LPC to visit the patient, the documentation is not stored or submitted to CMS or Medicaid, and they will not become part of their reports or associated with any of their services. In terms of payment, CMS/Medicaid does not know about a physician\u2019s report submitted to the processing center at the patient\u2019s address. LCCIQ reports will be stored in an electronic database. The type and length of the reports may differ by individual physician or group of physicians with differing requirements. All clinical data will be included in the report and will be stored in an electronic database. The information is sent electronically to the patient\u2019s healthcare system/e-mail account through the processing center. Electronic clinical documents, such as medication management systems, will be used or prescribed for patients who opt", "FTC has enforcement authority over most CRAs for violations of most consumer financial reporting (CFP) laws. Violations of GLBA\u2019s privacy and safeguarding provisions also may result in GLBA-related monetary damage for each consumer whose PII was exposed, making an amount hard to determine. Although FTC staff can use other available mechanisms to receive reports of data breaches and PII violations, there is a case backlog due to the large number of data breaches each year. Moreover, the amount of money consumers can recover may depend on the amount of consumer financial records exposed, the number of consumers whose information was exposed, and the amount of time between the breach and the consumer\u2019s reporting the breach. This information can result in difficulty determining the amount of PII damage that consumers suffered as a result, thus requiring extensive investigation for each violation. However, FTC has been successful in using its enforcement authority to obtain monetary settlement payments for each victimized individual in these cases. This approach is likely to remain in the foreseeable future, at least until the FTC has an administrative enforcement option for the GLBA violations. Nonetheless, an FTC administrator has expressed doubt about the viability of this approach. The FTC enforces compliance with consumer protection laws under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d). CFPA is based on the consumer protection laws of the state in which the company resides or the company\u2019s principal place of business, provided the violation violates these laws. ECOA was enacted to extend the federal prohibition against discrimination in lending until the federal courts in the Second/ Eleventh Circuit courts can provide their opinion on the constitutionality and the scope of ECOA. The Consumer Financial Protection Act (\u201cECOA\u201d) requires banks and financial institutions to report any account balances or history to these institutions. The law also requires providers to report certain errors or mistakes to the consumer, and requires annual reporting of errors for the past 24 months. These consumer reporting requirements can be subject to regulatory actions, a fact which also encourages consumers to report errors or mistakes even after an account is closed or a transfer of funds occurs. Both, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (\"OCC\") and the National Consumer Assistance Network (California, California) are required by the CFPB to cooperate in any litigation with consumers relating in any manner to the complaint's core provisions. Both organizations are required to perform compliance actions, provide resources to complainants, and seek civil penalties if it violates its terms.

In addition, DHS has analyzed vulnerabilities in enterprise networks and voter registration systems that can apply to various assets and stages of the election infrastructure. DHS has identified cyber and physical threats that are applicable to multiple assets at all stages of the election process. DHS has identified vulnerabilities in IT and communication systems that can apply to various assets and stages of the election infrastructure. DHS has identified cyber and physical threats that are applicable to enterprise networks supporting voter registration systems, as well as other assets, that could apply to voter registration systems and ballot systems. DHS has also identified potential security vulnerabilities in email, online communications, and in the information systems supporting an electoral ecosystem. DHS is developing guidance materials that will be posted on the DHS website to help protect election infrastructure vendors and public servants and to reduce security risk. (1) Definition of Physical and Cyber Attacks: Physical Attack: Any act or process that physically damages an asset, which may or may not directly impact an object or a non-human intelligence. An attack can result from a physical device used to access a computer network or an application, but may or may not directly harm the software being accessed. Non-physical attack: Any event or process that does not directly harm a human or an entity but can disrupt an organization or its assets by impacting network or application performance. Cyberattacks on non-human intelligence systems will often involve attacking non-electronic elements of the system to achieve a disruptive effect (e.g. disabling a voting process that has been running on the system). Definition of Cyber Attacks: Cyber attack: Any act or process that is carried out, or can be carried out, at an object. The attack may be carried out on the object itself, in information or non-human intelligence systems that can be harmed via cyber attacks (e.g. malware, intrusion attacks, exploitation of weak passwords), or the object may be required to communicate its functions through communications with other systems. DHS believes cyber attacks are threats to DHS as well as an attack to government, military, or law enforcement personnel. The DHS Threat Categories identify the types of threats that DHS can help defend against or respond to. They are based on the same categories as DHS\u2019s Defense, Intelligence, Counterintelligence, and Information Security Research and Development functions. DHS cyber threats may be carried out by the federal government, the states, local, or foreign adversities. DHS also conducts numerous cyber attacks on foreign adversaries, including foreign government and commercial entities. Additionally, DHS\u2019s cyber intelligence activities inform DHS and its components in the following stages: DHS and its components: DHS conducts the following types of cyber activity in an effort to collect and counter potential cyber threats: threat hunting, cyber intelligence, risk-based vulnerability exploitation, cyber deception operations. DHS can also use its Threat Analysis and Assessment System (TAAS) to detect the possible presence of malicious software on DHS systems (including non-U.S.-based DHS systems) and mitigate DHS-related vulnerability exposures in DHS systems. DHS cyber intelligence is carried out by DHS cyber centers located in different U.S. cities, and DHS cyber programs. DHS collects information and performs a variety of cyber threat, vulnerability assessments, cyber intrusion detection, or cyber deception activities against multiple adversary threats that can be carried out using different methods. DHS focuses on collecting cyber threat activity on DHS systems in order to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats to DHS systems. DHS cyber intelligence activities are carried out using DHS Threat Intelligence Center (THIC) for intelligence collection and threat analysis. DHS Cyber Security team can be reached at THIC@DHS.gov. Additional information about DHS cyber intelligence activities can also be found on DHS\u2019s Website. DHS collects information from its external and non-U.S. partners who provide information, capabilities, and technologies for 24/7 cyber threat response and mitigation efforts. DHS also works with partners, both private and public sectors, through the DHS Cyber and Information Security Awareness Program to improve our nation\u2019s cyber security. DHS uses a variety of tools and cyber intelligence techniques (e.g. collection tools, network data collection, penetration testing, etc.) to support DHS cyber operations, including those that involve personal devices to manage risks. DHS conducts cyber intelligence operations to manage cyber threats in its various systems, as well as through DHS\u2019s Cyber Threat Sharing system. A number of DHS initiatives provide information and resources to the public at <a href=\"http://cyber.gov/\">cyber.gov</a> or through DHS online platforms. DHS cyber awareness activities are carried out using DHS websites (e.g. DHS.gov) through online services, such as the DHS Cyber Portal for additional online learning modules. DHS also has a number of cyber and information security tools for DHS users that are available on DHS\u2019s Website. DHS has developed a number of online educational tools using DHS\u2019s Website to help its users become cyber savvy", "Flood risk management includes more than 71 construction projects that fall within the Corps\u2019 three missions. According to the Corps, the most critical factor in assessing long-term flood risk is the design and construction of floodwalls. Construction is planned or expected to begin in fiscal year 2012 and is projected to begin in fiscal year 2013. Corps Headquarters have completed several feasibility studies with nonfederal sponsors. Each feasibility study consisted of several phases of data collection; modeling of benefits and costs; and evaluation of the potential environmental and socio-economic effects of possible projects that may require Corps construction, maintenance, or operation and maintenance. The Corps reported that 2,892 feasibility studies were completed to date, and 27 of those, including the two studies we examined, are for flood risk management projects. In fiscal year 2012, the Corps constructed 63 flood risk management projects at a cost of approximately $1 billion. The Corps is currently estimating it will perform $2.3 billion in FY2017 on flood risk management projects and approximately $1 billion in FY2019. FEMA has been the recipient of $2 billion of these Corps\u2019 flood projects since the Corps\u2019s inception. The Army Corps of Engineers spends approximately $25 million on projects each year, of which approximately $3 million is spent on flood risk management projects. The Army Corps of Engineers completed 2,892 feasibility studies to date, including 27 that evaluated flood risk management projects. In fiscal year 2012, the Army Corps constructed 63 flood risk management projects at a total cost of approximately $1 billion. The Corps estimates it will construct approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 on flood risk management projects, as well as approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2019.

Of the total amount for grants received in fiscal year 2017, approximately $3.5 billion was allocated to CHCF grantees (up from about $3.1 2010-17: The Federal Health Center Program 1,400 22,500 25,000 $25,000 USD/day $6,000 USD/day $6,000 USD/day $18,000 USD/day $7,000 USD/day $9,000 USD/day $14,000 USD/day $22,000 USD/day $27,000 USD/day $29,000 USD/day $37,000 USD/week $42,000 USD/week $100,000 USD/year/12 month $130,000 USD/year/12 months $130,000 USD/year/12 months $130,000 USD/year/12 months $130,000 USD/year/12 months $80,000 USD $90,000 USD $100,000 USD $100,000 USD $150,000 USD $150,000 USD $200,000 USD $200,000 USD $250,000 USD $350,000 USD $550,000 USD $550,000 USD $1,000,000 USD/day $11,000 USD/week $17,000 USD/week $20,500 USD weekly/day $22,500 USD/week $40,500 USD/week/day. However, this share was down from approximately 38 percent in fiscal year 2010-17. Figure is derived from data reported by HRSA to allow us to evaluate changes in the share of revenue from grants over time. $37 billion in federal funds provided to health centers in fiscal year 2012, including about $4.6 billion for federal grants to health centers, approximately 10 percent of all federal grants to 3,400 grantee health centers. However, HRSA has not yet reported on all of the grant applications to the Federal Health Center Program so we have not yet been able to determine exactly how much this program has grown since our last analysis. It is clear, however, that HRSA has been steadily increasing grants to health centers in recent years as many in the health center field are grateful for this funding source. HRSA has been steadily increasing grants to health centers in recent years as many in the health center field are grateful for this funding source. From fiscal year 2010 through 2017, total funding of approximately $20.4 billion USD was provided to health centers by HRSA, including approximately $3.5 billion alone for grants and approximately $4.2 billion in other appropriations. These funds are in addition to approximately $9.7 billion USD provided to health centers in this period by Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurance. In our analysis, grants to health centers have steadily been increasing\u2014from about $4.2 billion in fiscal year 2010-11 to about $20.4 billion in fiscal year 2017. 3 Health centers for children and adolescents Health centers are part of the Federally-Funded Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These grants are paid to health centers under a state Medicaid match formula that ensures that no state has significantly less funding than another state. Each dollar of Medicaid funding spent on matching CHIP coverage results in states receiving an additional $1-$2 in funding. Although the amounts spent on CHIP vary by state, the number of children and low- income individuals enrolled in these programs each state provides matches 100 percent of the federal funds spent on funding them. Of all health centers\u2014the ones we visited most frequently\u2014are likely to have at least one in its program. In fiscal year 2010-17, HRSA received approximately $3.5 billion in grants to health centers in this period, $4.2 billion in fiscal year 2010-11, and approximately $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2017\u2014though there were grants to each health center, not just the ones we were tracking. In recent years, we note that Congress or state legislatures require that a health center renew its contract to receive new grant funding in order to continue to receive the funding from HRSA that we were able to analyze. 10,000,000 1,600,000 3,400", "Enforcement, pursuant to authority granted by the Act, performs a variety of tasks, including investigations and examinations of various transactions, cases, businesses and persons engaged in commerce or securities business. These duties are performed in numerous locations including regional and central offices. The Commission will publish its Enforcement Annual Report. Among these are statistical data. Enforcement staff described how they calculate and report statistical data. This has resulted in inconsistencies between reported data to the Board regarding the number of enforcement actions performed. These consistencies should be monitored each year before the public reporting is performed. In FY 2019, Enforcement filed 33,636 cases. These cases comprised 37,073 investigations, 27,662 enforcement cases and 30,594 administrative proceedings. This corresponds to 24,000 investigations per year, 10,000 enforcement cases per year (down from the previous fiscal year) and 10,000 adjudicated cases per year. The Division of Enforcement conducted 2,900 examinations in FY 2018. The division also conducted 4,500 administrative proceedings, 3,100 investigations, 2,100 enforcement cases and 2,800 adjudicated cases. In 2019, Enforcement is seeking to establish a new database for the investigation of potential violations of securities law. Additional resources are already being employed to further improve the data and management structure. Enforcement staff are also developing a database for tracking, evaluating performance and outcomes of individual cases.\nA recent publication by the Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Workplace Standards Division found that among 27,000 consumer complaints each year, as many as 90 percent involved a workplace problem related to workplace safety, health care, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. These complaints are made up of approximately 2,000 of occupational safety and health complaints, with 2-to3 percent of these concerns attributedto workplace discrimination. When problems occur in the workplace, both employees and employers can face a number of potential problems, risks and legal issues that are costly and time consuming to resolve. A recent survey conducted by Safety+ Consulting Corporation found that although there has been progress in the past three years, still many organizations are not adequately aware of the potential hazards in their workplaces (i.e. that employees who are not aware of the types of information they are allowed to tell their supervisors about a problem are not likely to be able to resolve the issue). It also pointed out that employees can be reluctant (either voluntarily or legally) to report work-related injuries and illnesses due to fear they will be perceived either as a troublemaker or an imminent fire risk. A number of factors can lead to an employee\u2019s decision to not report, include a lack of worker-specific support, a fear of being judged and stigmatized in the workplace, and not feeling like one\u2019s problem is the important to the organization. According to Safety+ Consulting Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \u201cS+C\u201d), a number of employees in the country\u2019s capital are choosing either not to come to work, or not to come to work on time, or missing time from previous injuries, rather than report or seek medical aid on schedule. About one-third of employees taking their time to get back to work, because the \u201cunusual\u201d illness, injury or injury occurred on the job, are worried that no work leave will be granted, because the boss is less likely to have approved of the leave or because a previous injury will \u201cplay\u201d in the worker\u2019s mind long after he or she is out of the workplace. Another 15 percent of employees who come back to work are concerned about returning work injuries or other injuries that might be incurred on the job. There is a high risk of an employee to work, because the employer\u2019s concern when asked what has been the worker\u2019s experience on that date is that he or she was unable to complete his or her job duties due to the injury. In a majority of cases there is no documentation, no written documentation of the incident or injury, which suggests an organization is missing documentation to be able to make the case in regard to an employee requesting workers\u2019 comp. The \u201cNo Work No Pay\u201d policy that we have is a program we just want to make sure is a policy that is working the way it was intended. There are lots of organizations that do have a No Work No Pay or other types of a wage loss policies on health and wellness benefits, and the like. However, they are still very few that actually have those kinds of programs in place. So, employees who could afford them are more likely to use them. Those less fortunate are more likely to actually submit a claim or a worker\u2019s compensation law. According to S+C research, about half of employees who come back to work will then take up to three days (1-2 weeks) to recover from time spent on the disabled list. Another 14 percent of employees who return to work will suffer some residual pain for a minimum of 6 months or have to be kept off", "In 2017, the M\u00e9rida Initiative shifted its focus to countering TCOs\u2019 illicit activities.

During the two weeks following landfall on September 20, 2017, the hurricane inflicted catastrophic damage on homes, businesses, and infrastructure. In response, FEMA implemented the Public Assistance program in partnership with Puerto Rico, and FEMA established an oversight authority to ensure compliance. FEMA provided $52.3B, the largest single expenditure in FEMA\u2019s history, including Public Assistance grants that totaled $7.1B. According to FEMA officials, all major public infrastructure damages were eligible for Public Assistance funding, including hospitals, public schools, and other essential services that provide critical public services. The central focus of FEMA\u2019s efforts, in conjunction with the government of Puerto Rico, is to reconstruct Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure, which includes restoring power, public transportation systems, housing, and essential government buildings.

This plan provides a schedule for DOD\u2019s efforts in fiscal year 2021, which ranged from at least $116.3 million to $116.8 million. As stated in the summary above, the text of the plan, which is generally addressing most of the elements required under section 921, includes the following general categories: Invoicing and cost management, inventory management, and budgeting. Additionally, other activities which can be generally classified as management or related to maintenance and operations, such as training, health care, support, research and development, are identified. The plan also provides a schedule for implementing the reforms, and a summary table listing the status of accomplishment of DOD\u2019s efforts. The plan generally corresponds with both our findings and recommendations from previous reports. The initiative includes significant steps to implement or clarify many of our recommendations, such as performing a comprehensive review of contractor costs and other indirect cost, implementing cost transparency through improved reports of costs of particular goods and services, and continuing to reform and streamline in-process and other requirements. Additionally, it includes steps to provide detailed information about the number of bills of material that are processed over time for each item on an inventory.

Among three agencies with which we analyzed Title IX compliance, three reported having limited roles for their Title IX offices. While NIH, NASA, and NSF reported having offices focused solely on sexual harassment, only one -DOE - could conduct any such investigations on their campuses - although this unit is now able to do so. Sexual harassment and Title IX compliance requirements in all agencies vary with different structures and roles.

Some researchers have suggested that certain aspects of animal handling and behavior may be similar in a medical and surgical context inasmuch as they are conducted by medical professionals and are usually performed for therapeutic purposes. Nonetheless, because of the intrinsic animal nature of the procedures, and the perceived human and animal similarities, animal care may include procedures such as dental work or treatment of infection. In a number of instances, researchers and institutions are working to reduce the level of animal involvement in research, training, testings, and experimentation, in order to optimize animal welfare at an equivalent level that animal science has traditionally provided in terms of preventing or treating distress, pain, and infection. In general, scientists consider animal species to differ in terms of behavior, susceptibility to the same disease, and reproductive rate. As such, an animal species may be categorized as endangered or extinct, thereby influencing the animal research that can be performed and the cost considerations associated with the animal research. An animal\u2019s susceptibility or \u201cresistance\u201d to disease is also a critical factor for determining the animal that may have the most scientific value in the research, as opposed to determining the animal whose \u201cdisease\u201d has significant potential public health value. The Animal Research Act requires researchers to report adverse outcome data on the animal, which then can be used for scientific review, including animal pain research, the number of animals used, the efficacy of their use, whether an animal in pain has adequate pain or distress management. Animal experimentation may include any type of procedure on the animal\u2019s nervous system which involves the introduction of drugs or surgery. A variety of scientific fields use animals for scientific and therapeutic procedures. For example, microbiologists and pathologist use animal models to understand the effects of bacteria and viruses, respectively. For human disease development, a variety of in vitro studies are conducted using materials obtained from a number of species, e.g., mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, and so on. Many research fields require animal laboratory testing on a large number of species in order to validate new therapeutic concepts. Also, animal tissues and laboratory animals are used to make products available for medical and therapeutic purposes, such as vaccines and drugs. The use of animal species is one of nature\u2019s wonders, a complex organism that, when manipulated and managed, can be the key to a variety of medical, biological, and therapeutic objectives. Advances in medical research, biotechnology, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals have all depended to some degree on animal testing. The study of an animal\u2019s morphology and physiology offers us more valuable information on the properties of humans than does observation of animals in a research laboratory. In fact, many modern medical techniques, such as blood tests and dental procedures, are routinely performed on patient animals in order to understand their functioning and behavior. Medical advances, such as surgical techniques of the heart and pancreas, would not be possible without animal testing. The scientific and technological disciplines that utilize animal-based research have significantly contributed to our understanding of human biology, medical and therapeutic procedures, and drug treatments. More than 99,000 research animals will be used this year at facilities on the NIH campus alone, 5 times more than the figure of 30,000 animals that were recorded about ten years ago. Animal research and its use have also made vital contributions to our understanding of life sciences, from cellular dynamics and genetics to human behavior, motivation, emotions, and learning, and the environment. In addition, the vast majority of therapeutic drugs now are derived from plant or animal species. This discovery offers the potential for saving many lives, through drugs that are 100-120 years old and had been used by humans and animals for centuries. Also, because of the ability of new therapeutic chemicals to inhibit or \u201ctake out\u201d genes, the same substances can be used for other purposes, such as being added to cosmetics, making soap, and so on. The study of genetics can also be helped through animal testing and analysis and DNA, but the same can also be studied in isolation from the physical body and environment as well, e.g., by using models or computers. The NIH\u2019s NIH Revitalization Act directs the Director of NIH to prepare a plan to conduct or support biomedical research \u201cin or, in substantial part on or on land or in or on the water in the area of and in the area under the jurisdiction\u201d of federal agencies for the purpose of scientific, medical or health services research or of the purpose of providing medical, dental, or veterinary treatment of a human. This type of research should not be restricted to laboratory research, nor should it include the type of laboratory animal currently held by federal agencies, which is intended to provide animal resources necessary for the study of a particular species. In addition, other NIH programs such as the Biomedical and Health Information Sciences (BAMIS) and Clinical Research Infrastructure Development (CRID) grants address \u201cthe need for increased animal resources for medical research, which (by", "The International Safety Management Code is a standard to ensure ships and vessels comply with this Code. The Coast Guard has a broad menu of different tools to ensure SMS compliance. The organization is responsible for determining the number of yearly vessel inspections per vessel. Each yearly vessel inspection by Coast Guard marine inspectors is described in terms of material deficiencies. Examples of the specific areas in which Coast Guard inspectors check include the vessel\u2019s structural integrity, fire extinguisher and smoke detector capability, the vessel\u2019s emergency equipment and safety documentation, and the vessel\u2019s compliance with international maritime safety regulations. The Coast Guard considers itself to be responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the U.S. vessels\u2019 SMS, even in the absence of formal inspections. Additionally, Coast Guard boat inspections are conducted on vessels that are currently in use for navigation and vessel safety compliance purposes. Each annual vessel inspection is expected in accordance with the National Vessel Inspection Program. According to official Coast Guard advice, vessel owners and operators have the responsibility to either request the vessel inspection or self-inspect their vessel. Coast Guard marine inspectors can be assigned permanent positions on vessels to enhance the effectiveness of SMS compliance and inspection procedures. The Coast Guard provides these services to other federal, state, and local laws that may be applicable to the U.S. vessels. These include services from other federal agencies, such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Environmental Protection Agency, and services from state and local authorities. The Coast Guard does not establish its inspection program activities under the National Vessel Inspection Program. The National Vessel Inspection Program is a program which has been suspended, in the United States, and that will be phased out. In May 2020, US Coast Guard Secretary Paul D. Zukunft was instructed by Congress to establish a \u201ccomprehensive fleet analysis,\u201d which he has responded to by establishing a new program that will be developed over a 6-year period. According to the Coast Guard, as the National Vessel Inspection Program is phased out, other programs within the office to perform specific tasks of certain sizes and types will increase in size as all the current NVP roles will be eliminated. The National Vessel Inspection Program and the National Vessel Inspections Program have been suspended from March 2014 to December 26, 2021, and the National Vessel Inspection Program has been suspended for the time being. In May 2020, the Coast Guard also established their Emergency Preparedness and Planning division to coordinate emergency preparedness and response coordination efforts with local municipalities, state maritime authority, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when a maritime incident occurs and provides guidance to affected mariner communities on how to respond and prepare for response opportunities. To ensure that U.S. vessels, and those visiting or bound to U.S. ports, are able to comply with the safety and efficiency measures set forth in this standard code, we find it unnecessary and potentially counterproductive to impose vessel-specific requirements. Thus, the Coast Guard adopted a National Vessel Inspection Program and replaced all the NVP functions with additional information and resources to enhance the effectiveness of this safety program. However, in May 2020, Congress told it to start a new program to perform this type of service, but the Coast Guard did not say at what point in the new program that would occur. A Coast Guard spokesperson stated, \u201cWhile there are no immediate plans at this time to resume Coast Guard Vessel Inspection Program, the Coast Guard and DHS have been working to develop a comprehensive, fleet-based national (s)afety program that will help better protect the vessel, the commercial mariners, and the maritime transportation system. In keeping with the National Vessel Safety Act, Coast Guard will continue with a fleetwide program that will require vessels to undergo annual evaluations by the Coast Guard. Coast Guard has worked on this system with DHS and DHS has not yet released it to the public. The Coast Guard stated that its National Vessel Inspection Program is suspended. In May 2020, the Coast Guard set up their emergency preparedness and planning division. In May 2020, representatives from DHS told Congress that DHS will develop a new program on vessel safety that will include all current NVP roles, however at a later date DHS may have to perform all functions and they are working to make that a possibility. In the meantime, DHS will be able to perform all operations that would be performed by NVP. There has been no report on the cost to the government for its role in providing its emergency assistance. Coast Guard provides these services to other federal agencies, such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and more. Coast Guard has agreed to develop a new program to complete the work that DHS does on vessels. The DHS stated it would have to perform all functions, including vessel management, because DHS is not permitted to manage vessels as part of the program. DHS has already developed the National Vessel Safety Program. DHS indicated its program on vessel safety would develop a comprehensive fleet-based national program. While DHS has expressed they", "In 2014, the PMP released its report of findings from a review of Secret Service, which found the agency\u2019s security posture had degraded. With the exception of the three special agents assigned to PPD and VPD and one other agent, agents assigned to PPD and VPD did not report attending their monthly training. In 2018, the PMP found many improvement efforts had been made, including communication among the offices responsible for training. The PMP also cited a figure provided by the Secret Service, which indicated since the report was issued in 2014, the number of agents who had attended training had doubled. Nonetheless, the PMP found, even with a larger proportion of special agents currently trained, the threat to the President and VP remained high. Additionally, during fiscal year 2016\u20132018, no agents had been shot (unless the threat was thwarted and a gun became \u201creal\u201d)\u2014that number is 30 in fiscal year 2018 \u2014the highest figure in 5 years (since fiscal year 2010). Furthermore, from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, the number of agents who reported they had been armed (that is armed by special agents as opposed to firearms in their possession) declined from the mid-point (in fiscal year 2018, approximately 50 percent) to fiscal year 2018 (37 percent) and has been declining since fiscal year 2012 (which was 52 percent). In the same spirit, fewer agents were armed since fiscal year 2018 (36 percent) versus fiscal year 2012 (49 percent). Although the PMP found that training for special agents had markedly improved between fiscal years 2014 and 2018, approximately half of their time (43 percent) was spent on operational support and training. In addition, these agents were less likely to report on the number of hours spent on \u201chigh-level\u201d responsibilities (in the Office of Chief Operating Officer and the Office of the Under Secretary of Public Affairs, which were previously under the Office of the Director of Protective Operations). To help address the lack of hours spent on these types of work, the Secret Service has continued to develop and expand a specialized training for these employees. The PMP also noted that the training for special agents in the Office of Homeland Security Investigations (OHSI), which is responsible for investigations and counterintelligence, was not on track. In the same spirit, the PMP found that despite the training given to special agents and those at OHSI, more than 50 percent of the agents in the field were not regularly updating their skills and knowledge. The PMP\u2019s findings also indicated that agents in these offices who had completed the additional training were not regularly being employed in field offices. In addition, while some agents at OHSI took courses offered through the PMO, most of these courses were never used in a criminal context, and therefore not in the traditional responsibilities of the PM. The PMP, therefore, found that OHSI remained the most serious issue within the 2014\u20132018 review, as nearly one third of agents in OHSI were not regularly trained in criminal investigative skills. Finally, in analyzing the OHSI training needs, the PMP found that in fiscal year 2016 some agents (43 percent) were not completing the required field-agent-specific training. In fiscal years 2018 through 2018, all of the agents in OHSI at the time had a minimum number of training hours, but the number of agents in FY 2018 who had met this requirement was low. The PMP therefore continues to recommend that additional training to be done, such as re-establishing training in the field offices related to operational security as well as training related to the PM and field law enforcement partner organizations. Similarly, agents in OHSI who do not receive field training are unable to become proficient, as they are usually \u201ctoo tired and fatigued\u201d\u2014because of the amount of field work and the large number of cases each agent handles. The PMP therefore found that OHSI continued to need training in criminal investigation skills. To address the lack in training of Agents, Office of Homeland Security Investigations, OHSI, Field Offices, and Office of the Director of Protective Operations, the PMPM will recommend that 50 percent of field agent training and instruction be made a requirement. Finally, while the PMP found that the number of agents assigned to the Office of Intelligence Division was much above 50 percent of special agents, no agents were found to be regularly taking courses provided to them by the PMO on how to update their skills or knowledge. To address these gaps, the PMP recommends, or the Secret Service should consider having a training program in place for the Office of Intelligence Division that allows them to receive the required update training. Each of the offices in this review should periodically undergo its training requirements and the PMP", "In fiscal year 2019, VA spent $47 billion for VHA\u2019s primary mission, $24 billion for community care, and $39.1 billion for general purpose funds, of which $10.5 billion were spent on community care.

Additionally, IHS continues to hire and retain professionals in various positions including medical, dental, and tribal health professionals. \u2022 Indian Affairs, BIE, and BIA have implemented or are implementing strategies to hire and retain skilled front-line employees. This includes a special hiring program and strategies to recruit and retain medical employees. \u2022 The education arm of IHS and BIE has been working to enhance their partnerships with tribal colleges and universities to ensure that students receive access to educational resources and opportunities. Additionally, both organizations continue to work with other federal and local entities to provide educational activities and services. \u2022 EACH agency continues to work hard to address the issues that contributed to problems on the list, and Indian Affairs, BIE, BIA, IHS and other federal entities continue to work on their respective high-risk components to ensure timely removal from this list. \u2022 Met criteria. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is taking actions on each of the five criteria for removal from the list. It is ensuring that each staff member is well versed and proficient at handling high-risk cases. The IHS has also developed multiple new CAPs for improving healthcare and services to Native individuals. As an example of how Indian Affairs, BIE, and BIA are working to address the high-risk areas, we learned that Indian Affairs, BIE, and BIA continue to work on their high-risk areas and are on track to complete and submit CAPs in the near future. In March 2019, the agency presented findings to Congress on its first report of an analysis of its compliance with the Native American Accountability Act, or the Tribal Court Initiative. IHS continues to work on its individual CAPs and plans to implement its tribal health system strategy. Indian Affairs, BIE, and BIA are striving to address significant challenges in retaining and recruiting healthcare staff, although overall staffing goals have been met. Overall, IHS and the Indian Health Service have made significant strides in improving healthcare and providing quality services to Native America since the Tribal Court Initiative in 2006. In April 2019, the agency presented data which showed that in IHS-operated facilities, more than 80 percent of the American Indian and Alaska Native populations had received quality health care services. We continue to learn about the high-risk areas and how the Indian Health Service and other federal agencies are working to rectify them. Our efforts in understanding the unique and different challenges faced by each component of the Indian Health Service are leading to a better understanding of the overall high-risk areas and the actions needed to address them. During this time, the agencies continue to make improvements and take necessary action to address the individual high-risk segments. Our next update in June 2019 will highlight the strides each organization has made, and provide our findings on the most significant areas of progress for them. Since our last report, we have learned that Indian Affairs, BIE, and BIA continue to work on their individual CAPs and their respective tribal health systems system strategy. To address their challenges in retaining and recruiting front-line healthcare staff, the organizations implemented strategies designed to recruit and retain medical professionals. Additionally, the agencies continue to improve and address access to quality healthcare services for Native Americans, whose populations have a high prevalence of preventable health conditions. To assist their efforts in meeting these challenges, the Tribal Court Initiative has been in place since 2006. The program established a collaboration between the Indian Health Service and tribal health systems in which staff from the Indian Health Service can be used in an American Indian and Alaska Native health system. IHS provided services to tribal health centers, mobile clinics serving tribes, and a range of health services. Our next update report on this aspect will provide more information on the challenges and the successes of this program, in addition to outlining the various goals and strategies that the program has evolved since its inception. Currently, IHS continues to meet 19 of its 32 obligations under the Tribal Court Initiative, including providing healthcare staff, nursing services, and laboratory services. The Tribal Court Initiative has served Indian Health Service staff working a range of American Indian and Alaska Native health centers, mobile clinics, and tribal health systems. In March 2019, IHS provided data showing that in its administered tribal health centers, more than 81 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives received quality healthcare services. In April 2019, IHS introduced new", "TEXT: On 07.05.2019, Federal Government Information was sent a copy of the report. In March 2018, OMB issued to several federal agencies an Executive Order No. 13,023 and Memorandum M-01-02 to assist agencies to establish new tools and processes to streamline existing practices. According to OMB, its Memorandum and Order 17-14 instructed agencies across DoD, DHS, and DoE to establish new tools and processes to streamline existing practices, particularly in information security. OMB also reported to Congress in its 2019 fiscal year budget justification that at least two agencies were currently reviewing their processes pertaining to the information systems that the agencies use or control. All three agencies identified several areas where they felt OMB\u2019s Memorandum and Order 17-14 applied: 1) establishing an integrated IT architecture for existing systems; 2) eliminating systems that are no longer in play; 3) moving to a single, cloud-based system; and 4) removing unnecessary steps from processes, such as disabling access controls or enabling a machine. 3", "- Violence experienced by intimate partners occurs in almost all relationships: 63 percent in those that are married; 69 percent of the cohabitation relationships; and 70 percent of households with children. The number of intimate partner violence victims who were injured is one of the most common injuries found by providers. Intimate partner violence injuries are much more common (up to 10 times more common than the general injury population) than many other types of victimizations. - It is estimated that 16 percent of domestic violence victims were injured by the use of some means of torture. This was slightly less than the percentages of women who had suffered a head injury, back injury, or sprains over the preceding months. A little more than two thirds of these injuries occurred on arms, hands (nearly half of whom were injured in a finger), legs, or feet. - Intimate partner violence is more common than violence against peers (63 percent vs. 40 percent); however, peer violence appears to occur less frequently than the victim\u2019s child or adult member. There is a greater likelihood that victims will suffer more severe or frequent injuries as an attacker than an individual who was victimized by peers. - Intimate partner violence victimizations occur more frequently in the home than the workplace, at 25 versus 11 percent, respectively. - It is estimated that 23 percent of domestic violence victims experienced injury due to the use or production, or distribution of drugs. More than half of these injuries occurred in combination with physical violence. - About a fourth of children are injured by intimate partner violence. Some have been injured in a wide variety of ways\u2014head injuries. - A victim\u2019s physical injury, which frequently occurs, may be due to the use of force such as strangulation or suffocation, which are a major cause of in- the United States and found to be common from the 2002-4-year period. - Children are more likely than adults and other victim members to be hit by a gun (13 percent vs. 1.1 percent), stabbed by a knife (11.2 percent vs. 4.2 percent) or injured by bodily force, compared to the U.S. population. Children are also at a greater risk of being struck by car/truck compared to any other means of impact. - Some domestic violence injuries may be fatal, from a head injury or even due to an overdose of drugs, drugs in combination with violence, with other injuries that may be more preventable. Victims may suffer a combination of injuries resulting from their physical harm, as well as injuries to the head, neck, arms, legs, or feet. More than half of the injury deaths in the United States are related to intimate partner violence. Intimate partner violence is one most often occurring crime and a growing concern. According to DHS estimates, the average number of Intimate partner violence cases received annually by the federal courts is about 750,000 and by HHS is about 500,000. More than three times that many Intimate partner violence referrals to state and local authorities by the Hotline occur each yeardata indicates that 1 million women were sexually assaulted in 2013. For 2013 Intimate partner violence victims who were injured are more likely than others to be severely injured and have greater mortality rates than those who suffered less severe injuries. Research shows that the percent of victims with severe physical injuries is roughly double among those with severe head injuries as compared to the rest of their injury population. Many of these victims are injured in a manner reminiscent of those suffering from strokes, a traumatic brain injury or other traumatic injuries. Intimate partner violence victimizations may be common in different types of settings. Victims may be more likely to be injured in their home, at work, or at a location involving a business or in a community park. Victims of rape are more likely than others to suffer injuries in the head, spine, neck, and other areas, whereas victims of physical assault are more likely to suffer injuries in the hands and feet. It is common to be injured in the arms, legs, or feet. A large percentage are injured in different parts of the body that the perpetrators found to be easy to injure. The injuries to the head and neck are more common than injuries to hands, arms, feet, or legs. Most of the victims of intimate violence are more susceptible to injuries to their head, neck, arms, or hands than those who are attacked in physical locations. In addition, violent behavior can easily be seen in a child who was injured, and many injuries to children\u2019s bodies are likely. Children could also be assaulted in an automobile, in the workplace, or in or outside educational settings. Victims of sexual assault are more likely to suffer injuries in the pelvic area, but also the lower legs or feet. Some victims may suffer injuries that can be easily mistaken for other kinds of physical trauma. Intimate partner violence victimizations also occur at work more often than they do", "In order to enlist in the U.S. military during peacetime, foreign nationals legally present in the U.S. must have served honorably in the military for at least three years.

However, DAD is subject to the cash management policy for its Working Capital Funds (WRPC) and Military Equipment (MEL) Fund. In accordance to DOD-AR99-023 (Dew to the Air Force), we note for example that DOD is subject to the annual cash management policy and report requirements for the following cost elements: (1) DOD working capital funds and operating funds, which are required to be 100 percent of the annual disbursements, (2) OHA financial transactions (3) General and administrative expense (not including costs of the Department of Defense, Office of Homeland Security Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS), or DoD components other than DOD Finance Centers), (4) costs associated with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and (5) costs related to operating the military bases.

Medicaid expansion CHIP. States may operate CHIP as an extension of their Medicaid programs. Under Medicaid expansion, states expand income eligibility levels for children beyond those of the state medicaid program. Medicaid expansion CHIP is required to have a written CHIP application process that states must review in order to avoid penalties from the federal government. States must also conduct monthly financial reporting to the federal government and are required to report an annual CHIP plan report to CMS. Medicaid expansion CHIP may be required to have a written CHIP application process. The CHIP application process must be posted online. In addition, CHIP must submit an annual CHIP report on the state\u2019s 50 data elements to the federal government. It generally includes information on the number of CHIP applicants with access to insurance and the number of private health insurance plans a state identifies for each of those enrolled in CHIP. States must provide a comprehensive review of each CHIP case that includes a description of medical conditions and a patient\u2019s ability to pay. Medicaid expansion CHIP may be required to have a written CHIP application process to ensure that applicants are eligible. Additionally, states must report an annual CHIP report to CMS with data on child health status, number of new enrollments in CHIP per enrollee, number of CHIP applicants without ongoing access to medical coverage, and a description of the types of medical services that the CHIP state provides to Medicaid expansion CHIP enrollees.

These explosives are called high-melting plastics. During the manufacturing processes, plutonium or other components might be added if desired. The nuclear weapon\u2019s main battery contains the primary high energy explosive (HMX) and/or the secondary low energy explosive (LEEP) material which is the hydrodynamic material. The chemical composition of these materials is detailed in Appendix D. According to DOE\u2019s Nuclear Weapon Technology Reference Directory, \u201cTatb\u201d is the abbreviation commonly used for TATB. Its chemical form is HMX. TATB was first synthesized in 1888, and DOD has used HMX material in conventional weapons. However, DOD decided to discontinue the use of HMX in certain conventional weapons, which are more expensive to manufacture than TATB. DOD also found it less desirable to use TATB in conventional weapons. The U.S. government has decided not to use TATB in nuclear weapons because the material could be detonated by an attacker in their nuclear facility. TATB might cause an accident, if left out of the weapon. TATB was also discontinued in conventional weapons since its main component HMX would be subject to damage by electromagnetic radiation and heat in the barrel of the gun. The primary components of a nuclear weapon. Photo: David Albee. U.S. Department of Defense, Atomic Demolition of Weapons of Mass Destruction DOD Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) stockpile are a variety of materials that could serve different purposes such as a missile system guidance system or a trigger of a weapon to cause a crash. DOD manages a stockpile consisting of several materials from more conventional weapon systems, including conventional explosive high energy (HE) materials and conventional detonators. The weapon, when loaded into the firearm barrel and detonated will release the explosive materials into the barrel. Figure 1 illustrates that the main components of a nuclear weapon include the explosive material. In a conventional weapon the main component is typically the explosive. For a nuclear weapon, the main components are usually either the explosive material in the weapon barrel (which is detonated) and/or the nuclear material in the nuclear component. In conventional weaponry, the barrel will contain conventional explosive material. The nuclear component materials are explosive compounds. The primary component of the explosive is a high-melting plastic called HMX. Figure 2 illustrates the components and manufacturing processes for the conventional weapons. Several manufacturing techniques are applied at the plant level. The main components of an IHE include HMX, pyrotechnic material, initiators, firing pins, igniter, and casing components. In conventional ammunition manufacturing, raw components are produced at several large-scale sites around the country, such as the ones belonging to major ammunition plants. The manufacturing consists of the mixing of raw materials and formulations, machining the explosives (either by machining them directly or by pressing them into shapes), machining the casing, and pressing the casing and explosives together into a mold. Figure 3 illustrates the manufacturing process of a nuclear weapon. Although an IHE can be derived using many of the same components used to manufacture conventional ordancces, all of them are subject to strict review by the U.S. government. TATB can be used as explosive in non-weaponized nuclear weapons. It is also used in conventional weapons, specifically for propellant. Figure 4 illustrates one example of HMX used in a conventional weapon. Several of these components are either explosive or hold or have an explosive component within them. According to the ODD, since HMX is not suitable for use in conventional-weaponized nuclear weapons, TATB is not used in their manufacture. The ODD also stipulates that the HMX and HMX-containing components should not be used in conventional-weaponized nuclear weapons. Photo: David Albee.

O\u2019Boyle.", "Due to DOD's commitment to resolving significant performance issues in the Joint Acquisition Task Force for Radar, Radar Systems and Navigation Equipment (JTRFF), Congress added (1) GAO assessments in 2016 and 2017 to monitor progress in resolving this critical and wide- spread vulnerability issue and (2) actions that included DOD's participation in a GAO-led, government-wide initiative to address the vulnerability of DOD's supply chain for JTRFF radar system segments. As we have with areas previously removed from the High-Risk List, we will continue to monitor this area to ensure that the improvements we have noted are sustained. Appendix I provides additional information in this high-risk area. DOD also provided progress on three areas previously noted on the High- Risk List that met with actions taken. DOD assessed over 10,000 electronic devices for security vulnerabilities and (1) remediated devices that posed security risks and (2) provided technical and management support to contractors developing and maintaining software. DOD also provided detailed information to GAO about security vulnerabilities in the JTRFF radio frequency communication systems and the impact on users within certain time windows. As GAO described in its 2017 assessment, DOD\u2019s actions were incomplete, and it did not provide sufficient data to show the progress made in a number of areas necessary to demonstrate progress. As we have with areas previously removed from the High- Risk List, we will continue to monitor this area to ensure that the improvements we have noted are sustained. Progress to address high-risk areas in the DOD has been slow. In part, this is due to continued weaknesses in DOD information systems. Specifically, the Department\u2019s inability to identify a number of deficiencies in its networks\u2014 including weak passwords and inadequate information securities controls as detailed in past High-Risk List reports\u2014has been a significant issue. Since 2017, DOD has taken some important steps, including the initiation of a DoD Assessment System (DDAS) for network security and privacy. Still, DOD has been somewhat slow to address the findings from the Assessment. For example, DOD provided GAO with detailed information to show progress made across the various information security control measures, but some items were not properly documented. Specifically, the number, location, and dates of the Information Systems Control $A & B assessments conducted for the DoD Assessment System show that some assessments were not being accurately completed, documented, or properly maintained. DOD has agreed to an ongoing assessment plan with the OIG to ensure the DoD Assessment Program for Information Systems will be conducted appropriately. The Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (G.A. P.) is the largest acquisition system in the world, spanning an immense number of products and services. Even though some of the items in DOD\u2019s original contract could not be procured, it still costs much more to procure than it would if a contract was awarded via the OIG\u2019s Single Award Master Contract (SAM) rather than its original contract. As we have noted in other High- Risk List reports, some key procurement reforms in the Defense Acquisition Streamlining Act allow DOD to acquire certain items significantly more quickly than the Single Contract\u2014Maximum Price (S-CP) and Single Award-Maximum Threshold - Maximum Annual Price (S-AMP) contracts. Some items cannot be procured at all under the \u201cas-if\u201d contract. This approach leads many contractors to bid their work at different rates (such as time-and-materials or cost- plus) causing substantial additional costs to the DOD (more than the OIG\u2019s SAM). According to the Defense Contract Management Human Capital Management (DoD) Human Capital Management (DoD) Information Technology Modernization (Initiatives) report released November 10, 2015, acquisition processes can often go faster, but DOD has a lot of barriers. For example, in the Defense Financial Intelligence Agency\u2019s report, DOD and OIG have identified over 200 potential hurdles (for example, the inability to perform meaningful risk assessments of critical systems and information security systems) in using the Government Accountability Office. More recent OIG reports and GAO investigations show that DOD management information security control deficiencies can cost the Department hundreds of millions of tax dollars. To find ways to reduce these costs, GAO\u2019s In-Depth Assessment of OIG's Management of Information Security Controls (released July 1, 2018) recommended a number of steps for reducing the costs such as (1) moving DOD to a continuous controls approach to reduce audit and sustainment costs, (2) eliminating unnecessary controls such as the DoD's use of single-use devices to conduct risk assessments and (3) using commercial products and reducing hardware and software costs. While many steps are needed to address the management of information security risk controls, DOD has made notable progress", "On 24-1-07, the military commissions and trial of the enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay were ordered by a Supreme Court Judge in relation to the Bush\u2019s Military Commissions Act, a law authorizing a military to conduct unlawful \u2018War Crimes\u2019 to prisoners held in Afghanistan since 2001. The military held a total of 1,268 detainees at Guantanamo Bay on Dec 31, 2006. Since 2006, around 60 detainees are released from each facility every month. The remaining detention center at Guantanamo, where detainees are imprisoned, is known for their extreme conditions. They are kept in the dark underground facility which does not provide daylight, air or temperature control to the detainees for the purposes of a humane treatment. According to a report provided to the United States Commission for the International Security Assistance Program in May 2008, detainees at Guantanamo Bay, in addition to being deprived of food, water, sun lights or air, also were locked in these underground cells without access to sunlight or air without an adequate amount of water to drink. The report also revealed that detainees were sometimes forced to share space with a number of detainees in cages that were cramped and crowded, with inadequate amounts of space to sit or walk, leading to back pain and other physical ailments. A doctor from Columbia University had described the conditions there as \u201cindefensible\u201d. The International Secretary of Amnesty International had also visited Guantanamo Bay and had found the conditions there not only inhuman, but cruel, even for prisoners convicted of crimes. There had been more than 1500 deaths in their underground prison since 2001. It has been reported that 30 detainees have been killed in the past 10 years, and that the majority of prisoners have either been released without charges or charges for \u2018illegal acts\u2019. In spite of the fact that there are three different types of detainees (enemy combatants, al Qaeda operatives, and those arrested on suspicion of connection charges with the main terrorist organizations), the Supreme Court ordered on 20th Jan the release of all enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay that are a threat to national security. They would be kept under military law for one year, and then transferred BACK to a prison in the United States. The US government also established a prison in Afghanistan (now known as the Afghan Detention Camp), which will house the military prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. In Afghanistan, the detainees would be held, initially, and later in a prison within the United States. 4 4 5-06-07 DOD military commissions and trial of enemy combatants ORDER 5 11/30/07: BUSH WAR IN IRAQ & DOD WAR IN AFGHANISTAN U.S. Supreme Court Orders Trial of Enemy Combatants 9/11 attacks on US soil Widespread U.S. military operations in Afghanistan & Iraq 9/11 attacks on US soil CONCLUSIONS: CONSECURING WITH THE PRINCIPAL DUTY TO UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS U.S. Commission for International Security Assistance Programs Report to the Senate Armed Services Committee DOD Secretary Gates on Guantanamo Bay DOD Secretary Gates at Guantanamo Bay DOD Director Haines on detainees at Guantanamo Bay Afghanistan Military Detainees 5 6 Military Commissions Trial of Enemy Combatants U.S. Supreme Court Judge Leon in Guantanamo Bay DOD Secretary Gates on detainees at Guantanamo Bay DOD Director Haines on detainees at Guantanamo Bay OMC\u2019s Trial DOD Military Commission\u2019s Defense Attorney Michael Bock on victims of Guantanamo Bay DOD Secretary Gates on detainees at Guantanamo Bay In the military, you are innocent until proven guilty.

FDA\u2019s goal is to complete the review of FDA\u2019s Priority Review or Standard Review of a drug application within 10 months as well. There are 3 types of PRV programs, and the one set to expire in September 2022 includes the treatment of medically countermeasure-eligible diseases. While the number of new drugs in development has tripled between 1985 and 2005 and the number of drugs undergoing standard review has doubled from 2006 through 2018, there are significant gaps in this number. The FDA currently processes about 8,000 standard applications per year, yet there are between 100,000 and 2 million new drug application submissions at FDA every year. In most cases, the FDA requires drug sponsors to pay a user fee and provide additional product-specific user fees. These user fees are designed to help fund FDA\u2019s user fee budget, FDA $1trillion of user fees by 2023. By the end of FY2023, FDA\u2019s revenue could be sustained with three user fees, and two of these user fees, $1.3 billion and $5 billion respectively, are slated to expire within that same period.\nThe total of product-specific user fees for all drugs has risen from $2 billion in FY1987 to $15.3 billion in FY2020, according to data FDA provided to the HHS Committee in order to receive the information to be included in a report. The FDA is seeking this large amount of user fees every year. Over the past 20 years, FDA\u2019s fees have climbed from $7.5 billion to $15.3 billion. FDA has also been requesting Congress to change the user fees and allow them to charge this money from consumers for a period of 6 years. The current law requires the FDA to use a portion of collected user fees to be used for quality assurance for small businesses. However, there are few regulations in place to ensure the success of FDA\u2019s user fees and the quality of the services FDA offers the drug sponsorship programs. The FDA can charge up to 20 percent of a drug\u2019s retail value. For small businesses, that could amount to an annual payment of $10 million, according to a study commissioned by the FDA. These user fees are used to fund the small business program (SBP) introduced in FDA Modernization. By the end of FY 2023, FDA will be able to charge up to $200,000 from individual businesses for both a single transaction and a series of transactions between the drug and the drug manufacturer. The HHS Committee report has detailed concerns about how these user fees have been administered and used. Although SBP has received FDA\u2019s attention, the Office of Inspector General is reviewing whether the program has been helping small businesses.", "Medicaid is a complex program that finances a variety of health and social services to individuals and groups. While CMS has substantial guidance to states on the accuracy of Medicaid eligibility determinations, CMS is not implementing some key areas of CMS guidance. For example, CMS has not yet implemented CMS\u2019 updated FMAP calculation that would reduce over-reimbursements for federal Medicaid funds for Medicaid expansion enrollees. States are responsible for determining eligibility before children are eligible for Medicaid, unless the state provides coverage for a short-term medical condition. However, while there are federal guidelines for Medicaid eligibility, they do not account fully for all the nuances of state eligibility systems. For example, we found that several states have different eligibility criteria than the federal guidelines for Medicaid coverage. There were also cases where federal guidelines did not account for some of the state provisions that could result in eligible individuals remaining uninsured while receiving federal funds to cover the cost of private care. Although CMS provides guidance on how to audit Medicaid expenditures, these requirements have not led to implementation of a system to track expenditures that have been reviewed. For example, CMS had been tracking the Medicaid eligibility determination and enrollment applications process, but CMS closed the tracking system in August 2018 without fully implementing its guidelines. In September 2016, we found weaknesses in Medicaid eligibility determination and enrollment processes. Medicaid eligibility determinations, particularly the ones conducted by state Medicaid agencies, are critical for ensuring that states\u2019 enrollment numbers, federal funds, and state expenditures are appropriately matched. However, an insufficient national system in place to determine eligibility makes it difficult for states to ensure that these critical processes are implemented correctly. For example, we conducted a review audit to determine how CMS reviews state eligibility determinations and found that the states were not systematically performing their verification steps. A significant difference in these practices was identified between Medicaid expansion enrollees, where 75 percent were systematically processed compared to an average of 38 percent for all clients. Moreover, without full implementation of these recommendations, CMS is not monitoring how states verify eligibility. With respect to Medicaid eligibility expansions, the federal government requires states to perform an income verification based on individual tax returns, and federal guidelines stipulate that Medicaid beneficiaries should report income that falls within the limit of 100% of federal poverty guidelines per year. However, in September 2016 we found that not all recipients were enrolled in the Medicaid program, despite federal guidelines and enrollment eligibility requirements. Moreover, CMS required states to perform income tests, yet at least one in five states did not require Medicaid clients to provide income information. In September 2018, we reviewed the Medicaid eligibility processes and found weaknesses in how it reviews eligibility determination and enrollment applications, and we also recommended the implementation of guidelines for verifying eligibility in order to coordinate systems.

FINDINGS SUMMARY Table: FACT: At least one in three Medicaid expansion enrollees\u2014as large as 22% in New Hampshire\u2014do provide their eligibility to Medicaid, as defined by the state. The Medicaid program accounts for roughly 1.3% of the overall U.S. population and approximately 3.1% of all households. The number of Medicaid dollars spent at the state level for all of 2019 is more than $5.1 billion. \u2022 Although CMS guidelines allow states to determine eligibility and enroll individuals in Medicaid, the majority of Medicaid eligibility determinations are performed during the screening process and are not uniformly applied due to the variation in state eligibility systems. \u2022 FMI\u2019s review of how states performed eligibility checks on Medicaid expansion enrollees\u2014based on CMS reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although CMS is notifying its clients about an increased risk of fraud by their clients, states have been provided with information to identify the type of benefit that might be associated with an individual enrolled in the Medicaid program. \u2022 It is unclear how CMS will implement a new Medicaid quality payment incentive program established under the Affordable Care Act. The initial payment rates are determined in the same manner as the original payment amounts. Although federal guidelines allow a range in FMAP rates, Medicaid FMAP rates have been fixed at 24 throughout FY 2018. \u2022 The number of eligible individuals who are enrolled in the Medicaid program is not clear as CMS does not provide guidance for how states determine eligibility with respect to Medicaid expansion enrollees. CMS reports quarterly Medicaid payment rates to help enable states to determine their federal payments. This data collection effort will help the majority of states that perform at least a partial state match. The accuracy of state eligibility determination and payment calculations was an ongoing concern. \u2022 Of the more than $3.7 billion in state payments for FMAP in FY 2018, $3.8 billion was related", "VA reports increases in utilization and spending for EHCPMs 5-10 years 2036, with an overall growth of 34 percent from fiscal years 2012-2018. We also found that VA is projected to increase spending over 75 percent from 2016 to 2036, while VA\u2019s utilization rate (the proportion of expenditure) will decrease 60 percent from 2016. While GEC has taken steps to meet the increasing demand for these services, GEC officials acknowledge challenges such as workforce shortages and geographic alignment. The Veterans Health Care Management (VG) Program is a new care plan that aims to provide veterans with more options for care and improve care coordination. It is currently in a pilot phase. The program utilizes a model that relies on primary providers and a case manager to work with each veteran to develop a care plan that is tailored to their own needs. VVB is one of eight new care programs established in 2016 under VA's Community Care program. It is designed for veterans who have a non-VA component to their care. In 2017, VVB added 25 percent more veteran slots to the program, allowing VA to provide more than 300,000 veterans with a VA provider. In January 2020, VA announced that Veterans Health Care Management (VHCB) is expanding the number of primary providers it offers to veterans from 11,000 to 20,000 providers. The expansion is designed to expand access to primary care, increase VA efficiency, and improve the veteran's experience. VA is also implementing two additional expansions of VVB's slots for veterans to meet the demand created by the influx of new VVB providers. VA announced expansions of the VVB pilot in July 2020 at the 2020 National Conference on Employee Benefits to add a further 80,000 veterans to the program. The expansion is designed to increase access to care in the community, better coordinate care, and help veterans obtain necessary treatment in a timelier manner. VA is implementing these expansions, including expansions into the Department of Defense's health care system, to meet the demand of over 900,000 veterans under the VVB program. Additional VA Care Programs VA is responsible for providing long-term care in partnership with a variety of entities, including the Veterans Health Care Management Program of the Community Care program. One additional long-term care program for veterans is the Veterans Health Care Assistance Program, which is designed to help veterans purchase private long-term care policies. VA has not reported its average costs associated with this program. The Veterans Access to Care Act authorized a new type of health care plan for those veterans who do not live near VA medical facilities to provide a more flexible, modern, patient-centered system, where veterans can access primary care outside of the VA system. These outpatient health centers, which are not yet fully operational, will be developed by private/public/ non-profit organizations or academic institutions who are awarded contracts by VA to develop, maintain, and manage certain aspects of the outpatient centers and a network of primary care physicians. The goal is to enhance and improve access and access to care for veterans with disabilities, by providing community-based medical and social services. If a veteran with a disability and a severe medical condition has health needs that are not met within the veterans\u2019 access to care system, a veteran in need of the care can apply through an existing non-VA care network to receive care. The Department of Veterans Affairs has contracted a private entity to administer this new care model. This contract was awarded to a veteran\u2019s organization, and veterans will access medical care and social care from one entity. The program will enable vets to get primary care medical, dental and vision care that will be overseen in a single platform/system. This new program has a goal to improve access and assistance to vets with disabilities or disabilities and injuries that could be managed using telehealth services in a more streamlined manner. - VA's community-based care model could be a model for the rest of the country. Veterans and their families can call 1-800-883-7667 toll-free on their cell phones. VA's current call center service model that includes access to primary and specialty care and assistance with prescription copays. [This table can ] also be found in the report (see Appendix D). For veterans with service-connected-disability pensions, income and resource screening may be required as part of eligibility requirements in order to get care. If not for veterans, VA has been making efforts to find ways to do this but has so far encountered barriers. VA has used the Comprehensive Care Plan (CCP) in various tests to determine eligibility requirements and has made adjustments in its protocols for eligibility screening. A new type of insurance model for veterans with disabilities was announced in 2017. The Veterans Health and Mental-Health Care Act of 2018 (HJR 1) requires VA to provide", "40 percent of IHS patients reported they had Medicaid medical coverage to nearly 100 percent of patients at some point during fiscal year 2018. These 100 percent increase occurred in 16 facilities among 25 IHS facilities from fiscal year 2015 through 2019. 32 facilities (52%) were able to obtain Medicaid coverage for eligible enrollees as of September 2018. Medicaid coverage increased an average of 14 percent per year over fiscal years 2013 through 2018. Although most federally operated IHS facilities reported at least 10 percent of patients reporting health insurance coverage in 2018 (the lowest percentage of any IHS facility), the 100 percent increase occurred in 16 facilities among 25 IHS facilities from fiscal year 2015 through 2019. 17 facilities (33%) reported no health coverage information in fiscal year 2018, and less than 10 percent of patients reported Medicaid in fiscal year 2019. Data for non-Medicaid coverage (including 100 percent of patients at some point in fiscal year 2018) indicates significant variation between facilities. While only 7 facilities reported having health insurance in 2018, Medicaid coverage for patients at some point in fiscal year 2018 doubled to 33 percent at fiscal year 2019. By comparison, 29 facilities reported having Medicaid coverage in fiscal year 2018, with 12 facilities reporting at some point in that year. Medicaid/Medicaid coverage declined at all facilities from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 and ranged from 7 percent to 14 percent of patients reporting coverage in fiscal year 2019. A total of 25 IHS facilities reported at least 10 percent of patients having health insurance coverage in fiscal year 2018, with 10 facilities reporting at some point in that year; in fiscal year 2019, 19 facilities reported at least 50 percent of patients having health insurance coverage. In our analysis of IHS data between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2019, we examined the number of federally operated IHS facilities administering Medicaid from fiscal year 2013 through 2018 and compared that to the number of IHS facilities administering private health insurance in 2013 through 2018. In the case of Medicaid, from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018, the number actually declined by an average of 6 percentage points, while the percentage of IHS facilities administering Medicaid decreased 45 percent. However, from fiscal year 2018 through 2019 the data indicates that the population of Medicaid-enrolled IHS benefits continued to steadily increase with a larger percentage of patients (up from 33 percent in fiscal year 2018) now with health insurance coverage. As of November 2019, 44 percent of IHS facilities administering Medicaid reported at least 50 percent of their patients receiving some form of health insurance in the fiscal year. A total of 48 IHS facilities were actively assisting patients to be enrolled in Medicaid health plans in fiscal year 2018, with 25 additional facilities adding data on some IHS facilities\u2019 Medicaid activities later in the fiscal year. This data indicates that in fiscal year 2018, 55 percent of IHS facilities administering Medicaid were actively assisting patients to enroll in Medicaid health plans. During fiscal year 2019, all of the IHS facilities administering Medicaid in fiscal year 2016 were actively assisting patients to enroll in Medicaid health plans. These facilities, which are the largest of the IHS facilities reporting Medicaid numbers in fiscal year 2018 or 2019, accounted for approximately 67 percent of facilities reporting Medicaid numbers among all IHS facilities in fiscal year 2018 or 19 in fiscal year 2019. IHS facilities reporting a decline in Medicaid numbers from 2012 to 2018 actually reported an overall increase in their patient numbers from 2012 to 2018 and from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. The data indicates that across all IHS facilities, from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2018, the number of IHS facilities that reported Medicaid numbering (i.e., actual patient numbers) increased an average of 6.3 percentage points, while (b) IHS facilities administering Medicaid in fiscal year 2018 actually decreased from fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, 27 facilities in total reported patient numbers at some point during the fiscal year. The 12 facilities that reported Medicaid patient numbers are the largest IHS facilities nationwide reporting numbers, accounting for approximately 40 percent of patient numbers reported by all IHS facilities, reporting patient numbers in fiscal year 2016. By comparison, and taking into consideration our estimate that 25 percent of all IHS patients actually receive Medicaid, those facilities with more than 75 percent of patients actually receiving Medicaid reported numbers of patients receiving Medicaid similar to the number of IHS patients receiving Medicaid in fiscal year", "In 2018, Executive Order 13834 replaced 2015 Executive Order 13693. EO 13834 directed federal agencies to implement practices to divert from landfill food waste. EO 13834 was replaced by a new executive Order 13834, directing federal agencies to implement waste prevention and recycling measures but no longer directed waste conversion practices. Exempted under the FLW Act, the USDA can continue to provide guidance for farmers through programs aimed at (a) reducing food waste from farmland products and (b) reducing the incidence of food waste among consumers by increasing awareness of the role consumers play in FLW.", "The benefits offered to veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill range from education, to tuition and fees, and GI Bill benefits from attending public and for-profit schools.

Since 2018, VA has sought to eliminate this process in the Medical Care Program, using \u201cdirect acquisition\u201d techniques. In this review of VA\u2019s FSS and MSPV-NG programs, we identified 15 areas that we evaluated as either being improved or in need of improvement. These included 3,400 medical items being available for purchase, the 100,000 medical supply and equipment items in the IFFs, the 4,000 vendors in VA\u2019s FSS and MSPV-NG programs, and significant variances in contract scope and pricing (up to 40% in some areas). In addition, we also examined VHA\u2019s overall programmatic performance, including VA\u2019s internal processes for evaluating and awarding contractor performance, and found that, in many cases, there are room for improvement. Overall, VA\u2019s FSS and MSPV-NG programs are critical elements of VA\u2019s healthcare network. The programs offer substantial benefits to VA \u2013 and the Veterans it serves \u2013 in terms of value and price, which must be preserved. In our review, we identified three overarching issues: inconsistent performance, which can be improved by centralized processes for contractor performance evaluation and quality assurance; issues with contract monitoring for contractor performance; and potential challenges associated with contracting out in place services, such as the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program.

The technology has been tested by numerous manufacturers and on countless vehicles. In 2011, NHTSA tested the 2 million vehicles in its fleet for compliance to FMVSS without incident. Since inception of the program, NHTSA has tested more than 8.5 million vehicles. Although NHTSA has used FMVSS test procedures, including bumper requirements, the standard does not currently include a test for pedestrian safety. With the exception of the FMVSS, there is no federal law in this country that specifically regulates pedestrian safety features or pedestrian crashes. The laws and regulations NHTSA administers are meant to protect consumers from the results of poor designs and the damage it can cause them and their families. Therefore, as currently defined by NHTSA, its vehicles are limited by that organization to only provide general information to the public concerning their pedestrian safety performance. See diagram page 16. A. Data-based information from vehicle and/or pedestrian crashes or crashes involving pedestrians, including in-depth analysis of the factors involved in each crash. See diagram 3.1 and 3.2. 1 + 1\u00b3 = 1,000,000 2 NHTSA was required to administer a \u201cpedestrian-crashes database\u201d under the Motor Vehicle Information and Safety Act. These data, collected beginning in 2019, were collected to provide the NHTSA information on pedestrian crashes and deaths involved in automobile crashes. Pedestrian crashes involving crashes between pedestrians and motor vehicles were determined by examining crashes that occurred on pedestrian areas and pedestrian sidewalks, as opposed to crashes that occurred between vehicles and on or near a roadway. The dataset of crashes between pedestrians and motor vehicles from NHTSA can be used in the same way that other datasets can be evaluated. The dataset can be used to analyze pedestrian crashes, such as pedestrian crashes at non-intersection points on roadways, pedestrian crashes during the day versus at night, and the time of day or evening when these crashes occur. Pedestrian crashes involving pedestrian versus motor vehicles are determined by examining crashes that occurred between pedestrians and an object within the roadway that was larger than a pedestrian to crashes that occurred between pedestrians and an automobile. Also, NHTSA\u2019s data on pedestrian crashes can be used to validate pedestrian information and information from victims. Pedestrian crashes involving pedestrians and motor vehicles were further analyzed using the Crash Injury Counts and Analysis System (CICAS), which is a database of pedestrian crashes that is available to the public. B. Methods to gather pedestrian victim injury and death data, including surveys of pedestrian victims. Pedestrian victims are generally defined as being 18 years at or over in age at the time of the crash. According to the Department of Transportation, from 2007\u201312, there were 1,100 (11,000) pedestrian deaths per year. Pedestrians killed in intersection crashes were about 28 percent more likely to receive a injury than pedestrians who were at fault in the crash. NHTSA analyzed this dataset to develop pedestrian crash analysis tools to identify and provide information for crashes involving pedestrians in general. These tools are available on the NHTSA website, which can be accessed on its website at the link provided in Figure 3.1 of this report \u201cPedestrian Crash Analysis Tools and Research Tools\u201d. Pedestrian Crash Analysis Tools and Research Tools 10 PEDESTRIAN CRASH ANALYSIS/IDENTIFICATION TOOLS A. Pedestrian Crash Data The NHTSA Crash Data Analysis system will allow users to view data from crashes occurring between March 2018 and February of 2018. These data can be analyzed according to crash types, age groups and several additional data fields defined below. At present, crash data relating to pedestrians and crashes involving pedestrians and children in pedestrian crashes is not publicly available. Pedestrian crash data can be used to identify trends such as pedestrian crashes occurring on weekends versus weekdays, the time of day that pedestrian 2 + 1\u00b3=1? collisions occur, and the differences in pedestrian and motor vehicle crashes based on crashes occurring in intersections versus crashes that were non-intersection crashes. Pedestrian crash data can also be used for mapping pedestrian crashes that occurred in different year-to-year categories. B. Pedestrian Crash Evaluation Methodologies The NHTSA team also developed new methodologies to identify potential pedestrian crashes. Methods include using crash scenarios developed by U.S. auto makers and by vehicle manufacturers, applying crash data analytics tools in the development of pedestrian crash evaluation methods, and crash testing (including pedestrian crashes) using new technology, as well as the data collected from pedestrian crash analysis tools.

The new behavioral indicators were developed by combining older indicators and adding new indicators. TSA updated policy and procedure manuals to reflect the new approach. AOM conducted a comprehensive review of these changes and the current approach to provide additional information on the process. TSA issued an Aviation Security Standards Update and related guidance. The security guidelines were implemented into TSA policy. TSA also announced it would revise its screening procedures for travelers under 6 years old. TSA began implementing its new approach in early 2018 and continued through fiscal year 2019. For fiscal years 2018 and 2019, TSA reported increases in the number of \"red dots\" issued by passengers, which TSA described as potentially unsafe behavior. TSA also began applying new screening procedures for travelers under 6 years old, including the use of new body scanners, and an increase in canine searches. The new policies for passengers under 6 years old are being implemented and will go into effect on January 1, 2021.

In 2010, the Bureau counts populations using the concepts of usual residence and residence criteria. In 2020, populations are counted in distinct categories ranging from people on Census Day, residents of nursing facilities, members of U.S. Military and civilian employees deployed abroad, and more. When counting these populations, the Bureau has made changes and updates to the current criteria and guidance to adapt to new circumstances and changes in the Census. This includes adding new methods for counting populations, as well as adjusting how the Census addresses complex populations and their changing characteristics. The Bureau also updates its guidance on how to include in its counts people living in group quarters, including those associated with residential facilities. By changing how it calculates and includes these populations, the Bureau hopes to improve accuracy and reduce error in the 2020 Census. This process includes defining criteria and boundaries for geographic populations and clarifying certain populations that may be complex. The Census counts are intended to be consistent for each Census year, although it is still important for each household to report its members on each Census to the Bureau, even in years the Census does not count a particular resident. The Bureau collects Census data on births, population characteristics, and many other demographic variables. Census data become an extremely valuable resource to states, which use them in conjunction with data from other sources to better understand their communities and how their communities live. | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ To summarize, the Bureau collects Census data on complex Census populations on every Census Day from the people on the Census form or from administrative population tables in their databases.

Challenges in implementation have to date been related to inadequate coordination between interagency entities, inefficiencies in how agencies detect and respond to biological threats, and lack of adequate communication across the entire national defense mechanism. To address these challenges, the strategy called for increased coordination and cooperation between agencies and also recommended the development of a National Biosecurity Strategy. The strategy and NSPM-14 outline a requirement for participating agencies to utilize threat information across domains to inform cross-domain decisions. A new effort entitled \u201cStrategic Threat Focus Group\u201d (STFG) was introduced within DHS, and a new strategy called the \u201cNational Strategy for Integrated Deterrence\u201d (NSID) was formed. Since its publication, DHS has taken additional steps to streamline information sharing with agencies, clarify existing communication channels, and introduce a Unified Command Capability (UCC) structure. DHS has also taken steps to address challenges across the entire biodefense enterprise by expanding its intelligence capabilities. In April 2018, DHS announced the NSPM-14 and the threat database platform it was developed. The report will be updated periodically to address how the strategy is implemented. However, the specific application of NSPM-14 has not yet reached a critical mass, and DHS still faces challenges in the adoption of an end-to-end approach that can be used to quickly integrate information across agencies. The strategy and NSPM-15 do not fully address these challenges. The strategy and NSPM-16 also do not fully address the potential challenges in integrating threat and detection information across agencies that exist when organizations are not part of a joint intelligence program. The DHS report should be incorporated in future strategic guidance documents that DHS should consider in an update of its strategy. In addition, DHS remains the key agency to which state and local law enforcement agencies should defer for intelligence, especially for tactical intelligence, that it is better suited to meet the needs of these agencies than the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). DHS still does not have enough human resources to effectively produce threat reports, especially for new threat reporting. DHS still has a need to increase the number of federal and private information sharing and intelligence partnerships. DHS also needs additional strategies that could allow DHS to leverage information collected from a broad range of sources such as foreign intelligence, state intelligence, and nonmilitary intelligence. DHS will need resources to keep up with the evolving threat. DHS\u2019s ability to create a unified threat detection and response strategy has been a challenge in the past, and it will likely remain so in the future. DHS\u2019s threat database platform announcement will likely be rolled out with a public beta version later this year. DHS still needs to resolve some of the data management challenges it faces that involve both internal DHS and external government databases. The DHS report does not recognize this challenge. With increased access and integration of a wide range of sources, DHS could develop a more effective and efficient approach to detecting and responding to biological threats. DHS\u2019s new strategy and NSPM-22, released in July 2018, has several additional components that are well implemented across DHS, but DHS still faces challenges in translating this data to other departments to use in decision-making. DHS has begun its efforts to streamline information sharing across agencies. DHS also has work underway with DHS to expand their ability to detect and provide early warning of biological threats. DHS is working with DHS to implement some of the 2014 National Biosurveillance Plan objectives, including development of a risk-based process to manage the risk of human and material security. We will continue to track DHS\u2019s implementation of these efforts and its willingness to collaborate internally and externally to ensure biological threat detection. DHS is also working to improve data sharing among agencies to use data more efficiently and effectively among various levels of government. DHS is currently working with FEMA, FEMA Regional Response Information Center partners, and FEMA to develop additional ways to utilize information sharing technologies. DHS is also evaluating the risk of cybersecurity threats in its data centers. DHS continues to work with DHS to implement their new strategy. DHS is expanding its analytic capabilities to better detect and respond to biological and physical emergencies in response to a variety of events. DHS is moving forward with efforts to improve data sharing across agencies with greater efficiency and automation. DHS efforts will continue in this area to build on its existing efforts to integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., DHS/FEMA region-specific resources, DHS/FBI/NCOIC, DHS/FBI/HSI). DHS also has been working with multiple agencies, along with DHS, including USDA and the Department of Army and has established a number of new ways to share intelligence. DHS is taking various actions to help DHS remain a key player when responding to or mitigating biological threats. DHS also is actively considering ways to leverage their", "The Navy's Columbia Class design faces high schedule and cost growth due to the need to design, research, and build a submarine more than a century old. A large detail design is required, and the program has substantial overhead. At present, the Navy has contracted to the shipyards two shipbuilding program codes, totaling $7 million in obligations to date. These codes, CPP10C and CPP10X contain 30 activity descriptions, totaling over 8,000 sentences, which overlap with the 17,000 sentences in the Navy's ship description. For several of the shipyard codes, Navy officials state that they do not have reliable cost estimates (Naval Sea Systems Command [NAVSEA]; and the shipyard contractors). The total cost of program [TCP] has to date been over $11 billion dollars (about $7 million per ship), and it has exceeded the Navy's initial cost target of $8 billion dollars set in 2009. As of June 2018, the Navy reports that Columbia class submarine manufacturing cost growth ranges from 19 to 23 percent. The Navy has established a cost cap of roughly $5 billion dollars, but since the program's start in 1999, the cost cap has exceeded $5 billion dollars due to inflation adjustment. The Navy's Office of Cost Analysis and Evaluation also found discrepancies between Navy cost estimates and shipyard actuals. To assist the Navy in identifying the impact of certain submarine costs on the total cost of the program, GAO conducted a performance and cost analysis, which also examined the Navy's strategic goal to maintain the technological competitive edge by maintaining submarine design capabilities. Our review of the cost estimates available at present for programs that were not under a binding-resolution program (BRP) has included analysis of cost estimates available for only one shipyard for the Virginia class program (Navy Yard Norfolk), while the Navy had available Navy-wide data for the Columbia class (including a Navy wide dataset for the Columbia class program code CPP20000). Unlike the Virginia class program, the Navy estimates their cost for the Columbia class based on a unit cost, which is the cost per cubic yard of the shipyard for each inch of the ship. There has been little discussion of a potential cost cap. If the Navy does not set a realistic cost cap, the program could have cost growth that is not well managed; thus, causing cost growth that can continue long past the end of each construction year. The Navy's Strategic Planning and Programs Office (S&P) provided analysis to GAO on the program design, ship specifications, and system integration for the ColumbiaClass (CC) system that integrates the ship with combatsupport systems. According to Navy S&P, the system integration design is being developed and will be available by December 2019. The Navy's report also explains how long the Columbia will be on the Navy shipyard, where they expect to complete the initial construction, of 2 years, and how likely it is the shipyard will be able to deliver the complete ship on time without deviation from the Navy's schedule. An additional concern to the Columbia's manufacturing cycle is that at present, the program can only be assured that 100 percent of the required materials by July 2022, based on current Navy plans, will meet the Navy's reliability requirements to perform its submarine service objectives. According to the Navy's report, these will include a minimum hull structure material TRL of 4.6. The Navy has not yet developed a reliable, measurable program for its Navy-wide subsystems life cycle cost TRL for Columbia to 42.5 years. As a Navy shipyard, the CC ship integration work will be critical to maintaining a reliable cost schedule for program success. Our review has identified the initial cost increase in the program beyond the Navy estimates. According to Navy S&P, this will be $5 billion dollars over the Navy's program cap and will be offset by program growth beyond $5 billion. The Navy does have some control of the program's total cost because they manage the production and cost of components for the submarine, including the systems integration and testing work performed during construction, as well as the program office in Norfolk. Additionally, Navy S&P explains that an early report of the Navy's program cost estimate is a more likely indicator of the program's final total cost of $3.5 billion dollars of its total $27 billion dollar program in funding, compared to the current cap of $23.4 billion dollars by September 2018. Navy S&P also states that the Navy will likely have a small number (<1%) of major cost increases, but the total program cost will not increase based on these occurrences. According to Navy S&P, when initial design cost estimates are updated in 2016, the Navy's estimates are based on $18", "Federal land management agencies administer approximately 700 million acres of federally owned land (FOTG).

The RPEP requires domestic office space for a 5-year period of 5 targets (target years) for each agency. Each agency must submit a Five-Year Program to OMB in which: 2) an efficiency target per person (i.e., an annual reduction in usable square feet per person) was established; 3) a list of projects was identified by the agency as it would undertake to reduce their footprint and enhance the efficiency of space utilization. These projects are a portfolio of space cost reduction efforts required of each agency. In November 2017, GAO reported that while most agencies saw decreases in cost and rent, their use of space varied. However, agencies have not been fully able to meet all of their space utilization reduction goals, which range from 25 to 75 percent. Agencies could not meet some of their goals in the first reporting year. Some agencies have reduced space significantly; however, the amount of space reduced varied across agencies. Agencies also reported varying success rates when attempting to reduce their office costs. Agencies reported that they have been able to reduce their space utilization rate by varying sizes. All agencies reported a decrease in the cost of their office space, with some suggesting the savings could be hundreds of thousands of dollars. The average total cost per square foot of space per person for each agency has increased in recent years. Agencies varied in their efforts to track the number of hours employees are working in order to identify opportunities for space cost reductions. Agencies have received valuable, free advice and training programs to help them with planning and executing space reduction strategies. Agencies will need to track their space utilization goals for the 2020 fiscal year, however, when 2020 data are not available for all agencies, the RPEP will provide a 2019 target for space utilization. We discuss these topics later in the section containing GAO\u2019s discussion of the current state of space cost reduction efforts. ______________________________ A copy of the OMB Real Property Efficiency Plan on Real Property Information Services (RPIPS)[3] and the 2020 RPIPs are available.

Each agency must develop processes and procedures to achieve this objective and periodically review their progress towards this objective. Most property custodians were responsible for storing property during both wartime and peacetime. They may be responsible for property in multiple warehouses but most property managers generally work in one warehouse, which they report on the Physical Inventory Count process (PIC) on a quarterly basis. Each of the three selected agencies reported performing the PIC for multiple warehouses because they were required to do so by the law. The Property Management Information System (PMIS) used to validate property inventories is a widely adopted asset management information system. The systems\u2019 usage is not limited to the warehouse space itself, but can also be used for other purposes such as tracking the disposal process of excess property. The three selected agencies reported using various asset management systems (AMSS) as a way or resource to manage their property from the time of receipt to disposal. It has been reported to agencies that AMSS provides tools to coordinate and support a complete program to include, for example, real time inventories and disposal of excess property. A majority of the Federal agencies use GSA's PMIS as their source for performing the PIC. There are 26 PMISs across the Federal government that support 14 agencies, and more than 1,200 PMIS systems are currently installed. Agencies are responsible to ensure that the data for properties across PMISs are conformed and merged within the time frame of property disposal. Each agency is required to perform the PIC both quarterly and monthly or when needed for emergency situations. Within each 11 months there are 12 different periods to perform PIC, depending on the agency's specific requirements. There are two ways that Federal agencies categorize property, one is with the acronym of the asset management system they use; and the second is with the classification of the items' useful life or the disposal process. Agency officials explained that a significant change occurred in the 2010 law, now referred to as FM 27-2-10, when \"property\" was changed to the term \"perishable items,\" due to the large volume of perishables and their disposal processes required. Agencies are mandated to perform PIC within 12 months and are required to perform the PIC at least four times a year. Agencies are also required to perform yearly inventories to 24-hour standards and must also include that a physical inventory is performed yearly and an electronic inventory by the year 2022. The inventory cycle may be longer if the program requires an extended physical counting process and an additional electronic inventory program. Agencies must report performance on annual inspections and inventories, which can be used to evaluate progress in implementing and achieving the property goals. The Physical Inventory Count (PIC) process helps agencies determine the value of the assets. Agencies must collect PICs, which occur on a quarterly and annual basis. The Federal Information Technology Reform Act of 1997 (OFP) directs agencies to complete a comprehensive plan to inventory all assets, which will provide additional efficiency and resource efficiencies. Agencies are required to define asset valuation procedures that include a process for establishing a value for assets, which is performed using the appropriate asset management system. Agencies may perform physical inventories, while also requiring electronic data entry with an electronic inventory. The data is captured electronically, whereas physical inventories are performed on paper using an electronic system. Agencies are required to generate a report showing the items' age and useful life, as well as the disposal process they will utilize. Some Federal agencies use automated electronic system capabilities to assist in completing their PIC. Agencies are required to report a physical count of asset and inventory levels once a year. Agencies are required to prepare a summary of the property held in a warehouse and submit it to GSA each year. This data is then compiled in a report to summarize the property held in each GSA\u2019s warehouse on a yearly basis. Agencies are also required twice a year to check the property tags placed on goods in inventory at least once a year. Agencies are required to perform a complete inventory of all property in their warehouse at least four times a year. Agencies must report the number of items owned by them each year. The number of items owned should be based on the disposal process a property will undergo in order that an appropriate number of items are owned by each agency. The property must have all its assets removed and disposed by December 31 of that year. In addition, agencies are required to perform the PIC within 30 days of a change in the property inventory. The Property Management Information System (PMIS) is a widely adopted asset management information system used across the Federal government to track physical property items, perform a comprehensive annual inventory process, and manage waste disposal processing procedures. The Physical Inventory Count (PIC) process is conducted quarterly. Agencies\u2019 inventory cycle may be longer based on program-specific requirements.

However, since VA updated its oversight policies in FY 2017 to perform periodic reviews of providers by management, we determined that progress has been made. Nevertheless, the five medical centers we focused on have taken action only in areas that we addressed. In our FY 2017 report, we noted the need for VA policies that establish specific credentialing criteria and define the minimum qualifications to be included in the personnel file. In our February 2019 report, we recommended that VA develop a policy to mandate VA medical center credentialing committees. We encouraged VA to create a system that logs individual credentialing reviews and to develop a system to electronically track the credentialing actions and results of personnel in the medical centers. In our February 2019 report, we stated that VA needs to improve the training that medical center staff receive on VHA information system processes to ensure that they can perform credentialing reviews expeditiously. We encourage VA to improve its information management systems to better track the credentialing processes. We found that VA medical centers have implemented some good practices to provide information to physicians and staff about clinicians in their medical centers that have a history of issues. This can be helpful in determining if there have been issues and if the clinician should remain in practice. We encourage VA to further develop its internal systems of sharing information so that all employees have the information that they need to make decisions.

Key findings include (1) shortcomings on oversight, evaluation, and decision-making processes in selecting the right approach for a particular privatized housing project, and (2) a lack of reliable or consistent data on the condition and satisfaction of military housing units that is actionable for improvement. Key Recommendations: Each military department should ensure its own performance measures for its privatized housing programs. Each year, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management to prepare a report that identifies the number of privatized housing projects for which he or she and DOD\u2019s Chief Business Officer are responsible for ensuring that the housing units are repaired and maintained when necessary. As part of this report, the Secretary should document the number of housing units in each of the projects and the cost of improvements in each year since 2017. Each military department should develop and execute a project-specific review plan that focuses on the condition and performance of privatized housing. Additionally, each military department should develop and execute a comprehensive evaluation plan to determine when and if the current housing policy of DOD and the military departments is achieving its desired outcome. Key Indicators of performance and success include: whether or not the housing units being occupied have undergone an in-depth study for quality repairs, renovations, or other modifications; whether or not each of the housing units have been inspected and evaluated by DOD or the military, such as by a contractor or the military department\u2019s housing office. Also look to whether or not project-specific procedures have been created for each specific housing project and are followed. Key Challenges: The limited availability for DOD to gather the necessary data on each military project may depend on each installation having a process for tracking these data elements. Additionally, if DOD wants to develop standard procedures on a given housing issue, they may have challenges achieving these goals from one military base to another. The extent of the challenges will depend on how well DOD has established its MHPI goals and plans, as well as each organization\u2019s ability to manage and maintain a housing portfolio of many individual projects. Scope of Report: This report focuses on military housing privatized housing issues relating to the number of projects in existence, their conditions, and status of housing. Specifically, the report considers the challenges and best practices of military departments\u2019 implementation of DOD\u2019s policy on military housing. It does not include a detailed examination of the financial management of each privatized housing project. Project Background: On July 29, 2019, Congress passed the PRA-PA Act to amend the Military Housing Improvement Project Act to allow for the privatization of certain military housing projects and to allow military installations to convert certain housing units to privatized housing units that are occupied by civilians. DOD's privatized housing implementation processes and strategies are addressed in this report. Project Milestones: DOD's privatized housing implementation processes and strategies are addressed in this report. Project Funding: No specific project funding was required. Methodology: The evaluation focused on five main topics: performance, compliance, data and information governance, monitoring and evaluation, and communication. 2019 Performance Information Report. The report includes project-specific data sheets, which can be found in the report at Appendix B. Appendix A: List of Military Installations and Housing Units 2019 Military Housing Strategy Implementation Guidance Table 1. Examples of OSAO in MHPI. Housing is provided to eligible personnel or civilians as part of their military duties and responsibilities. The availability of housing depends on the installation, housing unit, and individual. All military personnel are entitled to rent and utilities that meet federal guidelines, according to Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5210.27. Military housing must be free, including the cost of occupancy payments for family members and the living allowances that must be paid to those residing in MHPI projects. These costs must be reviewed by each housing property manager for his/her installation. Housing can be acquired through MHPI, privatized housing initiatives, or traditional housing contracts. The DOD's housing priorities include to manage current levels of affordable, quality housing for soldiers and their families. The Department of Defense defines \"affordable housing\" as housing that does not exceed 30 percent of income that is not considered reasonable. According to federal guidelines, housing costs must not exceed 25% of individuals\u2019 disposable income\u2014adjusted for cost-of-living regionally. Housing costs that are above this standard can be reviewed by each installation for housing affordability. Military housing is considered a priority for the Air Force. According to Article 30, section 11, the Air Force mission includes a requirement for base housing improvement projects that are designed to serve base personnel with both affordable, quality housing and a sustainable base life force that supports Air Force mission, morale, and readiness. Housing costs can be reviewed", "We use the term platform worker for individuals who provide services. They can receive payments and make payments through a third party platform company, but they may also be classified as independent contractors. Traditional independent contractors pay the same taxes but also have to pay estimated tax on their annual income. Platform workers who receive payments directly from individual customers may receive payments via PayPal, an Electronic Funds Transfer (e.g., Venmo) and also pay income taxes; furthermore, they pay both FICA and Medicare taxes. An advantage of FICA and Medicare taxes is that they are not income taxes. An employee will likely pay double in income taxes and FICA & Medicare taxes because of these taxes being paid by an employer in payroll taxes. As stated throughout, when individuals are treated as independent contractors they must pay their own taxes, self-employment taxes, and may receive a W-2 and/or 1099-MISC form from the payer/company, but not an individual worker. We use the term platform worker to refer to individuals whose earnings are made through providing services on online platforms; their platform companies may facilitate payments between their workers and customers\u2014often using a third-party platform to enable payment transactions between these two segments of society. These online platforms facilitate payments between their platform workers and customers while the platform company is responsible for the taxes. As businesses grow in terms of capital size they may need to seek capital through tax subsidies from their federal, state or local governments to expand their business\u2014but not everyone will get tax subsidies. We call the payments by third-party platforms intermediaries fees. Platform workers may not be obligated to pay themselves certain taxes, like payroll taxes and self-employment taxes. Most of the 1099-MISC & W-2 forms are used to track payroll taxes and wage payments. Our report examines the platform economy using data from the 2018 federal tax returns. As individuals are classified under FICA income taxes are withheld from their earnings at the age of 59.5. We are also estimating that the platform companies currently pay 40 percent of the FICA taxes for their employees and platform workers. The remaining 40 percent of the FICA taxes are usually self-employed taxpayers\u2014typically individuals with sole proprietorships (not S-corps or partnerships). There are certain exceptions and deductions that can be offered. For example, under Section 310 of the IRS code, platform workers can deduct up to $2,500 per year contributed to health care plans within their tax bracket. This may provide tax benefits to the worker and/or employer. According to the IRS, as of March 7, 2019, there were approximately 3.9 million individuals submitting IRS returns, of which only 2.2 million could be reported for payroll taxes. For a significant percentage of the individuals whose earnings are within the range of $10,000\u2014$50,000 per year there were no payroll tax forms filed. These individuals had wage earnings but had a relatively limited payroll. They would also need to pay themselves certain taxes, such as payroll, sales and FICA for a self-employment business. 2.7% (2.2 million) of the workers\u2019 income was in wages and income taxes, which is not likely to be wage payments on the platform company. In contrast, the majority of platform workers\u2019 income is likely comprised of commissions or fees they receive from employers, which are often paid upfront. Most platform worker companies do not pay payroll taxes on the services they provide. A small segment of these platform companies do pay payroll taxes. The payroll tax is often based on the business\u2019 gross income. In 2017, 25 percent of platform company gross income is reported by the IRS. The number of business that would be in this group varied somewhat in 2018. As stated earlier, individuals are required to pay their own tax taxes. However, in order to minimize their tax liability, often they do not need to pay anything until they receive income from 1099-MISC and/or W-2 sources. Income tax withholding, FICA taxes, and payroll taxes & payroll FICA tax deductions may not be required to be paid every year by platform workers\u2014and each individual employer is unique. Since each payroll withholding form (Form W-2) is filed by each payment, it is also a complex process to identify and identify those payments a business may be obligated to pay (e.g., the IRS, FICA and payroll). Payroll tax is calculated on the gross revenues made by the platform company\u2014and can be either a fixed amount per year or the amount needed to cover the payroll withholding requirements\u2014which is determined by payroll withholding calculations and rules. If an employee was paid a salary, then FICA taxes would be deducted from the employee\u2019s income tax payment, and payroll taxes would also be deducted from the employer\u2019s income tax payment. Payroll taxes, including FICA tax and state taxes, would be deducted from each employee\u2019s and employer", "The data sources indicated that there are 18,000 to 20,000 customer service agents at US airports.

A redesigned field infrastructure will be implemented, which will lead to an improved mapping of addresses for the upcoming Census. A large and diverse workforce must be assembled to complete the necessary tasks, including gathering and organizing data. In addition to extensive training, automated assessment tools will be utilized to monitor the execution of field operations. Key Facts: The Census Bureau is planning for an unprecedented workload of 2.1 million Census household visits in the 2020 Census, up from about 2 million in the 2010 Census. Census Field Managers were hired in 1988. The Census Bureau has 2,400 field managers. More than 50% of the work force are field operations and support staff. In 2010, 2.4 million ACO offices had been established by the Census Bureau for various purposes, including field data collection. In 2010, the Census Bureau conducted 30,000+ hours of additional field training for 5 million+ workers\u2014a first in the country.

In the 2010 Census census year there were 25,000 Census Field Managers (CFM-Is); by 2020, there is a plan for 38,760 Census Field Managers to train, supervise and conduct Census operations, with the goal to reduce the staff count during data collection. In the 2000 census, there were roughly 15,000 Census Field Managers nationwide. A Census Field Manual (2006) states that Census Field Managers need five weeks of training, and once there, a \"one-day Census Field School (CFS)\" for two weeks is not a requirement. However, there is a need for additional training for Census Field Managers, Census Area Managers and Census Operations Managers. Census Field Manager training has been held over 300 times around the nation and continues as census operations are implemented every year. Each Census Data Processing Center (CDPC) is staffed with Census Field Managers all year. The Census Bureau offers new Census Field Manager training twice a year, which occurs at each Census Data Processing Center and online training modules. A new set of criteria for the Census Field Managers has been released by the Census Bureau. They included items such as geographic location, ethnicity, language proficiency, and Census training. Census Field Officers are staff hired by Census year 2000 to assist in field operations for the decennial census in 2020. Census Field Data Processing Centers (CFPCs) are hired to take data from the Census Bureau's Internet Census Form Manager System into the Census Reporting Process. Census Area Managers hire Census Data Processing Centers that run the Internet Census Form Manager System (ICFMS). Census Census Data Processing Centers (CFCCs) do not require Census Field Managers. Census Operations Managers are hired to coordinate Census Field Operations as well as run Census Data Processing Centers. Census Field Maps, developed by Census Bureau and Census years 2000 and 2010 Census data are released every Census year. Data are gathered annually, whereas census information is collected in the ten-year period between Census years. Census Field Data Processing Centers are staffed by Census Area Managers and Census Field Officers. Census Region Data Processing Center (CFDPC) is staffed by Census Area Managers. Census Data Processing Centers (CFCCs) are staffed by Census Census Area Managers, Census Area Supervisors, and Census Field Data Processing Managers.

As the sole organization to recruit, train and retain medical and dental officers, the ASD(HA) implements the recruitment authorities for the military in the management of medical and dental forces, providing the medical, dental, and vision care programs in accordance with DoD policies. Currently, service members under scholarship are required to commit to a minimum of 6 years in active duty, the educational obligation of a dental officer is 7 years, the medical resident obligation for the military is 7 years, and the undergraduate obligation for dental officers is 1 year. The ASD(HA), with primary responsibilities for recruiting and retention, serves the DOD medical providers along with civilian medical providers. The requirements the military is making on dental personnel have been updated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to reflect a change in the DOD\u2019s dental coverage. Health care and services for deployed service member dental personnel are primarily covered by the 2007 Dental Fee Service Guide (DHHLR), which established a 120-day global minimum price. The maximum amount allocated to a dental officer\u2019s annual compensation, which must meet certain criteria. According to DOD officials, the first year of post-graduate training does not accrue a service obligation and is considered obligation neutral. Dental resident training can be anywhere from one to Seven years, depending on the specialty and residency requirements. The ASD(HA) is responsible for all dental personnel serving in the Army and Navy. Currently, service members under a scholarship are obligated to serve a minimum of 4 years in active duty and to perform civilian dental services in communities as an active-duty dentist for the next 6 years. The civilian dental services may also be required for dental officers serving in the Army or Navy. For dental officers serving in civilian practice, the service member\u2019s maximum compensation allocation is $70,000 per year, which must be approved for each patient by OCHHS. In FY 2010, Congress passed the American Recovery and Tax Act of 2010, which designated funds to offset the cost of medical procedures to a total maximum of $90,000 per person. The new maximum amount for dental services per patient in 2010 allows any patient to receive treatment of up to $2,500 in 2010. In 2010, the American Recovery and Tax Act of 2009 (H.Res. 3204) required OCHHS to develop a proposal and a policy for an exchange program between civilian dentists practicing in the Army and Navy, and the DoD dental system. Specifically, H.Res. 3204 defined an \u201cexchange pilot program.\u201d This program would allow civilian dentists practicing in the Army or Navy to complete their post-graduate education at DOD and receive dental care at no cost to the government. In response, OCHHS has developed a proposal in consultation with the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Health Affairs (OHA) and the National Conference of State Medical Boards to provide exchange programs. Current requirements in the exchange pilot program include completing a post-baccalaureate dental program in accordance with the recommendations of the American Dental Association and entering an APRD Program in a military medical or dental residency. Under the exchange-pilot program, civilian dentists, practicing in the military, will receive up to four years of dental education at military costs before committing to serve in the DOD, for up to 10 years by the end of their 20th year. There is an intent that up to 60 civilian dentists, per fiscal year, will complete their advanced training via DOD\u2019s exchange programs across approximately 25 military installations. However, the exchange pilot program does not necessarily constitute an official plan and does not change policy or practice in any way pertaining to post-baccalaureate dental education or other educational pathways. The Department of Defense will continue to seek out possible additional ways to reduce civilian dentists\u2019 fees for both dental care and additional programs. Currently, dental officers of the Uniformed Services serve in military hospitals on military posts. Their primary roles are the implementation of health and other medical/dental commands and to practice dentistry. According to DOD officials, their compensation is subject to DoD policy, the requirements of DoD/DHA rules and Army regulations. Each of the service branches has their own specific compensation policies. The compensation to date has been the same each of the past three years for dental officers in each of the four service branches. The \u201csame\u201d compensation may result, in part, due to the same basic pay and retirement benefits across the defense enterprise. Within that construct, the DoD has three major benefits packages. OCHHS will continue to serve as the central office for dental care services.

Agencies need to evaluate the past performance of small businesses in order to make source selection decisions. Contracting officers evaluate past performance to make a recommendation on a small business set-aside. In addition, the FAR requires agencies to document contractor performance. Agencies document their own past performance by completing a report called \u201cEvaluation of Contractor Past Performance.\u201d In addition, agencies use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to assess contractor performance, which can be completed on the web site. The FAR requires agencies to use a set-aside method, which allows agencies to ensure more competition and more small business participation in federal contracting. The FAR also allows agencies to negotiate prices with suppliers and subcontractors. Small business utilization refers to the amount of participation in federal contracting dollars paid to small business entities annually, while the share held by small businesses is more than 50 percent. Agencies are expected to set aside or allocate a specific percentage of funds for small businesses, in addition to evaluating them. According to the FAR, agencies with less than half-a-dollar small business budgets must set aside or allocate funding for small businesses each year. Agencies must ensure the small business share is a minimum of 40 percent across all federal programs. In addition to size, SBA uses the percent of the dollar share a small business contributed to the overall procurement dollar value a factor in assessing the business\u2019s small business performance. The percent also takes into account small business involvement in federal contracting opportunities. Small businesses are now able to compete in more than 75 percent of federal programs. Agencies now have to be strategic and deliberate about assessing their overall impact upon small businesses. A program must be designed to meet certain performance goals, and the progress of the program must be measured. At least one-third of annual contracting dollars are set aside for small business in federal projects in order to meet the 23 percent of procurement dollar goal for small businesses. Agencies are required to complete a yearly small business utilization form, which allows agencies to evaluate small business participation in their programs, as applicable. The SBA has a program called the Small Business Jobs Act of 199\n3\nthat allocates a minimum of one-third of contracting dollars to small businesses, which applies to all federal departments and agencies with a budget greater than $100 million. For FY 2019, agencies were required to use the small business annual status report to report on business utilization. Each year on April 1, agencies are required to file Annual Compliance Reports, including the business\u2019s own (as applicable) SBA 8(a) Annual Business Size Certification. Agencies must also complete a small business utilization form, which serves as a program inventory, listing and monitoring all small businesses for whom an agency has set aside funding. The annual small business utilization report was completed by all agencies by April 1. While agencies cannot award individual contracts and must set aside 75 percent of their total dollar value for federal small business contract funds, contractors also are expected to submit annually a report on how many small business subcontract contracts their firm made. Agency programs for smaller businesses may include business development, technical assistance, research and development, and mentoring activities. Agency programs for small businesses should be strategically designed to meet the requirements of the overall program goals. Agencies should be strategic and deliberate about small business\u2019 programs to meet performance goals. Each year each agency is required to report on its impact upon small businesses. Agencies must complete a program inventory listing all small businesses for whom an agency has set aside funding. They must also complete a program inventory for use in small business utilization reports required annually. Each year on April 1, agencies are required to report on their entire business\u2019s Annual Compliance Report, including small businesses, which serves as a program inventory and business utilization form. Small business utilization was required for all federal departments and agencies with a budget greater than $100 million each\nyear. The Small Business Jobs Act established SBA as the go-to source for government-aided programs for small businesses. There were over 2.7 million SBA programs and services offered annually. According to the SBA, in FY 2019 there were 99,892 businesses in the United States whose full-time employees (or 50 percent of their full-time employees), employees\u2019 health or retirement benefits, or who were other small businesses by type. Additionally, there were approximately 18,400 small business loans, $8.85 billion in small business loans, approximately 17,600 new small business certifications a year, and over 7,500 new small business grant awards each fiscal year. At more than 23 percent of its annual budget, SBA provides financial assistance to small business entrepreneurs. In FY 2019\n4,900 small business loans totalled at close to $4 billion. Loans and loan guarantee commitments averaged from $1 million per year in FY\n5\n, with 17 in FY 6 and", "To receive FEMA assistance under FEMA\u2019s Individual and Households Program, through which disaster survivors can receive help with housing and other needs, individuals with disabilities may face long wait times and unclear registration questions, and may be limited in communicating disability-related information or assistance. FEMA could improve its data management and exchange, as well as the way it shares and flags disability-related data. FEMA should consider and implement technology changes, such as developing an alert within files that indicates an accommodation request, to help improve communication across FEMA programs. FEMA also needs to develop a standardized process for sharing and flagging disability- related information across its programs that will be in place by April 2024. FEMA should continue to improve its infrastructure, communication, and coordination with other U.S. federal and territorial agencies to ensure a coordinated, effective disaster response. FEMA should ensure FEMA has a clear and accessible process in place for requesting accommodations and other disability-related information for individuals seeking assistance in future disaster situations. To be consistent with FEMA\u2019s long-term initiative, we recommend that FEMA establish an ongoing process that will allow survivors to provide and report disability-related information. FEMA should develop a standardized process to streamline disability- related data exchange across FEMA programs. FEMA should establish a database that stores disability-related information, including information on all registered individuals. FEMA should continue to engage with individuals and organizations to ensure FEMA has a clear understanding of disability needs, including developing a process for sharing and flagging these needs. FEMA should continue to have a disaster specific \"FEMA Individual Needs Registry\" for individuals in the disaster affected locations. FEMA should also continue to ensure the availability of disability-related housing and other assistance to ensure that individuals have the same access and resources to meet their survival and recovery needs, no matter where the disaster occurred. -6- Recommendations As summarized earlier, we identified a variety of registration- and other issues related to FEMA, individuals, and federal contractors. Many of these issues are unique to FEMA\u2019s programs. Some of these recommendations are based on current best practices for federal emergency assistance. The recommendations are: Eliminate FEMA\u2019s registration-and-application process for individuals, families, and individuals with disabilities who were displaced by Hurricane Maria. Create a standardized process to simplify reporting disability-related incidents at and after FEMA facilities and events. Eliminate FEMA\u2019s application-intake process to assess individuals\u2019 disability-related needs that occurred more than one day after the disaster. Create a standardized \u201cFEMA Individual Needs Registry\u201d to allow survivors to share their disaster-related accommodation requests online. Create a standardized process for FEMA to review disability-related data across FEMA programs, including a standardized method for receiving disability-related information to inform FEMA employees. Create a database that stores disability- related data across FEMA programs, including an individual\u2019s medical records, housing preferences, and other information. Create a process during disaster planning for contractors and individuals to access FEMA-provided medical and psychological services for individuals with disabilities. Set aside funds to enhance technology and assist individuals and families at FEMA disaster assistance centers, to assist with disaster-related accommodations, and to hire and provide temporary and extended care for individuals with disabilities, where needed. When disaster or other emergency situations are occurring, FEMA should be able to assist individuals and families. When the goal of FEMA\u2019s actions are unclear to individuals and families, communication should be enhanced with their feedback during and after the event. The recommendations regarding FEMA programs outlined by this report are the result of the Report to FEMA\u2019s Independent Review Committee. This report was prepared at FEMA\u2019s request. Please address your copyrights concerns to the Office of Federal Inter-Agency Council on Disability Issues to be returned to FEMA. FEMA's role in disasters As the Report to FEMA\u2019s Independent Review Committee concluded, FEMA plays a role in the disaster-response process that cannot be replaced. However, FEMA\u2019s role does not have to remain limited to responding to emergency assistance. FEMA already manages the assistance of Americans in disaster. However, while most of the activities in FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Office are associated with disaster-related assistance, FEMA can assist individuals and families during future events. FEMA has the role to manage disaster-assistance programs through FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Office. In addition to assisting applicants in securing disaster-related assistance, FEMA can play an important role in assisting individuals with disabilities during and after the event. As FEMA implements disaster-response operations during and following the occurrence of an event, it is possible that some individuals with disabilities would not be able to communicate directly with FEMA, as FEMA\u2019s communications channels are typically general information-only channels. Examples of communication methods FEMA uses include phone, email, social media, text messaging, and mobile phones. FEMA has used these platforms in the past to convey basic information on the status of disasters. As FEMA also takes additional steps to provide real-time, individualized information for individuals by phone, the process could be more efficient. A phone line or dedicated number for assistance may help individuals with disabilities, especially individuals from smaller communities,", "In the United States, the civil aviation roles and responsibilities related to preparing for, assessing, and responding to communicable disease threats in air transportation systems and aviation-system stakeholders may vary depending on their type or level of authority.

The FAA is responsible for civil aviation and commercial space flight transportation in the United States and the safety of U.S. airlines, other U.S. operators, and FAA-certified aircrews worldwide. In 2013, we found airports and airlines had independently developed preparedness plans for responding to communicable disease threats from abroad. These plans generally addressed high-level components such as establishment of an incident command center or an activation trigger for a response.

After a 30-day Congressional notification period, DSCA authorizes the transfer of Excess Defense Articles that includes Humvees for use worldwide. DSCA follows a process that includes determining if equipment meets the industrial base needs; if a waiver is granted, a new modernization/refurbishment strategy is devised; and the process is coordinated with the Department of the Army and Army Materiel Command. This report includes a description of the strategy and the number of Excess Defense Articles transferred and received. The strategy also states that Humvees must be modernized or fitted with modern protection features before being transferred, in order to ensure they meet the Army's needs. There is a 10-month training timeline at the end of which the Army must either destroy or transfer the Humvees from combat to a new location. The purpose of the strategy is to reduce the quantity of obsolete Army-owned vehicles and then use that funding to upgrade the vehicles and equipment. The strategy also includes a focus on a \"civilized\" force and to support the Army's current Force Capabilities Enhancement Program. A number of excess military articles, including Humvees, is on the list for disposal. The number of Excess Defense Articles transferred and received is an example of how DSCA follows up and down the supply chain while tracking items. (Exceeding thresholds is not a problem with the DA. Once items are transferred, DSCA coordinates with both Army Materiel Command and Army Logistics (APL) inventory. In addition, DSCA must track every unit, whether in the National Capital Area (NCA) and/or at other locations in the United States. Because of the large number of items that can be transported through the program, 22.4 percent of the items are currently either stored or are being transformed in NCA. Most of the items are for the Army's active, combat-strength, unit needs (e.g., 1,300 items at the Army's Headquarters in Afghanistan) that include 13.2 percent of the total number of items transferred and/or 10.3 percent of the number of excess items. There are 18.2 percent of items, for which the Army determines there is a strategic value, such that only 8.6 percent of the items are used, because there are other factors requiring the transfer. The Department of Defense spends millions of dollars each year to clean up excess equipment from previous procurement and modernization projects. In early January 2021, the Army's Chief of Staff General Mark F. Millett, Jr. announced that 1,000 M1A1 Main Battle Tank (MBT) turret replacements would be transferred to the National Stock Number (NSN) on file. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Army Materiel Command (APL) did not receive the full quantity of the items. The items were shipped directly back from the vendor to APL using the Army\u2019s Emergency Acquisition Authority (EAA). In March 2020, Army Materiel Command (APL) established a system-wide moratorium (under Emergency Acquisition Authority (EAA) authority) related to processing/procurement of Excess Defense Items (EDEs), when EAA has been declared. Army EDA is used at both the Department of the Army's (DA) level and the Army's level through Army Materiel Command (APL). Since 2008, Army EDA has been used at two Army installations\u2014Fort Gordon, GA and Fort Lee, VA. Army EDA has also been used at three other Army locations to date. Army EDA has been used to support the Army's Force Capability Enhancement (FACE) program. The Army's FACE program trains and transforms Army Materiel Command soldiers across the globe on equipment and systems used outside the Continental United States. Soldiers assigned under FACE, work with Army equipment, such as Army water purification systems, radios, and tactical power systems. The Army EDA strategy is in alignment with the Army\u2019s 2020 Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDEMC) 2030 strategy, in which RDEMC will become a more active provider of emerging technologies and concepts that support Army Modernization Initiatives. Army EDA strategies include Army Operational Sustainment Support (AOSS), the Army Maintenance Program (AMP), Force Capability Enhancement (FCEP). The Army Equipment Lifecycle Management (AELM) initiative is aimed at providing Army assets to sustain the force for 50 years. The Army EDA strategy includes using Army EDA to enhance military readiness. EDA is a tool to achieve greater efficiencies and reduce costs of procurement. Army EDA has a close relationship with the Army\u2019s 40th Year of Force Capability Review Board (FYFCCB", "We recommend that the Department of Labor (DOL) comply with statutory requirements related to Drug Misuse Prevention Grants, a program from WIOA. These grants are intended to provide employment and training assistance to individuals in the WIOA target population related to opioids. They currently cost a reported $100 million and are due for reauthorization. As our tests of grant spending were ongoing, we also identified additional grants that potentially had the same impact on DOL spending as grants under the original authorization of the WIOA program, but were awarded to States from different programs. A large number of these drug- misuse program funding extensions have been added to WIOA-funded grants. The grant extension of WIOA can no longer use the funds associated with the grant, but must use them consistent with the requirements for WIOA, WIOA-related laws, and program rules in future years. We recommended that DOL comply with existing requirements and have their WIOA drug misuse targets and related drug misuse prevention strategies (DMWPs) align with the WIOA objectives, with proper documentation. We are concerned that some drug misuse assistance to employers and employees may be considered a separate program from drug misuse assistance to drug treatment centers, and thus, may not properly align with the WIOA objectives to \u201ceradicate the incidence of illicit drug use\u201d among individuals in the WIOA target population. In the Drug Misuse Grant Program, the number of DMWPs exceeds the number of drug misuse treatment centers in the WIOA system. In the Drug Misuse Grant program, 95 percent of drug misuse treatment center grantees and 88 percent of employer drug misuse assistance grantees share similar WIOA obligations. However, employer drug misuse assistance may have to target individuals receiving opioid treatment as those patients may be eligible for WIOA drug misuse services but have not done so. Thus, it is unclear if employer drug misuse assistance grantees are required to provide drug misuse prevention-related services to their WIOA applicants when WTOA guidance allows drug misuse prevention services to be available to all of WIOA\u2019s WOD grantees (WIG), but no information is available to assess whether and how many employers are using these services. We also recommended that DOL track WIOA grantee success in providing drug misuse prevention services, including the drug- misuse treatment results achieved, and identify grantee accomplishments in providing drug misuse prevention and treatment guidance. We found some evidence that DOL is beginning to track grantee data on drug misuse prevention activities, but not all grantee performance measures are in place. We concluded that the current structure of the WIOA system may not fully address the drug misuse prevention strategy and grant objectives of some grantees who are currently not able to access drug misuse prevention services. 5 GAO-20-00021 Drug Misuse Grant Program: Drug Misuse Prevention and Treatment Assistance to State, Local, and Tribal Governments Report at (\n3\nGAO-21-00005 GAO-20-00024: Drug Misuse Prevention Grant (WITHEE) Report at (\n/publications/nitro/a/nitro-21-00024.pdf\n)\nGAO-19-00805 Drugs and Drug Misuse Report Report at (\ndrug-misuse/)\nGovernment Accountability Office.

(Source: Department of Transportation) Due to DOT\u2019s regulation requiring airlines to communicate denied boarding compensation information to their passengers, airlines are not required to post any information online. Airlines must communicate this compensation information to their passengers either verbally or in writing. This compensation information may be included in the invoice that DOT required to be sent to the passenger. Airlines must retain the invoice and a record of the correspondence/statement of compensation of each passenger denied boarding, even if they do not request a cash/check payment (DOT, DOT-OEM, DOT-RIM, NCTA/CPUC). \u201cDenied boarding compensation\u201d that a passenger is owed is considered income to that particular member, so it must be reported and deducted from the passenger\u2019s income taxes (for details on air operator certificate fees and the costs of other required documents, see the \u201cOther costs\u201d section below). Denied boarding compensation that consists of a monetary payment is required to be stated as a gift on the passenger\u2019s tax return (for details on which types of payments can be made, which are taxable, and which should be made, see the \u201cDenied boarding compensation\u201d box below). If the passenger was denied boarding by airlines or DOT (\u201cairline error\u201d), DOT is required to keep track of the airline\u2019s compensation and expenses. The airline must make payments to DOT based on the airline\u2019s payment information. The payment/compensation schedule may be based on a certain type of aircraft (e.g., Boeing, Airbus, Airbus, etc). The compensation schedule may be based on a set of different factors. These factors may include certain types of flights and passenger demand schedules. Additionally, this schedule allows DOT to establish minimum compensation amounts based on the price of the ticket, the length of time the passenger is delayed, the length of time the passenger is delayed at the airport, the passenger\u2019s status and what that meant (for example, how long after the boarding process the passenger boarded the aircraft), how many flights the passenger takes/changes during the process, or other factors. The minimum compensation amount of a denied boarding (not to exceed $250, even if multiple passengers are denied boarding) can be adjusted in the event that flights are oversold or there are changes in the number of flights the passenger can take. However, the compensation amount is not required to change to/from the amount. The minimum compensation amount for a denied boarding is mandated by federal rules. Additionally, airlines are required by federal regulation to keep a record of the time of each denied boarding. The compensation also includes a statement that the payment was made within the 30 minutes that the FAA requires airlines to communicate the information about how many passengers have been denied boarding, how many have been denied boarding \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d (by accident), how many are injured, and how many have been treated.

To date, VA has contracted with three (5) Community-Provider Organizations, commonly referred to as TPA\u2019s, to administer the choice program. The three (3) TPA\u2019s currently administering the program are Healthcare Innovations LLC (1), TriWest Healthcare (2), and CSC Global Services (3). There are three other veterans advocacy organizations that are currently working with VA to develop the program, which has not yet been published for public comment. The VCCP is an acronym for Choice Program Extended Care (CPEC). The 39,000 Choice Program providers may also be responsible for scheduling veteran appointments with time-eligible veterans within a region. In January 2019, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) determined that only 12% of non-metropolitan veteran health care claims from 2010 to 2017 were resolved. To develop a new program that would manage time-eligible veterans\u2019 and other veterans\u2019 health care, VA has proposed a new program called the Veterans Choice Community Performance-Based Fee-Based Care Program. VA proposed the VCP to VA medical facilities on December 28, 2018. Prior to awarding contracts, VA issued an announcement on July 15, 2019, stating that VA would only contract with the same three TPAs administering the VCP.

TSA has been a leading voice in designing security requirements for a variety of devices. Many of the devices are designed and built by industry, including commercial aviation equipment developers. These technologies serve a variety of purpose. For instance, commercial airplane landing and departure is a critical point, as well as check-in and boarding processes. Screening and detection technologies serve a variety of purposes for TSA. These include providing information on the aircraft as well as information on individuals who are using TSA services. These technologies do not detect everything that passengers have in their carry-on baggage. However, the goal of TSA is to make it easier for passengers through technology. Most of the technologies TSA uses to make their screening and detection processes efficient are built and maintained by commercial service providers. TSA\u2019s role as a supplier and service provider varies in size depending on the airport in question. As part of its mission, TSA works closely with the aviation sector on various safety and preparedness initiatives. TSA continues to develop detection technologies that are specifically tailored to their mission. TSA is the first line of defense when arriving at an airport, and the technologies it provides can make travel less cumbersome or at least more efficient. In 2016, the FBI recorded 21.2 million thefts of traveler\u2019s personal belongings, and more than 80 percent of these thefts were of portable electronic devices\u2014meaning an individual\u2019s device, such as a laptop or portable device, could be a target for theft. That statistic alone proves how important TSA\u2019s technologies are to securing personal belongings. A 2011 incident at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta demonstrated how airport services could be impacted when a device was detonated inside an electronics device. A device inside the device initiated an explosive device and caused significant damage to the area, but it could not be determined to be carried on the individual passenger\u2019s person. The device, an iPod, did contain electronic components. A 2004 incident involving a suitcase with explosives placed inside by a terrorist at Los Angeles International Airport triggered the most famous TSA safety procedure, the \u20193-1\u2019 program. The program mandated the removal from the checkpoint by passengers of any item that did not belong there. Items could not be returned and were destroyed, if deemed unusable, after passengers had been required to surrender them in order to enter the airport grounds. The incidents served to show the threat that terrorism posed to commercial aviation, and the 3-1 system may have saved people from a possible attack. There are rules in place to prevent individuals from entering the restricted areas of the airport. If individuals try to enter these areas, TSA security staff will stop them, asking for identification and/or other personal information. The security measures were put into place after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Some of the technological devices that TSA officers use for detection include various types of X-ray machines, metal detectors and luggage scanners. Other technologies include body scanners, shoe X-ray machines, and explosives detection equipment. In-depth knowledge or equipment is required by screeners to detect any potential threats. They have to be knowledgeable and competent in order to detect any threat materials, whether it be on the surface or in an item such as a laptop. Other security tools include biometric scanners, surveillance cameras, and even sniffer dogs. The TSA conducts continuous training for screeners. They may attend a training seminar once a year or more frequently. By doing so, screeners can become more knowledgeable on the most current security threats and their associated devices. To assist them in their learning process, TSA also has an extensive library of learning materials. These materials include the procedures manuals as well as manuals specific to particular technologies, such as a laptop X-ray program. One of the main missions of TSA is to ensure screeners are up to date in their training, too. The TSA website includes training and educational resources for screeners, TSA personnel, and the general public, that span a range of different areas, including X-ray machines and electronics. According to the TSA, over 13 million passengers pass through the nation\u2019s airport entrance process without incident. That equates to roughly 1,000,000 individuals per day that carry on their persons personal belongings. One of the main requirements of TSA is that passengers must adhere to their guidelines and rules to enter a terminal building. To assist in the process of checking items at the security checkpoint, the TSA uses both physical security and technology to maintain the safety of travelers. They also have implemented new technologies for the first time in TSA history to allow them to detect a number of common security threats. One of the latest technologies tested by TSA is a so-called explosive screener. These screelers are designed to detect small items such as homemade explosives on a passenger. In addition, TSA uses high-speed baggage handling systems. These systems can automatically remove items of a banned or prohibited", "The Coast Guard owns shore infrastructure consisting of more than 20,000 facilities, which we reported totaled at least $2.6 billion as of 2018, and that in fiscal year 2012 the organization has declared a total of 52,000 assets in decline.

The market is often highly concentrated within a state, and that market share can translate to a company\u2019s success or failure.

PPACA has numerous provisions that affect exchange exchange. PPACA established a variety of market reforms aimed at increasing competition among exchange entities, as well as encouraging insurers to compete with each other to provide a set of defined benefits packages. Exchange plan structures, including an exchange\u2019s ability to impose a penalty on exchange plans that fail to meet minimum standards, continue to be very different and have varied levels of structure\u2014as some have minimal health benefits and other coverage requirements, but a significant number of the coverage types are a set of a relatively narrow set of benefits offered on the state level\u2014in most states, for example, $50,000/$100,000/$200,000, respectively. In contrast, exchange benefits are usually very structured and standardized, typically featuring narrow benefit packages with an average annual cost of each benefit in excess of $2,000\u2014as much as 20-30% of premiums were consumed by the state share contributions\u2014including administrative \u2018service\u2019 fees and premium tax credits. A variety of factors continued to come into play to explain exchange health. In all states, exchange plan premiums, costs and tax subsidies were very different by location and health benefits\u2014even for very similar-sounding benefits packages. In some states more than half of all exchange enrollees are uninsured, while in other parts of that state exchange enrollees numbered fewer than 22 percent. Exchange premiums and costs were highly concentrated, but with different market dynamics in different exchanges. When exchanges established their insurance products and prices, that impact and benefit to small businesses was highly competitive\u2014one third of employers offered exchange plans, and a greater proportion of small businesses offered exchange plans than small businesses offered traditional Small Business Health Plans (2/3) and Individual Plans (2/3). Exchange plan pricing was highly stratified according to the location of the enrollees, their ages, incomes and other demographics. The more affluent and older enrollees were more likely to be offered richer benefits packages. Exchange premiums ($7,000/$19,000/$19,000/$7,000) also vary highly by their size\u2014in all large markets except the West Coast there are significant differences in the premiums of the exchange policies. By state, exchange premiums and costs show some variation among insurers (one exchange in a few states was as expensive as any state. In contrast, nearly all exchanges in small and mid-size markets have lower premiums and more limited, narrower benefit packages than insurers or private firms. Exchange health costs are the lowest among all small business offerings. It remained quite diverse that the average premiums per enrollee and premiums per enrollee are among the lowest in all of Europe. In addition, exchange health costs in all states except Florida were significantly below those premiums and costs in the Netherlands. Exchange enrollee and enrollee trends vary significantly across states. Even exchanges for the same state (for example, in Florida, 4 different health insurance companies offer exchange policies) show dramatically different enrollees, costs and premiums between 2-10% of enrollees in each exchange. Exchange enrollees are also usually younger than the state\u2019s overall populations. For example, in Florida, exchange enrollees age 44-62 years old make up 67% of enrollees, while in Iowa only age 18-55 years old make up 61% of enrollees. While exchange enrollees are younger than in the typical large employer group coverage market, the age distribution is also quite different in the state markets. In several states, half of all enrollees are age 25-44 years old, while in other states the distribution of enrollees is more closely focused among older adults (>65) as well as younger enrollees. (See figure 4.1.) Exchange enrollees are more geographically concentrated than was expected. Exchange enrollees are generally older and more affluent than the local population in all state markets but a few. For example, in Florida less than half the enrollees were 55-64 years of age, while in Connecticut more than half were 45-54 years old. In several states, Exchange enrollees with incomes less than $50,000 are more likely to enrol in exchange plans than those with incomes above that amount. In addition", "The Mexico City policy, which the U.S. government mandated in 1984 and revived in 2017, asks non-governmental organizations (NGOs) contracting with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide financial support and logistical assistance to assist in implementing abortions related to reproductive health and family planning. The policy was announced at a conference on population and is intended to apply to Mexico City as well as all new grants and cooperative agreements that provide global health assistance awarded after May 2017, awards provided directly by U.S.-based organizations to foreign NGOs with grants or contracts, and assistance provided directly to national governments. However, in a May 2017 briefing on the PLGHA policy, USAID noted that humanitarian assistance and USAID disaster and humanitarian relief activities were also excluded from the policy. A June 2020 report to Congress on the policy's implementation noted that Mexico City Family Planning Program (MEPAF) received U.S. funds during the 2017-18 grant year, including those related to abortion services. The report also noted that an organization that contracted with USAID to provide counseling on reproductive health and that contracted with HHS for logistical assistance to abortion services could receive and provide PLGHA funding. The report also noted that $8.7 billion was allocated for PLGHA in fiscal year 2017, compared to a FY2017 baseline of $2 billion. Funding for GHP was authorized under the FY2018 funding bill, which is H.R. 3052.", "Surplus plutonium management strategies changed over time from near-term plans for immobilization, irradiation, or dilution and disposition to the current strategy involving plutonium oxide production and feedstock development.

The FEMA cadres work in various areas, such as incident management, hazard mitigation, response, and recovery at incident locations where they receive or are responsible for delivering financial or technical assistance to communities during a disaster. FEMA incident management employees are national assets that can deploy to any location in the country to manage or support incidents, regardless of their experience or permanent duty station. Incident management positions are organized by operational and functional groups and their associated roles include planning, logistics, communications, and medical services. FEMA employees hold both primary and subordinate titles to support roles in the FEMA 4\u00d74 system that may include incident management, response, hazard mitigation, and recovery services, as well as their assigned responsibilities. For example, a FEMA reserve employee can choose to work in medical or law enforcement roles of support. The FEMA cadres are organized into the four tiers depicted on the figure 5-1 at their respective levels of responsibility with the primary and subordinate titles of each role. The FEMA employee titles are categorized by their main duties in FEMA incident management. FEMA manages the staffing, training, and deployment of its cadres at the national level by the Incident Management Center (IM) Office. To keep with the latest terminology and concepts, FEMA reclassified the Incident Management COREs to an Emergency Management CORE and renamed the Public Assistance Officer cadre to Emergency Assistance Professional or Homeland Security Assistant. FEMA has developed a comprehensive incident management competency training and assessment system, titled the Incident Command Level 2 (IC-2) training program, which is a requirement for FEMA Hazard Mitigation grant activities. In 2001, FEMA updated the FEMA Emergency Management Standard to include more current terminology in response to the 9/11 Commission Report. The Emergency Management Standard specifies the 10 main functions and management areas (e.g., communications, evacuation, evacuation of buildings, search and rescue, shelter operations, and supplies) that need to be addressed by FEMA on a daily basis and FEMA must also develop a response and recovery mechanism. The Emergency Management Standard can be found in FEMA Publication 550, The Hazard Mitigation Grant and Development Grant Program Guide, chapter 2-1, and the guidance of chapter 4 of FEMA's Unified Grant Program Agreement (FEMA Form 2-10-1). The FEMA Emergency Management Institute (EMI) offers a course on the National Incident Management Standard on line at https://www.emacademy.org/. FEMA\u2019s Emergency Management Resource Directory at https://www.ema-incident-management.fm.us contains links and information on FEMA Emergency Information and FEMA Emergency Management Academy modules, among other resources.

In 2019, HUD-VASH reported $1.1 billion in obligations across the country, and GPD reported $234.6 million. VA Medical Centers can receive funding to develop a comprehensive coordinated entry system for homeless veterans. Homeless veterans may be referred to HUD-approved housing vouchers or to service providers via the Coordinated Homeless Assistance program. Homeless veterans\u2019 mental health needs are among the most complex issues they face and are the most common barriers to accessing housing and services. USICH reported that 28 percent of homeless veterans that receive VA-provided health care have been diagnosed with depression, and that 19 percent have struggled with alcohol abuse. Additionally, 20 percent of service providers told USICH\u2019s researchers that the mental health needs of homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless often represent a key barrier to accessing housing and services. The goal of USICH's Homeless Veterans Program is to deliver timely, coordinated, and holistic care to homeless veterans while aligning with best practices to achieve the goal of decreasing homeless veteran homelessness.

Additionally, the Navy can now implement an approach similar to one used on the FFG(X) program for LCS, with a clear and executable business case. This will allow the Navy to streamline the process and gain a larger cost improvement that was not realized during the first LCS design. The Navy\u2019s goal of providing a faster, more lethal, and more sustainable ship could be accomplished only by improving its current shipbuilding processes. This new knowledge and process will support other shipbuilders, large and small, and will help address challenges in shipbuilding. Some examples of shipbuilding challenges include cost reduction, the impact of changing ship designs, the need for more efficient ship processes. This report demonstrates that the Navy has a comprehensive approach for addressing the cost and schedule issues that can impact shipbuilding programs. Many of these obstacles can be resolved by deploying Navy experts to the other shipyards. These Navy experts can help in the planning and production processes, identify potential problems before they occur, and ensure ships stay on schedule through the use of Navy knowledge and experience. Navy Shipbuilding Case Study: Introduction Page Next section Chapter 3 Summary This report outlines a detailed understanding of challenges in shipbuilding development. Shipbuilding can be expensive to produce, particularly for advanced surface combatants, and is critical to the U.S. Navy\u2019s effectiveness. This report shows that Navy leaders have become aware of the need for improved efficiency in shipbuilding, which involves a deeper understanding of cost and schedule issues. A Navy shipbuilding \u201cexpert\u201d from industry was identified to gather extensive understanding that can be leveraged for other shipbuilder challenges. The expert, who served as a consultant to (N)SC since 2008, collected data and observations on a wide variety of Navy ships. She was asked to assess trends in shipbuilding methods, identify patterns among shipbuilder leaders to help understand their approach, and review data on various LCS-related projects. This report examines shipbuilding methods as well as Navy and commercial shipbuilding best practices. The report describes the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding process and its best practices. We found that the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding process has several weaknesses. These weaknesses include: lack of efficiency and productivity in shipbuilding operations, design and planning inefficiencies, and communication and logistics challenges. The report shows that the Navy has developed a comprehensive understanding of the problems in shipbuilding development and has adapted its shipbuilding processes to address these challenges. This report helps identify potential challenges in shipbuilding programs, as well as identify the appropriate resources and methods to resolve the challenges. As we have found in previous Navy shipbuilding reports, the U.S. Navy\u2019s acquisition process is complex and its shipbuilding performance and progress can be difficult to analyze. To better understand shipbuilding methods, we used (N)SC staff to research shipbuilding processes. This report summarizes the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding process using expert analysis and recommendations. The Navy is currently seeking to improve shipbuilding efficiency and productivity, which is critical to ensuring the Navy is prepared for the challenges ahead. This report outlines key strategies for improving shipbuilding efficiency, quality and progress, which must be done by both the Navy and contractor shipyards. The report can be used to identify and develop solutions to shipbuilding issues and can be used to help contractors understand Navy shipbuilding processes. If Navy or contractor shipyard methods were used to construct every Navy ship, there would be many instances of ships needing modifications or being delayed from production. A solution of increasing shipyard efficiency could go a long way to reducing ship acquisition and sustainment costs. This report provides the Navy useful information on the best possible approach to shipbuilding. It can be used to create realistic shipbuilding plans, ensure good communication between Navy and contractor shipyards, and identify ways to save time and money. Navy Shipbuilding Case Study: Chapter 1 Introduction page 4 Next page Next section Chapter 3 Summary The Navy Shipbuilding Case Study report on shipyard efficiency and productivity was commissioned to the Defense Acquisition Systems Analysis Institute (WASI) and the Navy to develop a case study of Navy ship construction processes. The case study, which lasted approximately seven months, was reviewed by Navy and DOD subject matter experts for consistency of Navy policy, and the case study was reviewed in June 2016 by Navy, Marine Corps and Department of Defense (DOD) officials, and their technical expertise were used throughout the case study. DOD and Navy requirements for shipyard shipyard efficiency and productivity. In order to improve shipbuilding performance, the Navy has adopted a shipyard shipyard efficiency. This report contains an in-depth study of Navy shipyard efficiency by gathering Navy input into a comprehensive report, and which has been made available without review. Navy Shipyard Efficiency and Productivity Case Study (4) Page Next section Chapter 2 Shipyard Shipyard. Previous Navy shipyard performance studies found that, despite the best efforts", "In response to congressional requests in 1988 and 1997 that Congress provide permanent statutory authority for permanent military jurisdiction over utilities, DOD issued several policies and DoD orders addressing utility privatization. Military installations at nine locations and the Navy at three locations currently implement utility privatization programs, which are also available to other private entities under service contracts. TABLE 2: Number of utility systems privatized since DOD began tracking in 2004 (excluding Navy) in fiscal year 2020.

Unsecured areas, or commercial airport public areas, are the areas of the airport that may access by members of the public without restrictions. Common to commercial airports, the security requirements of these airport areas are generally similar to other areas. According to aviation security stakeholders, these airport areas presented multiple challenges to airport operators, largely as a result of the large number of people that pass through airport public areas during peak operating hours. Law enforcement agencies. In addition to airport administrators and the federal TSA law enforcement authorities, local law enforcement personnel may provide security assistance to airport public areas and airports. Although TSA regulations mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies are responsible for providing law enforcement assistance in commercial aviation, it is recommended to have a policy stating TSA reserves the right to regulate, for security purposes, the personnel and number of law enforcement officers that local law enforcement agencies consider appropriate in securing their own airport public areas. In this case (noted by TSA), local law enforcement agencies may also be allowed to respond to non-TSA related law enforcement emergency incidents within the airport public areas themselves without obtaining the TSA approval. The number of and placement of law enforcement officers and their resources can be a major constraint to any operator. In some cases, operators may need to provide additional security personnel as an additional step to further enhance operations. TSA and other aviation stakeholders. According to TSA operations stakeholders, securing public access and providing security assistance to airports is the task of multiple organizations and entities working together to provide a cohesive aviation security system. Public access to airport areas should be provided by a number of aviation stakeholders. In general, airport administrators should be responsible for identifying and developing appropriate security protocols for their own airport public areas. State law enforcement agencies, local law enforcement, as well as security assistance corporations, are needed to work together to ensure the safety and protection of passengers in the areas of a commercial airport. In addition to those organizations, airport operators are responsible for providing the necessary security staff and support to the TSA. Airports are asked to coordinate with a large number of stakeholders, including state and local authorities and law enforcement agencies to ensure airports remain in compliance with the security requirements associated with them. An example of a task shared with a number of stakeholders is to ensure the safety and efficient movement of passengers in a terminal of a commercial airport by the timely implementation of automated boarding gates, or the use of RFID boarding cards and other technologies. (Examples of a variety of tools and systems, as well as processes can be used in airport construction to simplify the construction process. For example: TSA\u2019s new Virtual Terminal System and Automatic Virtual Terminals allows for all the required document checks that the public security must be verified or that the government needs to determine that the public may or cannot access. These are a number of important tools to use and ensure that airport operations will be free of unnecessary and costly delays in the terminal. According to our conversations with aviation industry representatives, in a post-construction phase, the TSA works with airport stakeholders to provide airport operators with a set of procedures that are used in the terminal access area. It is recommended that airports with similar security standards implement these procedures for security at the access points between airports terminal. Once constructed and in operation, the Virtual Gateway Access System and Advanced Technology X-ray Machine, Automated Passenger Screening Systems with full Body Imaging Technology, and the Airport Intelligence Center and RFID-enabled Automated Access Systems all will support the terminal access for secure and efficient processes. According to industry representatives, airports are generally underfunded and need more efficient technologies to accomplish security requirements than the cost of installing such products can justify. They pointed out that new technology can help airports minimize their cost of implementing security processes that are needed to be present on the roadway. For example, in the traditional roadway process, the airport operator needs to provide pedestrian walkways and a secure area in the terminal to allow the public to access airport operations. To accomplish this, the airport may take up to a few hours to install the necessary facilities. On the other hand, there are several solutions to simplify these tasks. For example, the development of the Automated Pedestrian Detection in the roadway that allows the airport to detect pedestrians and automatically provide walkways with lighting, barriers, and pedestrian gates. Other technologies include RFID, and Automated Access Control Systems that enable the airport operator to remotely access pedestrian gates and sidewalks. Automated Pedestrian Detection Systems are used at various airports around the state, including the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which has the largest U.S. airport access roadway system in a continuous ramp. In general, TSA recommends and makes all security decisions that are needed to secure airport operations. Generally, TSA\u2019s \u201cbest practices\u201d are the most comprehensive security system in the world. Additionally, TSA offers many", "The activities and resources required to suppress wildfires, in particular, major wildfires, generally fall under the categories of disaster relief, response, and restoration. FEMA may provide different types of support to states and jurisdictions than individuals, but FEMA can provide assistance to those, especially if the disaster caused serious, widespread damage to private property. State governments often requested a federal declaration of disaster in order for the federal government to provide funding to public and private entities. A disaster assistance declaration by the President has the authority to provide federal disaster relief funding and assistance. There are numerous public and private organizations, including FEMA regional offices, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and state programs that are available or may be involved in administering FEMA relief and restoration. FEMA regional offices work closely with the DHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to coordinate disaster relief actions. FEMA regional offices are co-ordinated through a chain of command and hierarchical organization as follows: * Regional Offices * Area Offices * Area Directors * Regional Directors * Assistant Directors * Emergency Managers * Operations Coordinators * Field Advisors The Disaster Mitigation Grant (DMG) Program is the federal component of state and local government programs that helps prevent future disasters and/or to respond to current disasters to reduce the immediate and long term impact as much as possible. Through the DMG program, FEMA provides grant awards up to $10 million to each federal or territorial agency, as it may direct grants to help states, counties, and local governments, so they can use state and local dollars to buy equipment, build buildings, buy materials, etc. to ensure they are as self-sufficient as possible. While federal funding to state and local government is often available for recovery from natural disasters, FEMA, through the DMG program also provides funding to support emergency services and recovery activities. This federal financial assistance program allows jurisdictions to make projects in the recovery period. The specific programs that may be available through the DMG program are: Building, fire, and construction funds Housing, temporary utilities/infrastructure equipment, \u2026 \u2022 Construction/ \u2022 Temporary housing costs/infrastructure costs \u2026 \u2022 Rental assistance (not to exceed $50 per month) \u2022 Debris removal/civil debris costs/remediation costs \u2022 Environmental cleanup costs \u2022 Other costs of $50,000 or less per year \u2022 Medical/civil evacuation costs/insurance costs \u2022 Demolition/construction costs/structural collapse costs/ \u2026 Demolition/construction/structural collapse costs for new construction. As noted in previous reports there are no specific requirements for building demolition/construction/structural collapse funding \u2026 \u2022 Funding to assist state, territorial, and local government for necessary administrative expenses in the disaster relief context. \u2022 Funding for state, territorial, and local government for certain emergency, administrative and logistical purposes in the disaster relief context. \u2022 Funding for construction of public buildings to replace damaged buildings. \u2022 \u2026 \u2022 \u2022 Funding to replace residential property to pre-existing residential property. Funding the state of California to rebuild and rebuild public infrastructure including roads, bridges and more (post-2019 Northridge Earthquake, 1992... and subsequent California Earthquakes). Funding to rebuild and restore the state of Florida post- Hurricane Andrew in 1993. Funding to rebuild buildings and infrastructure in South California for fires in 2008. The \u201cDisaster Response Unit\u201d is a federal/local government program that is designed to assist in the response and recovery from disasters. In addition to the physical rebuilding of equipment, structures, and infrastructure, assistance provided by the DMG to the state government and other state/local jurisdictions may include funding for fire suppression costs, medical/civil evacuation costs, temporary housing costs, environmental cleanup costs, and other eligible costs. A state could use up to $10 million in Federal funds to assist the federal or sub-national government in providing assistance. The State of New Jersey was provided an unprecedented $1.4 billion through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in order to help recover from Superstorm Sandy. One way to make it easier for FEMA to assist states is to utilize \u201ccoordinate-with\u201d or \u201ccoordinate-with\u201d the DHS Regional Offices.

Importers, manufacturers, and brokers are required to electronically submit information directly to FDA in order for FDA to track import entries through its OASIS system, including information such as the name of the importer and the product to be imported. PREDICT is an automated product information system developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medical Products (CVM) to assist foreign food manufacturers in complying with federal regulations. Importers must agree to submit a certain level of information, including product manufacturer, product type of goods, and quantity of each product. In addition, the importer must submit information regarding their current compliance with FDA requirements. Information must also be provided regarding the importer\u2019s compliance history as well as their certification that they have been inspected. Before entry of the product in the United States, FDA electronically screens it to verify it is admissible under FFDCA and to ensure that it represents a health risk to American consumers. FDA may also request or require that the importer to submit certain food safety information in addition to mandatory information required for the product. If food manufactured by an importer is suspected to be tainted or is otherwise inedible, it will be rejected or detained during the inspections process and may not be imported. All of the data entry, product type, and other relevant information required by FDA will be uploaded electronically to FDA\u2019s Electronic Registration, or ERA, system. The ERA system will hold this product data until the FDA, or FDA\u2019s designated inspection authority, reviews the data. If a problem is found using the PREDICT system or the ERA system, FDA will contact the importer. If importers refuse to share food safety information or if the information is inadequate, FDA will decide whether the importer or product(s) in question can be processed and released, depending on additional factors. 15 CFR part 94.3. This law allows FDA to inspect all food, including food products that have already been entered into the United States, even if they are of no food safety concern. The law applies to all types of food, including all animal food products intended for human consumption, including food that is manufactured in the United States but is destined solely for distribution in the territory. The law does not apply to products, even those manufactured in the United States, that are destined for interstate commerce or are imported directly into the United States. FDA\u2019s OASIS is the single database available to commercial importers that contains food product information, including importers, manufacturers, and brokers. FDA also requires the tracking of food products into OASIS. This data allows importers, manufacturers, brokers, and other commercial importers to access current data from a U.S. port without having to use a large database to which they may not legally be allowed. Additionally, FDA uses OASIS to electronically track product imports, allowing FDA to quickly identify potentially serious concerns with products that have already been entered at U.S. ports of entry. Import alerts are typically issued to importers of products that FDA has determined through inspection could be toxic, a product of inadequate quality, or adulterous. Importers are required to track food safety information by submitting it directly to FDA\u2019s ERP system or OASIS system. The FDA can require importers, manufacturers, and broker-importers to submit current product information and to submit their certification of compliance with FFDCA in addition to other mandatory information. This information assists FDA in determining whether importer or product(s) in question can be imported. If importers must also submit food safety information, it can be requested or required of importers, manufacturers, or broker-importers. In some cases, FDA may require importers or manufacturers to provide additional information about food such as the producer\u2019s name, location, and certification number. Upon arrival at FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Enforcement (ORA), importers generally must submit product-specific information (PSI) including the product code and name of the product, importer name and contact information, and other importer information. ORA uses these data to ensure that importers have provided the necessary data required to be able to track their products or the product components that they add together to form a component of a product. PSI is defined in 21 CFR part 114. All data input by the importers and suppliers is directly entered into the FDA Electronic System (EAS) by the importer or manufacturer, or by the third-party data provider. Manufacturers generally submit their manufacturing information and certification information electronically (via the FDA Electronic Registration, or ERA), in order to gain FDA eligibility to import their products into the United States. After information is entered into OASIS", "DARs staff tracks each of these potential changes in case files, which are referred to as cases. DARS staff also can work with other federal agency offices to implement acquisition-related NDAA provisions through a Federal Acquisition Regulation rule change, interim rule change, or class deviation. In some cases, a provision may specify that DOD take other actions, such as holding a public meeting to obtain interested parties\u2019 opinions on an acquisition topic.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended by the INA, established the H- 2B visa category to the Secretary of Labor, which authorizes employers to hire skilled, professional foreign workers for temporary nonimmigrant \u201camenity-services\u201d work. The INA also established a system of sponsorship to legally employ foreign workers and allows employers to apply for a license number. The INA allows foreign workers, whose employment is directly related to the temporary work petitioned for, to accompany them for additional work-related visits. The INA also specifies which labor-protected workers are ineligible for consideration. DOL issues an INA petition with the Foreign Labor Certifying Offices and USCIS authorizes H-2B petitions in order to bring foreign workers into the United States for temporary employment. A specific number of H-2B employees can be approved by DOL for specific, specific employer applications for a fee. Under the INA, there is an annual cap on the number of H-2B visas issued to H-2B employers. They are subject to an annual allocation of 33,000 that determines to H-2B workers authorized in fiscal year (October 1 - March 31). Employers are also required to pay H-2B workers their minimum wage, transportation expenses, and a \"separately established\" minimum number of work hours per day. The INA allows U.S. employers to apply for a license number under certain circumstances, such as when they hire foreign workers to perform H-2B work. Each H-2B employer is charged a fee for the processing of the application. A specific number of H-2B employees can be approved up to the number recommended to DOL (8,000). If USCIS approves, DHS may approve H-2B visa applications for up to a specific number of workers. Each H-2B employer is charged a fee of up to A H-2B visa can be used for H-2B-related work on or off U.S. soil. In 2015, DHS and USCIS jointly issued regulations that set forth a number of specific requirements that both employers and H-2B petitioners must comply with. These include the provision of transportation, and a minimum number of work hours per day. Employers can petition DHS for a number of H-2B workers up to a maximum number of 33,000. H-2B employers are permitted to charge their H-2B employees for processing fees, such as for obtaining a H-2B license for their workers, and for transportation. H-2B employers must also provide their H-2B employees with the minimum wage, the number of work hours per day, and transportation. The INA allows U.S. employers to apply for their own license number under certain circumstances. For example, if the employers are hiring H-2B workers to perform skilled work in certain professional or higher-level management positions for a new or expanding company, they are be eligible to apply for and obtain a license under INA section 221(i). For H-2B employers that are hiring foreign workers under the visa cap, the INA allows them to apply for authorization under the INA. The INA requires H-2B employers to be certified to apply for additional H-2B visas. Employers that are found to have not met the requirements may be subject to an INA-based cap, which can restrict the number of foreign H-2B workers they are able to obtain from DHS each year. Under INA section 212, DHS is to screen petitions for H-2B eligibility based on a number of criteria, including a review of work authorization, wage requirements, transportation obligations, and other eligibility obligations. Once the DHS office processes the H-2B Visa, an H-2B employer must ensure that the H-2B employee, while working temporarily in the United States, works out of the H-2B employer office space within the United States and that the employee works for the H-2B employer during the 180-day period that the H-2B employer certifies to DHS every year. Employers must maintain records of the number of H-2B employees during the fiscal year, including an average daily wage for all H-2B employees. Employers must disclose to employees that they are H-2B employees. The INA allows employers to petition USCIS for a number of H-2B visas, including 500 H-2B employer petitions per year. The INA requires that H-2B employers, and their employees, file their H-2B- related documents with DHS annually and report their employment status every year. H-2B employers are required to track the number of H-2B employees currently on payroll. H-2B employers are also required to submit wage information to DHS. Additionally, INA \u00a7236(b) charges H-2", "This contract is for design and construction, testing, and commissioning of an Office of Safe Operations in Las Cruces, New Mexico. During the initial period of the contract, NNSA will assess contractor capabilities and evaluate the performance of the contractor. After that period, NNSA will assess the contractor\u2019s ability to provide services to NNSA through a set period of time. The contract has a total term of 13 years if NNSA exercises its Option Year 4. Additionally, NNSA will have the ability to renew this contract one additional time, up to 4 years.

The Treasury has the power to produce and distribute the currency. In 2017, the Federal Government spent about $1.3 billion on currency, resulting in a net annual benefit of about $650 million. This approach also reduced the need for the government to borrow money. Due to the difference between the cost of producing a coin versus the cost of producing a note, the government may save significantly in the long run by replacing the coin or the note with a coin.\nIn 2011, we recommended that Congress consider and pass proposals replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin along with elimination of the current $1 coin to ensure success of the coin. As we reported, a 30-year net benefit of 25+ billion dollars could be possible.", "The Director of Intelligence serves as head of the 17 IC elements; in addition the Intelligence Community Efficiency Studies Initiative provided intelligence community-wide efficiency and effectiveness analysis. In a memo of October 1, 2011 ODNI began transferring the management of the IC CAE program, which includes grant funding, to DIA. According to ODNI and DIA officials, ODNI officials are working to complete the transition in fiscal year 2020. The Intelligence Community Efficiency Studies Initiative was launched by ODNI to perform a study on the size, structure and functions of the ODNI. ODNI launched an Education & Training Initiative with DIA in 2010 as well as the Intelligence Community Efficiency Studies Initiative in 2011. Since the IC Intelligence Council was created in 2004, ODNI has been the lead organization of the IC Intelligence Work Group including the Intelligence Community Ethics Program, Intelligence Community Safety Work Group, and the Joint Information Analysis Center. According to ODNI officials, this work and many others have improved the intelligence community\u2019s efforts and ability to protect the United States. Since 2005 ODNI has been tasked with providing oversight to DIA\u2019s Foreign Language Academy as well as DIA\u2019s Foreign Language Program. As part of this role, ODNI has facilitated the Foreign Language Program\u2019s expansion with the creation of the ICFEL program which DIA Director of Foreign Language Operations started in Fiscal Year 2015. Since 2008 ODNI has been tasked with providing oversight and guidance to the DoD/ODNI/USDA/DoE/NHS/NHTSA/CDC\u2019s implementation of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to ensure the health and safety benefit of data collected through the program, according to ODNI officials. As part of this role, a new program was launched that has since been completed, the Federal Nutrition Surveillance System (FNS). During fiscal year 2020, ODNI facilitated the creation of a new program called the Immigrant Naturalization Initiative Program to assist Immigration and Naturalization Services with this new program. This effort included developing a comprehensive, comprehensive, data-based approach with goals and objectives for immigrant naturalization and training a diverse workforce in naturalization. During fiscal year 2019, ODNI worked with multiple partners like the DHS and State Department to streamline the legal process in the process of becoming a legal permanent resident by completing the application process online without the need to submit a paper application. The initiative\u2019s success is tracked in the DHS Statistical Profile of Lawful Permanent Residents Program which was the most visited immigration page for the past ten years. Since its creation in 1953, the Intelligence Community has been tasked with providing a wide range of services, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 intelligence collection, production, and distribution, threat assessment, and counterintelligence. Each of the intelligence organizations must establish a detailed annual plan, which each of the organizations must submit each fiscal year. According to ODNI officials, as soon as Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 begins, ODNI will be establishing a new structure for all intelligence organizations that will reflect their different roles and missions. The restructuring will include ODNI being renamed the Office of Intelligence Strategy and Threat Assessment and all of the Intelligence Community organizations will be renamed and be structured as \u201csubordinate organizations.\u201d The Intelligence Center of Excellence in Atlanta, Georgia is a new element of the Intelligence Community that includes five components: education, community outreach, training, technical assistance services through IC3 and IC4, and the Community Outreach Program.

A total of 43,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees stationed at approximately 440 commercial airports nationwide are responsible for inspecting individuals and belongings to prevent prohibited items on board an aircraft or into the airport sterile area. They operate an onboarding program that comprises a 100- hour training curriculum that is regularly updated through the National Training Plan, a 40-hour-on-the-job training opportunity for screeners, and ongoing professional training for front-line TSA employees. The TSA Academy established a re-training program called Mission Essential \u2013 Passenger Mitigation designed to provide training to TSO members in recognition of a threat posed by the threat group commonly known as The Islamic State. Evaluation methods included a course survey immediately after completing training and a survey on the program\u2019s impact on the agency. (1-2) TSO employees receive a 100- hour training curriculum tailored to aviation security, that includes 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60 hours of classroom practice, from which approximately 50% is related to passenger screening. Additionally, TSO employees are required to complete an on-the-job training examination. The training program is divided into two parts: initial hiring (approximately six months of classroom training) and ongoing training to maintain and expand their knowledge base. The National Training Plan is used to provide all TSOs with the necessary standard training requirements. In addition to an annual training examination, screeners also participate in a job-related examination. The level of examination depends on the screeners\u2019 level of experience. Level 1 trainees receive a written examination when they complete their first year. Level 2 trainees also receive a written examination when they complete their two first-year reviews. Level 3 trainees receive an online multiple-choice examination. The training courses TSOs receive are tailored to four categories of personnel: screeners (TSA TSO members), frontline employees (TSA Customer Service Representatives), information technology (IT) employees, and auxiliary employees (Auxiliary Police). TSOs receive various types of training, both initial hiring and ongoing training. All employees are required to keep up-to-date with ongoing training. TSO's are responsible for the screening of passengers and those boarding commercial aircraft. Training includes both classroom and training \"out of the classroom\" such as simulations and on-the-job training. They may receive additional additional training in specific subjects, such as: 1. Security - to include explosives detection and threat mitigation techniques. 2. Aviation/Airport Operations - checkpoints, processing and security clearances. 3. First Aid/Emergency Procedures/Cardiac Defibrillators. 4. Basic First Aid. 5) Behavioral/Sociological/Psychoanalytic training - to include how to recognize signs that someone may pose a terrorist threat. TSA employees are evaluated periodically during their employment and may receive a \"pass/no-pass\" grade based on their ability to perform in their current job. Additionally, they must pass a written examination, an online multiple-choice exam, or the TSA's job-based examination. The initial hiring for TSO employees includes a comprehensive background check (approximately 100 hours - 40 classroom/practise, followed by an annual physical examination and drug test). TSO employees are required to complete periodic re-training to maintain and broaden their knowledge base. According to TSA, an annual course on \"Meth/Aircraft Explosives Detection\" is required for all TSOs. Additionally, all TSA employees, including information technology, auxiliary, and frontline employees, must complete an annual training on Active Shooter. Those in the screening position in the airport would also receive additional training per airport regulations and protocols. TSOs are responsible for passenger and baggage screening by TSA officers and/or security personnel. The TSO training program includes classroom instruction and hands-on practical application. \"Initial hiring\" trainees receive approximately 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60 hours of practice. Approximately 40 hours of on-the-job training is provided to TSOs. In addition, TSOs are required to complete an annual on-the-job training examination. Each year, TSOs must also complete an out-of-classroom course on passenger and baggage security. Upon their initial hire, TSOs receive additional \"out of the classroom\" training, in addition to the on-the-job training. The training program includes both classroom instruction and hands-on practice, as well as 40 hours of on-the-job training.

FEDERAL COMPETENT ESTABLISHMENT: NATIONAL TRIBES MADE AN ARRESTING RIGHT OF PROPRIETORS BY THIRD CERTIFICATION OF THE TITLE FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. The federal executive branch\u2019s 2016 Executive Order (EO) 27,000 clarifies and supersedes the 2015 Executive Order (EO) 119,096 on Native American Graves Act (NAGA), which EO 1177 established at section 6(5) of the NHPA, authorizing Native American tribes and/or groups to take control of these and other federal lands within the United States if they have established a land trust relationship with the United States government. EO 11821 was amended by EO 12824, which further clarified the scope and application of EO 1197, and amended the scope, implementation details, and authorizations contained in the latter Executive Order. While EO 1197 was limited to non-Federal governmental and Native American lands, EO 11821 also encouraged private land owners, including Native American tribes, to enter into cooperative agreements with the government to provide for the management, use, and development of Federally-owned lands for Native American purposes. While the Executive Order did not extend specific rights for non-Indians (for example, Article, 18 U.S.C. \u00a73508), the President also expanded by Order 30,000, the Department of the Interior\u2019s role in administering Native American lands through the establishment of an account on behalf of Indian nations. This account serves as the depository for any funds resulting from Native American lands taken or appropriated by Congressional action, including funds established in the account by the Secretary of the Interior at the time he or she deems it appropriate to disburse funds from the account because of tribal land withdrawals. In August 2018, the National Conference called by the United States Secretary of the Interior to address issues in Indian lands and infrastructure management. The Department of the Interior\u2019s 2018 report, Improving Federal Infrastructure Management: Strengthening Access to Native American Lands and Infrastructures, concluded that the Department\u2019s management of infrastructure and real property on Native American lands has been deficient. Specifically, the report found that: (1) There is limited coordination among Indian nations and their respective agencies with infrastructure development; (2) little coordination exists among the Department of the Interior, its programs, and Indian nations; and (3) the Department was not properly utilizing existing federal funds for infrastructure projects that occurred on Native American lands. However, the report found that efforts the Department of the Interior and its partners made toward Indian infrastructure development have improved the infrastructure situation for Native American communities. The report also recommended the Secretary of the Treasury, as the \u201cfederal funding stream\u201d of revenues to the Department of the Interior that the President has been permitted to exercise under the act; and Secretary of the Treasury, as an \u201cagency\u201d in compliance with Public Law 94-563, the Department of Interior and Treasury, which requires financial transactions on federal lands to be processed and managed by federal agencies. Since 1997, we have provided Congress reports, on-the-spot inspections, and interviews with federal officials, tribal leaders, tribal members, Department of the Treasury employees, and others. With the result of the 2018 study in mind, we have also interviewed and provided reports to congressional committees and the Department of the Treasury staff, who oversee Indian lands. This is the 12th \u201cARPA Case Files\u201d in the series. In addition to finding that: * The Department of Interior (DOI) is the largest tribal landholder in the United States, and thus has a major role in tribal lands management, although DOI is not a federal land grant trust: While DOI may hold land in exchange for easements, it does not have to maintain the land trust obligations when it manages land in conjunction with tribal lands. In 2006, DOI established a new law to create a trust for tribal lands.

DOD's implementation plan fully addressed two of the five elements required by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 14. According to our assessment and conversations with DOD officials in April 2017, these two elements were the responsibility (who will inventory, track, and manage stocks at each site, and how often will it update its inventory) of the Department of Defense and specifically the prepositioned stock programs. However, DOD does not formally include these two elements in a comprehensive inventory of the department\u2019s prepositioned materiel and equipment programs. Element four (prerequisites and conditions for implementing the plan, partially addressed). The plan addresses the need for DOD to build a cohesive implementation plan incorporating all of its mission-critical processes and procedures to ensure the DOD will have the appropriate capability to support the warfighting mission and the readiness of our force. Elements five through seven of the report's text are dedicated only to the Department of Defense's implementation plan. The text is not fully applicable, given that DOD does not have any procedures to comprehensively list each of the prepositioned stock programs the department maintains. The current requirements of the text, which include listing each prepositioned stock programs the department maintains in its annual report to Congress, address the implementation of a plan, which is not addressed by the text. 14-8 - Prepositioning Stock Implementation Guide In accordance with guidance provided in the April 2012 report of the Commission to Assess National Security to the military departments (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC), and in accordance with the request of the Departmental Council for Management, Acquisition, and Financial Management (DCMA) for certain items that are of significance to the IC, the Army Materiel Command (AMC), Navy Logistics Command (NLC), and Marine Corps Logistics Command (MCLC) developed a guide, in-depth assessment of the Army\u2019s prepositioning stock systems, systems for tracking materiel in theater and other systems for processing, receiving, storing, and tracking Army materiel items. This guide is included in Army-wide guidance regarding processes that will reduce the processing time necessary to track Army materials into the supply chain and furthering efficiencies in the Army\u2019s supply chain. The guidance will also enhance the efficiency of Army logistical and material support to combat forces on the battlefield. It requires Department-wide consistency in the processes utilized to track Army materiel items. This document is the result of a study conducted by the Commission to Assess National Security (CNAN) in connection with the requirements of DOD Directive 4-11, dated 1 April 2002. DOD recognizes, however, that the report was produced by the Command\u2019s Defense Materiel Acquisition Management Office Information System Infrastructure (DMA). Nevertheless, DOD must respond to any criticism of the report, and it has been done. In 2017, Army leadership developed a comprehensive report addressing questions or concerns expressed in an April 2011 report to the Commission to Assess National Security by Dr. Robert J. Stasio entitled \u201cPrepositioning Stock Implementation Guide\u201d. The report defines terms such as \u201cComprehensive Report on Prepositioning Stock Implementation Plan\u201d which are not included in DOD\u2019s Report. Dr. Stasio\u2019s analysis identified Army-wide policy gaps and specific policy flaws. He stated, in part, in paragraph 2, under the section entitled \u201cInadequate Planning for Logistics at the Battlefield level\u201d which is not included in DOD\u2019s Report, he found Army\u2019s logistic planning inadequate for handling and storing Army\u2019s \u201cunpredictable\u201d supply chain with its \u201cunrealistic\u201d delivery commitments. The current Army policy that requires a minimum requirement level for Army logistic stockpiles, as well as Army policies and procedures governing the deployment and management of Army prepositioned stockpiles, could not prevent the Army from running out of parts that should have been readily available. He stated that Army prepositioning stockpiles must be replenished on a minimum weekly schedule to ensure readiness. Army logistics stockpiles must be replenished within a certain amount of time from the date these items were delivered to the 4th Infantry Division. To implement prepositioning stockpiles, the Army must have adequate systems in place to provide replenishment of Army stockpiles. For Army prepositioning stockpile items, the Army should have sufficient inhouse systems to manage, track, and maintain Army stockpiles. Army Logistics Command has processes for managing Army stockpiles and should ensure they are in place in all Army logistics installations and all field locations. Army equipment and personnel must be scheduled and deployed in a manner similar to Army of the Pacific and Army of the Rhine. The Army should have sufficient in house systems to track Army stockpiles and Army logistics and personnel systems to deploy or maintain Army equipment. The Army must have an adequate supply chain system so that Army stockpiles, items, and personnel are available.

This report provides an introduction to sustainability in the chemical industry, focusing on the terms used. Sustainability terminology can have many interpretations depending on the context in which these words are used. Some terms used have been misinterpreted by some stakeholders or have been completely new to others in the chemical industry. This report concludes with some important takeaway messages. Chemical products are made from chemicals and materials that have been modified by scientists, transformed or manipulated throughout a variety of processes and procedures at facilities across the nation and, in some cases, across the world. They are sold to a variety of customers, from large manufacturing companies to specialized distributors, who are seeking to develop or improve products to meet their individual market segments. Chemical suppliers supply the facilities that develop these products. Each product, from a can of soup to a set of dishes, undergoes a unique set of processes to create a consumer product. Many consumers consider product sustainability when making purchasing deisions, so many chemical suppliers are turning to sustainability management to promote sustainability and minimize impact on consumers. Sustainability is no longer about the use of fossil fuels. The chemical industry produces a variety of products with sustainable ingredients, recycled or renewable materials, renewable electrical systems for operating their buildings, and even green roofs and skylights to reduce sunlight through photosynthesis. This report provides a guide for chemical suppliers and manufacturers to get started and/or improve on current best practices while also promoting sustained market growth. The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s (DoL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration Laboratory (OSHA-L) found that chemical products are some of the most hazardous and potentially dangerous materials on the market these days. The fact that chemical products can cause harm to people and/or the environment is very real. The Department of the Army\u2019s Weapons Project Officer (WPO) reported in 2004 that (i) in the past 75 years, the Army has used thousands of chemicals to create weapons, and (ii) the Army currently uses more than 22,000 chemicals for their products. In this report, you will learn some of the challenges that chemical suppliers and manufacturers are facing. Some of these challenges include increasing market demand for chemically derived renewable products, balancing the product\u2019s cost to manufacture at current price points with the customer\u2019s willingness to purchase at a higher cost (e.g., environmental considerations, \u201cgreen\u201d products, or green chemistry), understanding the current marketplace trends in this marketplace, and identifying the \u2026 Chemical industry is facing product diversity for commercial success.

They might be recommended when a person with obesity is unable to lose weight due to other underlying medical conditions or in some cases, despite efforts made by the patient. However, there are side effects and they can be costly. The most common side effects for obesity drugs are headaches, nausea, and headaches. More serious side effects that can occur include dry mouth, diarrhea, and changes in heart rate. On average, the average weight loss for people taking obesity drugs is relatively high (a 5-10% reduction in body mass), but there is significant variability between individuals. Obesity drugs work with patients who try them, but their effects may be better outcomes for those who understand how the medications work, and take the medication and other necessary steps. A 2018 review of 28 randomized controlled trials concluded that no prescription obesity drugs currently available are as effective as a low-calorie diet. A review of 201 clinical trials, however, found that some patients did see improvements in symptoms, body weight, and diabetes with prescription obesity drugs. However, the review also noted that the clinical results could not provide evidence on which drugs were used long-term most effectively to keep body weight steady, or on which drugs could prevent the development and progression of obesity. The review also suggested these drugs could provide benefits for people with obesity, but more research was needed. In addition, other studies have suggested that obesity medications may help people lose weight better when incorporated with diet and physical activity. Therefore, as with any treatment, individualized approaches with their unique risks may help those treating with obesity. Obesity drugs can help individuals; they were intended to help with maintaining a body weight that is within the \u201cacceptable limits\u201d\u2014a body size that was no larger than what is considered healthy or safe for most people. When the medications are put with diet and exercise plans, they can be used to help those with obesity. The medications are prescribed by healthcare providers and can be combined with other treatments including exercise, diet, and behavioral change. However, these medications alone are not a solution for treating obesity. They may need to be combined with lifestyle changes that include healthy eating habits, exercise, and physical behavior. The use of obesity medications may come at an additional cost, so patients should be fully informed of the side effects and any associated costs. Their use may also help some individuals understand their underlying cause of obesity. The side effects of these medications can be quite serious. On average, the average weight loss for individuals receiving obesity drugs was 5 percent. If the medications are used correctly, they may cause a loss of more than any other component of weight loss. However, their benefits may not be seen in all patients. Many experts noted that obesity alone cannot be treated, but rather the patient needs to have a low-calorie diet and increased physical activity. In addition, these medications were prescribed to be used in conjunction with diet, exercise, and counseling. The medications may be recommended when a patient is unable to lose weight due to certain medical conditions or medications that are being used. For those who are able to lose weight with these drugs, the financial cost may be lower for the prescription than using a meal delivery program. However, the cost of a meal delivery regimen was lower for some people, who had to purchase it themselves. It is important for both medical providers and patients to work collaboratively on weight loss. Physicians may be able to help patients develop an action plan and identify the best approach for weight loss and any side effects. Patients should be cautious about these medications as some were prescribed for those who had a history of type II diabetes, yet these medications had no effect on controlling the disorder. Most obese patients do not benefit from obesity medications, and most medications have no effect on weight or physical symptoms of obesity. The medications do generally have a \u201cplacebo effect\u201d and can reduce the symptoms of obesity. Although obesity can be treated with lifestyle change, diet, and exercise, medical providers may prescribe obesity medication if a patient does not lose weight over time, or if they are obese despite lifestyle changes. According to guidelines recommended by national organizations, physicians should consider prescribing obesity medications to patients whose body mass index or body fat percentile is >27, have comorbidities such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and sleep apnea, or who have not achieved clinical meaningful weight loss after adequate diet, exercise, and behavior change counseling. Obesity drugs act with different effects on everyone, and should work well when used in conjunction with a healthy diet, exercise, and counseling. The medications are intended to be a part of the patient\u2019s obesity management plan, and they do not replace it. 10-01-2019 07:38:49 PM 2 of 4 Last Updated: 10-24-2019 08:39:44 PM Posted by: Susan R. 20 months, 4 weeks ago Flag as Inappropriate Flag as InappropriateYou are currently viewing page 1 of 4", "In September 2017, Category 5 hurricanes hit the USVI, causing catastrophic damage across the entire territory and neighboring islands. These hurricanes resulted in the destruction of critical infrastructure, which resulted in significant long-term economic impacts and unemployment. To support economic recovery, FEMA, states, and territories provide Public Assistance funds to assist with the repair or reconstruction of critical infrastructure and eligible expenses such as hazard mitigation work. FEMA administers the public assistance program, including managing project scope, requirements, and payments to the subrecipient. The 2018 Disaster Recovery and Resilience Task Force Report indicates that hurricanes can cause an average of $1.4 billion in economic losses each year. The National Response and Recovery Framework mandates that federal organizations work with state and local governments to assist with community-level costs (see fig. 1).

FEMA awards public assistance grants (PAGs) to state, territorial, and local governments; public non-profit organizations; and other categories of entities that suffered economic damages as a result of the natural disaster in order to rebuild or repair eligible public infrastructure and repair or rebuild damage to eligible owner-occupied dwelling structures or the repair cost of equipment, furniture, and/or trade tools used for repairs/rebuilds that were directly caused by the disaster (see fig. 2). FEMA provides financial assistance to restore the economy and rebuild infrastructure after a major disaster. In some cases, FEMA may directly reimburse subrecipients to complete or repair their facilities. In response to Tropical Storms Irene and Matthew in 2011, FEMA made $1.14 billion in Community Assistance and Disaster Recovery (CDAR) funding available to individuals, households, businesses and nonprofits, and tribal governments affected by hurricanes throughout the Northeast and Southeast. In response to Supertyphoon Yolanda in The Philippines in 2013, FEMA made more than $2 billion in CDAR funding available to individuals, households, businesses, and nonprofits, and state and local governments in response to the storm. A total of $900 million in CDAR funding was used to repair or rebuild critical public infrastructure and eligible residential housing. In 2015, The National Review article on the 2016 Texas Superstorm described the $2.6 billion in FEMA funding for repair of public infrastructure that were destroyed during the hurricane, including roads and bridges (see fig. 15). 12 In response to Irma in Florida in 2017, FEMA made more than $1 billion in CDAR funding available to state and local governments to assist the recovery effort. FEMA also made direct financial assistance to rebuild or repair eligible critical public infrastructure, including a total investment of $16 billion to assist with rebuilding homes, infrastructure, and economic development. More than $5 billion in FEMA funding was available to rebuild or repair homes. Approximately 5 percent of the housing inventory was destroyed. The total amount of FEMA CDAR funding disbursed for Public Assistance in 2017 was more than $9 billion, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total Public Assistance expenditures during FY 2016-2017, according to a FEMA press release on July 18, 2017. FEMA Public Assistance funding is available in", "To facilitate transactions of individuals interacting with Federal systems, organizations rely on identity proofing in the form of either a remote web-based application or a knowledge-based examination. Both methods utilize specialized services, including CRAs who provide personal information and answer questions about credit, employment record, or other information. Organizations use a variety of techniques to confirm and verify information, including asking applicants detailed questions, their password, etc.", "Older adults in the United States are well served by a comprehensive retirement system with many federal components. Most of these components are currently facing financial risks, but the first pillar, Social Security, has the challenge of keeping up with demographic trends. This means increasing the number and diversity of contributions and increasing resources available to make good the system\u2019s long-term financial needs. To address this challenge, Congress currently (2017) requires an annual report to the DOL on the costs, premiums, and payroll taxes collected by the Social Security program. The DOL report will also assess the feasibility of extending Social Security to younger workers and its ability to adequately meet the retirement needs of a growing nation. Most current funding to the Social Security Trustee Account comes from payroll taxes collected from Americans, while employers and employees pay approximately $4 billion annually and are obligated to contribute a matching amount each year just to get the cash benefits sent from their employees. Employers pay about $5 billion a year, which is in addition to the payroll taxes they pay to support the system\u2019s benefits, putting the total employer contribution at almost twice the payroll tax amount. The total payroll tax amount contributed to the program by individuals will be about $8.3 billion a year for next year and approximately $9.5 billion a year of the coming decade. It will take even more funds to ensure the program can meet the system\u2019s goals. While there is a simple answer to balancing the expenses of any particular system, balancing the expenses of a system that is both complex and diverse is extremely difficult. The same situation now exists within each pillar of the retirement system. The second pillar, employer-sponsored plans, are an important resource in ensuring that everyone has access to retirement savings, but they are often outmatched by the individual contributions of participants. Employer plans must be part of any package of retirement benefits required to support the Social Security system in light of declining number of companies offering such benefits. While employers provide retirement benefits, they currently do not have to save to meet those payments and are not obligated to do so under any law. This omission is particularly difficult to justify because employers are required by law to save in traditional defined benefit (DB) plans, even though these systems are less economically viable. According to the Institute for International Trade, there were approximately 21 million Americans out of work in 2015. Approximately half a million employers provide DB benefits for their employees. Of approximately 11 million Americans out of work, just over 7.2 million of them had access to DB benefits. Approximately 8 million of them had savings in these plans as well. However, only 3.1 million of them had the benefit to save for their future retirement. Employers should be more responsive to the retirement needs of their employees, but current legal requirements in the ERISA act make it difficult for them to do so. As in other aspects of the system, the second pillar of employer sponsored plans is ill equipped to meet the system\u2019s demographic demands. The third pillar, individual savings accounts, has historically done a poor job of serving as a source of income for people during retirement. At approximately $90 billion a year, they provide less than less than one-third of the income people will typically need to sustain the lifestyle they have adjusted to in retirement. The main problem is they are not designed to cover a full range of retirement needs, including medical costs for many Americans. Currently, many people are expected to spend their retirement savings on health care, housing, and other needs. The fourth pillar, which serves as the main source of benefits for the program's roughly 7.7 million private-sector retirees, is the only pillar that can be easily funded on an on-going basis. This is particularly difficult for the self-insured employer groups to do because insurance industry profitability is driven as it is a highly competitive market with no government risk pool. The system must be kept open for a long time, because many Americans\u2019 retirements will span a period of 25\u201330 years before they can become eligible to receive benefits (see Appendix D). This means the trust fund will need to accumulate substantially more than the income needed to pay benefits in order to continue to provide its benefits. The major challenge on both sides of the system, including the fifth pillar (private health insurance) and the sixth pillar (retirement pensions), is that many individuals are increasingly moving out of the system before their eligibility for benefits begins (see Appendix E). In addition, financial markets have little experience managing income streams of this size, so insurance companies have particular difficulties in insuring these claims. The last pillar, the PBGC, is designed to help maintain the financial integrity of defined benefit (DB) plans to protect participants from the risks of a financially impaired industry or other firms. In light of the shrinking number of DB plans, which now represent just over two percent of employers that offer defined benefit plans, a challenge is for the PBGC to continue to administer these plans without becoming financially insolvent", "FHA provides a number of insurance products, including single-family housing insurance and a mortgage insurance program. To support these programs, the agency requires mortgage servicers to pay certain fees and undergo certain requirements regarding property preservation, maintenance, and general safety. FHA\u2019s requirements also include a number of specific steps to ensure properties meet safety and conveyance standards. FHA reimburses mortgage servicers for certain costs related to these requirements. To protect homeowners, HUD regulations state that FHA servicers must obtain good and marketable title or complete CWCOT procedures within 30 days of the date of the foreclosure deed, whichever occurs sooner. If an extension is required, HUD will inform the servicer but will not revoke its approval of the closure certificate until HUD receives proof the title was conveyed. FHA may withhold payments to the servicer for CWCOT and/or property preservation expenses until the servicer submits to HUD the specified information and documents.", "In early 2017, Congress awarded DOD prototype other transaction authority to use it as a tool for rapidly providing prototype other transactions for commercial, research, or prototyping purposes. DOD used the authorization in section 2371b of title 10 to award prototype other transactions to companies that were not traditional defense contractors, including firms with fewer than 50% subcontracted hours on federal contracts valued at $25,000 or more. DOD also used the authority to award prototype other transactions with an increased percentage of subcontracted hours if the prototype of design, manufacture, or engineering of a product being produced was 25% or more lower cost than existing government contracting rates. In March 2018, DOD announced it had revised the guide to include new and evolving rules, procedures, and examples related to prototype other transactions. A November 2018 report, Other Transaction Guide for Prototype Projects, provides general information on planning, evaluating, and awarding prototype other transactions, as well as lessons learned to help agreements officers when awarding other transactions. In September 2019, DOD issued an updated briefing on the use of other transactions and the DoD\u2019s 2018 Other Transaction Guide to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(ATR)). The report also clarified that: an agreements officer should consider whether a company is supplying a key technology, making a material increase in the performance of a product, or making or designing an existing product. If a non-traditional company or non-profit research institution is making a significant contribution to prototype development or product design, it will normally be reimbursed for its costs. However, a company making a significant contribution will generally not be reimbursed for its costs. A company can be reimbursed for indirect prototype costs such as wages, rent, electricity, and maintenance expenses associated with a prototype other transaction. The guide states this reimbursement applies only if the costs are directly attributable to prototype aspects, such as design-to-build work, and the costs occur while a prototype other transaction is the subject of a contract or a potential contract. DOD has updated its guide to include information on the maximum amount of expenses an non-traditional company or non-profit research institution can receive per hour of work. In March 2018, DOD updated its Other Transaction Guide to describe prototype other transaction guidelines such as defining prototypes, the scope of work for the prototype, prototype work authorization process, and use of prototype for commercial purposes. The guide also addressed the following: prototype products must conform to specified standards, technical requirements, and other performance requirements; prototype products must undergo initial development and performance testing; each prototype product must be separately priced (even in cases where prototype other transactions are performed on existing contracts); contractors are not required to submit a prototype other transaction prior to execution of a new contract or order or a modification of an existing contract; prototype product design and manufacturing costs are reimbursable. The September 2019 guidance also clarified that: an agreement cannot extend performance for more than 5 years; if an agreement was with a small business, the number of small business subcontracts was limited or restricted based on the type of work performed; and an agreement that is awarded to a commercial or non-profit entity, although designated a \u201cmodel contract\u201d, was subject to the restrictions and prohibitions in section 2371b.", "In response to the COVID-19 national public health and economic crisis, $2.7 trillion in federal spending has been disbursed as of May 31, 2020.

KEY FIGURES: Year", "MDA is responsible for designing, developing, and producing certain classified components to meet the ballistic missile defense mission. The agency currently manages an untold number of complex systems, and because of the cost, schedule, and performance baselines for each element that must be established, the BMDS is not able to meet its stated mission due to multiple reasons. For example, MDA claimed they could establish baselines in 27 months, but they have established baselines in 68 months or exceeded 27 months. The BMDS mission includes development, maintenance, and operation of ballistic missile defense systems, and MDA's performance has slowed due to the large number of components for which they must establish initial performance baselines. Due to the complexity of MDA's programs, MDA\u2019s lack of definition and implementation of BMDS development processes, and MDA's inability to establish BMDS development and production schedules, we made several recommendations to improve the BMDS program.

Agencies are required to implement rigorous safeguards and protective measures to ensure their cyber networks and systems are maintained in a secure and resilient manner. Agencies with higher risk (federal information systems and networks [FIRES]) are required to: 1) develop a risk management strategy to identify high-risk systems, and 2) implement procedures to assess and mitigate specific risks. Agencies with medium risk (federal applications and services, including those with limited systems, applications, and other non-residential functions) are required to: 1) develop a risk management strategy to identify high-risk systems, 2) implement procedures to assess and manage the unique risks of these systems, 3) evaluate security countermeasures regularly to ensure effective countermeasures are in place, 4) develop and deploy incident response plans for the management of major system events/interruptions/service disruptions, and 5) address each system to ensure compliance with FISMA. Agencies with lower risk (federal application or servers) 24\nSUMMARY of TEXT: Federal agencies depend on computerized information systems and electronic data to process, maintain, and report essential information, as well as maintain and operate their physical processes. Virtually all federal operations are supported by these cyber assets, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their missions and account for their resources without these cyber assets. Hence, the security of these systems and data is vital to public confidence and the Nation's economic, national security and personal privacy and safety. However, computer networks and systems used by federal agencies can be riddled with security vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. These systems are interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the internet, thereby increasing the number of avenues of attack. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact federal agencies and their information systems. According to DHS' U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), agencies reported 31,107 information security incidents in FY 2018. These incidents involved various threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. Agencies have to safeguard information systems and networks to protect federal resources against malicious attackers. The following are recommended to ensure computer networks are secure and resilient. They should include regularly updated security protocols and procedures, use of an integrated security management system, and implementation of a risk management plan. Federal agencies also need to assess their cyber networks and develop a strategic framework document to guide these assessments. The framework should align with security requirements and address FISMA compliance as implemented by the DHS and other Federal Government agencies. FISMA (the Federal Information Security Management Act) generally allows Federal information systems to implement an operational framework and processes to manage and protect information system vulnerabilities, including those resulting in: A breach or unauthorized failure affecting computer systems, including virtual private networks (VPNs); information stored or transmitted outside the country; malicious or inadvertent actions of Federal employees violating Federal information system security policies; unstructured data and unstructured data; systems that do not follow a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) secure and information-processing architecture (NISC); or other information or data to be used in a malicious manner. GAO and DHS have made information about FISMA available to the public on their websites. DHS advises FISMA requires all information systems to use the FISMA Authorizing, Configuring, Monitoring, Security Assessing, and Incident Management (or FISMA 7, in DHS-speak) framework to identify specific information system security controls that systems need to maintain to ensure the security of information systems to satisfy FISMA obligations. Agencies should regularly assess the status of all data stores, access controls on systems, user account passwords and access logs, system and user activity monitoring, and security of systems, applications, and data. The Security Manual of the DHS Office of Chief Information Security Officer (OCIS) was revised to include information about DHS FISMA requirements. In addition, DHS also has a FISMA-based FISMA Self Assessment Tool\u2014FISMA Assessment for IT Systems\u2014that can provide information about how Federal systems adhere to security requirements. DHS also requires all Federal information systems to use a self-certifying FISMA-based application. DHS also offers an FISMA Resource Library with more than 450 resources (and growing) on various technical topics to help Federal agencies and systems to manage and maintain their FISMA-related systems and processes. Agencies (except OMB) are required to use the DHS FISMA-based FISMA Certification Assessment to ensure compliance with their FISMA requirements. Agencies must also use a self-certifying FISMA Certification Assessment 24\nSUMMARY of TEXT: Federal agencies across Federal Government perform various mission-critical operations that rely on the reliability of data processes", "In 2004, the FHWA initiated research to determine the most common causes, and potential strategies of crashes among medium and heavy trucks, and is currently using these strategies to develop the Highway Safety Research and Development Program (HSRDP).

The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has strong incentives for manufacturers to make discounts affordable to Medicaid beneficiaries. The amount of rebate provided by manufacturers for Medicaid beneficiaries varies based on a variety of factors, including cost per dose, price paid by federal grantees to manufacturers, and current price paid by pharmaceutical providers. HRSA and CMS provide oversight and guidance to the drug manufacturer community while collecting rebates and redistributing them to a variety of stakeholders. States, health systems, and other organizations work together to implement this system to ensure that the lowest-income Medicaid recipients have access to lifesaving drugs. The 340B program uses these strategies to deliver its vision: improved pharmaceutical care for Medicaid beneficiaries.

Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HRSA uses an internal dataset to collect data on each beneficiary\u2019s prescription coverage and manufacturer payments under the Drug Coverage Assurance Program. For each year, HRSA identifies and reports payments to manufacturers for each product used by each Medicaid beneficiary. In addition, HRSA also reports manufacturer-payer relationships, which would allow Medicaid-dependent patients (who were previously uninsured) to pay for drugs in an out-of-pocket manner if their state Medicaid coverage is insufficient. In some cases, Medicaid will pay for drugs in these situations as long as they are covered by drug coverage or a co-payment plan with drug coverage. In all cases, Medicaid will verify its beneficiary\u2019s need for its medical coverage benefit before responding to a claim. Medicaid coverage varies based on state regulations and policies. Each state must have a process in place to provide Medicaid rebates in order for them to continue payment to manufacturers when a manufacturer requests it. The 340B program allows rebates to be made from drug manufacturers directly to Medicaid patients, but a state must have procedures in place to collect these rebates. All drug-payors, including physicians, who give prescriptions from Medicaid beneficiaries must disclose to Medicaid claims processing the amount of drugs-filled and medication-filled prescriptions. The amount of drugs-filled prescription and medication-filled prescription for Medicaid-dependent beneficiaries must be reported for each type of medication prescribed. A drug manufacturer would not be required to keep a record of each type of medication prescribed for an individual Medicaid patient, but will need to report the number and dollar amount of all medications supplied for Medicaid patients. The 340B Program includes several different types of drugs-filled prescriptions, which are defined in the program\u2019s Payment Standards Rule. In addition to physician claims, Medicaid payments are also required for pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 sales of their drugs. The law applies to all pharmaceutical manufacturers, including those whose drugs are included in 340B basket products. The 340B Program may also apply to pharmaceutical wholesalers, distributors, and intermediaries or manufacturers who sell their drugs to physicians or pharmacies outside of 340B. In addition, each manufacturer must report their annual sales to Medicare. The 340B program also includes prescription drugs and medical biological products that are not in the 340B basket, but are on the Medicaid formularly, and may also be covered by Medicaid. A drug manufacturer will be required to provide information about whether a particular drug is listed on the payment standard unless that payment standard has been waived or excluded. HRSA\u2019s Clinical and Transactional Data Elements Reporting Specification, which includes more detailed information about Medicaid-related (such as payment) data elements, must be used for all products required to be entered into the Drug-Coverage Assurance Program. The FDA is responsible for monitoring compliance to all aspects of the payment standards for manufacturers. Each manufacturer must report product specific information to HRSA, such as the manufacturer\u2019s name and contact information, manufacturer\u2019s address, and the product name and type to be measured. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of product-level information, which can also be found at HRSA. When a manufacturer is listed in the payment standard, they must inform HRSA of their manufacturers\u2019 list. Additionally, manufacturer payments and reimbursement are reported for all drugs included in the 340B basket using the U.S Office of Healthcare Information Technology (US-OHIT) Health IT. These U.S.-specific information and data components must be used in lieu of existing and currently-used CMS products.

Only 52 percent of non-TS/EG veterans found coverage readily available. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in TRICARE health plan ratings. In 2019, ratings for outpatient primary care providers in TSS were 28 percent, with 88 percent of veterans reporting TRICARE health plans readily available. In primary care and mental health care provider ratings, 83 percent and 72 percent of veterans reported readily available mental health care, respectively, representing statistically significant differences from the 2017/2018 survey. (See table 1.) There were statistically significant differences in the ratings of three types of providers in TRICARE: primary care providers, specialty care providers, and mental health care providers. In particular, we found a statistically significant decrease in primary care providers ratings to 68 percent (on a scale of one to ten). (See table 2.) In the three types of providers we tested, most statistically significant differences came with regard to how often TRICARE beneficiaries experienced problems locating civilian providers. Over 80 percent of TSS participants found civilian health care providers available, compared to just over one-third of non-TS/EG veterans from the 2017/2018 surveys. In the civilian provider ratings, there was a statistically significant difference in the ratings of outpatient primary care providers, with an estimated 38 percent of TSS individuals readily available. In contrast, there is no statistically significant difference in primary care provider ratings for the 2017/2018 and 2019 surveys for in-patient treatment centers, and less than 40 percent of veterans located a civilian provider for mental health care. In the civilian provider ratings of outpatient primary care providers, a statistically significant difference occurred where 81 percent of TSS individuals readily available civilian providers compared to approximately 67 percent of non-TS/EG veterans. In contrast, there is no statistically significant difference in these ratings for primary care and mental health care providers. There were also statistically significant differences in civilians ratings to locate civilian primary care providers and to locate civilian mental health care providers, whereas TSS veterans rated their civilian access to civilian primary care providers and Tss veterans rated their civilian access to civilian mental health care providers. We found statistically significant difference in TSS veterans\u2019 ratings, as opposed to non-TSS veterans, of primary care provider ratings from the 2018/2017 surveys to the 2019 survey. TSS veterans had an average rating of 83 percent one year prior, statistically significantly higher than their 68 percent average rating in the 2019 survey. (See table 3.) There were statistically significant differences in TSS and non-TSS Veterans\u2019 ratings of mental health care provider ratings. In the TRICARE survey, TSS veterans experienced statistically significant higher rates of being able to get timely treatment for mental health issues (91\u201388 percent of TSS veterans vs 81 percent of non-TSS veterans) and of being able to get counseling for mental health issues (96 of TSS veterans vs 84 percent of overall TRICARE patients). The non-TSS/EG veterans reported experiencing problems with mental health care provider ratings slightly more readily available (88 percent), with 52 percent of non-TSS/EG veterans rated as readily available. In the civilians ratings of mental health care provider rating we found statistically significant differences between TSS and non-TSS/EG individuals for primary care and mental health care providers in 2018 and statistically significant differences for both groups in 2019. (See table 4). In 2019, no statistically significant findings occurred among TSS veterans for primary care providers, whereas non-TSS/EG veterans faced statistically significant differences in their ratings of primary care and mental health care providers. After transitioning to TRICARE Select in 2019, both the civilian ratings of in-patient treatment center providers and the in-patient rating of mental health care providers decreased in both cases from 82 percent prior to transition, back to 80 percent and 90 percent respectively. In particular, there were statistically significant differences in \u201cinpatient rates of psychiatric diagnoses\u201d (TSS = 11 percent, non-TSS/EG = 13 percent) and the percentage of veterans that had a mental health care visit within the previous quarter (TSS = 42 percent, non-TSS/EG = 70 percent), as well as TSS rating of availability of mental health services in provider\u2019s offices within the last six months of TRICARE Select 2019 (86 percent), although statistically \u201cun-significant\u201d for TSS veterans in 2019, they received comparable", "Executive Order 12898 and the MOU require EPA to develop a strategic plan on environmental justice that addresses disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards on racial, ethnic, and low-income populations. Agencies will also work on developing a framework for identifying and assessing disproportionately high health and environmental hazards and adverse effects of policies, programs, and activities. In the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Annual Report on the National Human Health Objectives and Environmental Justice Program, the EPA has recognized a 26-case National Environmental Justice Program as one of the most significant environmental justice programs in the country. The EPA will conduct a midterm review in 2015 to assess whether the goals and objectives of the Program are on track for achieving environmental justice outcomes.\nEnvironmental justice is a national policy developed to ensure that federal agencies collaborate with interagency working groups to improve equitable environmental outcomes by addressing disproportionate environmental burdens borne by minority and low-income communities. Since 1994, this partnership has been reinforced with $7.1 million in federal funding. Agencies have also recognized the need to address disproportionately high and adverse health and environmental impacts by developing frameworks for identifying and assessing them. One example (EPA case) is the National Environmental Justice Program, which recognizes environmental justice outcomes. EPA will conduct a midterm review in 2015 to assess goals and objectives of the program.", "1995 \u2013 2018 Total Grant Obligations vs. 2018 Grant Obligations Source: DOL, Grants.gov. In the three agencies, the cost is broken down for grantee reporting and compliance obligations, including those needed to comply with the Stevens Amendment. For example, OGM costs for grants reporting requirements are divided between three components: 1. Grantee reporting requirements (including Stevens) 2. Grantee information updates by grantee 3. Electronic reporting capabilities. According to ETA, its costs in reporting Stevens coverage totaled $11,000 for FY 2017 and $13,000 in FY 2018. According to OGM officials, its cost for grantee reporting requirements was roughly $20 per grantee. The National Research Association (NRAP), which conducts research on funding opportunities for nonprofit organizations, estimates that the cost of compliant reporting by grantees to federal agencies in 2017 was $3.2 billion, according to the Census Bureau. For the cost of compliance with the Stevens Amendment, these agencies told us their costs were between $40 million and $50 million. We could not separately identify the costs of compliance due to OGM\u2019s $11,000 reporting per grantee per year, and also $3.2 billion for 2017 and 2018, which we use as a proxy. We found the cost breakdown to be comparable across \u201cgrantee-based\u201d grant programs. In fiscal year 2017, DOL awarded approximately $64.9 billion in grants to individuals, businesses, non-profit entities, and governments. However, according to our analysis of FY 2017 grant award data and interviews with DOL grant program officials, none of the agencies have received significant amounts from grantees to comply with the Stevens Amendment, which is designed for grantee reporting and grantee information [sic] updates. All are required to administer compliance reporting requirements. One exception to reporting requirements is that grantee-based programs, including the WorkSource system, required the grantee to report a small fee (that exceeds minimum wage currently) given by an employer. However, in recent years, ETA officials stated that they have no data on grantee reporting per grantee per year, although they said approximately 1.3 million individuals and businesses per year report grantee information annually. In contrast, we saw that grant programs typically require grantees, grantee-based programs included, and grantees (i.e. DOL, OGM) to report grantee-based grantee information per year. These costs (1) are also subject to a statutory fee. Specifically, HHS\u2019s costs for administering a grant fund and a separate grant cost per grantee vary by grant program, and the costs range from $5000 to $10,000. According to OGM officials, the cost incurred for administrative reporting by grantee in FY 2017 was roughly $11,000, and it has decreased to about $7,500 per grantee per year. It is important to note that only the grant award portion of grant funding is counted in the overall costs; all administrative costs are federally funded. In September 2005, OCHHS received additional statutory authority to audit the WorkSource system. According to DOL officials, they have conducted multiple audits of WorkSource. Since 2005, OCHHS has conducted an annual evaluation of the WorkSource program (1) each quarter for each WorkSource unit within a specific geographic area, (2) once a quarter to WorkSource units based on administrative charges, (3) an annual evaluation of all WorkSource units, (4) an annual evaluation of all WorkSource units across the entire country, or any other request made by DHHS \u2013 each evaluation was conducted from October through December of the corresponding year. According to officials, the results were: 2005\u201314,558 WorkSource units. 2006\u201315,244, WorkSource units. 2007\u201318,428 WorkSource units were reviewed. 2008\u201315,454 WorkSource units were reviewed. 2009\u201315,608 WorkSource units was reviewed, according to DHHS officials. 2010\u201314,424 WorkSource units were reviewed. 2011\u201314,594 WorkSource units were reviewed. WorkSource officials also stated that the evaluations have remained the same per year since 2005, but they told us since 2005, no other work has been performed on WorkSource than an annual evaluation. DHHS officials state the WorkSource costs are covered under a \u201cno-cost extension to the 1995 Work Opportunity Act. According to DOL officials, 9,750 grantee (WorkSource and Work Opportunity Housing) grantee-based questions per year were asked, so in the context of the Work Opportunity Housing costs,", "We found FEMA has not yet completed a national preparedness assessment and that none of the 10 states in our 2015 review maintained reserves solely for future disasters; FEMA has yet to finalize these actions; our initial 2017 and 2018 reports to Congress have informed FEMA\u2019s efforts to better plan for and mitigate hazards and to establish disaster assessment procedures and guidelines to close gaps in preparedness. FEMA has made strides in prioritizing disaster preparedness, but we found that FEMA currently lacks strategic planning initiatives to target specific hazards across its portfolio to provide actionable measures for its communities to address these risks.

FEMA has yet to develop a national FEMA public performance measure to evaluate preparedness capabilities. FEMA is taking steps to conduct a nation-wide assessment of disaster readiness and resources necessary for such actions. None of FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plans or hazard mitigation procedures were mentioned during the review of FEMA\u2019s work in this area. FEMA has made progress to better align with FEMA Public Assistance field operations. FEMA was creating a Public Assistance Performance Measurement framework. FEMA was using FEMA Information Technology systems to improve data availability. FEMA has yet to develop a comprehensive FEMA Public Assistance performance assessment process. FEMA\u2019s efforts to assess regional disaster preparedness were ongoing. FEMA was incorporating hazard mitigation into FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program. FEMA has yet to finalize a nation-wide FEMA public performance measure to evaluate FEMA\u2019s public assistance role. FEMA had made progress to prioritize FEMA Public Assistance assistance applications during FEMA\u2019s response to hurricanes in 2017. FEMA had incorporated FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance process into FEMA Administrator Paulison\u2019s FEMA priorities in 2017. FEMA was seeking FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance assessment on FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Public Participation and Information (PPAI)/Assessments efforts. FEMA has since developed a PPAI/Assessment tool that includes a national performance measurement framework. FEMA was prioritizing FEMA-specific PPAI/Assessment efforts. FEMA had a Disaster Recovery Technical Assistance program in place. FEMA, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Interior, Department of Homeland Security, Defense Information Systems Security Agency, and the U.S. Forest Service was launching a National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). FEMA\u2019s NIDIS would be designed to provide drought-alerted tools to support decision-making. FEMA, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was conducting soil and water tests on flood, drought-prone areas, and watersheds in 2017. All FEMA PHAF teams in the Southeast had participated in the 2017 disaster season. FEMA\u2019s Southern Newborn Death Surveillance System was up and running. FEMA had been conducting national and regional PHAF data collection. FEMA has also been collecting FEMA and FEMA Public Assistance grant performance metrics data during fiscal years 2017 and 2018. FEMA had created a FEMA Disaster Grant Management Standard, which included a framework that FEMA PHAFE programs work towards. FEMA was implementing a comprehensive hazard mitigation performance assessment. FEMA\u2019s Integrated Information Technology System (IITS) includes a Disaster Assessment tool. FEMA was preparing the FEMA Risk Mapping Tool (HMRC) for the Hurricane (EM 13) model. FEMA will be providing a mapping tool to U.S. territories and is using FEMA GIS Data Portal 7.0. FEMA\u2019s new 2017 FEMA Floodplain Mapping tool is accessible. FEMA has been using the FEMA Assessment Tool for Flood Damage Assessment. FEMA was now using FEMA-provided GIS tools in the assessment process. FEMA is providing GIS mapping support in the development of FEMA\u2019s Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Mitigation tools. FEMA continues to utilize FEMA-developed flood maps. FEMA is developing Floodplain Mapping and Risk Assessment tools. FEMA had a FEMA floodplain mapping tool. FEMA is conducting a cost of response program. FEMA\u2019s Risk Mapping and Assessment Tool (HM) could be customized with FEMA data. FEMA is updating the HM/EM 13. FEMA had been able to continue using FEMA\u2019s PHAFE-R tool during hurricanes in 2017. FEMA was updating HM with FEMA GIS data. FEMA GIS data is widely used in FEMA Floodplain mapping. FEMA developed floodplain maps for 2017. FEMA has been expanding the HMRC tool to support FEMA floodplain mapping. FEMA mapped and surveyed coastal areas from floodplain to 500-foot high water mark. FEMA maps include both landside and aquatic flood damage to FEMA\u2019s floodplain mapping tool. FEMA maps are built to display floodplain maps in the FEMA Floodplain Mapping Tool. FEMA will receive funding for the update of FEMA\u2019s cost-estimating tool. FEMA has a GIS portal. FEMA was using OpenFEMA. FEMA provides online mapping tools. FEMA launched the Hurricane-Flood Mapping Initiative. FEMA developed 2016 Flood Hazard Modification maps. FEMA has a Hazard Information and Mapping System. FEMA map viewer was accessible to users.

In January 2019, we reported FPS was lacking mission, goals, and objectives. In July 2018, DHS stated that FPS would be required to use the mission, goals, and objectives established in its strategic plan and the Homeland Security Act to assist FPS. While FPS has a mission, goals, and objectives, we do not believe the agency had any specific or unique missions, goals, or objectives within its strategic plan or its DHS mission statement. The agency, in keeping with DHS policy, did not have any unique missions, goals or objectives in their DHS-level strategic or mission plan that we could confirm or find information on. Similarly, FPS\u2019s goals and objectives were not unique or specific within DHS/FPS\u2019s mission and goals. In January 2019, we evaluated FPS as a viable candidate for DHS/DHS\u2019s mission on protecting federal facilities. We determined that FPS\u2019s mission was to protect federal facilities, and DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Act of 2002 required that federal agencies establish and implement mission-level homeland security goals and objectives. Therefore, when compared to DHS\u2019s mission to protect its physical assets, FPS continued to fulfill DHS\u2019s missions without a unique role within DHS\u2019s structure. However, DHS continued to work closely with FPS, and as of June 2019, we found it was required to use DHS\u2019s strategic planning process to set its priorities and objectives. In January of 2019, we found DHS had not yet implemented the FPS DHS requirements. On August 23, 2018, DHS stated it would be required to use missions, goals, and objectives from its strategic plan. Mission and goals are critical information for informing public or private-sector organizations of their unique missions and roles within DHS/DHS. Having clear mission, goals, and objectives is necessary to inform potential stakeholders what they can expect from DHS, including FPS. In December of 2018, DHS stated it continued to work with its DHS strategic partners to identify and incorporate FPS\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives within DHS\u2019s. Homeland Security (HHS) Council. In conjunction with this DHS initiative, we found FPS had established goals, objectives, and strategies at DHS/GSA that were not yet completed at FPS. If FPS needs to be incorporated into DHS/ DHS, they may need to modify their plans to be more proactive and intentional regarding their goals. DHS had not yet established FPS as a DHS level mission, goal, or objective. DHS established an HHS Council in May 2018 to streamline collaboration on public health, medical, and emergency-response missions. We found that DHS and FPS had been involved in a pilot during the previous year to streamline public health communication during major-event situations. DHS, in keeping with this DHS initiative, also incorporated FPS missions, goals and objectives into DHS\u2019s Pandemic Influenza 1st-Tier Advisory Committee (PIC) on 14/05/2018. We can infer from DHS\u2019s initiative the DHS/DHS work to incorporate FPS into DHS, but we do not know of any current information on their status. DHS has an FPS Information Repository system, which DHS/FSPS maintained through their DHS website. DHS reported in 2018 that in order to meet this information provisioning goal, they needed access to new technology and data and would be working with DHS to transition to a new FPS technology system. We will continue to monitor FPS\u2019s technology system deployment to see how it meets DHS/DHS\u2019s requirements and DHS\u2019s expectations. DHS reported in 2018, that the current information sharing system for FPS was an older legacy technology. In 2010, DHS proposed transitioning FPS\u2019s technology system to the new Technology Information Service (TIS) structure. In April 2018, DHS reported that after its initial work with TIS, it needed to further customize the current technology system in order for FPS to meet the new DHS requirements and DHS\u2019s goals on public safety. Since this information comes from DHS reports and DHS has not provided updated information regarding FPS technology, FPS was not included as part of DHS\u2019s 2018 Technology Modernization Program. In January 2019, DHS reported that FPS\u2019s infrastructure \u201cwas transitioning to the DHS Information System Modernization (ISM) program, which was designed to streamline, consolidate, and make DHS systems more efficient.\u201d As we reported in January 2019, that DHS/DHS was transitioning FPS to its Homeland Security Information System (HSIS). While DHS was able to implement and complete DHS\u2019s work on public health during the last fiscal year, DHS said that they would not yet be able to meet the DHS\u2019 Homeland Security Mission requirements in DHS. FPS had been working with DHS since 2015 to identify their DHS objectives and goals. In April 2018, DHS stated they had been", "DHS, DHS officials, and components have taken actions to address certain human capital issues related to employee morale and engagement.

DHS also has made progress in addressing certain workforce engagement areas, as seen through DHS components\u2019 increased actions for employee training and development, employee engagement, and performance-based promotion processes. DHS, FEMA, and many components have also made substantial changes to their cybersecurity and personnel functions in the past year. DHS has taken actions to identify its position and skill requirements among its cybersecurity workforce and has implemented coding and development procedures among its information technology and cyber roles. DHS officials believe this approach will help ensure that they effectively identify employees in critical roles across the DHS cyber programs for the 2019-20 fiscal years. DHS officials also plan to improve their workforce planning processes and DHS Components continue to develop and adopt new HR processes and strategies to address and overcome human capital issues. DHS has taken actions across various areas and DHS components have started to implement processes to address workforce development. In December 2019, DHS released new guidelines to assist agencies in identifying and assessing human capital vulnerabilities. DHS components, OCHCO, and OHS have been implementing DHS\u2019s Human Capital Inventory Tool, as DHS found it to be a useful tool for identifying human capital vulnerabilities. DHS also established new DHS-wide HR training initiative for DHS employees that provides training on a variety of HR-related topics. This DHS initiative was launched at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. Finally, DHS officials stated that DHS is currently working on a project to establish DHS-wide guidelines for selecting best practices and strategies for workforce development and retention. This DHS initiative has been in development since fiscal year 2018, and DHS and OHS began implementing new development guidance in fiscal year 2019. DHS HR, DHS OHS, DHS OCHCO, FEMA, and DHS components continue to develop and adopt new HR processes to help DHS address and overcome human capital issues. DHS has made progress across many areas and DHS Components have also started to implement various processes to address workforce development. DHS continues to work in 2020 to finalize DHS-wide guidelines for workforce development and retention. DHS HR, DHS OCHCO, DHS OHS, DHS OCHCO, FEMA, and DHS Components are continuing to evolve HR processes and strategies in 2020. DHS has also begun working on a pilot to establish DHS-wide HR training and professional HR development opportunities. The DHS Human Capital Work Group will also complete work on other future DHS HR initiatives in 2020. DHS, DHS OCHCO, DHS HR, DHS OCHCO, DHS OHS, DHS OHS, DHS OCHCO, FEMA, and DHS Components are continuing to evolve DHS HR processes and strategies in 2020. DHS has started its pilot project for DHS-wide human capital training and DHS OCHCO has continued to work on DHS HR guidelines.

There are several levels of military industrial base management to include DOD, Army and Marine Corps depots, as well as joint operations command centers. Each DOD component manages his or her own fleet of depots. The Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s instructions for a Lessons Learned program can be shared between all the military services. The Military Services\u2019 command level operations and activities in supporting readiness in weapon systems and equipment. There is significant variation in practices and performance across these military services, as well as between their depots. According to our prior work, the depots are generally poorly equipped, poorly maintained, and aging. The challenge associated with maintaining readiness in war-ready weapon systems and systems support may be difficult unless proper resources are acquired. There are also questions on how efficiently the military services manage readiness. Figure 1. Examples of specific activities and processes that are generally included in the definition of \u201cDepot Operations.\u201d The military has a history of building up these sites to improve readiness for their weapon systems. These depots require infrastructure, which generally includes buildings, warehouses, and landfills to support their various tasks. For example, the Marine Corps depot at New River, North Carolina, is responsible for maintaining small arms, combat support and infantry support equipment. According to DOD there are over 20 Marine Corps depots across the country. The depots are often found adjacent to shipyards, flight training sites, and other major military bases, which are essential for training and readiness. These depots also provide important logistics support and training opportunities. The Navy currently has 17 depot-level maintenance depots across its fleet. The depots focus on maintenance of various types of equipment for ship-based and submarine-based equipment. The depots also support a ship-based combat support and supply chain, and these are found in areas near shipways to maintain readiness for amphibious operations by water and air. The Air Force has numerous depots of varying sizes that concentrate on aircraft, aircraft components, and weapons systems. These systems are found along side other military activities, to include training for combat support and operational supply. According to DOD there are over 20 Air Force depots across the country. The Army has 17 division-level depots that are typically found adjacent to infantry and mechanized divisions. These depots are responsible for keeping the 4,000-mile-long network of 10,000 miles of roadways in place. These depots are critical to the readiness of soldiers for combat, training, and operations. According to DOD, there are over 100 Army depots across the country. The remaining military services have similar organizational structures with small depot-level sites to support their small arms, air combat readiness, and weapons/sighting systems. However, it is important to note that the size and scope of the various depots can vary significantly based on their mission and responsibilities. DOD data from 50 military depots from April 2019 showed a lot of variation in readiness and training status across the DOD industrial base. In more than half of the 50 facilities, the depots were at their least capable level, with several showing poor performance in maintaining readiness for weapons systems. Based on DOD data in a 12 months old period, 70 percent of army depots had more than one out of service (OOT) system since the inception of the program, whereas only 10% of Navy depots and 9% of Air Force deports had more than one OOT system. DOD data from 40 depots in April 2019 showed over 50% of them are at their minimum capability level. In contrast, there were only seven air force depots at their minimum capability level, whereas three had 100% OOT for their OOT systems. The Army had just over 40% of depots at their minimum ability, whereas the majority of the navy depots were at their minimum level of OOT. While Navy ships were able to have approximately 70% of the Navy OOT equipment functioning, the remaining system is not functioning well at all. There is no correlation between the numbers of OOT equipment in a depot with its Readiness Status or with the amount of time the depot has been around. DOD reported that about 9% of its Army depots have OOT systems. According to DOD, 50% of remaining depots in the Marine Corps (Marine Corps) reported having OOT issues, while DOD declared that all Air Force depots are at least 94% OOT. Among the other military services, DOD has identified the following 40 critical readiness categories that needed the maximum attention due to the readiness challenges across the depots: 2 \u2013 Air and Ground Transportation 3 - Personnel 4 \u2013 Fire Protection 5 \u2013 Medical Services 6 \u2013 Supply 7", "Many Native American tribes lack high-speed Internet access; a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report recommends tribes access licensed spectrum to connect. Nearly all Native American entities reported that unlicensed spectrum was a valuable access option, although some drawbacks were reported. Most entities that can access licensed spectrum are choosing to do so. FCC reported a tribal entity has greater access to spectrum-based technologies in 90 percent of tribes in 2015, but only a small fraction of tribes have applied for spectrum licenses in each of 2009, 2010, and 2011. Tribal applicants are competing for FCC-administered spectrum licenses, but winning bidders are awarded up to $50,000 in revenue per license. Native American tribes have fewer access options to broadband and other Internet services. The FCC, tribal entities, and stakeholders we interviewed believe there is potential for FCC spectrum auction subsidies. FCC\u2019s Office of Native Affairs and Policy has a role in helping tribes in planning and implementing Internet access strategies that rely on spectrum, particularly providing broadband services over fixed wireless and mobile broadband networks. Tribal entities lack access to broadband and other Internet services; most are using the unlicensed spectrum in 2018, to connect with each other and with their members. More than 60 percent (1,611) of winning bidders had their biddings over $1 million. Tribal entities, including some that have received SENS money, report difficulties of financing spectrum usage and require infrastructure improvements as prerequisites. FCC Reported Nearly All Native American Entities Accessing Spectrum Currently. In December 2016, FCC Reported Tribal Broadband Plan. FCC Reported tribal Broadband Plan is completed and that tribal entities will have a role in planning and implementing broadband. Tribal entities that provide fixed wireless and mobile broadband services are likely to be on the cutting edge of new developments in connecting networks. FCC\u2019s Native American Broadband Plan recommendations: FCC recommended an expanded role for tribal entities in wireless and broadband network planning; the Native American Broadband Access Grant Program will fund 8,000 connections (4 000 fixed wireless systems and 4 001,000 mobile systems). FCC Reported Native American Broadband Access Grant Program is Funded with SENS. FCC Reported Tribal Broadband Tool Kit (TBTK) was updated in July 2018. The Tribal Broadband Tool Kit is a web application tool for tribal broadband planning. Tribal entities can use the tool to assess their broadband infrastructure, develop infrastructure and operations plans with SENS funding, identify and prioritize a candidate spectrum, understand FCC spectrum allocation strategy, plan and develop broadband service programs, and provide support for tribal broadband plan implementation. FCC Reported First FCC tribal broadband survey for Native American Broadband Access Implementation Plans. According to 70 percent of tribal entities, the best way to expand their broadband offerings is through fiber optic expansion. FCC reported the 2015 Native American Broadband Access Implementation Plans Report was completed and that tribal entities that provide fixed wireless and mobile broadband will play a leading role in connecting communities. In December 2016, the FCC Reported Native Broadband Plan was completed, but tribal broadband plans may need to be adjusted if FCC changes spectrum policies. FCC reported a Tribal Broadband Workshop scheduled for April 16, 2015, in Washington D.C. There are tribal entities that have access to broadband and other Internet services and FCC believes this number will increase in the future. However, due to limitations of unlicensed spectrum in tribal Broadband Plans FCC Reported the 2014 Native American Broadband Survey Results. In accordance with FCC Report \u201c2016 Spectrum Census.\u201d The FCC Reported the number of broadband/Internet service providers per state and the Census Bureau Reported the number of broadband service providers per state, per capita rate, and census block area in 2010. FCC Reports that FCC spectrum licensing authority for wireless devices have been designated as fixed wireless. The FCC Reported the 2013 Native American Broadband Deployment Report. Tribal broadband plans have been a challenge to FCC\u2019s \u201cInternet in the Future\u201d plan since the 2011 National Broadband Plan report. FCC Reported In accordance with FCC Reported 2004 Native American Tribal Broadband Survey Report.

Tribal broadband plans have been a challenge to FCC\u2019s \u201cInternet in the Future\u201d plan since the 2011 National Broadband Plan Report. FCC Reported The FCC Reported an Internet 100% Report, which examines Internet access and speeds. FCC Reported the Commission Reported a Broadband Deployment Project Report. Tribal broadband technology information may be found in Section 5.c.4 in the FCC Reported tribal entities, which are 60 percent of the winning bidders for each FCC-administered spectrum auction of 2016 and 2013. In response to the FCC Report, representatives reported they were uncertain which bands the government was licensing for wireless deployment.

These techniques, principles, laws, or ordinances must be considered in land development or site selection to minimize the potential risk of damage from coastal storm or flooding. (FEMA 4 p. 1\u20132) in the event of natural disasters that are not in the best interest of the country, which may include coastal storm and flooding risk reduction measures. These principles require that the Corps\u2019 civil engineering and project design processes be incorporated into watershed management plans for nonfederal sponsored projects. For example, the Corps\u2019 Civil Works Department conducts feasibility studies to determine the feasibility of coastal storm risk reduction measures, such as the construction of seawalls in coastal storm-prone areas, before these projects are constructed. There are two elements of the Coastal Risk Reduction Program (CRRP): Coastal Flood Risk Reduction (CRRR) and Coastal Coastal and Inland Streams (CCIES). CRRR is a risk reduction program, designed to protect communities against coastal flooding. Specifically, it is designed to protect land, property, and transportation routes owned or operated by the federal government that are likely to be damaged by coastal floods attributable to sea level rise, storm surge, and flooding. The CRRR program provides the federal government with access to low-cost insurance coverage and a network of federal specialists. For the Coastal Coastal and Inland Streams (CCIES) program, the Corps is providing a set of tools to be used to develop or modify levees or levees and associated floodplain features. This program provides engineering, science, and project-management assistance of a federal nature. The program also includes technical guidance associated with the construction of levees and floodplain mitigation features. The Coastal Community Risk Reduction Program (CCRP), implemented in 2010, is a national, interdisciplinary partnership between federal and nonfederal stakeholders in the United States. The goal of CCRP is to reduce the human and economic impacts due to coastal storm and flooding hazards. Some examples of these tools are sea walls, natural barriers (e.g., reefs), and mangrove systems. The Corps coordinates efforts with nonfederal sponsors and partners in a CCRP-like program called the Coastal Habitat Risk Reduction Initiative (CHRRI). The CHRRI helps communities reduce the potential impact hazard from flooding and coastal storming on communities. In doing so, it provides guidance for watershed management, coastal erosion reduction, and property and infrastructure protection strategies. These tools are provided by the Corps\u2019 Regional Division offices, which will help communities with the planning, design, and construction of coastal habitats.

Figure 1 shows the type of work performed by the Coast Guard. This diagram was created from data from documents in the FEMA-PPR section of the FEMA website. FEMA-PPR stands for Floodplain Mapping and Risk Analysis. The US Army Corps of Engineers has two levels of regional offices. The first level is comprised of a District engineer. The District engineer, along with a Corps office in that District, manages a Corps-wide portfolio of projects. These can range from a variety of different dam repairs, to a new headquarters building or even a brand-new Corps hospital. Corps offices in the New York area, Norfolk, Virginia, and Honolulu also manage multiple operations. Many of the regional 7 Corps have numerous districts, along with a small field office and numerous projects that they manage. Corps headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, the Corps of Engineers in Washington DC, and the Corps field office in Albany NY often work in tandem with the District offices in these areas. Since the first Corps District was established, the Corps has established a small number of Regional offices. The Corps of Engineers can also be divided into four regions: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Midwest. Although there are currently approximately 22 Corps district divisions that are responsible for the Corps\u2019 major and ongoing construction projects, the Corps also maintains a number of smaller project support teams located throughout the country.

The data reflect all aspects of school feeding practices, such as student eligibility, meal patterns, and revenue and meal count by school. These practices are then used to monitor USDA's implementation of the laws that govern school facilities. A review of 35 school facilities and related data also is completed to determine whether food service operations, physical facilities, and infrastructure components are adequate to facilitate effective food service in 35 facilities across the country. The amount of funds USDA provides to reimburse schools for administrative costs varies based on the region and level at which a school serves, as well as the complexity of the project. The percentage of administrative costs increases as a result of the number of students served (and corresponding meals) and schools\u2019 level of reimbursement. For example, 25 cents of the average number of $5 per day cost of providing meals at 30 of the 3,400 eligible schools across the country are reimbursed, while the average of 20 cents reimbursed for the entire state is 10 percent of the average cost. Schools receiving federal meals must count them each day. Schools are then reimbursed 100 percent of their costs up to 70 percent, 50 percent for the next 25 percent, and thereafter based on the level of student income (below poverty limit is 95%). The amount of reimbursement also depends on the type of meals delivered. The average amount a school receives under the national reimbursable meals count program is $15 compared to $19 per child per school year. School districts using the school reimbursement system for school meals are reimbursed for 85 percent of their expenses and 100 percent for the costs of food components of the meal that are not reimbursable. A school district is reimbursed for 15 percent for the costs of food components. The amount of school reimbursement also depends on the type of student served, which is based on the student's income level. The average reimbursable cost per serving meal for the 93 percent and above of free and reduced price meals is $1.48 (up from $1.12 in FY2017). Conversely, the amount per serving reimbursement is $1.52 for the 90-95 percent (up from $1.40 in FY2017), $1.53 for the 85-95 percentile (up from $1.35 in FY2017), $1.26 for the 76-80 percent percentile of students (up from $1.13 in FY2017), $1.21 for the 70-75 percentile of students (up from $1.14 in FY2017), and $1.02 for 25-27 percent percentile of students (up from $1.00 in FY2017). USDA's data indicates schools are reimbursed the average annual amount of $63.5 million for administrative activities. The average amount of administrative costs per student is approximately $3.21 per student. School districts paid the average annual amount of $8.8 million for instructional costs. The average amount of instructional costs per student is approximately $3.40 per student. This differs from the previous data that has documented approximately $3 spent per meal. The school meals data set of over 1,000 schools has increased to 1,600 schools, although that data set is not fully complete. According to USDA, there continue to be an excess of school-level data, yet USDA does provide additional data on 11 variables, such as individual student data in the data that USDA conducts or administers. School facilities are visited each year, and most school facilities are in good condition, yet a few schools continue to need a significant investment to be functional for their students. As with many areas of education, the percentage of school funding per student varies greatly across different school types. Schools with the highest percentage of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals also show the highest percentage of funds returned to the states. In general, schools have less than $3.5 million in revenue per student. Schools of all sizes, including elementary schools (typically $21.8 per student in FY2017), middle schools (typically $26.1 per student in FY2017), and high schools (typically $25.6 per student in FY2017) contributed an average of $3.90 per student in 2017. According to USDA, all eligible schools contribute data on the amount of school meals in each student as well as on how many students received a reimbursable meal. The percentage of schools reimbursed for meals was approximately 50 percent of the total payments for student meals in FY2017. Schools were reimbursed for approximately 13.1 percent of the fiscal years of FY2019 through FY2027, totaling $4.5 billion. USDA and school districts have different procedures to", "In FY2020, the U.S. Census Bureau used an \u201cin-field address canvassing\u201d approach with 32 Area Census Offices that resulted in more than 50 million addresses for the Bureau.

This article briefly describes significant challenges, best practices, and potential impact of a possible \u2018IRS Data Dump.\u2019 Tax experts call for greater risk-based implementation practices and increased tax transparency. FIGURE 1: How IDT is fraud commonly perpetrated? A. Financial Information System. This fraudster (or a small number of like perpetrators) systematically and falsely claims financial data and business details, such as payrolls and insurance payments, to avoid paying tax and penalties. IRS data indicates more than 80 percent of fraudulent returns report the tax amount due based on these details. B. Tax Preparation Methods. The fraudulent taxpayer may use common tactics to maximize deductions and thereby pay less income tax, such as claiming business expenses for personal use. IRS data reveals that 71 percent of fraudulent claims have been based on business expenses. C. EINs. A fraudulent taxpayer may claim an individual taxpayer identification number (EIN) which may be used to open an illegal business. D. Business IDT. In many cases, IDT is used to file or amend fraudulent business return information that includes an EIN. (Source: IRS\u2019 Data Analytics Platform) FIGURE 2: FRDAA is \u2018fraud resistance\u2019 that also encourages better tax compliance. The Fraud Risk Framework can help to determine tax collection methods or actions by taxpayer, but generally the best approach will be combination of the components. While some of the leading and most useful best practices are: a. Document and review all financial transactions in your company; b. Set financial information access rules; c. Review your entity hierarchy in a risk-based approach; d. Establish an automated risk-based audit system; e. Utilize automated reporting methods, which can detect fraud or error. If implementing these practices, individuals and small businesses will benefit from having an IRS system in place that can verify their returns, which can reduce their likelihood of an identity theft. More businesses could benefit from this system as an important part of fraud resilience. A significant number of incidents that have occurred in recent years involve IRS or security breach systems. The potential for a large-scale breach of personal or business taxpayer financial data can increase the costs of identity, theft and credit card theft, fraud or tax fraud. To address many of these incidents, businesses today are spending more time researching security solutions \u2013 such as password management and endpoint security technology \u2013 that can reduce their exposure, as well as the opportunity cost of downtime. Similarly, businesses are learning more about how to use their existing cybersecurity tools more effectively. They often need to update the most important security patches, as well as deploy new security and compliance best practices. A lot of the security risk can be reduced by properly locking up resources which are required to do compliance and security tasks. However, this can be costly, so more businesses need to use automated technologies, such as AI and machine learning, to automatically streamline some of their compliance tasks. This is where the cost savings of automating identity access can be really significant, reducing some of the most common authentication threats to businesses. It is also cost effective for businesses and governments to leverage each other\u2019s resources for cybersecurity compliance. For example, an organization can benefit on the cybersecurity side by leveraging one business\u2019s employee benefits plan for access to a wide range of resources. Similarly, agencies may be able to help businesses improve their PCI compliance. Businesses would benefit by learning how to use a variety of tools that can be offered through a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for authentication or compliance purposes, such as a PCI compliance platform or a cloud-based payment system. Many organizations are implementing user-centered authentication solutions, which can be implemented to improve their ability to prevent fraudulent purchases. User access management technology can help to restrict certain users to certain parts of the system, based on their user ID. User access management technology can help businesses to reduce their risk of a cyber-attack or even malicious user activity that can lead them to being denied access. The system can also be used to manage access levels across all users while they are on access. User access management technology can also monitor user activity through tracking and analytics, as well as protect sensitive data and networks from cyber actors who may seek data to steal financial or other information. For businesses, as opposed to government or public organizations, the costs of such security systems should be much lower. Businesses can generally implement such systems in the cloud or have their IT outsource for cost-effective solutions. Businesses can benefit and achieve a range of goals that are supported by the implementation of cybersecurity resources, such as improving data protection and security, including the protection of sensitive information.

We identified that climate-related damages to infrastructure are expected to increase over time as more intense storms become more frequent. Such damage would be even more likely to occur in coastal areas, where the combination of sea level rise and strong coastal storms can further damage public infrastructure (see also fig. 1) for further information. The national-scale studies we reviewed provided a range of estimates on economic effects of climate change, but it is likely that estimates will become more precise as technology advances. For example, some studies suggest that sea-level rise due to climate change is more significant than suggested by U.S. government research. In particular, we noted that some studies found sea-level rise of more than 20 feet within the next century. Similarly, we noted that new research would be essential to assess an estimate of the economic effects of a severe hurricane landfall on a particular U.S. coastal county. In addition, new data on the economic impacts of climate change will be essential to better understand the potential role of public infrastructure in mitigating the economic impacts of severe extreme weather events. To summarize the economic effects of climate change in the United States, we evaluated four areas: economic impacts of regional climate shocks, the economic effects of climate risk management activities, and economic effects of climate change mitigation options. In September 2018 we found that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which occurred in 2017, caused economic losses of about $452 billion (see fig. 1), and that these losses were greater than any single extreme event in North America since 1900 (excluding the 1906 New England hurricane). We estimated that the economic losses were 45 percent more costly than the losses caused by climate shocks in China. Estimates of the economic damages due to climate change from a century\u2019s worth of extreme weather events suggest larger economic impacts than observed by the U.S. government. These prior estimates indicate significant economic losses due to climate change, and they estimate that they will climb to at least $300 billion by the year 2030. Although experts on climate change and U.S. coastal engineering believe that new technologies and methods will improve the ability to design and build coastal areas to withstand climate change (see also FIG. 1), new or improved science or tools are not likely to change the likelihood or size of climate effects on coastal U.S. areas. The findings from the new study point to a potentially significant economic impact of the effects of climate change on the U.S. economy, considering the nation\u2019s total economic output and population. Such findings are consistent with reports on past economic losses from climate-related disasters or extreme weather events. Since these prior economic losses were largely associated with sea-level rise, we used the National Coastal Zone Program to identify which coastal areas are likely to be most susceptible to rising sea levels due to climate change. Coastal areas from Maine to Florida were likely to experience significant economic losses if the sea levels rise. Although the geographic range of coastal areas could be even-larger in future due to the rise of sea levels, we remain concerned that even more frequent and intense extreme weather will cause higher economic losses for coastal communities because of the rising prevalence of severe hurricanes, which occur once or twice in every decade. The effects of climate-related land erosion are likely to extend over time. While less well characterized than these other climate effects on the coastal economy, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) studies found significant long-term economic losses attributed to coastal erosion resulting from changing climate. Economic trends based on climate data could show that such trends over time also are associated with a higher frequency and intensity of hurricanes. While it is likely that hurricanes would bring significant increases in economic losses over the past century, estimates are difficult to quantify, partly due to uncertainties in the U.S. federal research. However, data from U.S. federal research suggest (see FIG. 1) that sea-level rise would increase economic losses due to coastal erosion, which occurred more frequently than economic losses related to the severity of hurricanes, and may have resulted in significant economic losses from both hurricanes and sea-level rise. In addition, economic losses from climate-related land erosion are likely to increase over time as long-term land-level declines continue. In addition, coastal erosion in particular areas could have a significant direct impact on the geographic range of a nation\u2019s coastline, and as climate change affects the sea levels, coastal towns, cities, and cities in those regions are likely to incur higher sea-level-change-induced economic costs, not unlike their costs from hurricanes. Coastal erosion is also not directly addressed and not part of the NOAA Coastal Zone program. We encourage NOAA to expand their monitoring program that identifies areas of concern to coastal flooding or flooding due to sea-level rise, particularly, in", "Reducing transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries has consistently been DOT's top priority.

EEOC requires businesses to report data on job-level demographics every year. Between 2007 and 2015, Minority representation among overall management increased by about 8 percentage points, while the representation of women increased about 11 percent. During this time, representation of African-American women also rose by 3.8 percentage points, while Asian men in management decreased about 0.3 percent. Women make up about 45 percent of overall management. Most private employers subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with 100 or more employees and financial institutions with more than 50 employees must submit income tax data. Each year, companies need to report to the Civil Rights Commission statistics on the demographic makeup of the work force and the pay scales used to pay employees. For the second year in a row, we report that over time the financial services industry has grown in female representation from about 29 percent to 40 percent at the management level. The percentage of Asians and Hispanics reporting at all-level employment in the financial services industry jumped from about 4 to more than 6 percent. Among senior-level managers specifically, we show that this percentage remained unchanged at about 70 percent. Asian women who are employed (the majority of them) report employment levels that remain slightly lower than Hispiecans and African-Americans. Men tend to report higher employment levels than women (in the aggregate). Asian men report an overall level of managerial positions higher than women, white and Hispanic women, with the exception of Asian women. According to analysis, Asian women hold positions on a lower level than most white and Hispanic women. While Asian women report as having about 70 percent of employment across positions at all-levels of our analysis of financial services, data indicate that Asian men do not appear to be as well paid as white and Hispanic women. Asian women and Hispanics have smaller compensation gaps than men in their respective groups at all-level management. Asian men working at financial services are among the lowest paid individuals at all levels and only slightly more paid than Hispanic and Asian men. Asian women working in financial services outnumber Hispanic and African-American women but are only slightly more highly paid. Data indicate that among Asians working in financial services, the majority are Asian and not a single one was Hispanic or African. Data also indicate that Asian women have surpassed men in numbers employed across all positions. Of the 5,000 employees we have analyzed across our study for various positions, Asian women account for about 11 percent. Among our overall sample, Asian women exceed men (the percentage for both is about 6 percent), which we did not expect on average. Asian women exceeded Hispanic women by as little as a percent in some positions. Asian women do not tend to be older than Hispanic or white women. Asian women tend to work slightly fewer hours than whites/European Americans. While Asian men generally have more work experience than our sample, Asian women often report lower levels of education and experience and lower compensation than Asian men. Asian men are among the lowest represented and the lowest paid ethnic groups in our database. Asian men account for less than half of overall managers. Asian women in all positions are the only group who has surpassed Hispanic women. Asian men appear to be paid slightly less than peers (typically, between 1 and 5 percent). Asian men hold positions in all-level management above both white and Hispanic men across our study. Asian men have reported lower levels of work experience than white men (the majority of Asian men report less than 20 years). Asian men often report the lowest compensation of all ethnic groups. Asian women account for close to 40 percent of overall jobs, but have a lower proportion than Hispanic women and men in most of our categories. Asian women are paid slightly less than white women across most of our categories/occupations. Asian women are paid less for most categories than Asian men. Asian women also earn about a tenth less than white men across most of our categories of employment. Asian men do not appear to show significant employment gaps compared to white and Hispanic men. Asian women appear to be paid similarly to white women and even receive slightly higher compensation than white women. Asian women may perform slightly less well in certain tasks, yet Asian men have not been able to attain positions higher than white and Hispanic men. Asian women also appear to be paid slightly less than white and Hispanic men across most of our categories of employment. Asian women represent a bigger proportion in senior-level positions than in entry-level positions. Asian women earn higher than Asian men, overall, and across most professional categories. Asian men are almost always paid less than white men in the U.S., where the exception is Asian women. Asian women and white men earn about the same. Asian men appear to earn slightly less than white and Hispanic men in many areas. Asian women are paid similarly to white women and men, with one exception.

The Army has updated or is in the process of updating doctrines that guide Army operations. The Army\u2019s approach to doctrine focuses on addressing this Army-wide shift. For instance, one of the Army\u2019s most-current Army-wide doctrine updates, the Army's new Active-Army Doctrine, includes an emphasis on multi-domain learning and training. Army Concept. In 21st centen ry warfare, we face numerous challenges that involve the interplay of military tools and technologies. New Army concepts that focus on multi-domain learning and training aim to help the Army address these challenges. Figure 1 (below) provides an overview of the Army\u2019s Force Structure (FSO). Since the end of World War II, Army Force Structure has been in a state of continuous change. Army Force Structure has evolved from a \u201cmechanized\u201d and centralized focus to a decentralized and modular structure. Since the end of World War II, Army Force Structure has evolved from a \u201cmechanized\u201d and centralized focus to a decentralized and modular structure. Army Force Structure has always required that the Army be organized, equipped, and trained to move and deploy quickly, with maximum efficiency and minimal preparation time. Army Force Structure is organized and designed to accomplish this in a time in which technology advances at an exponential rate and enemy tactics are always changing. Army Force Structure is not designed to stay static. Army Force Structure is designed to move rapidly to new locations in order to be prepared for whatever tasks or conditions their Soldiers must deal with. Army Force Structure is continuously evolving and is a key element in helping Army forces to be ready-to-go by quickly deploying anywhere in the world. Army Organization. Army Organization has evolved greatly since World War II. In fact, Army units have shifted from a traditional hierarchical command structure to one based on self-contained elements. Army Army units are now formed in a modular structure, which is centered in a single Headquarters element. Soldiers from Army units are now deployed more frequently than was the case in the past, and are increasingly used in a role that is centered around the individual soldier. Soldiers are not always on the same base as these units, and there is a greater emphasis on \u201cfamilies\u201d living together on individual units. Army organizational structure has evolved from one that focused on a company of one hundred men. Army structures have been updated in this way to facilitate greater efficiency. Army Organization has evolved since World War II. The Army has been evolving its organizational principles since the end of World War II. Army units have been modernized, with each brigade now organized as an element that rotates on a much more frequent basis than Army units in the past. A brigade has been organized like this since it first came into existence during the French Revolution. Army units organized in this way are self-contained, and are structured to move quickly when they leave for deployment. Army units are now being organized and trained in a way that will facilitate their being able to deploy as quickly as possible. Army Organization has evolved greatly since World War II. Army Organization has evolved to a modern structure that places each Army element into a system that can be quickly and efficiently deployed to the front lines. The Army will now have to think and plan in a way that will allow them to be ready to go when needed. Army Army units with different roles will now be integrated into a structure that works together closely with one another, and with the main Headquarters to ensure the fastest possible response to a new situation. Army", "All VAMCs reported their HIV policies and practices included all three HIV screening stages to determine how well they implemented the HIV policy and strategy. In addition, officials indicated that VAMCs have incorporated into their practice or tested their capacity to offer different screening methods to include multiple stages of HIV testing: in stage one, verbal reminders to obtain veterans\u2019 verbal consent to be tested. VASCs should: \u2022 Ensure that these screening instructions in the HIV policies have been integrated into their practice to reflect CDC recommendations on HIV testing. \u2022 Maintain records linking these testing instructions to the HIV policies. \u2022 Use clinical reminders to prompt providers to offer an HIV test to their veterans, which include a patient consent form. \u2022 Use the clinical reminder feature of their lab menu to make it easier for providers to order the most current CDC-recommended HIV test. \u2022 Use other tools and procedures to document that a veteran has actually received an HIV test. \u2022 Incorporate HIV policy, procedure, and protocol reviews into their quality improvement processes. According to officials from the three VA facilities where we reviewed the data for this report, the practice of offering HIV tests to VAMCs\u2019 veterans is high. Among the three VAMCs, 96 officials reported that they are currently involved in the practice of the first stage of the CDC-recommended process (ie, they are currently facilitating the delivery of an HIV test to their veterans). The second stage that they are currently implementing by facilitating the delivery of the CDC-recommended HIV test includes (b) offering a CDC-recommended HIV test to their veterans that their doctors have referred to them. As of the time of our review, of the 90 VAMCs that we reviewed, 38 are implementing the CDC-recommended screening for the first stage of HIV testing. In all of the VAMCs, (a) all veterans are screened for HIV within a certain amount of time because it is recommended by the CDC; (b) the recommended CDC tests are offered to veterans during a routine appointment; (c) a veteran receiving a CDC-recommended test is diagnosed with HIV; and all testing guidelines are provided in writing. Regarding the last stage of the CDC-recommended screening, (7) all veterans who have been diagnosed with HIV are 12-17 years old. More than half of the veterans are from the United States (56%), Africa, which includes Liberia, Senegal, and Kenya (19%), and Asia (13%). Veterans also are from South Korea, Mexico, Cambodia (6%), and Vietnam (2%). The age distribution of the veterans differs in each VAMC. While half of the veterans (55%) are in their 13th decade and a quarter of the veterans are (25%) 18 to 29 years old, the majority (69%) are age 30+. In addition, while 13,000 veterans are serving in Afghanistan, only 6,700 of the veterans who have been diagnosed with HIV so were. The number of veterans receiving the HIV test also varied. The number of veterans receiving the recommended HIV test was (a) over 15,000 times within the VPCs we are reviewing and (b) not performed regularly within the VAMCs we are reviewing. The recommended practice to provide the highest age-appropriate HIV screening to military veterans and civilians at age 13, 13+, 18+, 13+, 17+, 19+, 12\u2013, 50+, and 17+ has been in practice since the late 1990s. This study also showed that the practice was still in practice and implemented in all of the VAMCs. Because the current practice of administering an HIV test to those who have been diagnosed with HIV or who might have at least one or more risk factors for the virus can identify the virus in those VAMCs who are susceptible, it is essential that this process continues in all VAMCs. For that reason, it is essential that the practice of offering a complete HIV test and making an appropriate clinical recommendation can be accomplished in every clinic of the VAMCs. Because it is essential that every veteran receiving the recommended HIV test be informed of results, according to our study, it was reported that VAMCs are still using CDC materials such as the test results folder to communicate results back to civilian health centers. All veterans who are diagnosed with HIV are 12-17 years old. More than half of the veterans are from the United States. 1/38(95%) 2/8 (38%); age 60+ (17%); 50+ or 45 years old (6%); fewer than 36 (6%).

More than 800,000 products offered by USPS are delivered to the customer on a standard three-day delivery schedule. On October 3, 2018, USPS announced that same-day delivery testing is scheduled to begin October 1 through December 18, 2018, with customers opting to receive packages on the third or second day of delivery, depending on the service they select. Customers currently have access to these delivery services through vendors who pay USPS for the service. Postal carriers, including FedEx, UPS, and DHL, are competing businesses that provide delivery services for retail and business shipments throughout the United States and worldwide. According to USPS surveys, only 42 percent of customers are satisfied with the current delivery system, which is a delivery system without the benefit of the UPS, FedEx, and DHL businesses. As a result of this dissatisfaction, and to ensure the continuity of package delivery for the customer, USPS is developing, implementing, and evaluating new techniques for delivery. USPS is using automation technology to ship many of their packages at least a day early than they first offered, thus providing more value to their customer of the same cost in fewer days. At the end of fiscal year 2018, USPS reported 20 percent of customers were satisfied with current USPS delivery. However, USPS reports that 90 percent of customers are very satisfied or satisfied with USPS delivery when the shipment is delivered and delivered in a timely manner. With many packages being delivered at a standard three-day delivery schedule, USPS provides customers with information on the delivery times of each of their delivery options. There are 5 core technologies and components that USPS must adopt and consider in designing, configuring, and providing USPS delivery capabilities at the storefront for customers. These technologies are: Delivery-Sorting Systems and Business Intelligence Software; Internet Address Sorting; Shipping Containers and Packages; Automated Delivery Processing Systems; and Integration of Automated Systems and Delivery Networks. Delivery-Sorting Systems and Business Intelligence Software: These technologies are designed to use data in order to provide optimized value to USPS customers. The USPS database is currently undergoing replacement and its mainframe infrastructure is undergoing an upgrade. The USPS\u2019s mainframe computer system provides the basis for the automation, and provides the data to determine the delivery routes to use. The USPS database for the Postal Customer Care System and the Postal Payment System is used to record mailing and shipping information for use in future automated operations. For example, when a piece of mail enters USPS, it uses its delivery sorting technology to ensure that the correct mail to the right destination is processed. In addition, Business Intelligence Software is used to provide timely reports to USPS executives, which, in turn, enables them to provide timely and accurate reports to its customers. Internet Address Sorting: For example, USPS uses data from an extensive database of more than 1.3 billion consumers to provide tailored personalized services to customers for the mailing and shipping of the US mail every day. The USPS\u2019s postal network (i.e., sorting process) requires USPS to use automated technology in order to properly sort mail in a manner in which customer experience is achieved. Automated delivery processing, systems, and automation technologies, as discussed in chapter 8, help USPS increase mail efficiency. To process the mail, USPS relies on automated delivery sorting systems. Automated delivery systems may be used alone or may be combined with \"standard delivery\" by USPS\u2019s retail partners (e.g., FedEx, UPS, Costco, and Amazon). Postal carriers do not have as many options as traditional retail stores because of strict federal regulations and contractual obligations that USPS has with them to carry out USPS\u2019s \"non-delivery\" function. USPS has reported that over a third of its mail processing is the same each month, which can be used in future automated operations. The USPS currently uses automated software in its Postal Customer Care System (PCCS) to handle basic customer inquiries, including telephone inquiries by customer. This service enables telephone inquiries to be answered by a call center or other automated software. To provide customers 24/7 service, the USPS has developed automated electronic customer care (ECC) solutions to include an automated system for customer call inquiries, automated customer data entry, and other functions. Automated delivery systems, or automated sorting systems, allow USPS to ship mail every day with lower costs. Postal carrier systems like UPS and DHL are now competing with each other for business, which has caused the USPS to lower its own costs, which, in turn, makes more efficient postal service to its customers. Automated Delivery Processing Systems: In addition to automated delivery sorting technologies, USPS is developing automated delivery processing systems. The Post-Office-to-USPS (POUS) Automated Sorting System, which is scheduled to be installed in Postal Inspection Service and sorting facilities within FY-2019, should revolutionize postal delivery and simplify service to its customers. The system can sort mail to multiple locations within USPS\u2019s network and can be used alone or combined", "More than 18 years ago, BMD emerged as a new concept for missile defense.

The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 established SNAP by authorizing 50 percent of the program costs in each state. In fiscal years 2014-2017, USDA reported an AFR for SNAP that ranged from 0.5-0.63 percent of direct payments annually. In fiscal year 2018, the SNAP AFR dropped to 0.4 percent and has been increasing each fiscal year since. USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is responsible for administering the SNAP program. The Department provided information that since fiscal year 2004, an estimated $4 billion, or 6.8 percent, of SNAP outlays that year is attributable to improper payments. Over that time period, USDA reported an average AFR of 0.4 percent in each fiscal year. SNAP payments are made directly to each individual and are received once a month. In fiscal year 2019, the Food and Nutrition Service reported an AFR of approximately 8.6 percent of direct payments into the SNAP program. The AFR reported for fiscal year 2019 includes direct payments and administrative costs. The Department of Education reports an AFR of approximately 0.5 percent of Direct Loan program loans each fiscal year. In fiscal year 2019, the Department of Education has reported an AFR of approximately 0.6 percent of loans for the Direct Loan program. The Department of Education reports its own AFR for fiscal year 2019. SNAP SNAP is authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended by the Food Assistance, Nutrition, and Child Nutrition Act of 2017. The Act and subsequent SNAP reauthorizations direct federal payments to eligible individuals, allowing them to purchase food items and, under limited circumstances, school food fees and supplies. The Act and subsequent reauthorizations also allow certain states to administer their own programs. SNAP benefit amounts are based on income, household size, and state unemployment data. The Act authorizes the FNS to administer the benefits portion of SNAP. Through its various regulations on SNAP, the Department also directs states in administering program benefits and monitoring them for compliance. The USDA Office of Inspector General administers SNAP. With the passage of the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 2016 (CNR), certain state programs may be able to apply for additional benefits to provide a variety of child nutrition items from authorized food stores. The USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) reports that about $1.1 billion is required for SNAP benefits annually. To ensure that 30-day and 60-day SNAP benefits are not disallowed, DHS developed the SNAP benefits rules every year, beginning in fiscal year 2007. DHS also required states to have documentation that they administered the SNAP benefits and the payment of any funds they disbursed. At the end of fiscal year 2018, the USDA reported an estimate of approximately $5 billion distributed for SNAP in fiscal year 2018 compared to $3 billion in 2006. In fiscal year 2019, the USDA reported $21.5 billion in payments distributed through the SNAP Benefits, Food Prices, and Nutrition Information system with annual cost per beneficiary at $11 billion for fiscal year 2019. TABLE 1: Selected Fiscal Year Highlights SNAP Benefit Costs SNAP Benefit Costs and Cost per Beneficiary SNAP benefits and cost per beneficiary have exceeded the amounts available to states for the past 20 years. \u2022 In fiscal year 2017, SNAP benefits totaled approximately $6.4 billion with costs for administering benefits totaling approximately $4.2 billion. \u2022 The SNAP caseload has decreased since fiscal year (FY) 2013 for most states. In FY 2013, the average SNAP benefit was $138 per person per month. The average benefit for FY 2017 was $118 per person per month. \u2022 There has been a downward trend in SNAP benefits since FY 2014 as 38 states (90 percent) saw lower SNAP payments each fiscal year from FY 2015 to FY 2017. These payments decreased from approximately $9 billion in FY 2016 to approximately $5 billion in FY 2018, before jumping to $10 billion in FY 2019. \u2022 In addition to the direct payments to states, $13 billion has been designated for SNAP in each fiscal year from FY 2014 to FY 2019. \u2022 The net cost per SNAP benefit to the federal government increased from approximately $11 billion in FY 2014 to approximately $15 billion in FY 2019. \u2022 The SNAP per capita amount for individual households has been constant since FY 2014 and exceeded $1,400 per person per month in FY 2018.

Of the roughly two dozen administrative activities that we examined and the child care quality measures that the states rely on, they reported: Most states require all (12) or most (24) children in their child care system to have at least 8 percent of the CCDF spent on children\u2019s health and safety. However, only about three quarters of these states (27) rely on child care resource and referral agencies to administer the CCDF in fiscal year 2017. Most states offer consumer educational services and information on public child care resources to parents. Most states are required to disseminate information on child care providers\u2019 monitoring and inspection reports, and to implement a statewide public awareness campaign regarding the quality of child care providers. Nearly half of all states rely on CCDF to fund consumer education activities. All 15 of the states we interviewed reported that one or more of their child care resource and referral agencies is authorized to enroll new children into one or more of these child care programs; according to five of the state officials interviewed, their child care resource and referral agencies are available even to noninsured families. Nearly two-thirds of the states we surveyed report that they use quality ratings for child care. Of the 8 child care ratings systems that are required in at least a single state (as of the survey date), many states collect information on child care quality ratings for use in public advertising and website content, and in parent feedback efforts, interviews, or surveys. Nearly three-quarters of the states (22) reported that they use local parent groups (including parent education resources) to offer parental education opportunities regarding child care, according to several CCDF administrators interviewed. In fiscal year 2017, almost all CCDF administrators reported that at least one of their child care resource and referral agencies provided the following to child care providers: 24-hour emergency contacts; a family locator service; and a toll-free, child/infant CPR/First Aid training number, according to 6 of 32 state officials interviewed (although they could not report 27 percent of these activities). The majority of states and all but some local child care provider resources use or have implemented a minimum data quality standard for their data collection efforts, according to 4 of 25 child care resource and referral administrators interviewed. Nearly all states that rely on CCDF administer parental education activities and most of these activities are available to parents of the child care children at no cost, according to 12 of the parents interviewed. However, only about half of the parents interviewed received financial support for child care, as of fiscal year 2017. Although most states reported funding to parents seeking CCDF, more than half of the parents reported that they had never (or rarely) received child care subsidies from CCDF. About half of the parents (4 of 9) reported that they have to travel a long distance to their child care providers, and about one-quarters of the states require parents to submit child care information to CCDF before and after each summer child care session, according to 3 of the 9 child care resource and referral administrators interviewed. In general, the child care resource and referral agencies offer support and advice to parents from the start of a child care provider (or before) and continue to offer these services, sometimes including child care resources, to both parents and child care providers, often in a classroom or training center at a child care center, throughout a child\u2019s educational period, even after the child turns 5 years old (13 states). A surprising number of states require child care providers to submit child care information to one another, especially in real-time, as a way to address the 6 percent of child care subsidies that do not reach the children to whom they were originally allocated. In fiscal year 2017, over one third of states use consumer education resources to provide information to parents regarding child care, according to 18 of the 25 child care resource and referral administrators interviewed. States often (14) or sometimes (12) provide parent education resources, including child care information and parenting help. A large number of child care resource and referral agencies, according to 19 of the child care resource and referral administrators interviewed, offer child care information, including child care information regarding the development and physical growth of child care infants (or pre-schoolers), with a 4 percent improvement. Child care resource and referral agencies are authorized to enroll parent and child care resource and referral agencies in some states may use (or consider using) parent assistance programs, in order to help parents and children learn about child care and child care resource and referral agencies may use (or consider using) information regarding the availability of childcare resources (e.g. child care subsidies); for example, a parent may need to be", "For over a decade, GSA has used a leasing program that provides the federal government with services similar to those offered to other commercial customers.

The ITAR covers a wide range of U.S.-origin technology, including computer software and design, electronics, and general engineering practices, and prohibits their export if their purpose is to help other countries design or develop military items that could be deployed in U.S. service. Certain exportable items or source code may also be subject to export controls, even if they are being used in the U.S. in commercial trade; however, trade can also be facilitated through several mechanisms, depending on the circumstances, including a license, temporary export authority, or an authorized contractor. For example, there are several U.S. government-approved manufacturers, distributors, and other authorized contractors who are authorized to facilitate the export of U.S.-origin items, such as equipment and software. The two primary methods of controlling U.S.-origin items are the \u201csource code control rule\u201d\u2014meaning items that are covered by ITAR source code control requirements are subject to export restrictions as a result of their source code control requirements\u2014and the \u201ccommercial controls rule\u201d\u2014items within categories defined in the ITAR are subject to EAR licensing requirements unless they are not U.S. origin or are deemed exports to the U.S. Additionally, items controlled on the EAR that are used on military aircraft may be subject to additional U.S. export restrictions and regulations. In recent years, the U.S. administration has been increasing its efforts to ensure that items exported to U.S. military installations are also subject to the EAR, and has updated those regulations to broaden the definition of end-use/ end-user to encompass multiple categories of controlled items. 5.0 BACKGROUND.", "In fiscal year 2006, the federal government enacted the National Flood Insurance program (NFIP) Reform and Modernization Act of 2006, which amended FEMA\u2019s ability to assess premiums for uninsured victims in certain severe flood events. The federal government's direct role could vary depending on the specific event or emergency situation. For example, when Hurricane Katrina occurred in New Orleans in 2005, FEMA was authorized by Congress to provide assistance to private property owners who suffered a direct or indirect loss due to the disaster. In FY 2006, the President\u2019s Budget proposed an annual increase in the federal liability cap to assist federal property managers to ensure that flood-prone communities could access insurance for reconstruction costs or other expenses after the event. FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH ACT The fiscal year 2006 Appropriations Act included the Federal Employee Mental Health Program (FEMEP), which provides federal employees access to mental health services paid for by the federal government. FEMEP will replace the existing Veterans Affairs (V.A.) program in that Department, which was established to ensure that veterans are provided with high- quality mental health services so that they can resume full productive functions of their lives. FEMEP received funding separate from the VA program. As mentioned previously, in FY 2006, the President\u2019s Budget proposed an annual increase in the federal liability cap to assist federal property managers to ensure that flood-prone communities could access insurance for reconstruction costs or other expenses after the event. On September 11, 2008, President George W. Bush and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, released to the public the initial report of the 9/11 Commission. The report stated that \u201cThe federal government\u2019s failure to act timely to prevent attacks on the WTC could have been prevented.\u201d In response, the President\u2019s Budget includes in 2010 approximately $1.4 billion in cost sharing, which is the portion of the Department of Defense (DoD) costs for a variety of activities that may be charged in exchange for DoD resources previously allocated for such activities. During 2007, FEMA has been designated by law to administer an assistance program after a presidentially declared disaster. This program includes assistance in temporary living expenses and essential government services and rebuilding costs. In addition, FEMA plays a lead role in determining, processing and administering all the emergency costs incurred by a single disaster. All those costs are then submitted to the President\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval upon a reasonable amount. In order to provide federal support to aid private property owners who are adversely affected by a disaster, FEMA may set aside up to $1.5 billion from that emergency fund for construction costs, including the rebuild of public facilities. The money can only be used for emergency public assistance, such as emergency sheltering, food, water, and medical supplies provided by emergency personnel. The President\u2019s Budget also includes in FY 2009 approximately $1 billion in cost-sharing, which is the portion of the DoD costs for a variety of activities that may be charged in exchange for DoD resources allocated for these activities. During 2007, FEMA has been designated as head administrator and authorized by law to administer assistance to individuals and businesses impacted by hurricanes or tornadoes. Those costs are then submitted to OMB for approval, to a reasonable amount. As FEMA is an agency within the Executive Branch of government, its costs in the immediate aftermath of the disaster are not separately charged to the Congress until it is approved by that Legislative body. It is noteworthy that FEMA is a private organization. Unlike the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the 15 years it has served the public will be completed in 2014. Its primary responsibility is emergency assistance and, although FEMA serves as a first responder, it primarily does not provide benefits to individual people. The only direct assistance provided is a limited form of unemployment benefits, where a portion of a person\u2019s previous 13 weeks of benefits are given as a result of the disaster. If FEMA determines these benefits would not be paid in excess of certain amounts, all or most of the benefits are subject to cost sharing or in the case of construction costs, that are not reimbursable. The current 7.8 percent FERCCA fee in addition to the FEMEP funding also adds to the costs. FEMA is authorized to provide assistance to individuals and small businesses in the form of temporary housing, certain contents and repair costs of the primary residence in excess of $100,000. However, FEMA is unable to provide assistance directly to the state, municipality or counties. In general, FEMA\u2019s primary responsibilities for FEMA are for the disaster preparedness and response, emergency medical services such as hospitals, medical and mental health services, feeding and hydration, temporary housing and other necessary services. FEMA does not administer benefits for a variety of personal obligations of an individual. For example, individuals are not qualified", "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandate that federal agencies create an equal employment opportunity program and prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, or disability status.

The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires agencies to report to Congress how they\u2019re using program funds, how the government is spending their tax dollars, and the status of each program\u2019s 2019 estimate and payment. However, agencies do not consistently produce these reports on all programs\u2014which is a material weakness that the Government Information and Services Committee (GISA) has previously identified. Agencies\u2019 inadequate information reporting processes put the government\u2014and taxpayers\u2014 at risk of errors or even fraud. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires agencies to report on the risk of errors if IGs cannot confirm their improper payments estimates, as well as their plans for responding to any potential noncompliance. Agencies that do not report their estimates must also report the size and scope of their errors to U.S. Department of State (USDOE), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), among other agencies. Several agencies reported that their improper payment estimates did not accurately reflect their internal controls, posing the possibility that errors could arise in certain areas of their processes and reports that the IRS uses to ensure accurate receipt and payment of taxes. In December 2018, GISA and OMB-OIMS coordinated a letter that was sent by OIGs to IG executives. The letter informed IG executives about a requirement for each agency\u2019s 2021 Improper Payments Information Report. The report must submit for each program a 2019 SUMMARIZED IMPROPER PAYMENT REPORT 5 The Improper Payments Information Act requires agencies to report on internal controls pertaining to program payments. The Act requires each agency receiving the report to develop, implement, and maintain internal control systems. This guidance defines internal control systems as information and control procedures that provide the Government with reasonable assurances that material federal program payments will be accurately recorded by agencies. The Act requires each agency to develop a process (i.e., an internal control form) that identifies potential risks (e.g., noncompliance with the Improper Payments Information Act (IPERA) requirements) of program payments. Each agency must also evaluate the results of the form (risk identification list) it submits and develop controls to minimize any risk identified. Each agency must also submit an Improper Payments Information Report (IPERA) to OIG for each program that is subject of its report and annual audit in which material federal program errors are reported (e.g., $25 million in Medicaid error reports). Agencies must develop their own processes that capture specific risks. They should use the Internal Control Form, which contains 13 controls and five risk indicators (Figure 1). The controls may vary among agencies depending on their size and complexity. Figure 2 illustrates the number of agencies responding to IPERA as of December 2018. While 99 percent of agencies reported that all 14 controls are in operation, we remain concerned that not all agencies are consistently applying these controls. On the flip side, nearly all the agencies (98 percent) reported that the overall processes and procedures required to generate the reports and responses did not adhere to OMB-OIMS\u2019s expectations, suggesting that some agencies are not in compliance on the whole. Figure 3 displays the number of agencies that have reported material federal program error reports since 2015. Agencies were required to report any error at least once every five years, but they are not required to report error reports separately from their yearly reports. The Act does not require agencies to use IPERA in 2018 to ensure all internal controls are in place. Agencies that report that there are errors in the number of incorrect payments (e.g., \u201cno cash or noncash payment\u201d when paid by check), instead of reporting the payments at an individual check number, must submit the error report to all 13 fields (see Figure 4 for examples). When submitting a report, agencies must include an IPERA form, which contains 13 controls and five risk indicators. The form should also contain the agency\u2019s internal control structure, and the Internal Audit Officer (IAO) must attest the accuracy of the information. In 2018, OIG used the IPERA form in collaboration with GISA to verify the accuracy of the information reported in the 2015 IPERA form (and other sources) to the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury). GISA and OIMS also coordinated a letter sent to IG executives in December 2018. The letter requested all agencies to provide feedback on the content of the documents. Each OIG was required to review the reports on all three entities for the first two quarters of 2018 and each quarter of 2019 for all three organizations. Figure 4 reports 5%", "In 2001, DOD initiated a program that was destined to eventually create the F-35, the most advanced fighter jet to date. Though the program was restructured multiple times and is now at an uncertain position due to funding constraints, the program has consistently increased its forecast for developmental testing while also improving readiness for operational testing. Due to the program\u2019s development and test timelines, it is unlikely that there will be a definitive budget for the entire F-35 program, since each of the program\u2019s three configurations (F-35A, B, and C) will share a single airframe. Due to funding constraints, we also cannot give definitive financial data for the program\u2019s future funding requirements.

The report also includes an updated F-35 fact sheet which you can view here.", "Hospitals with a Medicare-dependent, small, rural designation can receive an additional payment of up to 75 percent of the difference between their actual revenue reimbursement (IPPS) and the payment based on their MDHA designation. Hospitals with only the MDHA designation are not eligible for any financial aid. Size. As of 2003, there are more than 2,600 hospitals in the United States. In contrast, of the approximately 500 hospitals in South Africa (2003), 400 of them are classified as public and, therefore, are not-for-profit organizations and their payments were publicly funded. For example, the South African public hospital system accounts for about 50 percent of the hospitals\u2019 total net income. Of the hospitals paying for inpatient payments through the MDHA program, approximately 30 percent are classified as public hospitals (public hospitals have no direct payments, whereas private sector hospitals generally have some costs associated with their hospitals). (See fig. 3.) Other Rural Payment Designations. One other rural payment designation we have reviewed is that of Critical Access Hospitals (CAHS). Hospitals that meet certain rural eligibility criteria can receive CAHS designation, which was authorized in 1997 through a separate legislation. CAHs are rural hospitals located in sparsely populated areas that are more than 15 miles away from another hospital, such as a large teaching or research medical center. Approximately 4.8 percent of U.S. hospitals are located in rural areas. In particular, CAHSs can apply for special payments if they provide 24-hour emergency services to meet their inpatient needs. Hospitals can receive these additional payments even if they are in a CAH area that was not established by legislation but that has been (or will be) licensed as a CAHS. The MDHA program has been authorized by law for over 30 years. The MDHA program payments are based on cost of inpatient activity. The MDHA payments are generally higher when a hospital offers a range of services or is located in a metropolitan area or in a sparsely populated locality as opposed to a rural location. The MDHA program has an annual maximum payment per hospital, which in turn is based on the hospital\u2019s per capita payments. A hospital\u2019s per capita payment is the value of payments each year per capita that is used by CMS to calculate the payments made to hospitals for inpatient care. These payments are calculated from each hospital\u2019s total costs and are adjusted annually to reflect changes in the value of the hospitals\u2019 per capita payments. Because of recent developments in the Affordable Care Act, there are now a number of additional ways that MDHs can receive additional payments above their base payments based on the hospital\u2019s MDHA status. Hospitals with MDH designation must report their annual per capita payments. For hospitals that do not report their annual per capita payments, CMS will determine the hospital\u2019s payments based using a standardized formula with a number of payment categories (e.g., hospital inpatient costs = 5 and 95 percent of the per capita cost of \"hospital outpatient services\"). MDHs are able to access certain tax credits (i.e., the 50 percent reduction in FICA contribution that employers pay based on payroll deductions to provide their employees) through the HRSA MCHC grant program. This allows the hospital to share the tax benefit its employer gets from these contributions. In the 1997 authorization of (See fig. 4) the State-Based Rural Health Plan (SBRHP), hospitals are reimbursed at a set fee per bed day or per hour. Additionally, CMS reimburses for outpatient services provided to patients with a diagnosis of a medically necessary chronic condition or a medically necessary diagnostic test procedure. CMS will also reimburse hospitals for medically necessary inpatient procedures that include a one-time fee for each hour of inpatient hospital time that results in a bill of more than one hour at the hourly rate. There is no requirement that hospitals submit any of their additional reimbursements, so they are available to hospitals that have not previously applied for them. State-Based Rural Health Planning Incentives. In addition to reimbursement for medical costs, CMS in 1997 authorized state-level rural hospitals to be provided with additional funding. There are now numerous state-level initiatives that provide funding to rural hospitals. For example, Arkansas was authorized to provide funding to rural hospitals that serve the state\u2019s rural population for such purposes as medical care. Other states have similar arrangements. Although hospitals do not have to apply for these funds, one of the requirements is that they must prove that they are operating with a Medicaid-eligible population before receiving any of (See fig.5). In addition to providing additional funding, CMS is using these state level-initiatives to increase the availability of health centers and clinics. In 1993, CMS established a pilot program that provides matching payments up to $300,000 per year, per hospital to provide outpatient services, such as the time nurses spend administering medications. According to", "The FAR requires the solicitations for products and services that are predominantly for such items be reviewed and limited based on the principles set forth in a final rule. The FAR required DOD to assess noncapital systems contracts based on life cycle costs, nonrecurring requirements, and current cost. Specifically, DOD must establish a process which identifies the need for any trade-offs between cost and non-cost factors which could result in nonrecurring costs. DOD concurred with this recommendation, but plans to address questions related to the application of these two criteria when utilzing the LPTA process, specifically the trade-off between cost and non-cost factors and the trade-off between cost or price and non-cost factors.", "These include recommending all DoD and DoD-related organizations track the following information: race, ethnicity, gender, and nationality in all military systems. All military organizations should have the capability to collect the DoD-wide standard search on all personnel databases.

Recommendations to increase transparency in the military justice system when assessing racial and ethnic disparities were repeated in this report for all DoD and DoD-related organizations. These recommendations include requiring the DoD\u2019s Office of the Civil Rights to collect and maintain a military justice database of every conviction and current case and to analyze and publish the race and ethnicity related to criminal convictions and case outcomes ; implementing additional data collection regarding race and ethnicity to enhance reporting and analysis within military justice; and developing a training program for members of the military justice community to help them to understand their duties and responsibilities under the UCMJ related to racial and ethnic consideration. The recommended training will include a comprehensive briefing on all relevant cases and their outcome on ethnic and racial disparities, which should be integrated into the annual training for judges, attorneys, and military prosecutors.

In response, the company allegedly disclosed the unauthorized access to a law firm and the startup itself. As a result, the startup sued for the alleged disclosure of sensitive consumer information. The startup\u2019s counsel, however, filed papers requesting summary judgment on the company\u2019s motion to dismiss and the law firm\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The law firm argued the company is not a consumer or was involved in personal information trade (like medical, educational or employment information) and thus qualified as a data broker under Magnuson-Moss, a rule developed by the Supreme Court regarding the FTC Act's right to use its power to pursue data broker violations without promulgating rules before seeking public data, data held privately, or data about consumer, which, per regulations, is treated differently than personal data. This case thus fits under the Magnuson-Moss \u201cpreemption\u201d clause and falls on a higher tier than the company and the law firm's right to seek relief through the FTC Act. The law firm argues the company engaged in data transmission without consent and the FTC Act's violation was under the \u201cpreemption\u201d clause or alternatively, violated Magnuson-Moss and Rule on Privacy of Medical and Financial Information, Exempt to Consumer Rule and C3S Rule. The law firm argues this right of action is subject to the Magnuson-Moss Procedures, including providing notice to a wide range of data handlers, even those who do not produce consumer and employment data, and \"pre-empting these other data handlers from complying with the FTC Act's data security and privacy protections. \u201d These are the legal issues surrounding which the District Court, Southern District of Florida, heard the case. The court decided first the laws under which each party would be able to seek relief under (1) the FTC Act and (2) the Magnuson-Moss \u201cpreemption clause\u201d. On the facts, the company provided the law firm with access to the company's consumer information, but the law firm used confidential data as compensation instead of the company\u2019s consumer data. Then on October 27, 2018, the company allegedly disclosed sensitive personal data about 87 million US users to Cambridge-based startup data-broking platform, Cambridge Analytical. This data was provided for \u201cdata science purposes\u201d and for Cambridge-based companies to sell their products. After the company allegedly learned there was a data security breach at Cambridge-based startup, the Startup filed for relief under (2) the Magnuson-Moss \u201cdata-broker data breach\u201d provision in the FTC Act, which the FTC also intervened in the lawsuit; and (1) the Magnuson-Moss right to seek consent. The startup attorney filed a motion to dismiss the case in October 7, 2018, claiming that it did not qualify as a data broker under the Magnuson-Moss rule and the FTC Act or the FTC Act alone. The court granted the motion and dismissed the case against the Law firm, but denied the motion to dismiss from the startup. It continued to assert that the FTC Act did not apply to the startup and could only apply to the data broker (Cambridge). This case is still ongoing.

Specifically, Treasury\u2019s new financial reporting hierarchy in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards may be interpreted as permitting the consolidation of amounts determined in accordance with FASAB and FASB standards into a single line item without conversion for differences in accounting policies, which could result in differences in amounts for the same CFS reporting line. Specifically, Treasury requires financial reporting accountants to report on the effect of certain accounting policies related to SFFAS 50 if a component entity included an opening balance or other amount determined in accordance with the accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, on the basis that the accounting policies would be consistently applied throughout the period of reporting. We found that Treasury has procedures in place to properly support and consistently report restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning net position reported in the revised fiscal year 2018 Financial Report. Specifically, we found that (1) Treasury did not have sufficient procedures to analyze and determine whether appropriate disclosures related to new federal accounting standards were included in the 2018 Financial Report draft. Treasury utilizes a checklist to consider all disclosures and reporting to ensure compliance with new accounting standards, which was not updated for fiscal year 2018. (2) Treasury and OMB did not have adequate procedures to determine the effects on selected CFS line items of using certain accounting policies issued in accordance with SFFAS 47, which may result in differences in amounts for the same CFS reporting line. Although Treasury\u2019s hierarchy may allow for the consolidation of components as long as financial reporting accountants properly report the differences in CFS line item amounts, Treasury\u2019s procedures for evaluating and determining the effects of specific accounting policies may not be effective in ensuring that all components in the Financial Report were reported correctly. In response to our report, Treasury provided the procedures and tools to evaluate the effect of certain accounting policies, to assist in the preparation of the current year\u2019s CFS and to provide Treasury, in conjunction with our report, an audit opinion related to those procedures. (3) Treasury has procedures in place to analyze and determine whether appropriate disclosures regarding new federal accounting standards were included in the currently-prepared 2018 Financial Report draft. Treasury would use a checklist to review each line item on the report. Additionally, Treasury has processes in place to consider component entities of a line item whose CFS is consolidated with others for various accounting purposes. While these processes have been useful, Treasury has not been able to keep its accounting reporting lines in a consistent hierarchy for each reporting period, and therefore has been unable to provide a true representation of line item amounts for the past fiscal year. This lack of accounting and reporting hierarchy is a significant factor contributing to the limitations in our report. During our current fiscal year audit, Treasury did not have sufficient procedures to analyze and determine the effect of new accounting standards in the draft of the CFS. Treasury also did not have adequate procedures to verify the application and effect of accounting and financial reporting policies, such as those related to new federal accounting standards. Treasury\u2019s hierarchy did allow for consolidation of components if they were properly prepared; however, Treasury\u2019s procedures to assess the effect of these accounting and financial reporting policies on selected line items did not provide a reliable basis for our report. We identified some potential limitations that could arise in Treasury\u2019s efforts to provide a complete and accurate financial report. Treasury could not determine if some of the information required to be reported under the Financial Accounting Standards Act was reported to the Public Financial Reporting Committee, as permitted. Treasury officials indicated that, as a practice, Treasury tries to maintain consistency from year to year despite reporting varying amounts. Treasury officials also stated that the amount and frequency of Treasury-wide financial reporting reports would depend in part on the time constraints established for the Financial Report and the CFS. Treasury officials stated that Treasury uses automated methods to ensure the accuracy of information and that Treasury and OMB were in constant close communication with one another to address concerns. We believe that Treasury is generally aware of the limitations inherent in their ability to maintain a uniform hierarchy of accounts and line items to report a reliable budget balance and to provide accurate, timely, and complete reports. Our report, which includes comments on specific accounting and financial reporting issues, generally concludes that Treasury is able to perform its current financial report responsibilities relatively easily. Treasury has the necessary structure and staff resources in place to provide an accurate financial report to the public. We noted that Treasury is taking steps to meet new reporting responsibilities under SFFS", "While the 2020 Census Partnership Program is a comprehensive effort to engage all partners in communicating the Census message to the public, its ultimate success depends on the willingness of local governments to engage in census partnerships to reach hard-to-count populations. | TABLE 2: 2020 Paid media plan for the Bureau of Census (as of May 2020) | Sources: Bureau of Census, American Community Survey, Federal Communications Commission.", "A review of the National Drug Control Strategy of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-Related Longitudinal Study (NHANLS-R), 2005-2018, can be obtained by clicking on this link: To retrieve the NHANLS-R dataset (with the metadata), one of the few publicly available datasets of drug use data, can be obtained by visiting: These datasets were used in the NHANLS-R dataset on which the National Drug Control Strategy Review was conducted. More specifically, this dataset was used for the following measures and variables of interest in the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy: The following were measured for the entire Strategy period: - Treatment Completion Rate - Recovery Rate (civilian) - Lifetime Substance Dependence in Adults - Youth Substance Use Initiation within School (ages 12-17) - Youth Substance Use Initiation within School (ages 18-25) - School-initiated substance use and initiation of drugs within the previous five years - Drug-related death (-) - Methadone-attributed deaths (-/+) - Drug-related hospitalization (-) - The use of Methadone (-) - The use of Non-Methadone Narcotics (-) - Drug arrests (-/+) - Total law enforcement-related offenses (-/-+) - Youth drug use-related calls (Civilian Police) - Civilian drug overdose call (-) - The call volume to emergency services per day (Civilian Law Enforcement). Measures and variables that are not shown were derived from a subset of the NHANLS-R. Because the NHANLS-R dataset was not updated until 2008, this is the most recent dataset which the Strategy used. However, not all measures that the Strategy utilized could be sourced from the NHANLS-R dataset. For example, the Strategy utilized the Drug Use Warning System, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. For more information on these methods and their sources, as well as a full review and discussion of the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy, see Table 1-3. These methods or other relevant research, have been utilized in the National Drug Control Strategy Review. IN THIS PROJECT\u2026 The National Drug Control Strategy Review provides an evaluation of the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy (2019NDC) by assessing the information on their webpages on substance use and education (for both adults and children, and including youth), prevention and recovery and prevention, treatment and recovery, law enforcement, infrastructure, and partnerships. We assessed the information on their webpages to make sure that the information was accurate, with a specific question for whether all measures were available on each webpage. The National Drug Control Strategy Review did not include any information on methadone use in the strategy. The National Drug Control Strategy website does contain information on methadone use, but we do not assess its information as it is not included in the Strategy at the level of the 12 measures of drug use and the related variables. METHODS: The methodology to evaluate the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy included an examination of the Strategy\u2019s main webpages on drug use and education, which included: (1) the National Drug Control Strategies website and (2) its Drug Use Education Clearinghouse for Adults and Children. This clearinghouse has information about drugs in general, as well as the use or misuse of drugs by specific groups of people. It also offers the National Drug Control Strategy\u2019s Drug-Free Kids Resource Network, which includes online materials for parents and educators to educate children about drugs. These materials include (1) a \u201cdrug diary\u201d for children to document their drug experiences, (2) a drug use activity sheet that is organized by age group, and (3) a drug-free sports activity sheet for young children. To evaluate the substance use-education portions of the Strategy\u2019s website, we reviewed the Drug, Alcohol and Other Substances Education for the Workforce (DHASEW) website. DHSEW focuses on specific population-specific strategies in which their focus is on developing a culture of health and preventing opioid addiction. The website also has information about National Drug Control Strategy initiatives. Data sources included the National Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (CJISS) National Domestic Violent Death Reporting Program (NVDP), which provides information for drug-related death data, as well as the Drug-Related Deaths project. This project links information that drugs like methadone were consumed with the death. In addition, we conducted additional information searches concerning the National Drug Control Strategy on its website to determine whether all measures were included on specific pages such as Drug Education and Prevention, Methadone Use, Methadone Certification, and the Drug-Free Workplace Program. Finally, a thorough review of the Strategy\u2019s 12 National Drug Use Indicators includes a", "Freight railroads carry freight over 140,000 miles of track at speeds from 25 to 70 miles per hour in both light and heavy railcars. The railcar make up is composed of locomotives (to power and control the locomotive and supply power to the railcars), followed by a set of freight cars. Railroads use a variety of freight configurations depending on the type, quantity, and weight of the freight they haul. Several systems, including distributed power (DP), are used to improve efficiency and safety on trains. The air brake on each car sequentially stops, providing greater control and preventing in-train forces. TRAIN PATH AND BRAKING: As railcars are moved to the front of the train and apply the brakes, the air pressure is controlled sequentially until the air breaks are applied, resulting in a reduction in force and in a compression of the railcars. Each car receives the same signal, but the duration before the brake signal is applied is the time for railcars in the rear to stop, requiring significantly more distance to stop in comparison to railcars closer to the front, who experience less compression. SUMMARY AND TABLE DATA PAGE The average rail length in the United States is 7,420 feet (2,260 meters), so each rail segment, which is typically 1,600 feet (500 meters) wide, must serve a purpose in the overall railroad design. The distance between rail segments, which varies according to the train\u2019s size and the type and material of railcars, is a total of 13,200 feet (4,000 meters) per 20-minute segment. Rail segments also serve a purpose in the overall railroad design in order to allow trains at certain times to travel at slower speeds. In addition, the number of rail segments between the locomotive and railhead can be designed independently and can vary between different locomotive types for economic and efficiency reasons. Table 1 shows the average, minimum, and maximum width of rail segments in use. The distance between rails in a railroad segment is fixed to 1,600 feet (500 meters), and rail segments are laid out on a grid-work pattern (Figure 1). TRAIN PATH AND BRAKING The railroad segments are laid out on a grid work pattern, which allows a train to stop at certain locations without slowing other trains on the route. The minimum width of a rail segment is 18 inch (0.46 meters), which is also 1,600 feet (500 meters) wide. The average rail width in the U.S. is about 24 feet (7 meters), and the width changes depending on railroads (see Figure 1). The average rail width in Denmark is about 5 meters, and in some countries it is as little as 1 meter. The average rail width in Australia is about 11 meters, and in Switzerland about 14 meters. The length and width of the rail segments vary depending on the type of rail, the rail width is also fixed so it is the 24 ft length that changes. The maximum width of rail segments in use are in railroads where rail is 18 inch (0.46 meters) wide, which allows a train to travel much slower at a time. Railway width and rail segment length, and track density for railroad width and rail segment length are a function of the length and width of both the rail and rail path. This is due to a mathematical relationship between the rail and railway widths. (This information can be readily found in a number of railroads' annual reports, including those of railroads operating trains on railroads owned by the federal government.) TRAIN PATH AND BRAKING Railroads are arranged in a grid-work pattern. The distance between rail segments is fixed at 1,600 feet (0.46 meters). In U.S. railroads, the rail segments are generally 24 feet or 7 meters in length, with a width of 19 inches or 48 cm. In Denmark, average rail segments are 10 feet or 3 meters in length, with one leg of rails measuring 0.9 meters or 33 inches in width. In Australia, the railway segments are generally 3.3 meters or 11 feet in width. In Switzerland, where the rail width is 7 meters, there is a minimum rail segment length of 6 centimeters or 0.24. 21-30 Figure 1 13-15 Figure 2 Figure 21 0% 10% 80% 10 90% 80 80 90 100 110 00% 0.0 % 0.0..1). Data on rail distance, rail width, rail segment length and rail car size are critical for rail performance, operations and maintenance at airports, railroads and transit rail systems from 0 to 4.5 inches in width. FRA conducted a survey of its railroad", "A majority of respondents (64%) answered yes, indicating that there is at least one employee in their office who regularly handles 14 different types of claim situations, while a smaller percentage responded that there are 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, or more employees. Most respondents indicated that there are 5-6 employees who handle all claim situations. The majority (69%) also responded that there are 5 or fewer employees who can handle all their claim situations, while a further 5% responded that there are 4-6 employees who have access to all their claim situations. At least one respondent indicated that there were a minimum of 7 or more employees in their office who handled some of their claim situations, with 10 respondents reporting that more than 7 employees work on these matters (see Table 1). When asked who is responsible for ensuring that staff working at OGW comply with applicable federal and state laws (see Figure 3B), 76% responded that staff would be responsible. A smaller 20% of respondents also indicated that staff would enforce the applicable laws and regulations more than often would be the responsibility of supervisors/managers, while a final 4% anticipated that they would never have to enforce such laws. Nearly one-third (34%) reported that staff themselves would be held responsible for ensuring compliance by customers. The remainder of the question (11% vs. 79%) was split between two groups of responses: 32% indicating that they would be both held responsible and customers (if staff did not comply), while 6% reported that customers would be responsible and staff would be held accountable; the remaining respondents (7%) had their responses cross checked so, not being relevant, there were no options to indicate the desired course of action (see Figure 3A). Only 4% who responded at least a few times each reported that this would be in practice only on staff working in their offices. Most respondents indicated that only staff would be responsible for ensuring compliance. A larger proportion of respondents indicated that staff themselves would need to be responsible to their own employer. In addition, 48% who work at OGW had staff working solely in OGW; while fewer (39%) of respondents work in a location where staffing and payroll are shared by another county office. Of this size group, 60% reported having OGW staff who will be working part-time. OGW staff working at least 2 half days per week also have this time in lieu of paid time. In addition, of those employees within this group, 67% do not receive paid vacation and holidays, while 33% do. Employees are paid $15.67 per 8 hour work hour for their OGW duties. Most respondents were paid daily, except for those who are on \u201csick leave.\u201d At 64%, those employees were paid for half a day or more each week, while 5% of respondents are paid salary that includes half time (less than 2,000 hours per year), and 63% are paid \u201csick leave\u201d (with varying durations). In addition, 8% who work at OGW had employees who were salaried (no hours deducted), while fewer than 4 in total reported being paid \u201cfull time\u201d (more than 40 hours per week), with 67% having employees working part-time. Employees receiving paychecks weekly were paid $32, while employees working 40 + hours a week were paid $51. Most employees also get paid a \u201cflat rate holiday bonus that amounts to two (2) weeks of their base salary.\u201d Two-thirds of employees work at least 2 days a week, but 50% of respondents answered that they were salaried, meaning their salaries were non-deductible from their taxes. Less than 8% of the OGW staff reported that they \u201cnever get overtime pay and, if they have to work on a federal holiday, you can buy it. Employees get up to two days of paid sick leave per year, paid at the minimum salary ($30.33), for up to 6 days total in each year (with no limit on how many years in a row employees may have been paid for these sick leave days). Vacation leave of up to 7 days per year was not offered at OGW. Employees working 40 hours a week receive that rate of two days a year, for up to 6 years in each 20-year job category. The number of 40+ hour workers receiving this same number of days is not provided in the text. The majority of employees (94%) are salaried employees, which means that they receive a fixed salary (which sometimes includes the amount of their tax withholdings, with or without employer matching contributions). One respondent indicated that staff are able to work from home after 2 years of working", "\u2022 The cost of counting the U.S. population has been escalating since the 1970s. \u2022 The 2010 Census was the most expensive in the Bureau\u2019s history, and was 31 percent more expensive when dollars were adjusted to 2020 inflation rates compared to the 1990 Census. \u2022 In recent years, the Bureau faced uncertainties surrounding the citizenship question and an increasing use of litigation to challenge the case. The Bureau resolved these challenges by moving forward with printing of the census forms, questionnaire testing, and questionnaire mailing in July 2019. The Census Bureau expects to release final 2020 Census population estimates sometime after September 24, 2019. TEXT: The value of time for counting a nation\u2019s population has been escalating with each decade. Since the 1970s, the cost of counting the US population has been escalating (figure 6). By 2000, the count of population and housing units included more than 100 million people, surpassing the number in the 1950 Census. The 2030 Census count is more than 330 million people. The cost for counting population has been escalating with each decade. From 1970 to 2000, the cost of population census increased ninefold from $16 million to $1.5 billion in 2020 dollars (Figure 6). By 2050, the count of population is estimated to rise more than 70 percent since 2010, representing nearly 386 million inhabitants. The cost of counting population is rising at an increasing rate as the census has been adapted to changing population, family structure patterns, and demographic evolution. There are both external and internal challenges affecting the census count, which in turn could influence the cost to complete it. External challenges include rising postal costs and the increasing cost of printing materials, in addition to legal challenges regarding the timing of citizen enumeration in recent years. Internal challenges include evolving attitudes toward respondent participation and the challenges of recruiting, retaining, and deploying staff or contractors necessary to complete the census. Since the 1980s, the Census Bureau has been making strides to modernize the Census Count Census process, including the use of technology in data collection, as well as developing new strategies for reaching hard-to-enumerate populations. However, the current legal climate of the citizenship case has been challenging the process, as it questions whether the current form of the question should be included on the 2020 Census. It remains to be seen whether the challenges will be resolved by the legal system in time for Census Count Census completion this year.

In fiscal year 2017, approximately 1.3 million organizations reported to IRS tax revenue generated by 880,000 individual taxpayers filing tax returns. Tax-exempt organizations are under the oversight of the Exempt Organization unit. IRS has resolved to identify new methods or tools to perform cross-examination and analysis to efficiently detect tax law violations or compliance issues requiring higher level examination. For example, the IRS Audit technique, known as TE/GE Risk Analysis, reviews information and trends to spot compliance-related errors and trends requiring additional investigation. Section 501(c)(3) of the taxpayer Internal Revenue Code section provides tax exemptions to organizations whose purpose is to engage in exclusively charitable, religious, or educational programs under section 501(c)(3) in accordance with section 170(c)(1). Organizations with 501(c)(3) status are required by law to apply that test a minimum of in excess of 50 percent of their total gross receipts to the test set forth above. If a majority of the organization\u2019s activities are in accordance with a particular IRS service and examination requirement, the organization can qualify for a special tax exemption. Under a program named EO Compliance Analysis, IRS, in conjunction with the Federal Government Accounting Standards Board, is seeking an independent reviewer to assess a financial-management system to ensure compliance with federal tax requirements. The program is part of the IRS Exempt Organization Compliance and Assistance (EOCA) program, which conducts quality reviews of tax-exempt organizations and other federal tax types at no cost to taxpayers. EOCA reviewers have the opportunity to perform in-depth audits of tax-exempt organizations for a fee if the organization qualifies for the program. Each EOCA review examines at least five key areas of the organization\u2019s operations (income, sales, purchases, leases, construction expenditures) and its finances and accounting practices to determine if the organization qualifies for EOCA participation. An eligible tax-exempt organization must satisfy each of the five general requirements and complete all requirements in order to qualify. These five requirements comprise a unique and comprehensive list of a tax organization\u2019s requirements in order to be eligible. The five requirements comprise: (1) tax-exempt organizations must be primarily engaged in tax-exempt purposes; (2) financial-management system in place; (3) a tax year must also be a qualified tax year; and (4) must file tax returns, including electronic return filing, in accordance with the IRS requirements. The fifth requirement involves performing in-depth audits; however, the organization may choose to participate in EOCA because no examination, including an EOCA review, is necessary. A major objective of EOCA is to reduce the number of organizations eligible for tax exemptions. The primary focus is on taxable organizations. EOCA\u2019s goal is to continue to have tax-exempt organizations become eligible for EOCA until no longer is necessary due to the reduction of the number of eligible tax-exempt organizations.", "PROMOTING INDIRECT DANGEROSITY DURING THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY AND RELATED ACT (Public Law 104-259, R.J.T.A.R. Section 1095(2)(g)) was enacted through public law, in the bill known as SSA-2006, and requires ONDCP to develop and promulgate a National Drug Control Strategy annually and on February 1 of each year. It requires that each agency that receives direct drug control funds from ONDCP develop an annual plan and budget for carrying out drug control programming. A recent court case ruling (Mazzarella v. HHS Director) stated that an ONDCP director's actions are an act \"in furtherance of,\" or \"within the scope of,\" the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP) authority to prescribe the duties and conduct of the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Office. The Federal Register Act of 1947, 5 U.S.C. 7(a), in conjunction with the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 5001-504; provides that certain procedures are in furtherance to the administrative functions of the Department of Health and Human Services (Department) to carry out its statutory responsibilities; and that the Agency may use administrative procedures, including those procedures set out in the Federal Register Act of 1947--5 U.S.C 5--(a)--(b) and 29 CFR 5-300-30--(i) and the Administrative Procedure Act--10 U.S.C. 1341(b) of a request by an individual to the Agency not to perform certain acts by or with respect to which the individual is not presently or previously employed; the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is to perform and perform related functions as needed, including to perform such additional acts as the Director determines are necessary. The National Drug Control Strategy for 2019, as prepared by OnDCP, required the Director of OnDCP to continue to develop and distribute drug control information materials to inform the public of the significance of this goal. The Drug Strategy also required the Director of ONDCP to develop and implement a campaign, including public relations campaigns, to continue to inform health care providers that drug-related death, including drug-related hospital admissions, may now be a significant public health threat. Further, Drug Strategy stated that when drug-related hospital admissions are occurring, it is likely that drug-related deaths will likely follow. Therefore, in order to make ONDCP\u2019s resources more useful the Strategic Campaign for Awareness of Drug-related Deaths was to begin in 2019. This Campaign will create a public service advertising campaign to increase awareness of the danger of drug-related death, and to encourage family members to call 1-800-662-HELP to speak with an addiction specialist and to ask their questions. Additionally, the National Drug Control Strategy stated that the Office of National Drug Control Drug Strategy is to perform, with respect to drug-related information received by the Department, the following: develop appropriate guidelines to ensure that in order for the Department to receive the drug-related information the Department\u2019s officers and employees are not required to make any information available to the public; ensure that the Department\u2019s employees are not required to provide any confidential information obtained during the investigation or to disclose any confidential information obtained or received by the employees from the public; to perform such other duties and tasks as the Director of ONDCP determines are necessary, and to prescribe such necessary procedures in order to further drug-related information to the public; develop a method of collecting information from the Department that ensures the information provided to the National Drug Control Strategy is not confidential; implement a program of providing information and assistance related to the drug problem; perform such other duties and tasks as the Director of ONDCP determines are necessary, and to prescribe such necessary procedures in order to further drug-related information to the public. 1-1-5-BONC: Use of National Drug Control Strategy, drug-related deaths, drugs, illegal drug, drugs, prescription drugs, prescriptions, drug use, drug problems, drug abuse, drug abuse treatment, drug-related deaths, drugs, legal drugs, drug-related deaths and drug use, drug treatment, prescription drug use, prescription drugs, prescription drugs, prescription drug use, prescription drug abuse, prescription drug prevention, prescription drug treatment, prescription drug therapy, prescription drug abuse, prescription drug overdose, drugs and drug abuse, drug abuse, prescription drugs, prescription drug abuse, prescription drug abuse, drug treatment, prescription drug abuse, prescription drug abuse, prescription drugs, prescription drugs, prescription drug overdose, prescription drug overdose, prescription drug abuse, prescription drug, prescription drugs, prescription drugs, prescription drugs, prescription drug abuse prevention, prescription drugs, prescription drugs", "As a result of Super Typhoon Rota in 2018, more than 90 percent of the population lost power for more than 2,500 hours, and the Saipan International Airport closed for more than 7 weeks.

GAO identified many actions that have been completed but not always fully addressed. Actions that have been fully addressed still need greater collaboration in implementation. Actions to address gaps in effectiveness within government agencies are necessary to ensure that taxpayers\u2019 dollars are well spent. Agencies have made significant progress over the past decade in addressing these challenges, particularly through improving communication, collaboration, and information sharing. The actions identified in this report reflect Federal progress. However, Congress still must consider addressing the remaining challenges that GAO raised to improve their effectiveness. DOD is working on reducing duplication by identifying similar actions across the services, but challenges remain. Federal agencies are making strides in addressing their gaps in information systems. Agencies are beginning to streamline acquisition processes across government. However, further actions are needed, especially within civilian intelligence agencies. GAO will continue to monitor these actions. This report is a very useful document for anyone who wants to stay informed on these important issues. The author of the report will conduct a review of this report at each fiscal year-end in order to keep the report updated. You should periodically visit the date at the top of the report to monitor its progress. If you have any questions regarding these actions, please contact Mr. Joe Kasper, (ksasper@gao.gov), (202) 441-4715, or Dr. Jerald Sigler, (jsigler@gao.gov), (202) 441-5316, at GAO-IG.

Coordination may be affected by factors such as availability of funding, alignment of different federal program requirements, and distances between transit providers. Although coordination can serve as a motivator for stakeholders, it is often difficult to coordinate due to limited resources. Almost two-thirds of stakeholders we spoke with in our interviews and literature review cited resource constraints as one of the biggest barriers to coordination. One participant in one of our discussion groups described the potential challenges of rural transit coordination due to multiple rural transit providers in his area, lack of transportation networks, and transportation provider fragmentation. This fragmentation is likely to result from the distribution of funding for transportation services. For example, one rural transportation provider told us that it is often difficult for rural transit providers to compete for funding, even if they identify and apply for it. We also found that funding from a variety of federal agencies is not always effectively coordinated with rural transportation providers, which may interfere with their ability to provide comprehensive or quality services to rural communities. Challenges and barriers to coordination can be addressed by various mechanisms. For example, one of our discussion groups suggested federal partnerships among rural transit providers, such as cooperative purchasing agreements of service providers, as a tool to facilitate coordination. In addition, our literature review and interviews with three discussion groups suggested that rural transportation providers face challenges in coordinating their services with other providers and programs, including a lack of awareness, limited access to data, and fragmentation of transportation networks. When discussing the feasibility of technology as a tool for rural transit coordination, stakeholders said that technological solutions like data- sharing portals and virtual training platforms would be helpful for sharing information, coordinating services, and expanding their service areas even farther in the future. Several of our literature review and interview participants agreed that rural transit coordination can be improved by providing more support and encouragement from FTA\u2019s administration and staff, as well as from DOT. FTA works closely with rural transit providers, providing them with support in areas such as human resources, accounting, and programmatic assistance. Specifically, FRA found that rural transportation formula grants are provided to states to pay a portion of the cost of providing service to rural communities. However, although FRA works with rural transit providers, there may be issues if FRA determines that a rural transit provider can manage without FTA\u2019s support. There is also concern among stakeholders that FTA does not fully understand the variety of services offered by rural transportation providers: stakeholders in our literature review and discussions reported that their providers offer many different types of services to rural populations, including fixed-routes, emergency medical transport, and school transportation in addition to fixed-route transit services. Our interviews showed that DOT may have limited data access, technical assistance, and funding opportunities that hinders FTA\u2019s ability to effectively address issues in rural transportation, and that FTA may be limited in its ability to facilitate collaboration among rural transit providers. In their literature review, one stakeholder suggests that to strengthen coordination, DOT and regional agencies should develop more regional tools and partnerships between agencies and rural transit providers. Our review and conversations suggest that while there may be obstacles and challenges, rural transportation can still be coordinated by leveraging the strengths and resources of all parties involved. One of our stakeholder interviews noted that rural transportation providers are willing to work together and are motivated to collaborate despite limited funding. When discussing specific technologies that can improve coordination, stakeholders mentioned different kinds of data-sharing portals that would allow them to share data, and virtual training opportunities to expand their service area even further. For several stakeholders, there is the potential that technology could serve as a helpful tool to enhance coordination and support rural transit services. One issue with implementing technology is that it can be cost-prohibitive for rural transit services. Participants in our literature review and discussions suggested that one potential barrier to rural transportation is a lack of adequate, high-speed data transmission and connection costs. Several stakeholders reported facing this challenge, noting that access to broadband for rural communities can be a major challenge and that it becomes harder for rural transit passengers if they have to pay significant amounts for service. Rural transportation providers have stated that they would like to be able to offer a variety of routes, and that rural transit should be able to adapt the type of service to the needs of their passengers. When speaking about the importance of connectivity and technology in rural transit, stakeholders often pointed to two distinct types of connectivity: the connectivity between rural transit providers and DOT, and the connectivity between rural transit providers and service providers in their communities. In our literature review, one discussion group mentioned that regional transit centers can be built in rural locations, but stated that access to broadband and resources from other areas made them difficult to maintain. However, our review cited a pilot project by Oregon DOT in which rural transit centers were built that offered high-speed data and Internet access, enabling rural transit providers to offer a variety of services. For examples of successful rural transit infrastructure projects, see Appendix P. Additionally, some stakeholders suggested that rural transit services could also", "TEXT: The United States has 19,000+ airports in the FAA system, which includes non-primary commercial service airport (PFC) funding.

Alternatives to current satellites, which are over 50 years old and have been found to have problems with reliability due to aging systems, are being considered. 9. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The Space and Missile Defense (SMD) Program is one of the largest and most complex (and most often underestimated) programs within DOD. The space portion of this program begins with payload development and satellite integration, followed by ground processing of the payload, space launch, and in-orbit stationing (launch and orbit sustain ). In addition, all of the SMD mission elements, that consist of the MDS (Mobile Device System), a new space control system known as DCCS (DMD Controls System), and ground systems in at least 21 locations for all three systems, are also included in this program. 9 (b)(2) and 9(b)(4). DOD has been challenged by the SMD Program (which includes MDS, DMS, and DCCS) to develop systems that are cost effective, sustainable and that can meet current requirements, while also responding to the challenges that the nation is facing, including the effects associated with 9/11. By its nature, the SMD Program represents the evolution of an existing system or program into 9 or more locations worldwide. While this program is often compared to an aircraft carrier to include the number of locations where all program elements are co-located, the program also includes an Air Force component. The Air Force component, known as DOD\u2019s Integrated Space Capability (DOSI) Program, which is 90 years old, 200 percent smaller than 10 years ago, has transitioned from a program that had a primary goal and supporting mission that was focused on the capability for which payload and space control functions could be consolidated under a centralized facility 12 miles from the Air Force Global Network Information Systems Center (Global Center). In the 21st Century, DOD has expanded its role to include systems management\u2014a responsibility that has been 9 (b)(1) and 9(b)(4), a lack of integration among the various payload types, and the resulting problems that these difficulties have for the Air Force. While all SMD systems are under one overall command structure, it is difficult for DOD to ensure that they are fully integrated, particularly when these systems are located in a number of geographically separated locations worldwide. In the space realm, DOD has historically been challenged by the demands associated with the number of sites and locations that need to sustain and support the systems across a multitude of user segments. In response to these challenges, Air Force Space Command Command has been developing an integrated command and control system called Global Space and Communications Operations Command (GSCO) to replace the Air Force Space Command Integrated Command Control Support Center. However, GSCO as currently configured, is very limited in its ability to coordinate across the various roles, functions, and geographic locations, which DOD has traditionally been tasked to do on behalf of its systems. In addition, the cost associated with these operations has often been difficult to manage, as they are funded out of the FYDP (FYDP) system. 9 (b) (2) and 9 (b)(4)/13 8 201 13 2013 2017 2019 (b) (b)(1)(b)(1) or 9 (b) 8 201 13 2013 2017 2023 2029 2042 (b) 8 201 13 2013 2016 2021 (b) 8 12 2032 9 (b) 8 201 13 2013 2023 2045 (b) The Space and Missile Defense (SMD) Program has over a million locations worldwide where the payload is deployed for 9 years or even longer with no cost to the Air Force. 9 (b) 14 (6) 8 U.S. Air Force Communications (U.S. Air Force Space Systems) 8 13 9 13 U.S. Army Air Combat Command Information Technology (United States Army Air Force Command, Information Technology Office) (U.S. Army Space and Information Technology Center Research and Development) (U.S. Air Force Space and Information Technology Division) 13 Air Force Space Command (Integrated Space Operations Center) (U.S. Army Space Research & Development Command) (U.S. Army Space Research and Development Command) (U.S. Air Force Space Division) (U.S. Air Force Space Division) (U.S. Army Intelligence, Operations Research, Information Security) (U.S. Army Intelligence Computer Information Systems", "", "Our report on federal home loan banks Board diversity trends showed that men currently account for the majority of the board members in FHLBank. However, since 2010 the proportion of male board members has decreased significantly due to an increase of women board members. Additionally, the proportion of minority board members has also been steadily increasing. The data indicates that the boards of most FHLBanks currently have a mix of women and minorities. Diversity in leadership helps boost overall performance according to multiple studies. Currently, there are many potential female and minority board candidates in financial institutions yet they are still underrepresented and not promoted as frequently as men and white candidates. The overall composition of boards can be seen as another key factor to understand greater representation among minority groups. Research has shown that boards with a diversity of perspectives have a more robust and varied range of ideas, which may result in better decisions. A recent report for the Federal Home Loan Banks System found that the number of women on boards of financial institutions was growing but also acknowledged there were still barriers in terms of recruiting more women as board members. Directors also noted that not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts was contributing to a lack of women and minorities represented on boards. In conclusion, increasing the number of women on FHLBank boards is essential to creating a dynamic and diverse board that can lead to greater performance. The Federal Housing Finance Board\u2019s 2016 FHLBank Corporate Board Diversity report showed that since 2010, the proportion of minority directors on corporate boards has steadily increased. There has also been an increase in recent years of women joining corporate boards as boards transition from single member to corporate governance for their entities. Directors also noted that not prioritizing diversity in recruiting efforts contributed to a lack of women and minorities on corporate boards. This suggests that FHLBank and the other FHLBs should prioritize the recruitment of diverse candidates during recruitment efforts while also considering their current pipeline. Research and stakeholder comments suggested that FHLBank has made strides in promoting diversity on its board, but there is still a need for continued efforts to increase diversity, recruiting and development of diverse candidates. The diversity of the FHLBank board is changing and is likely to become more diverse in the future. Directors currently say that FHLBanks' recruitment efforts for diversity is limited to the current pipeline. While FHLBanks have been successful in recruiting new officers to both FHLBank and the FHLB, recruitment efforts are often limited and targeted to external candidates. This approach may hinder efforts to recruit new diverse talent for each of the institutions. Many stakeholders noted that a more dynamic and diverse board can help the financial institutions perform better. Stakeholders reported a strong link through which more diverse boards and corporations can be developed. The data suggests that the diversity of the FHLBank board is becoming more fluid and is likely to become even more diverse in the future. Directors also noted that not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts contributed to a lack of women and minorities in FHLBank leadership. Directors said that since 2010 the proportion of male director candidates has decreased, the proportion of women has increased in most of the institutions. The stakeholders also pointed out the increased diversity in leadership may boost overall organization performance, yet there is much more to be done to increase this diversity. Recruiting strategies to recruit women should be prioritized and increased to address the diversity gap. Diversity is likely to be a more important factor in selecting new leaders with the competencies to take on the challenges. Additionally, the FHLBks should expand their external recruitment efforts beyond the current pipeline of candidates to broaden access to diverse candidates. Increasing the diversification through recruitment efforts to create a diverse board will contribute to greater performance. It\u2019s a small step to creating an organization that is reflective of the diverse communities the FHLBks serve. The diversity of FHLBank leaders is also linked to an increased performance and greater success. Directors also noted that not prioritizing diversity in recruitment could lead to lower performance. Stakeholders told us in the past two years, FHLBans has been proactive in recruitment campaigns to include women with their current recruitment lists for positions. Women's efforts to become officers is also an increasing trend in most of the FHLBanks. Directors and stakeholders also reported that since 2010 a greater proportion of women was recruited into FHLBank executive roles, but that more women were desired to fill leadership roles. Directors noted that not prioritizing diversity in recruitment will hinder the success of FHLBank. Directors also agreed that diversity is likely to be a more important factor in selecting new leaders with the competencies to tackle the challenges. In addition, FHLBanks should consider external recruitment efforts to increase access to diverse candidates. Directors who are responsible for recruitment expressed that recruitment is becoming more difficult and that greater diversity is required to attract a wider pool of talented candidates. Directors noted that since 2010 the proportion of male director candidates has declined while the proportion of women has increased in FHLBanks. Directors also stated additional methods they\u2019re implementing to broaden their candidate pool is to be more proactive in recruiting", "Foreign nationals who meet the INA\u2019s criteria may apply for a period of 90 days.

DHS must perform its own independent TPS determination based on the designee's information prior to submission to USCIS. DHS also performs its own INA determination regarding the eligibility and requirements for TPS benefits, including the Report process. DHS must be specifically notified if a TPS request is submitted for the foreign nationals. DHS has the power and duty to \u201creject and remove an individual from the INA if an individual \u201cis ineligible for benefits.\u201d DHS must also report to Congress each year the number of TPS designees in the TPS by country. DHS also reported the number of INA redesignations for foreign nationals in the INA by country. DHS received an average of 5,500 TPS requests in calendar year 2018. The number of TPS requests received by our Office from DHS in fiscal year 2018 was 7,000 and in 2019 was 17,000. DHS has reported annual INA by-country figures with the Report for \u2022 DHS officials also told us that each year DHS designees are required to report to DHS TPS determination within a set period after DHS receives their information in order to obtain a TPS application processing. DHS also must forward an annual Report of INA redesignations to USCIS and be notified of an INA redesignation which will result in the rejection of their TPS requests for a period of 90 days. This rejection will result in the TPS application being denied. DHS explained that DHS determines whether a country qualifies for the TPS and uses multiple steps to determine which country will receive the designee and the application processing. DHS TPS redesignations \u2022 DHS must report to Congress each year the number of INA redesignations for each foreign nation; for a period of up to 5 years. DHS TPS redesignations apply to any particular foreign nation that DHS determines to provide the greatest risk of a TPS redesignation due to a higher incidence of foreign nationals or other conditions that may require such a motion for redesignation on an individual basis.

In addition to these new guidance requiring banks to develop and maintain in their AML programs policies and procedures, FinCEN requires BSA/AML programs in place for more than one year for financial institutions to maintain a policy for identification and monitoring of clients. This policy must contain an effective way to determine beneficial ownership of accounts. FinCEN has amended this rule for 2019 to provide more time for institutions to become compliant by providing a one-year safe harbor from December 31, 2015 until May 11, 2018. During a compliance examination, the SRO will likely ask questions such as: did the institution identify and verify the legal entity of the customer? is the customer a U.S. person? did the entity conduct customer due diligence? did the financial institution have adequate systems in place to ensure compliance? did the financial institution have any delinquent accounts? did the financial institution ensure their customer\u2019s BSA compliance? did the customer pass any anti-money laundering test? did the customer pass any drug test? FinCEN is continuing its initiative to review and update the rules periodically. FinCEN now utilizes its FinCEN Examinations Database (FinCEN-ED), which allows it to conduct more than a million new exams per year to assist in ensuring compliance with BSA regulations and FinCEN\u2019s Examination Manual of the BSA/AML rule. Financial institutions were to \u201cuse their best efforts to identify\u201d all transactions related to a beneficial owner and establish policies and procedures to verify the identity of a beneficial owner. This identification process is used by the SROs during their examination. We asked all supervisory agencies and SROs asked if they have tested their AML system more than 8% in each year during the past five years. In general, all financial institutions must maintain effective, timely systems for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, keeping records of transactions, customer identification, and other BSA/AML requirements. We asked each supervisory agency and SDO if they have received more than one million new Financial Institution Information Registry (FIRMS) Reports and the associated database (FIRMS) and whether they have used a BSA/AML system within each year during the past five years since the implementation of the BSA. All financial institutions must, as part of a comprehensive BSA/AML program, maintain its own systems and procedures to develop and maintain individual account files, and maintain procedures in connection with the development and maintenance of individual account files. All of this information must be reported to FinCEN by each financial institution annually with a summary. FinCEN may investigate a member's BSA/AML compliance through interviews with the member, including the member's chief executive officer. FinCEN may ask financial institutions and its partner organizations (such as banks and broker-dealers) to review a BSA compliance program on an annual review basis, in order to ensure that it is comprehensive and up-to-date. Each financial institution must keep its AML program and staff of trained professional and independent contractors in place for a minimum period of two years. We also asked each supervisory agency and SRO about the number of BSA/AML inspections they conduct annually, and how they report them to FinCEN. 18 The Financial Institutions Management System (FIMS) (2) In the United States alone, approximately 500,000 new businesses come into existence, primarily the result of entrepreneurs deciding to (or have to) embark on a path to self- selfemployment. In 2017, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report indicated (2) the small business market is estimated at nearly 99.6 percent of privately-owned businesses. For the past decade, small businesses, including the ones that fail, have been seen as key beneficiaries of funding, which accounts for about two thirds of loans and equity investment. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 1.9 million active businesses in the U.S. They report (1) an estimated 2.25 million new businesses come into existence in the U.S. annually.

Specifically, we were concerned that VA\u2019s manual practice of updating a spreadsheet to identify PPE usage remained a practice, and even more so, that there were no plans in place to update the stockpiling procedure. These failures contributed to long-term problems related to stockouts and other issues that the medical centers encountered, which persisted even through the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. These weaknesses can lead to unintended consequences for the VHA and the veterans it serves, such as potentially unavailable PPE due to delays in replenishment. In light of these issues, we recommend that VA develop, document, and communicate a comprehensive strategy for its inventory management and monitor supply levels. In addition, VA should ensure the MSPV-A program is updated to reflect new medical practices and is actively working with the current contractors to establish more efficient processes and methods. Further, we recommend that VA explore other data collection methods and better methods to evaluate the impacts on their ability to obtain critical PPE. Lastly, we also recommend that VA and the current contractors better identify the existing roles and responsibilities of each other in managing medical center supply processes.

There is limited information available from DOD indicating how OUSD-IG staff have been spending the allocated resources as defined under OMB Circular A-11. Consequently, our OSD reporting requirement remains unmet as the OUSD-IG had not been tracking and reporting. DOD will provide more information to OSD-IG. TEXT: In January 2019, during an OSD reporting requirement that was triggered by a DOD OIG investigation, we learned that the current OSD mission is limited to the reporting chain of command; DOD will determine what information should be collected as part of the intelligence work product management process; this may result in changes in their process. TEXT: In February 2019, a comprehensive OSD review identified the OSD reporting requirement as well as other internal control issues. There is minimal information available indicating how OSSM-CPD has been addressing these issues. DOD needs to provide more information to address these OSSM-CPD reporting deficiencies identified. TEXT: In May 2019, OSD reported to the SECO in an effort to ensure the SECO that the requirements and roles in reporting are correctly tailored to each element. When OSSM-CPD asked DOD if it had documented whether the SECCO elements are being assigned to employees appropriately, DOD responded it did not have any document available that would address this question. According to OSSM-CPD, this lack of information is consistent with the OSD reporting requirements stated in OMB Circular A-11. TEXT: In June 2019, DOD submitted its organizational strategy which did not address that the OSD reporting requirement was one that needed to be addressed. In September 2019, we informed OCMO and its Deputy Director for Programs that the lack of information in these reports would also result in DOD being unable to fulfill the reporting requirements. TEXT: In June 2019, a key OSD training required all of DOD\u2019s staffs to complete during fiscal year 2020. This training is based on a DoD/OSSI requirement for information security training that all military grade employees in addition to civilian staff members need to complete every two years. At our July 2019 interview with Dr. Elizabeth Doud, OSD\u2019s Deputy Chief Learning Office, we received a written copy of an OSCP/B training curriculum. In particular, we learned: OSCP training curriculum does not yet comply with existing C&IS OSCP requirements. DOD is developing a course of the curriculum, it will be completed in fiscal year 2025. In all scenarios involving a person that may be considered a DoD cyber security threat or potentially a person seeking to access the Government\u2019s networks, there will be an additional layer of security in place. This is not the current behavior as OSSM-CPD reports that no one has been denied access to the information for any reason. TEXT: Dr. Doud was unsure of when OSSM-CPD would be able to develop an updated curriculum, with OSCP/B training curricula provided to DOD components for their use to ensure compliance with C&IS-OPSTI-O&C requirements. When the [redacted] OSD OPM training was completed, a comprehensive OSD review identified the need for an updated curriculum. According to Dr. Doud, the development of a course, to be completed in fiscal year 2025, would be done as soon as they can develop curriculum. The OPM also reported that they completed a comprehensive OPM survey that included all departments and components of DoD, including OSTS in fiscal year 2019. The survey was not designed specifically for this mission, but has the potential for its future use. These surveys are used by OSD OPM divisions to assess all elements of training and other related aspects, which could serve to help complete a course development in fiscal year 2025. C&IS-O&C-O&C-O&C-CMFO-C&IS and OSI (OSI) training curricula were revised to address each of the training topics. These revisions were successfully completed in fiscal year 2017-2018.

Evidence reveals that \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d schools (by publicly listing schools that rank low on performance indexes) are a deterrent, with a handful of low-performing schools\u2019 student achievement improving; this should translate to the \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d of principals. The 6 dimensions of school achievement in each state should align with school leader\u2019s professional responsibility, and if the school is rated below the standards in at least 3 dimensions due to multiple low-performing dimensions, schools should be given specific guidance. Schools should focus on \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d teachers and student achievement should be a school leader\u2019s \u201cnominative claim.\u201d School leaders should take responsibility for student achievement outcomes, and school-level decisionmakers should \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d teachers and students for their performances. This 6D evaluation system, which can be used alongside teacher evaluation and student success systems, is likely to outperform traditional school ratings. The School Accountability and Assessment Project at Columbia University is an example of comprehensive research on school accountability systems and has conducted extensive studies on school ratings using the 6 dimensions of student achievement. The Project has an online database ( ) that allows users to search for school leaders and/or teachers, schools, and districts by several types of measures. The database also contains data from more than 200 countries. There is an index in the database that summarizes its variables, and visitors to the web site can also see how many schools in the database are in a state with a rating below 50 percent of schools. The School Accountability and Assessment Project estimates that the 5 states and District of Columbia in the database cover 90 percent of all schools. In 2018, the project reported that in one of 17 states, school leaders could make a salary between $70,000 to $100,000 a year, depending on the quality and quantity of schools in their purview. The Project\u2019s data includes student achievement data across 25 dimensions of school achievement. School data include the grade level at which each school operates; the number of students in each school; whether the school offers grades beyond the secondary level (such as postsecondary); whether each school offers instruction in foreign language by a specialist and not by self-taught; whether more than 50% of teachers are female; and many other variables. The Project currently is accepting requests for the databases for multiple specific measures from different types of schools. This may include, in addition to school districts, public colleges and universities, and school boards, the National Center for Education Statistics. A report on the National School Psychologist Association\u2019s role in this study is available from.org/research. As \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d tools become the norm for identifying student achievement, school leaders should make sure that the schools in their purview are using a reliable evaluation system to evaluate each school in multiple dimensions (for the full school and individual students). Additionally, school leaders should have a variety of evaluation methods to ensure proper identification of schools that fall below the average achievement (by school) and not just those that rank below grade level. The School Accountability System Implementation Resource Guide can be found at /Guidelines%20and%20Assessments. The guide is available at no cost. The Project\u2019s website also provides free data to non-members upon request. While the project is no longer actively recruiting participants, the Columbia University team\u2019s School Evaluation and Accountability project reports on the performance of schools across 20+ dimensions of school achievement and can be found at the following website:. The Project currently is not taking requests for the data as it is preparing for a new project. As part of the 2008 reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Education conducted the National Education Data System (which required additional data in this space) and a follow-up study. In this report from Education\u2019s office of research, we learned that the National Evaluation Initiative and the Education Research and Statistics Act have had some effect on school leaders\u2019 evaluations of their schools. To be more specific, some evidence suggests that principals should have some influence in determining the evaluation of their individual schools, although there is variation across state guidelines. Education also found that there was no relationship between the use of professional preparation and leadership development of school principals and student outcomes. School accountability systems, which have been around for decades, are a complex topic with a lot of questions. The number of dimensions and dimensions themselves can change on a school-by-school basis, and what seems to have \u201cworked\u201d as a school accountability measure changes over time, and with changes in state requirements. Additionally, the number of schools being rated in a state can be overwhelming and may create confusion for the schools\u2019 leaders. One of the challenges Education has in this space is that there will likely be some", "A DOL report states that approximately 30 percent of black lung claims were either granted benefits from a trust fund or the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP), funded by operators responsible for the miner\u2019s black lung benefits.

Figure 1: A graph from a report on the black lung benefits program by the Department of Labor, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs shows payments made in fiscal year 2019 (see fig. 2 to see how much of each year was paid, how much of it was paid in the individual years); figure 2: In a slide presentation for the House Labor Committee from the Department of Labor, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs reported that since their merger in 1982, claims per coal miner have dropped by at least 84 percent; figure 3: Between 2014 and 2016, when 42,000 coal mine operators in the U.S. declared bankruptcy only 16 percent of those businesses were insured, 11 percent were self-insured:", "A construction contract revision process requires the contracting officer to evaluate whether the work is proceeding at the contractor\u2019s cost due to the increased scope or scope of the construction project. The construction contract revision process requires an evaluation of whether there is a change in scope, the cost to the department, or whether the cost to the department is increasing. A construction project is a major acquisition, where all the construction elements associated with the major construction are included within a single construction project. The USACE and GSA officials have both suggested that the process of a construction project might be improved or streamlined. Our test examination of a case-by-case basis revealed that the construction project process may be improved. Our goal was to identify an approach that would help contractors and their officials work with an agency to develop an appropriate way of handling the construction project. However, several of our findings indicated weaknesses in construction practices. A construction contractor should perform a feasibility investigation or initial assessment of work associated with the construction project (see figure 1, p. 10) before the construction project starts and the initial cost and schedule is built. The initial construction costs are the responsibility of the contractor and their cost information is the project's initial construction cost. However, the cost for construction is not included in the initial construction cost and the cost has been identified by USACE in our recent studies as a \u201chazardous event.\u201d It is up to the project commander and engineer to determine when a cost increase is necessary and when the change is appropriate. The type of change in a construction project depends on the initial cost. In addition, if there is a deviation in the final cost due to a change, the responsibility is the contractor\u2019s to perform the new cost based on their bid before performing a change. In a recent report to Congress, USACE indicated that the average construction cost increases are of 12 percent and the USACE\u2019s survey showed that at the lowest the construction cost increases were 5 percent of the average construction cost. Several USACE field investigations have been performed to determine the actual construction cost of a project. Several studies determined construction costs to be in excess of 90 percent of average project cost in addition to the 13 percent increase costs. These field investigations included cost analyses of construction, survey costs, and additional costs. USACE survey results of construction cost increases have been conducted in the range of 19 percent of the cost and 8 percent of the project cost. According to USACE, the main issues are cost of construction with a $15 billion annual increase in construction costs. These issues are exacerbated by the 8 percent of construction cost increase that is associated with the increase in construction costs. USACE also indicated several other factors that may be the root cause of the decrease in the construction cost. One is that the type and amount of construction methods used were inappropriate. The average construction cost for a USACE project in Alaska is $27.5 million, or more than 50 percent of the average construction cost of all USACE field investigations. USACE studies have also indicated that overconsumption of construction costs occurs. The USACE survey of the cost to construct a site shows that the difference in costs associated with a site's construction costs in excess of 10% of original construction costs had a range from 20 to 70 percent. A key challenge is the change in construction cost, which occurs after the construction is complete and the work of the contractor is over. According to USACE, the construction costs in excess of $400 thousand had been reported in at least 200 sites nationwide from the year 1990 to 2015. USACE survey results revealed that the average construction cost at the time of construction is $14.1 million, however, the cost of construction is actually higher than the estimate due to certain design elements and the time it takes for the project development and permitting. The design elements that significantly increase the cost of a project had been reported by USACE as cost for additional studies, $75 million out of $400 million. In addition, USACE found that the project costs can be inflated due to high interest fees on USACE engineering and environmental reviews. The 7 percent of increased costs that USACE reported may not be the cost of materials but rather costs that are associated with USACE design, construction, and construction costs. USACE is also reviewing and updating its Project Design Manual and Construction Cost Control. USACE also reported that USACE project design needs to better reflect engineering and construction costs. One reason may be that the USACE does not consider the type of materials used in construction as a factor in cost. USACE field investigations indicated that USACE does not consider specific construction materials which can affect the construction cost. Construction waste disposal is an additional cost in the construction process. USACE field investigations indicated that the disposal cost in their work areas can exceed $100 thousand. Finally, USACE indicated that a process for change in scope may be necessary for certain types of change. One reason, as we noted in a", "The federal real-property program includes thousands of leased facilities across the country costing the budget tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain. In recent years, GSA has implemented broker performance systems, requiring broker fees, and the value of these costs is not clear. As a result, we recommend that GSA establish program goals related to economic benefits from the broker program, link program goals to anticipated cost savings, and develop and implement processes to assess program costs and benefits.", "The Coast Guard, as a military service, has been responsible for carrying out Arctic operations and maintenance of facilities for the United States and its allies since 1970, when Congress established the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has long been required to perform Arctic-related missions. Recent developments include the deployment of one of its icebreakers within the Arctic Ocean. The Coast Guard\u2019s activities in the Arctic have been more limited compared to those at lower latitudes in the United States, which may have caused additional issues with communications. However, the Coast Guard identified that Arctic communications could be improved. Other factors that may have affected the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic operations include the limited availability of equipment and resources, and the difficulties of building and maintaining ice facilities. The Coast Guard highlighted its long-term efforts to equip its ships and units in the Arctic, but again stated these efforts have been more limited compared to missions performed in temperate ports. Coast Guard officials stated that they are also working on developing a metrics framework for address the capability gaps, and that these efforts were long-term developments. Coast Guard officials did not identify when this would occur, stating that it would be completed over the longer period of time. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY The Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic and North Coast operations were initially designed as a part of Canada\u2019s Arctic sovereignty program. The Coast Guard was established in 1914 in response to public demand for maritime services. In the 1970s, a U.S.-Canada maritime boundary dispute developed, leading to tensions and restrictions on Coast Guard Arctic activities and subsequent actions against the Coast Guard. In 2015, Canada\u2019s National Shipbuilding Program (CNSLP) awarded CMMS-MM-1910/MM-172/171 to the Coast Guard that included the new ships (eggs) or existing ships, the replacement of ships\u2019 gear and other equipment, and a provision of funds for upkeep and maintenance of the ships. In 2019, the Coast Guard received a budget increase to allow the Coast Guard to purchase an icebreaking facility in Greenland, in addition to its ships. In July 2019, DHS issued a national strategy of Arctic security, which included an Arctic strategy that directed DHS to develop a national strategy plan in order to provide further structure, guidance, and focus to the National Ice Safety Plan (ANISP) and to provide better opportunities for the Coast Guard to serve both in the Arctic and at other locations throughout the United States. Since the establishment of the Coast Guard in 1914, it has played an important role in maintaining the U.S. Arctic shipping and navigation, while also providing extensive icebreaking services. In the meantime, the Coast Guard now performs a multitude of important duties, including providing military search and rescue services. These duties in support of military missions are not well-known within the American populace, or to the degree that might have been recognized. In July 2015, the Government Accountability Office investigated the Coast Guard\u2019s response to maritime collisions and asked Coast Guard officials to provide information on the Coast Guard\u2019s \u201clong-term maritime deployment.\u201d Coast Guard officials responded and included a list of Coast Guard ships, icebreakers, and airplanes they are supporting in the Arctic, stating that there are four Coast Guard ships deployed to the Arctic. Coast Guard officials stated that the Coast Guard has a \u201cunique and important mission in the Arctic region\u201d that is extremely important to the United States and its allies. However, Coast Guard officials stated that they have made efforts to improve their Arctic performance and have recently been addressing this in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Coast Guard officials stated that while Coast Guard ships were required during the pandemic to protect U.S. ships from incoming ships, Coast Guard efforts were \u201crelatively limited.\u201d The Coast Guard stated that it conducts at least one Arctic mission per year, which included routine shipboard inspections, ship and icebreaker maintenance, icebreaking operations, training, and navigation safety checks. Coast Guard officials stated that these are routine operations in which Coast Guard ships are assigned a role that was designed to fill the Arctic space. The Coast Guard is currently involved in a number of \"ship, boat, aircraft, and station maintenance\u201d operations in Greenland, Iceland, Belgium, and Germany. Coast Guard officials stated that these missions have helped the Coast Guard better understand the Arctic region and its requirements better for Coast Guard missions that may occur in the future. Coast Guard officials also stated that in June 2020, the Coast Guard awarded the Coast Guard Ship and Icebreaker Training Station\u2014Baltic. Coast Guard officials reported that, as part of the program, a new $20.8 million, 100-day, operational program was awarded to CMMS-MMSS171/171. Coast Guard officials stated that this was related to the Coast Guard\u2019s continued support for Coast Guard shipyard work for ships (icebreaking ships), shipboard equipment (screws, tools), and communications equipment (C4 radio", "DLA\u2019s main responsibility is to buy and distribute consumable, expendable, and reparable items. Reverse engineering involves extracting information from an item to produce a technical data package needed for parts future use in procurement. Reverse engineering program options include two internal programs, Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow program, and contractors\u2019 efforts. DLA strives for optimal supply chain flexibility, including reverse engineering. INTRODUCTION. REPENCHARGE PROGRAM. The Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow Program (RAPPO). As noted in other DOD reports, by 2013 the size and complexity of DLA\u2019s inventory had grown significantly. Some 15,000 DLA-managed parts numbers (MPNs) had to meet the demand requirements of several hundred different programs (including DOD, other federal agencies, and armed forces), and each year, thousands of new parts are needed. The cost of reverse engineering new products for DLA\u2019s inventory amounted to about $5.2 billion, accounting for about 30 percent of DLA\u2019s overall reverse engineering costs. In 2014, DLA was responsible for about 1,760 projects at all levels of engineering and design, ranging from as small as a single wire part to a structural assembly or electronics assembly more complex than a personal computer. In addition, DLA manages over 7 million different items. For each unique part and item\u2014the same number the Department of Defense (DOD) used in its 2012 strategic plan description\u2014DOD must create a \"data layer\" that includes information on manufacturing, performance, quality, cost, and use requirements. In early 2012, DLA released a new data layer that included information on 4,700 parts and the data layer was updated to reflect a decrease in inventory since then. Information from the data layer is used to support decisions made by DLA, DOD, and Congress to ensure that the inventory is managed effectively. DLA data is used in commercial data services to enhance user experience, in addition to providing DOD data to other commercial services. The data layer was last updated on November 30, 2019. This list of information sources is intended to be a useful tool for the Department of Defense. Users can use these sources to get additional information on the data layer. For more information, refer to the Data Layer website at DoD Data.\nThe data layer in which manufacturers create data layers are now being built with commercial data services as well, to enhance DOD user-experience. The updated list of information sources is DOD MELs-OMS/WBS-OMS-R2-V3.0.\nBRIEFING OF REPENCHARGE PROGRAM COST: The RAPPO-2017 program for fiscal year 2011-2017 is an ORS funded effort that provides an annual fixed cost of $6.7 million to DOD to reduce the cost of its reverse engineering process.\nRAPPO PROGRESS: Reaching milestones. In the fiscal year. The most recent update from 2016-2018 program is 16,700 engineering and product manufacturing project, DOD MELs-OMS/WBS-OMS-R2-V3.0.\nCUSTOMER NEED OF INPUT: The RAPPO-2017 program cost of over $35 billion represents a significant burden to DOD and taxpayer dollars.\nVALUE: The RAPPO-2017 program cost of over $35 billion represents a significant burden to DOD and taxpayer dollars, and is not only a waste of taxpayer dollars but appears to have little to very little value. Since the fiscal year 2018 report, RAPPO-2017 has completed over 50,000 projects. The program has been found to be very costly and has achieved negligible customer feedback in terms of cost-effectiveness of each dollar that was invested. According to a 2018 report, only about 1,020 of the more than 32,000 parts that were used in DOD\u2019s inventories could provide any feedback on their performance, which could be indicative of their overall use in the fleet. This feedback is based on a study of DOD\u2019s engineering and product manufacturing program cost of the RAPPO-2017 program. RAPPO-2017 also has a long history of a backlog of work to complete during a given year.\nMAJOR PROJECT COMPLETION: RAPPO-2017 has not achieved any significant customer feedback in DOD inventories, and more than 90 percent of the annual RAPPO-2017 cost is funded with commercial data services. According to a report released in 2018, most of the 16,700 engineering and product manufacturing projects DOD has awarded every year by 2016-2018 were funded by commercial data services instead of DOD and civilian. Since the fiscal year 2018", "Section 2f-1a, a provision of the NVRA, prohibits state and local election authorities from knowingly registering ineligible voters. The text includes a number of definitions and exceptions to this provision, including the possibility of a registrant leaving a jurisdiction within 90 days and being subsequently removed from voter registration lists. Section 6, of Title 24 CFR, part 15, also identifies the categories of voter registration list maintenance activities, including the non-discrimination of the names and information required on voter registration forms. The act mandates that each U.S. Attorney, state, or local election authority (and, by implication, all jurisdictions and entities that administer voter registration lists) will use their staff resources and funding provided by Congress/federal government to implement the NVRA and HAVA. A matter is defined by the Office of Legal Counsel as \u2018a specific instance of one or more of the criminal, civil, administrative, or other offenses within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, and includes matters and activities that result in the prosecution of an offense as a result of a judicial or administrative proceeding in connection with, or as a direct result of, an offense,\u2019 (see also, 8 Uselton, supra, p. 25), which we understand to be the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s view as to whether a matter would include investigation, charging, or prosecution, rather than prosecuting, and whether or not to prosecute, or a criminal or civil matter, as defined. The process for initiating proceedings varies across DOJ components. Within the Criminal Division, staff typically work on matters for about 30 minutes. This could be in conjunction with other DOJ components and services. However, the Office of Legal Counsel provides guidance on procedures that must be followed concerning pending charges and indictments, and DOJ is working to develop guidelines on the circumstances in which federal and state authorities may consult each other. The procedures that must be followed concerning pending indictments are more stringent than those that regard pending charges during trial, and may be more stringent if the defendants are juveniles. DOJ may also initiate an investigation, or prosecute a case, when a subject is indicted. As we previously noted, the Criminal Division is responsible for initiating matters to prosecute and, if necessary, to obtain the dismissal of civil proceedings. In the Criminal Division\u2019s Violent Gang Drug Enforcement Task Force (VGDEE), there are six separate task forces across the country that address specific aspects of drug use and drug use related crimes in a specific geographic area. Although a matter is defined as a specific instance of one or more of the criminal, civil, administrative, or other offenses within the Department of Justice, there has been a trend within the Justice Department of categorizing different types of matters or criminal or civil proceedings differently in terms of the authority and responsibilities given to the Criminal Division in conducting proceedings. For example, in matters involving the violation of the criminal laws, jurisdiction is with the Criminal Division of the DOJ; whereas in civil matters, the Division is acting in a different role to enforce a federal statute. 4 The Help America Vote Act: Table 2 of U.S.C. App.l, App.l-2i provides a list of prohibited methods for voter registration list maintenance. In addition to removing ineligible voters, U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices are responsible for ensuring proper voter registration, for facilitating voter assistance, and for overseeing the list maintenance requirements. Public Integrity Section Trial Attorneys are responsible for enforcing the NVRA. Public Integrity\u2019s staff have more than a generation\u2019s experience and have established relationships with many jurisdictions across the U.S. Our work on the Help America Vote Act involved assisting prosecutors throughout the U.S. in prosecuting NVRA violation cases. In many cases, prosecutors are required to prosecute the majority of these violations or \u2018HAVA violations.\u2019 Due to the complexity and broad impact of the issues, the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country do not prosecute very many of these violations. The help given by our office to prosecutors in these cases was vital in ensuring that individuals who were targeted by the HAVA violations received relief from the Court and the law. In many cases, we assisted public integrity investigators in investigating certain crimes or violations of the HAVA and NEPRA. The NVRA prohibits voter registration list maintenance activities in a number of areas, including collecting and using information about an individual\u2019s political or ideological beliefs or associations. The Help America Vote Act is consistent with the NVRA in prohibiting voter registration list maintenance activities similar to the registration activities of NEPRA (National Election Polling Act). The NVRA provides a list of prohibited methods for voter registration list maintenance, and the courts have established that these methods can be used for enforcement purposes. In a number of NVRA cases, individuals were subjected to interrogation on the use of the voter registration system and the location of their voter application. A federal court must examine these aspects of the procedures for registration forms. While the court has the right to use its", "As of November 2018, 43 states that receive Medicaid demonstrate comprehensive requirements. While each state\u2019s program is slightly different, the majority are based on the same basic CMS model of work requirements. These requirements involve a variety of administrative activities that are federally reimbursed for up to 50 percent. Most states\u2019 efforts to work toward this federal requirement include adapting eligibility and enrollment systems, training staff, and educating beneficiaries. Work requirements may involve implementing eligibility and enrollment systems and training staff, in addition to administrative requirements.

The new command headquarters will co-location in a number of administrative, functional and contracting offices and is expected to be operational in July 2019. Army Futures Command will also form teams for Army Applications Laboratory, Combat Capability Development Command, Combat Systems Division Headquarters, Combat Capabilities Development Command, and Combat Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command. At the same time, the command will work with other Army organizations including the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. The command will have a small business engagement team to assist small business (SBA) offices. This will include a new Center for Small Business Innovation. It intends to improve outreach with SBA offices and with small business companies. In addition, the command will be working with a number of outside parties including a consultancy called 1,001, which specializes in assisting with the integration of a federal and commercial entity. While the majority of the command is at Fort Eustis, Virginia, a number of offices are in temporary accommodations while moving in to their new locations.

DHS manages the U.S. Government\u2019s counterterrorism center in intelligence (CTC INT). The DHS-managed Counter Terror Infrastructure Security Act (PADDLOT) requires DHS to establish a pipeline safety program. DHS uses its regulatory authorities to ensure pipeline safety and security, including pipeline design, construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and inspection. DHS also coordinates with the pipelines\u2019 owners and maintains a 24-hour Emergency Operations Center (EOC). DHS plays an ongoing role in the DHS / Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) Strategic Plan. The DHS has established a Pipeline Modal Government/Private Sector Coordination Council (PMGPCC) and a Pipeline Modal Government Coordinating Council (PMGTC). DHS coordinates and develops policies and techniques that address pipeline hazards (for example, DHS/DOT developed an Asset Management System {PMGTC}) through regulatory developments and industry collaborations. DHS also developed the Pipeline Safety Manual-Fourth Edition (PMPv4) that contains guidance, recommendations, safety messages, and regulations concerning pipeline safety and security to guide, train, and provide guidance to pipeline operations (DHS/DOT). FEMA is the designated authority to provide a role in emergency response and recovery, providing a FEMA Information Sharing Network to facilitate a wide range of information exchange between the federal government and the state and local governments. The Emergency Operations Center coordinates with DHS for emergency response to pipeline disasters, and FEMA is a designated authority by FEMA\u2019s Hazardous Material Safety Division (FBCC) for the management of hazardous waste incidents and spills and pipeline damage. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the FBI Counterterrorism Division, serves a role in the FBI/CISA/NSA Strategic Plan\u2019s counterterrorism programs, to investigate potential terrorist attacks on U.S. pipelines, pipelines, and associated control centers. A Federal Assistance Program (FAP) was established to finance the protection of pipelines by providing grants to states, cities, and towns to help finance security for their pipelines, including pipelines and critical facilities associated with them. The FAP provides Federal financial assistance, or FAP funds ($50 million), to States, Indian tribal governments, and local governments to protect critical infrastructure (DOT/TIG 2015). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses funds from the Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Modernization Program. FEMA has established the FEMA Information Sharing Network, which allows emergency personnel to share and securely share emergency information, including the status of pipelines with state and local authorities. The Pipeline Safety Manual-Fourth Edition (PMPv4) \u2013 released in November 2013 \u2013 is the pipeline industry\u2019s first comprehensive resource for pipeline design, construction, and operation. The manual is divided into subsections which address Pipeline Hazard Identification, Hazardous Substances, Pipeline Materials, Pipeline Construction, Pipeline Operation, Pipeline Dredging, Underwater Construction, Pipeline Inspection & Safety Testing, Pipeline Protection and Response, and Pipeline Hazard Detection and Investigation, as well as supporting tables and graphs. The pipeline industry utilizes a set of tools developed by the Association of American Pipe and Pipelines () in association with FEMA and NERC through FEMA\u2019s Pipeline Modal Government Coordinating Committee (PMGC). The PMGC advises DHS Secretary on DHS operations related to pipeline safety and security - including pipelines, gas, and oil pipelines. DHS has a 24-hour National Operations Center run by FEMA that is staffed with personnel from DHS to manage incidents regarding pipelines. FEMA is responsible for supporting DHS with DHS and the associated FEMA Center to coordinate government support and response to large-scale emergencies, and to oversee FEMA\u2019s 24-hour Emergency Operations Center operations.

Evidence-building processes\u2014including strategic design, implementation, quality improvement, data collection, analysis, and dissemination\u2014can identify what questions might need responding to and the types of evidence that could be collected on those questions. New evidence from HOPE III indicates structured decision-making processes can be used in various contexts, including home visiting with children, program design, and other social services. The Federal Government\u2019s ongoing evidence-building initiative can incorporate existing research practices and techniques by using a portfolio of evidence to address policy questions and identify future recommendations for improving services and programs. In December 2006, the Council of State Governments Executive Session on Excellence in Early Childhood offered suggestions for integrating the early childhood home visiting evidence review into policy and practice. Some recommendations included establishing the early childhood home visiting evidence base as the source of evidence-based early childhood professional development curriculum resources, developing a series of home visiting evidence and policy briefs for parent-child and parent-teacher conferences, and promoting the home visiting evidence- of-study outcomes to state and local early childhood practitioners and policymakers. To date, the Council of State Governments has continued efforts to improve early childhood data collection systems, create or improve early childhood assessments, disseminate information, and conduct policy analyses at state and local levels. The Council also continues to work on the National Early Childhood Data System-Child Early Learning, a \u201cstandard data system that tracks children starting from birth, from birth to the age of five, and their outcomes. It is an overarching framework, data set, and resource base that support the collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of child- specific early learning data and cross- state applications for early childhood learning data, data, and best practices for the benefit of children, families, and communities.\u201d HHS uses data derived from the MIECHV grant to assess the program\u2019s results in various areas, including child maltreatment and home visitation. In January 2019, the Department of Labor\u2019s impact evaluation of four home visiting models (which had been used to generate positive child abuse outcomes, and more than two-thirds indicated they had) found that these four models may have 13. Child abuse is commonly associated with family structure; for example, one study suggests that parental investment in children is a predictor of child development from birth to early childhood. Child abuse and neglect have consistently been linked by various federal research and analysis, including research in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS). The majority of the evidence, however, does not come for new models in addition to the evidence-based child abuse prevention model. One program that is currently collecting data on child abuse and neglect is the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Health (NSCAHB). The program, started in 1996, is designed to provide reliable data on the occurrence of children and adolescents throughout the United States. The most recent release of NSCAHB has over 800 questions to help data 13. Child maltreatment occurs in at least 1 in 20 families. (National Survey of Child and Adolescent Health, 2001, 2005, 2013, 2019) Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) reports that one in five children are diagnosed with a mental health disorder before the age of 20. (ECLS National Survey, 2015) At the time of this report, research on the association between family structure and child abuse is ongoing, and we currently have two reports of our research on this topic, although recent research on the topic is often based on studies of more limited results: Research on parent child abuse prevention has continued as well. (United States Health and Human Services Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, 2015) The HHS MIEYC program began in 2011, with a goal to increase investments in home visitation. Although the program has funded new research and evaluation in child maltreatment, information on children who have experienced the trauma of child abuse is limited on the program (HHS, 2006). One area of ongoing research concerns the impacts of childhood abuse. (Johnson, Pina, & Yoo, 2004) Other research examines the effects of childhood abuse on the development of children into adulthood, focusing in particular on psychological outcomes (Johnson & Yoo, 2004). Other types of child maltreatment, including corporal punishment, physical abuse, and neglect, are covered in the report A Review of Child Maltreatment in Children: National trends, incidence, correlates, and potential impact. (Lawsuit Information & Evaluation, 2008) Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) data demonstrate that 1 in 4 children experienced either a father-child or mother-child relationship and were significantly more distressed than peers during a period of 5 weeks in first grade. (Wilson, Webb-", "Federal agencies\u2019 vehicles are to become less efficient because of rising fuel costs and faster introduction of new vehicles due to changing fleet management requirements. FAS/A-1.8-4-15-M-1-0F1 Federal agencies\u2019 fleets consist of many types of vehicles that support a variety of purposes. To fulfill mandates, Congress and agencies have implemented policies and procedures designed to minimize costs and greenhouse gas emissions in vehicle fleets. Agencies reported annual fleet costs and mileage to FAST, the federal government\u2019s vehicle data library. In 2008, the definition of alternative fuel vehicles was amended to include hybrid electric vehicles and, in certain circumstances, gasoline vehicles. In 2019, implementing guidance focused on vehicle emissions. The FAST database tracks data on a range of alternative fuel vehicles, as well as fuel efficiency improvements and other aspects of vehicle fleet management. Additional data specific to vehicles was also submitted to the FAST database in accordance with relevant requirements. Table 1.

In the context of Hanban\u2019s funding, schools select teachers with a centralized application process, and they generally report an absence of Chinese interference in events and activities at the institute.\nThe U.S. Council of Higher Education is an authorizing body, responsible for providing the authorizing letters that are required for students beginning a course of studies at schools and universities. Under the law, the Council can perform its functions through the creation of policies and procedures; by assessing the progress of all educational institutions subject to its authority and developing policies; by administering grants and awards to improve the higher education system that exists within the state of U.S. Additionally, the Council operates many other special funds for special educational projects. The Council's authorizing letter for the University of Nevada Reno Confucius Institute will be prepared in accordance with standard procedures.\nThe Council of Higher Education operates the U.S. Section of Educational Assessment and Evaluation, which has responsibilities in the field of performance assessment. The Council periodically reviews the program to ensure it is relevant to the educational needs of children in the United States. If it is determined that the program fulfills the purpose of providing educational assessment to states and districts, the Council will grant to the program its authorization for up to a decade. The Council, as a part of its duties, has been notified in writing by Hanban regarding events and activities related to Confucius Institutes within the United States. These events and activities are listed in the \u201cAnnual Report to Congress.\u201d U.S. educational assessment data, which is made publicly available, is included in the report. Additionally, as part of a contract that is in place with Hanban, the Department of Defense is the organization that is responsible for administering the Hanban Program for America. This program enables Hanban to sponsor international Chinese language and cultural education programs at U.S. schools and universities. U.S. educational institutions, other countries that participate in educational assistance programs, and Hanwan are subject to a series of rules and procedures implemented under the Foreign Assistance Act of Pub.L. 4847, as amended by Pub.L. 1004.

State/INL monitored key aspects of these projects to ensure that they implemented well, maintained accurate and timely budget data, followed applicable laws and standards, and met performance goals. We summarized 15 M\u00e9rida Initiative projects to assess the extent to which State/INL monitoring procedures followed key practices for assignment of monitoring staff, planning evaluation strategies of projects, and monitoring project implementation. The findings show that State/INL generally followed key practices for assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring approach, and monitoring project implementation in 14 of State/INL\u2019s high\u2013dollar value M\u00e9rida Initiative projects, with an overall score 1.7 out of 3.1. However, there is room for improvement in several areas of State/INL\u2019s M\u00e9rida Initiative monitoring. Figure 1. M\u00e9rida Initiative Projects Consistently Monitoring Data State/INL did not consistently track all M\u00e9rida Initiative project activities and data to assess implementation. Therefore, it is difficult to know that the State/INL successfully tracks projects that will lead to a successful outcome. All M\u00e9rida Initiative projects should be monitored, including on-going activities at 9 months and 24 months. Each project should be assigned monitoring duties and a budget to facilitate an assigned team\u2019s monitoring of each of the project aspects, including key aspects. Additionally, State/INL needs to establish key performance measures that can be tracked alongside a budget to ensure the selected projects are managed effectively. Furthermore, State/INL should use an annual report for each selected project to assess performance, identify possible impediments, provide guidance and advice to a team of assessors including USAID, Defense Intelligence, National Security Agency, and State/INL. State/INL generally followed key practices for assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff. Most of the project managers were aware of the types of M\u00e9rida Initiative projects they were administering. State/INL monitored key aspects of these M\u00e9rida Initiative projects, such as the implementation of key performance measures. State/INL should continue to monitor projects that will lead to a successful outcome. This includes assessing the ongoing activities of projects that are ongoing after the 9- and 24-month marks. To accommodate the needs of the M\u00e9rida Initiative projects, State/INL should use an annual report to assess performance, identify possible challenges, and formulate guidance for future M\u00e9rida Initiative projects. Key practices should be established for every M\u00e9rida Initiative project to ensure that all aspects of the project are assessed. Key practices should be established each year to ensure that the selected projects are managed effectively. Each project should be assigned a budget to facilitate an assigned team\u2019s monitoring of each of the project aspects. Key performance measures need to be assigned at each level so that these performance measures can be tracked alongside a budget. Additionally, each M\u00e9rida Initiative project needs to be documented within a plan of action that should be finalized within the first year of the project. This plan should outline the objectives, timelines, goals, and the scope of the project should be assigned within each M\u00e9rida Initiative project. This plan of action should be documented for both the M\u00e9rida Initiative project and within each individual project. We have not yet reviewed the progress of all projects, the M\u00e9rida Initiative report did document that there were no findings of significant misconduct in either the USAID programs or projects that M\u00e9rida Initiative reported to us, including no instances of fraud or misuse of any grant funds. Some 22 of the 44 M\u00e9rida Initiative project managers contacted during Phase II confirmed their own independent review and verification processes for key practices, including the assignment of the monitoring, the monitoring plan, and project plans. However, to confirm that they are adhering to the practice to ensure that the project meets the law and the regulations they follow when they are on-site. State/INL has a number of practice measures in place and may need to fine-tune some processes to ensure more of the practices are happening. Key practices \u2013 such as a monitoring plan -- must be fully embedded at each level of the program, including each individual project, in order to effectively implement and evaluate the practices across the entire program. We strongly encourage State/INL and USAID to continue the strong collaborative approach to improving monitoring. This is very important because the M\u00e9rida Initiative is providing funding directly to civil society organizations in their own countries and in their respective local languages. Their projects are being delivered in their own community, which, from \u2018on-site\u2019 to \u2018off-site\u2019, in 2019, is the local community in Latin America. USAID is very strongly committed to their efforts in Latin America. State/INL and USAID have built a great cooperative working relationship on the entire M\u00e9rida Initiative. Their success has been in using a number of key performance measures. One", "North Macedonia has been the subject of a complex political situation involving a conflict between the ethnic Albanian and Macedonian communities over the country\u2019s name. After a civil conflict broke out in 2001, the U.S. government and the EU facilitated negotiations for the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which resolved the crisis and created another round of elections. In a 2016 parliamentary election, Zaev\u2019s SDSM coalition was returned as a majority after a violent, widely-disputed event. In 2018, the Republic of North Macedonia changed its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, and signed an accession protocol with NATO. Macedonia has implemented recommended EU reforms. It has been the subject of multiple U.S. military and civilian interventions since Yugoslavia\u2019s fragmentation after 1991, which created some concerns about the country\u2019s stability. In 2009, a large-scale ethnically Albanian protest and a subsequent coup attempt occurred. The coup was followed by a series of constitutional and legal reforms aimed at greater U.S. and EU acceptance, and to build a new political partnership between Zaev\u2019s SDSM government and the opposition. A coalition government of ethnic Albanians was formed in the April 2017 elections, and Zaev was appointed in May 2017. The name dispute with Greek-led VMRO-DPMNE was resolved with the changing of the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s name. NATO membership, opening the path to EU accession negotiations, was sealed in the 2019 agreement, contingent on a clear", "Early and Periodic Screening Screening, Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT).

Currently, BOPemployees can take pepper spray, are trained in the use of it and how to respond inan emergency situation, and generally receive other safety equipment, like radio earpiece, a body alarm, pepper sprays, keys, and vest. As it pertains to the BOP pilot study, employees may use pepper sprays between BOP employees and civilian employees on a trial basis (as of September 2018). The BOP policy statement allows the use of pepper spray to be used in immediate situations where a serious, life-threatening or seriously disabilitiing situation requires its use based solely on the judgment of an employee. It is not to be used during any routine situation. Pepper spray can often reduce physical harm, but not every incident can be resolved by deploying it. The BOP pepper spray training program includes procedures on which situations can be justified for use before any pepper spray is deployed. The pepper spray can be used to \u201cblend a fleeing or a threating inmate into the group, or to prevent the spread or threat of a serious disturbance.\u201d In all incidents where pepper spray is used, a safety hazard material review board shall be conducted on-site to verify a prisoner\u2019s medical history and his/her ability to safely work within a prison environment. Upon discovery that pepper spray could not be used safely, prison staff must contact their healthcare provider and have the pepper spray decontaminated. 3. Instruction: What is one of the key problems faced by BOP during their pandemic response?\nAs an AI language model, I cannot know the current status of BOP's pandemic response efforts. However, one of the key problems that BOP faced during their pandemic response could be the difficulty in providing medical care during such unprecedented times. The high demand for medical personnel could be one of the primary reasons that BOP had to restrict access to medical care to only BOP employees for a significant stretch of time, which could have negatively impacted the BOP employees that participated in the program. The impact of this on BOP's ability to provide care during the pandemic could have contributed to the significant challenges that BOP faced during the pandemic and could have been one of the leading factors for decreasing COVID-19 cases per capita in BOP.", "Navy shipbuilding is a costly and complex endeavor that begins with an acquisition process, which identifies and develops the ship, as well as key decision points throughout the program.

A range of tools and strategies exist to assist federal administrators and agencies in designing, implementing, and evaluating policies and programs that can help enhance U.S. resilience including measures to improve infrastructure as well as to reduce the risks of severe weather, fire and other man-made environmental hazards. A number of specific methods are outlined in the text to help those with authority and power to build resilience under uncertain circumstances. These best practices will be applied at both state and local levels to address immediate threats and long-term risks and to help identify the best strategies of risk mitigation and adaptation.

It will have, over its life-cycle, 3,000+ F-35s at 21 locations worldwide, 2,500+ F-35s for U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and 2,000+ F-35s available to more than 30 international partners in 12 countries. It includes three F-35 variants: A- model for the Air Force; B model for the Navy; and C model for the Marine Corps. A global supply chain network is in operation with the F-35 spares pool consisting of four parts packages: the base spares package, the global spares package, the deployment spares package, and the afloat spares package. See figure 2 (page 21) for a timeline of F-35 fleet evolution. See figure 1 (page 9) for F-35 fleet projections in multiple years.

The F-35 program is structured to enable a continuous product development flow. In contrast, the F-35 predecessor development program (F-21) transitioned directly from design to initial operating test. This structure, which originated from lessons learned during the F-21 program, can be seen in FIGURE 8, on the next page.

In contrast to the F-21 program, the F-35 program is structured to allow continuous development, whereas the F-21 program used a linear development flow. The F- 35 and F-21 programs have been designed and built according different acquisition processes. Also, F-135 is the F-35 variant for foreign military sales to the Department of Defense (DOD), while F-15, which has F-35 like attributes, is the F-15 variant for the Air Force.

As a", "The Cannon Building completed in 1908 is undergoing $753 million worth of renovation work. The project includes new utility infrastructure and distribution systems in the basement, garage, and courtyard at an $80 million price tag, as well as the construction of 31 additional Member Suites that were inaccessible because of construction work. At-risk construction dates and cost estimate data for the construction division will be shown. Additionally, there are $31 million in design and project management costs due to unforeseen conditions, that are expected to be added to the project\u2019s budget without the benefit of additional revenue. FIGURE 1. AOC\u2019s Cannon building renovations, from the start of construction in January 2015 through December 2018. FIGURE 2. Construction timeline for the initial phases of the Cannon renovations. (Note: AOC plans to update this progress summary periodically throughout construction, but it does not extend to the conclusion of construction.) AOC\u2019s design for renovation of the Cannon building consisted of a master plan to remove some low-lying exterior structures (e.g. fire breaks between the structure and the wall that encloses the building), and rebuild, remodel, replace, upgrade or restore and refurbish interior and exterior spaces of each segment building based on its location as well as the character of its building or structure. AOC is using the Construction Manager as Construcer (CMa) delivery method to implement the Cannon project. This approach allows an individual contractor(s) or a separate firm (i) to contract on each building segment and (ii) to have a single point of contact between AOC and the construction contractor/team. The overall Cannon Project plan identifies the AOC Vision Plan, consisting of a total design of 9 stories, a total footprint of approximately 2,100 feet, which is to be situated on 1.2 acres of land, and several functional spaces including a lobby and security area. Each renovation segment also includes its unique objectives with regard to the project. Each segment has a unique budget, which provides several construction management services, and also includes design and construction costs that are beyond the project\u2019s revenue and must be supplemented with funds from AOC\u2019s Budget Operations. Due to unforeseen conditions, design changes, and scope changes that are the responsibility of the AOC/CMa relationship, the total cost of the project for each segment was increased beyond the original AOC Vision Plan estimates due to unforeseen costs. During its AOC Board Briefing in July 2019, AOC reported that unforeseen issues in the electrical, fire protection, and HVAC systems have emerged that could impact the renovation budget. AOC estimated $19 million in design and project management costs would be added to the project\u2019s renovation cost of $20.1 million. AOC intends to add additional design and project management costs to the final project cost of $753.9 million due to unforeseen conditions. AOC expects total renovation and design costs to be covered outside of its budget. The total costs are due to unforeseen conditions, design changes, and scope changes for the renovation of the Cannon Building and its four sub-segments, and AOCs Vision Plan for the renovation of 1.2 acres of land. The Cannon renovation project includes the construction of a lobby and security area and a total of 63 Member Suites, which require approximately 26,000 cubic feet of space, and construction on 9 stories and on 1.2 acres of land. Currently, AOC expects total renovation costs of more than $400 million, with design and project management costs totaling approximately $50 million. The Cannon renovation of electrical and mechanical systems is in excess of the original $24.5-million design for the renovation of two existing blocks and construction of one new block each, totaling approximately 9.5 million. This design cost is in excess of more than $24 million each, due to unforeseen costs in design and project management, due to AOC\u2019s construction company, due to unforeseen conditions, and due to the unexpected change resulting from the new design. To address the unforeseen cost of design and project management in addition to the $19 million and $40.1 million estimates in AOC\u2019s renovation budget for 2019 and 2010, the AOC Board Briefing in July 2019 was requested by AOC board members in order to ensure they would be aware of the costs and its progress. These additional costs are due to unforeseen and/or design conditions, changes in the construction, and further construction methods. AOC is adding approximately $19 million in design and project management costs associated with the Electrical and Mechanical Systems of the Cannons renovation due to unforeseen projects and costs that have been beyond AOC\u2019s vision. The total costs are due to unforeseen (unforeseen design conditions, change, and construction) expenses in the renovation design, project management cost estimate (due to unforeseen project cost), and unforeseen costs due to (", "The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that depository institutions throughout the financial system operate in a safe and sound manner and comply with federal laws and regulations for the provision of banking services.

These Center of Excellence Centers perform research, engineering and planning to provide standard design packages that support the Army\u2019s Facility Standardization Programs. This cost to the Army varies from a low of about $75,000 to a high of $150,000 depending on the size of a project. According to Centers officials, the number of sites in their inventory to support the facilities can accommodate a maximum of 100 centers. These design packages are critical to the standard design in order to comply with a number of DOD standards and Army design specifications (e.g., Facilities Criteria). The Centers have been very successful in their efforts to help the Army design appropriate facilities. The average number of hours a team spends in preparing a design package is about 400 hours at a cost of approximately $15,000 per project and the design team (which consists of two military engineers and one Department of Defense design specialist) completes the design package in approximately 140 hours. According to Centers, there is a high level of user demand for their products and they are able to complete design packages in reasonable amounts of time. In fiscal year 2021, $250 million has been allocated to the 50 USACE centers under the Army Construction Program.", "With top leadership support and commitment, DHS has made substantial progress in addressing its management challenges. However, DHS still needs to do significant work to demonstrate sustained progress in areas critical for national security. To meet its March 2019 goals for demonstrated, sustained progress by leadership commitment and a collective approach to improvement, DHS must improve its business processes and implement the systems needed to ensure that DHS systems, applications and data are current, interoperable, and reliable.

For DHS components and DHS\u2019s FY 2019 goals table, DHS has started to share information about DHS\u2019s current strategic priorities and management processes with its external auditors in advance of the DHS FY 2020 audit. This initiative is designed to ensure that DHS has accurate information to external auditors so that DHS can address any issues they may have with DHS\u2019s management of DHS\u2019s programs and finances. DHS must take action to ensure that all DHS components are implementing the management requirements that DHS is required to enforce.

NASA agreed.", "In 2017, nearly one in three Medicare Part D beneficiaries received opioid prescriptions. Beneficiaries potentially at-risk by age, female demographics, or being dually eligible for Medicaid were found to be more likely at-risk for opioid misuse and abuse. However, this risk could be mitigated with higher numbers of prescribers and pharmacies. Plan providers were required to determine which potentially at-risk beneficiaries were deemed to be actually at risk, and then share these findings with the beneficiary\u2019s treatment team. The case management process began by identifying the subset of potentially at-risk beneficiaries who actively received treatment for frequently abused drugs. Subsequently, the benefit was provided to these beneficiaries who meet clinical criteria for case management. Patients who met clinical criteria for case management were excluded from DMP consideration. However, all potentially at-risk beneficiaries were eventually evaluated. Among 7,200 beneficiaries who met case management criteria, approximately 1 percent (1,200) were enrolled in more than five prescribers or pharmacies and received opioids more than seven times. Although more than half of the at-risk beneficiaries received treatment from a single prescriber or pharmacy in 2017, some patients received medications from many prescribers or pharmacies in any year, but still met clinical DMP medication safety criteria. Beneficiaries have the opportunity to receive a minimum of two additional treatments from an at-risk medication safety case manager before being at-risk of overdose. The second step of the case management process is to perform a discussion on a patient\u2019s beneficiary-level clinical information, and review patient-level clinical information to assess the patient\u2019s appropriate treatment by adjusting his or her medications. All at-risk individuals are required to have case management done either as a single physician or a single treatment team. Patients who are deemed to be not at-risk will no longer receive individualized case management by an at-risk care provider, and a new case management resource will be created, which identifies potentially at-risk beneficiaries who use the same treatment facility. An alternative approach would be to provide case management for each potentially at-risk beneficiary, with the exception of those enrolled in Medicare Care Entitlement and Coverage (Medicare CEP). This approach identifies the subset of beneficiaries who meet clinical criteria. DATE: First recorded prescriptions under beneficiary-level opioid misuse case management for 2017, which were included in the Medicare fee-for-service claims file, the Physician and Other Claimants File, and the Medicare Administrative Data. The beneficiary level population was estimated in the Fee-for-Service Claims File and the Medicare Administrative Data. Patients who met clinical case management criteria but still received opioid medications more than 7 times were excluded from the benefits of the case management program. MEDICARE COVERAGE For each physician or practice, we identified the percentage of Medicare patients seen by them and found that some physicians and practices are more common among Medicare beneficiaries than others. While it is important to evaluate physicians for their clinical cases of misuse or abuse of opioids, a smaller number of physicians and practices may be able to offer the benefit of case management. We identified in our analysis the benefits provided to case management and medication safety patients. For each case management patient with multiple prescriptions that met clinical case management criteria, we selected physicians and practices and found that the case managed physician patient ratio (CMP, or number of patients per physician or practice) of our identified physician could range as low as 1.1 percent and as high as approximately 25 percent. We found that physicians and practices in the bottom ten percent of the case management population account for over half of case managed medication safety patients. Beneficiaries receiving case management were being served by approximately 16,000 physicians and practices. MEDICARE PAYMENT PLAN FOR DANGEROUS DRUGS DURING 2017 In our analysis, we found that beneficiary and physician costs associated with case management of potentially at-risk beneficiaries with high dosages of the opioid medication, methadone, were comparable to beneficiary costs in the case management of a much larger fraction of the cases. The costs of care for beneficiaries who received higher doses of the opioid medication methadone were comparable to beneficiaries where dosages in the case management were adjusted. The costs and dosage of methadone was not a factor in medication cost savings across beneficiaries, so we found that the benefits of the case management for methadone alone could be offered throughout the entire system. MEDICARE CASE MANAGEMENT A pilot program for case management by physicians and practice in a variety of medical fields has been underway. The CMS Innovation Center is coordinating participation in the pilot. While we found that beneficiaries and most physicians are able to afford the costs (including the majority of case management payments as opposed to being paid $8,000-$12,000 per beneficiary per year in 2017), we also found that the majority of physicians could only be reimbursed for about 10 percent of medication costs. We found that our pilot has a high cost; if medication costs remained at current levels, a", "The Department of Defense Air Force announced in November 2019 that JADC2 is its goal for command and control with a new family of systems.

Both programs have significant application requirements, payments, and payment options to meet, including making all 120 qualifying payments in 120 months and repayment through one of three income-driven repayment plans. Despite borrower interest in PSLF and PSLF program, the temporary expanded process had a 99 percent denial rate. There were 36,900 total PSLF program applications from March 2017 through March 2019. Close to one-half of PSLF program applications the PSLF servicer had processed had been denied because of missing information or non PSLF program applications. In March 2019, there were 72,058 loan forgiveness applications that had been processed, a 97 percent increase from October 2018. The most common reason for denial for the permanent PSLF program is missing information. The majority of requests submitted by borrowers for the temporary expanded process were ineligible for the PSLF program and denied because the borrower had not previously submitted an application for the PSLF program to Education. EDUCATION administers several federal student aid programs, including the Temporary Expanded PSLF Program and the PSLF program. Requirements differ between the two processes; the PSLF program requires qualifying federal student loan payments for 120 months (in lieu of 120 months in service), while the temporary expanded process requires 120 payments over 10 years (or more than half its lifetime) and may qualify for forgiveness under certain new income-driven repayment plans. The key difference between PSLF and the temporary expanded process is the requirement to have all borrowers apply for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program, while in the case of the temporary expanded process, only certain additional income-dependent repayment plans (IIRP) allow for discharge. 9,700 PSLF program applications were received from October 2018 to March 2019, while nearly 9,000 requests were made for the Temporary Expanded PSLF Program in October 2018 to March 2019. There were 72,058 PSLF program applications received in October 2018 to March 2019, an almost 97% increase from October 2018 to March 2019. For nearly half of loan forgiveness applicants, the denials were because missing data, while for those who were eligible, Education processed 100,000 PSLF program applications within the 2 years from October 2018 to March 2019. Nearly 75% of applicants did not submit information to the Education Department. (See table 1.) 5.13.3 PROJECT INVESTIGATION OF PSLF AND The Temporary Expanded Parent Loan Fulfillment Program: (2014-2019) A recent review by ORS found that, due to a 9 percent decrease in loan repayment for student loan borrowers, PSLF is an important tool in helping Oregon students to remain successful in college. However, the PSLF program currently requires that borrowers make more than 120 monthly payments over a decade, while Education's temporary expanded process requires making all of the remaining qualifying federal student loan payments of up to $120 for the borrower. If that means the borrower will be eligible, the Temporary Expanded PSLF Program requires payments to be made over 10 years in lieu of half its lifetime in service. As a first step in researching this subject, we found in our previous research that Education is making close to 99 percent of loan forgiveness applications for PSLF. The reason for these denials, however, is not because of missing data, but because borrowers have not yet submitted the necessary information to Education. As an effort to get a better understanding of the PSLF and Temporary Expanded PSLF programs, our review in the 2015 report, \"A Deep Dive into PSLF, Temporary Expanded PSLF, and Loan Repayment Benefits that Need Legislative Reform,\" documented the fact that while PSLF and Temporary Expanded PSLF applications are being processed in almost all the required income brackets, 99 percent of applications for PSLF are denied because of missing information. Our review also found that in the PSLF and Temporary Expanded PSLF program data for those that have been through the program, the most common reason for denial is not missing data, but because the borrower has not previously submitted 120 months of qualifying federal student loan payments. Additionally, most of the requests made for the Temporary Expanded PSLF Program had no data submitted because of missing information. After examining the PSLF and Temporary Expanded PSLF documents, we were not able to find examples where the temporary program was used as a replacement for the PSLF program.

TEXT: A VA expert says the agency has significant human capital management challenges across many areas, including talent development, recruitment, retention, and career progression. The text summarizes their report on VA\u2019s priorities, accomplishments, and challenges. TEXT: At VA, and indeed at federal agencies in general, strategic human capital management can be a lot more than recruitment and retention. VA agrees in that case, as it has faced significant challenges in retaining talent and in recruiting personnel to fill vacancies and meet mission needs. They are also considering new strategies for how to meet their strategic goals. TEXT: In our 2019 report, we identified 40 management priorities at VA, focusing on such areas as talent management, job descriptions, and job roles. VA has addressed some of these issues but recognizes that there is significant scope for improvement. | 32\n- 12. Talent management. Talent management is critical to VA being able to manage and effectively use its human capital resources to achieve the strategic goals of the organization. These goals are increasingly challenging to achieve due to demographic changes and retirements. VA has addressed many of the human capital management challenges but in many cases through relatively minor modifications rather than major changes. These are the areas VA needs to focus on to best meet its human capital management challenges. It is critical for VA to improve employee retention, as over the past year, more workers have left the VA system than have been hired due to inadequate compensation. VA can look to the Army\u2019s civilian job classification system or military skill and occupation classification system (MCO) as resources in addressing the challenges related to the retention of employees. | 34 |", "This summary discusses the Department of Defense\u2019s F-35 fighter aircraft program. Text: DOD began the F-35 program in 2001 to develop a fifth-generation fighter aircraft to replace aging aircraft in the U.S. military services\u2019 inventories and provide enhanced capabilities to warfighters. DOD estimates that F-35 will cost as much as $1.2 trillion\u2014a condition known as a Nunn-McCurdy breach. In our previous work, we reported that DOD\u2019s process for developing the F-35 aircraft was deficient in multiple ways, including poor knowledge of the program\u2019s costs and complexity. Additionally, because DOD did not develop a suitable cost and schedule baseline upfront, it was not able to answer key questions from GAO regarding the future of the program. DOD concurred with our past GAO findings, but we also found that DOD had not sufficiently evaluated ALIS and was planning to replace it with a new system. GAO recommended that DOD develop and implement a strategy for re-designing ALIS. CONCLUSIONS: (1) DOD has not adequately evaluated its systems requirements or program design and has not developed a clear strategy for re-designing the critical components of the F-35 program; (2) the department\u2019s most recent estimates of F-35 costs increased significantly from an earlier baseline with no accompanying cost or schedule baseline; (3) without a clear strategy for re-designing ALIS and a new ALIS strategy, GAO expected that DOD will continue to struggle to complete development and delivery of the F-35 fighter aircraft.", "The Office of the Protective Inspector General issued a report addressing the Secret Service\u2019s failure to inform Congress about cyberattacks it had detected due to its data-collection methods, despite requiring these methods in contract. The report also addressed the agency\u2019s response to the Inspector General\u2019s request for special agent assignment information. RECOMMENDATION: After reviewing the IG report, the Secret Service agreed to provide a list of special agents in the Office of Personal and Administrative Affairs. They also began work on implementing the FBI\u2019s information-sharing procedures to the IG. The OPA report, which recommended a wide range of changes to the IG review, was completed in October 2018.

The report also addressed the agency's response to the IG\u2019s request for personal agent assignment information. Recommendations for improvements included providing lists of personal agents to the Inspector General and committing to updating the contract's implementation.", "Agencies from USDA, DOE, and DHS can provide personal property to non-federal recipients outside of their own internal screening process at no charge if the agency has its own program, the program is an FAA airport, or if the personal property is not declared excess as well as items listed on a list in Appendix II. These agencies must have a program in place that is not a \u201cFAIR\u201d program for disposal and sale of excess property. Agencies may or may not conduct their own independent property disposal process and may require agencies to utilize their own property disposal processes that DOE and DHS agencies have developed. Agencies from USDA, DOE, and DHS can provide personal property to non-federal recipients outside of their own internal screening process if the agency has its own program or if it participates in a specific program. These include programs run by the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and the Department of Interior. Agencies from USDA, DOE, and DHS can provide personal property if: a. The agency agrees that a property is declared excess as a cost of doing business b. The agency agrees to dispose of property in accordance with the disposal process at the end of its useful life (not the end of the item\u2019s useful life) c. The amount of property to which an emergency is a situation cannot be exceeded at a cost associated with the emergency. In these cases, the remaining property to which the emergency can be a situation must be disposed or reported or reported to the Federal Fire Assistance Program (FFAP) for evaluation purposes. Table 1. Agencies and departments are authorized to sell unused or excess personal property to eligible non-federal personal property disposition agencies. DHS also manages disposal, through their federal Excess Property Program, and their federal Personal property disposition system, PEXUS. Agencies provide personal property at no cost to an eligible non-federal entity, but agencies may be subject to federal fees for property disposal (up to $15,000). Agencies from USDA, DOE, and DHS can provide personal property outside of their own internal screening process. Agencies can provide personal property under a FEMA or DHS emergency declaration, or they can require their own property disposal procedures that DOE or DHS require for personal property disposal. * Agencies can decide which agency to use on a task. In most cases, personal property will be sold through GSAXcess. Federal agencies are responsible for disposal. Agencies can choose one or more agencies to provide personal property to their agencies. In addition, USDA, DOE, DHS and FEMA offer personal property disposal services. Agencies can also provide personal property to individuals, state governments, local governments, and public schools (or schools in the case of personal property disposal), and for purposes such as: For example, if a school district has excess personal property, it can be disposed of through the school district\u2019s program, and the items not sold after the auction (or auctioned through the use of the local tax money) or disposed of will be provided to schools as a donation.

USDA or DOE may choose which agency they will use to dispose their excess property. Agencies may choose one or more agencies to dispose of their excess property. Agencies generally can choose the disposal and sale of excess property up to the cost of disposal (such as the disposal expenses) on a per article or item basis. Personal property may be disposed of in accordance with any disposal rules and procedures set forth in a contract or agreement between USDA and DHS, which may establish the terms and conditions of disposal or disposal options. Disposition of personal property must be properly authorized by USDA or DHS. Agencies generally can dispose of their excess property in accordance with any disposal process of USDA and DHS.

According to VA figures for fiscal year 2016 the veteran population consisted of 70 percent of the entire program (400,000 veterans). The largest shares of the oldest veterans were aged 70 years or older (45 percent) and 88 percent were aged 60 years or older. There were approximately 17,000 veterans aged 50 through 59 years enrolled in home health care. For veterans enrolled in VA health care: 1. Percentage of 80 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. 2. Approximately 5.5 million veterans enrolled in VA\u2019s Community Based Outpatient Clinics, providing personal services including 5,000 health care aides, and about 30,000 medical residents and physician practictioners for clinical rotations. See FIGS: SUMMARY 5-1, SUMMARY 2-2, SUMMARY 6-1, SUMMARY TABLE 5-2: VA Health Care System Statistics as of VY. VA Caregiver Programs VA has a number of programs that could be beneficial to veterans. These programs cover care and support for veterans and their significant others experiencing a disability, a veteran\u2019s spouse, or a veteran\u2019s caregiver. VA has various programs to provide support and care to veterans. Most of these programs are designed to help veterans with disabilities including mental health diagnoses. Here are just a few of the programs that are available: \u2022 Caregiver/Respite/Home Health Services: VA provides help to caregivers that are being paid to care for veterans in their homes. In some cases, the veteran may need additional personal assistance to help with medical diagnosis. In addition, veteran may need financial assistance that they are unable to receive from either their government or community resources. \u2022 Continuing Care Units: Veterans may be able to receive assistance from residential health care center that can provide continuous health care. The VA also has Home Health Services that may be able to provide additional support to veteran\u2019s aging in place. \u2022 VA Caregiver Program: This program is designed to help veterans and their spouses with caregiver assistance to help them remain in their homes. The program is available in many states. \u2022 VA Health Care \u2022 Caregiver/Respite/Home Health Services: As before, VAMCs may be able to provide ongoing help or 24- hour care in a veteran\u2019s home. Some veteran\u2019s financial help may be provided for a monthly maintenance fee. \u2022 VA Caregiver Program: VA also provides this program. Depending on where the veteran resides, there may be a network of VAMCs that can provide ongoing support. These programs require that a veteran enroll in a VA Health Care System before receiving any support from a VAMC. \u2022 VAMC Residential Assistance Program: Vets are not the only ones that can use residential assistance. Veterans who served in Wounded Warrior programs or in the Global War on Terrorism may also receive support. \u2022 Community-Based Outpatient Programs: The VAMC may be able to provide outpatient programs, such as those that will serve both veteran and spouse. Some of these programs may serve veteran and spouse together. \u2022 Medical Foster Homes: VAMCs may be able to help patients with physical disabilities, that need additional assistance and care after they have been discharged from the VA Medical Care system. \u2022 Personal Assistance services (veteran\u2019s spouse): Vets sometimes receive great deal of support from their caregiver/spouse. Many VAMCs have caregivers available for veterans and their significant other that provide assistance and personal care on a daily basis. The assistance level may range from a few hours of respite per week to 24/7 coverage. Caregivers should take responsibility for the veteran\u2019s physical and medical care at all times and with a 24-hour call center available for assistance. \u2022 VA Home Care/Community-Based Outpatient Care (CBOCs): These are the locations where VA Medical Center provides a variety of services that are similar in scope to their main Medical Center but are located in a single office, rather than a full hospital setting. If an individual veterans lives in a location which has a medical center and VA (VAMC) that a veteran should be able to receive the same medical care, services may still be provided as long as the veteran\u2019s enrollment is up (not required if receiving VA compensation benefits). \u2022 Private Caregiver Services: Veterans in the community may seek their services. In these situations, the veteran would make payments using VA loan or GI bill. Other veterans\u2019 financial help may be provided, but the veteran would need to take personal responsibility for any costs associated with hiring a private provider. These types of expenses may include co-pays, premiums, and deductibles for the veteran\u2019s non- service-connected disability that were once paid for by state and other resources (private insurance benefits). \u2022 \u2022 Homebound/Infirm Care Providers Homebound/Infirm", "A single GPS satellite signals ground control to military receivers and modernizes, updating a system to have (1) cybersecure, secure global positioning capability, and (2) improved location accuracy.

Program costs exceed 9.5 billion dollars, with over 7.5 billion dollars paid for military satellites and more than 2.5 billion dollars for civilian satelit", "OMB worked with both grants and contracts agencies to pilot the DATA Act, primarily to reduce reporting burden of federal financial aid through OMB and other agencies. The pilot included a 12-month reporting cycle and also encompassed more than $1 billion in federal assistance by using multiple grant types and sampling methods. According to several CAP goals, the Department of Health and Human Services, Defense Acquisition Management Office, and Treasury Office of the Comptroller of the United States were involved in the DATA Act implementation.\nThe Data and Management (DMAG) Advisory Committee (DMAC), chartered in September 2016 by the Office of Management Policy (OMB), reported on the implementation of the Data and Management Section of the DATA Act. A final report was published in November 2016. The implementation of the Data and Management section of the DATA Act involves multiple agencies working together to develop a comprehensive information technology architecture for the use of federal data in support of both the PMA goals as well as the overall goal of reducing federal recipient reporting burden. The Section 10 goal is to ensure that the data element(s) are reported correctly for grants and contracts purposes, that data elements are required across federal government for grant and contracts purposes, and that data elements become readily available to federal award recipients. All three objectives intersect and are implemented through the implementation of the Data and Management Section. The Data and Management Advisory Committee (DMAC) was established on September 5, 2016 to serve as the DMA\u2019s designee to provide input on the development of the DATA Act. The DMAC Report focuses on the implementation of the section of the DATA Act. To date, 18 agencies/programs have either partially or complete been involved in the DMAC\u2019s Data Quality Framework. Data and Management Section Recommendations: Agencies/programs should further develop data architectures and applications that provide timely, current information and analysis that can be accessed for PMA and other purposes, such as by the HHS Human Services Portal. Data.gov should be further developed to provide access to the DATA Act data elements as well as other data sources. The DMAC's Final Report will be shared with the OMB, POMT, and PMA, however it was not publicly released due to confidentiality concerns.", "In the April 2019 report, we found that eight of the nine selected agencies have scientific integrity policies in place, such as steps for dealing with fraud and non-compliance. Eight agencies also have designated scientific integrity officials, and the agencies that do not rely on scientific integrity policies have either established their own guidelines or set of actions on how to address suspected fraud and non-compliance. The departments of Energy (DOE), Labor, State, Commerce, NASA, NOAA, and OSTP agreed with this assessment. However, three departments and agencies indicated that no scientific integrity official exists. Of the 10 organizations, NOAA and NASA are in the process of designating scientific integrity officers to take on the scientific integrity responsibilities. According to NIST\u2019s submission on a draft of the report, DOE should begin the process of implementing a scientific integrity policy on a phased approach. Based on the scientific integrity policy, DOE must establish procedures for responding to non-compliance, establish guidance for scientific integrity activities with scientific integrity policies and procedures (SIPs) for each agency, and designate someone to take responsibility for the execution of a scientific integrity plan. We recommended DOE to establish a scientific integrity policy, SIPs, and designate a scientific integrity manager, and provide a timeline of implementation for their scientific integrity activities, and consider adopting a scientific integrity plan that could be amended by implementing information on other agencies\u2019 current scientific integrity activities. We found that the agencies\u2019 current response mechanisms vary widely in their usefulness. The Agencies and OSTP were in agreement that the science being conducted at the selected agencies was, in general, valuable and of high quality. We recommended the agencies continue their scientific integrity efforts and improve the usefulness of their scientific integrity practices in the future. Recommendations: Establish a scientific integrity policy for each selected agency. Establish SIPs and designate a scientific integrity manager. We recommend OSTP establish a scientific integrity policy for its agencies and we recommend the DOI establish a plan of implementation for their implementation. The DOI also recommended a timeline for the implementation of a biological waste program. The Agencies and OSTP are in agreement with each item in the report. They also acknowledged that the number of resources they are making available to the scientific integrity workgroups is in decline, and they recognize the need for this information to stay up to date as a member. However, none of the agencies have provided responses to the final report. The lack of a proper response from agencies and oversight committee that oversee the scientific integrity activities have hindered the implementation of the plan. 14 APPENDICES Table I: List of Information Resources Table II: Detailed report on OSTPs April 2019 report Table III: OSTP\u2019s Annual Report on scientific integrity, April 2019 OSTP, 2019 Annual Report on Scientific Information Integrity (pp. 1 -2).

SSA is organized and funded through OUSD (Policy) resources; it is led by the Joint Staff, CAPE (Collective Intelligence); the key analytic products are \u2018threats-to-force\u2019 matrices, a matrix of possible military capabilities (which does not include nuclear, cyber, space, and intelligence), Force Structure Assessment (FSA), which is currently in development; and a tri-product analysis and recommendations document (the Tri-Chairs). SSA is organized internally as SSA-1, SSA-2, and SSA-3. SSA products are identified as SSA-TA (Triple-Assess Tool, which contains threat assessments for each mission task), SSA-TE (Triple-Assess Tool which contains threat assessments for each mission task, plus the \u201cthreat\u201d matrix), SSA-TC (Triple Assessment Tool, which contains threat assessments for each mission task, and the \u201cthreat\u201d matrix), and SSA-TA2 (which provides a tool-box of assessments with a matrix of military capabilities). SSA products are intended to be tri-products in that their primary elements are the assessments, recommendations, and threat matrix, taken together. These products are often used internally by joint staff, including Army and Navy and Air Force. The products must include threat-assessments to meet the Joint Force\u2019s \u201cforce structure needs for supporting the National Security Strategy.\u201d DOD recommends that each military service provide O&S (organization and staffing) for SSA-2, which will be developed separately for each service and must be completed by 2015. The Tri-Chairs will lead SSA-3 production. The Army will be the first service to complete the Tri-Chair responsibilities by the end of 2016. Air Force O&S of SSA products is not yet funded, and the Army is paying for the Tri-Chairs. The Navy is the third (and final) service to be added to the SSA products, which has no specific timeline; funding for development is being acquired separately, likely through a Navy command or Marine program. The Navy will produce the SSA-3 product. According to an OUSD press release, development of SSA-3 is now complete. Table 2 identifies the key products and lead organizations for each product\u2019s development in % of funding. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) defines military force structure as Force Structure Based Analysis (FSBA). It does not include nuclear, cyber, space, or intelligence capabilities. The analysis is broken down into two categories for analysis: Force Structure Assessment (FSA) and Tri-Chain Assessment. The FSBA requirements are defined in chapter 5 (see % in funding) and % of funding. DOD is aware of concerns regarding the reliability of the Joint Force\u2019s Force Structure Assessment (JF-FSA) product and is working to develop and improve these products. The Army is the lead O&S organization for JF-FSA. There are five product products under the current SSA initiative, as well as an annual O&S project. Table 3 lists the five products. Three of the products are now completed and their costs are being reported in %. Table 4 lists the current and original cost for those years, as well as the current and original percentages of funding. Table 2 can be used as a reference for future budget estimates.

Analysis of Threat Structure and Capability Assessments ($$) Joint Threat Analysis", "In U.S. commercial airline traffic, passengers may be affected by IT outages ranging from delayed or canceled flights by software or hardware glitches or even from a failure of an airline data center, which may lead to delays in real-time data communications, such as aircraft boarding, flight status, and check-in. Other effects can include prolonged delays across airline IT systems and cascading effects on flight schedules, with the potential for added costs for passengers. IT systems and operations used by airlines are becoming more digital with a need to replace manual processes, such as flight boardings, check-in, and boarding cards, as the airline industry goes through a transformation in its retail merchandising practices. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the government body overseeing the integration of commercial airplanes into our airspace. FAA is responsible for ensuring the safe, efficient operation of the National Airspace System (NAS), which supports demand for airspace. If an airline IT outage affects flight schedules, FAA officials noted that it only affects airspace operations that are within the airline\u2019s control, even if a flight is delayed or canceled. If it affects real-time flight boardings, it is limited and depends on the availability of the airline IT system that routes passengers to and from the gate. Some airlines have been forced to ground their fleets because of airline software system failures. The FAA plays a role in responding to airline IT outages. Agencies like the FAA can only manage limited aspects of airline IT systems, which often have critical roles in providing real-time flight status and boarding information. The FAA also noted that airline software failures can have limited effects on real-time boarding processes. In more severe cases, even the failure of the airline data center could affect real-time data communications, such as aircraft boarding and flight status. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plays various roles overseeing commercial aviation, airspaces, and data centers. A network outage can lead to delays in aircraft movements, delays in check-in, and delays in flight status updates among passengers. As a result of airline IT outages, the FAA can only manage limited aspects of IT systems, such as real-time boarding and flight status information. Generally, airline software failures can have limited effects on real-time boarding processes. In more severe cases, the failure of airline data centers can also impact real-time data communication, such as aircraft boarding and flight status. FAA officials noted that airline IT outages are limited in their impact on flight schedules due to real-time flight boardings, while some airlines may suffer extended delays. These delays are more commonly found within airline systems and data centers, including air traffic control (ATC), navigation aids, electronic surveillance, communications, traffic control and monitoring centers. However, if the airline IT systems are functioning normally, the FAA can usually recover and process real-time flight data during an outage. Generally, airline software failures can have limited effects on a real-time boarding process (\u201cflight boards\u201d). However, the failure of a data center could affect real-time data communications, such as aircraft boarding/status and flight update information for passengers. Generally, airline IT outages are minimized by redundant systems and processes. Despite the limited impact of most airline IT outages, the FAA, Air Traffic Control and Flight Center systems are critical for \u201creal-time\u201d flight data communications and information processing. They can also affect \u201creal-time\u201d boarding and scheduling that are critical to commercial flight operations. A network outage could affect flights at various points on the schedule, such as delays in terminal access and aircraft movements between gates. Delays in on-time performance during these periods can be costly, as they represent an extended delay. Depending on the type and severity of the outage, costs could range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per minute for impacted airlines. Additionally, some airlines may suffer extended delays in boarding/scheduling due to real-time processing problems. While data processing systems are designed with some redundancy and failover capabilities, they can also suffer limited performance during an emergency, such that a failure of multiple systems could lead to an airline\u2019s inability to process flight data or schedule flights. In many cases, airline data centers act as redundant to the systems that are subject to failure. In such a case, a failure of a data center system would depend on the capabilities of the airline\u2019s multiple data centers, as well as the redundancy of the systems. For example, airlines may have data centers that provide redundant access to the systems that are subject to failure, which could keep them operational during an outage. In other cases, the airline system may provide fault-tolerance by performing specific operations in parallel, so that failure of one system may not result in an outage. A power failure or system malfunction could cause real-time data to be inaccessible (\u201cdown\u201d), resulting in delays in customer check-in and boarding. These delays in the passenger flow could affect thousands of customers and hundreds of flights per day. Depending on the type and severity of the outage,", "The U.S. federal budget includes a variety of trust funds, nonrevolving trust funds, and revolving trust funds.

According to a WCF official, WCF Division officials are also involved in the \u2018go to\u2019 resource for purchasing and will handle purchases on behalf of the business line offices. WCF Division officials stated that a portion of WCF\u2019s funding may be used to allow business line offices to purchase commercial services. The WCF Division officials told us they have not been involved, and would possibly have to provide funds, to pay for service usage and that is purchased directly by business line offices. OCHCO and OCFO have been the main lines of business for providing customers with a large array of services and have been the primary liaison between the WCF and the customers. In many years, the WCF Division has been an integral partner of OCHCO\u2019s efforts regarding WCF and provided the business line offices with assistance in processing WCF transactions. The WCF Division stated its business line officers work in WCF, but they do not have any direct involvement in the WCF\u2019s internal functions, such as payroll and finance. Therefore, the WCF Division officials stated that it is unlikely that the business line or helpdesk would be involved in WCF tasks. According to OCHCO, WCF business line officers play a key role in the work involving service payments and accounting. The WCF Division officials indicate the business line officials work on the financial management aspects of WCF. In 2019, the WCF Division and OCFO signed a memorandum of understanding for a 5-year extension of the existing contract with them. They agree to cooperate and assist each other, to ensure the integrity of the WCF and other HUD programs/functions that they must perform. WCF\u2019s Division Director stated that the relationship with OCFO allows the Division to obtain data and financial information more efficiently. A WCF Division official stated that the business unit has worked collaboratively with the WCF, OCFO and all HUD offices, such as HR, to improve its internal processes. In 2016 WCF began the process to establish a new service and financial system. All the WCF division offices have been working to move systems to the cloud, as WCF is currently in a 24/7 service to keep up with customer demand. Business operations for the WCF have been outsourced to HP, where 10 WCF business operations employees, in addition to the 5 current HUD employees, are responsible for running the business and operations. In October 2016 after the installation of WCF\u2019s new financial management system the business line office, in addition to the WCF Division, was required to go through an entire programmatic refresh. In 2016 the business line offices participated in the process to select a \u2018single point of contact business office\u2019 to help better service their business support needs. The WCF Division stated that the business line offices are in a better position to evaluate WCF\u2019s needs since it relies on them to validate their internal WCF processes and the quality of their data. All the WCF Division offices have been working in transitioning from on-site to cloud-based operations. All the WCF Division officers are moving toward single point of contacts for business line/customer service. A business line officer is responsible for coordinating business processing and service transactions between WCF and the business line offices. All business line offices use their own accounting systems, which are being transitioned of consolidation into the WCF Division. WCF Division Official: Division Director, Robert Nicksay. The", "The Office of Mental Health Services provided in fiscal year 2018 was the most common type of service among veterans receiving mental health care. Approximately 60 percent of military veterans who used VAMCs also used medical services. Half of the approximately 2 million veterans identified in 2018 as using one or more mental health (see fig. 1). About 26 percent received a combination of non-pharmacologic therapy and psychotropic medication. Approximately 45 percent received only one or more psychotherapy sessions and 70 percent received some form of medication during fiscal year 2018. Approximately 90 percent of veterans receiving treatment were using psychotropic medication. About half of these veterans used a mixture of two medications. Approximately 70 percent of veterans using psychotropic medication received medication that had been prescribed by a mental health provider, approximately 20 percent of whom were prescribed medications after their initial psychiatric diagnoses in fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 2). About 20 percent of this medication use was the prescription of an antidepressant medication (e.g., Prozac\u00ae or Zoloft\u00ae). One in five veterans receiving treatment also received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve pain symptoms. Figure and Table 2 illustrate how veterans\u2019 use of psychotropic medication and other medications might be related. Approximately 25 percent of veterans receiving psychotherapy received medication for depression or PTSD, and nearly all veterans receiving medication for PTSD (e.g., 82 percent of veterans receiving psychotropic medication with a non-specific psychiatric diagnosis in fiscal year 2018) received both medication in addition to psychotherapy. Approximately 13 percent of veterans receiving psychotropic medication received a combination of a medication and a psychotherapy session (see fig. 3). Figure 2 shows the percentage of veteran receiving psychotropic medication using medication to treat depression or PTSD. Approximately 63 percent of veterans receiving medication to treat depression were prescribed medication without also receiving psychotherapy (see fig. 4). In addition, approximately 50 percent of veterans receiving medication for PTSD also received both medication and therapy. In contrast, about 25 percent of veterans receiving psychotherapy also received medication. The percentage of veterans receiving medication without psychotherapy is approximately 20 percent, and the same percentage of veterans using medication to treat PTSD are receiving psychotherapy. Figure 3 illustrates that almost half of veterans receiving medication to treat depression also receive psychotherapy, in contrast, more than half of veteran receiving psychotropic medication are not receiving therapy. Nearly a half of veterans receiving psychotropic medication are not being provided psychotherapy (see fig. 4). Table 2 illustrates how the percentage of veterans receiving or not receiving both medication and/or psychotherapy varies based on their VA prescription data. Approximately 23 percent of veterans receiving medication to treat depression were prescribed medication by a mental health provider after receiving a psychotropic medication (see fig. 5). Approximately 90 percent of veterans receiving medication without receiving psychotherapy are prescribed medication by a mental health provider. Although most veterans receiving medication to treat depression receive psychotherapy before or in addition to medication, it is the most prevalent type of psychotherapy received in fiscal year 2018. In contrast, veterans receiving medication for depression have shown the highest proportion of receiving psychotherapy. Veterans receiving medication to treat PTSD are the one type of treatment group with a lower proportion receiving psychotherapy. Similarly, veterans are generally prescribed medication for PTSD more often than veterans being prescribed medication to treat depression. Nearly 50 percent of veterans receiving medication to treat PTSD also receive psychotherapy. In contrast, 23 percent of veterans receiving medication for depression are receiving some type of psychotherapy, such as psychotherapy or counseling and psychotherapy. Figure 1 shows veteran\u2019s use of mental health care services. Approximately 26% of veterans with any mental health issue received a combination of medication and psychotherapy, according to the Office of Mental Health Services. Approximately 45% of veterans received some form of medication and 11% of veterans received psychotherapy, according to the Office of Mental Health Services. Approximately 68 percent of veterans receiving any form of medication used medication that had been prescribed by a mental health provider. Approximately 15 percent of veterans receiving medication had been prescribed medications after receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, according to the Office of Mental Health Services. Approximately 90% of veterans receiving medication report being prescribed medication by a mental health provider. Approximately 80% of veterans receiving medical care report receiving psychotherapy. About one-fourth of veterans have been seen by a mental health provider. Figure 2 illustrates the percentage of veterans prescribed different forms of mental health care by their utilization of VA care. Approximately 64% of veterans receiving medication and psychotherapy received both medication and therapy. Approximately 23% of veterans receiving medication to treat depression received both medication and psychotherapy. Additionally, nearly half of veterans receiving medication for PTSD received both medication and therapy. Veterans who received both medication and therapy had a higher proportion of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Approximately two-thirds of veterans receiving medication to treat PTSD received both medication and therapy (see figure 3). Approximately 90%", "FMS 18\nU.S. Department of Defense.

Specifically, it required agencies across the government to develop plans, engage in partnerships, and adapt recruitment and hiring practices. The Executive Order and subsequent Executive Order 13548 also set out specific roles for each of the three agencies responsible for executing the plan. Federal agencies play vital roles in the employment and retention of individuals with disabilities. Agencies have an important role in recruiting individuals with disabilities, assisting them when they enter the workforce, and identifying barriers to allow individuals with disabilities to obtain jobs. Additionally, agencies are involved in the areas of retention strategies, as well as developing effective HR practices for all employees. For the sake of brevity, EEOC was required to review 100 percent of new hiring requests. Agencies must develop strategies to re-employ individuals with disabilities, while EEOC tracks the numbers of employees with disabilities in the federal workforce. EEOC must analyze all agencies\u2019 HR practices to ensure compliance with EEOC guidelines designed to keep individuals with disabilities in the workforce. OPM and EEOC play leading roles in monitoring the employment of individuals with disabilities across agencies. In addition, OMB was the sole executive department in the federal government tasked by the Executive Order to develop a framework and provide guidance on employment of disabled individuals. The Order encouraged agencies to adopt innovative methods for recruitment and employment of individuals with disabilities. Agencies must also establish an effective performance system for employing individuals with disabilities. The Order also directed each agency to provide training on disabilities and employment for all employees at least once a year. Finally, agencies established or updated disability policies that covered individuals with disabilities, and they develop effective retention strategies. In summary, agencies must engage in specific requirements such as re- employment strategies and providing mandatory training to assist individuals with disabilities. Agencies must also adopt recruitment and retention practices that are suitable to their organization to encourage hiring of individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, agencies must ensure the retention of these individuals in a hostile work environment.", "Summary for a 2013 bond review policy that was recently issued by BLM. The review addressed the need for more clarity in determining bond adequacy and whether BLM should periodically review each bond.

The 2013 bond adequacy review policy is contained in Instruction Memorandum 2013-151, an official Department of the Interior policy.", "HUD's Performance Inspection and Evaluation Office manages REAC to address safety hazards, maintain physical standards, and track the performance and management of multifamily housing and public housing projects.", "Three organizational requirements required by section 911 of the legislation and three components of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s organizational strategy were used to evaluate DOD\u2019s progress in meeting this year\u2019s requirements and to further examine the implementation of the strategy. On December 12, 2019, DOD released its guidance on cross- functional teams, which we used to evaluate how well the department is tracking in DOD\u2019s response in December 2019 and on the progress in addressing the organization\u2019s statutory and strategic needs. In particular, we examined each component in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s strategy, which included: establishing cross-functional teams for areas identified in section 911 as necessary, defining and incorporating each component of the strategy using specific implementation steps and providing periodic progress reports; incorporating this implementation strategy into the existing organizational structure and processes associated with the Defense Strategy and Force Readiness Plan; and using various methods to assess progress, including internal reviews, peer evaluations, and external feedback. TEXT: DOD received four of the eight requirements in section 911 within the specified timeline, but did not meet the five remaining that had expired in August 2019. TEXT: DOD has implemented the most of the nine-month timeline of section 911 requirements. However, it did not meet the only remaining deadlines, expiring in August of the year, on a key one component in which DOD was supposed to submit an updated organizational structure by December 2019. We recommend that this timeline be extended two years and DOD ensure that it submits the organizational structure update by December 2020. DOD also did not implement a critical component needed for a collaborative culture. A senior management group, in this case, the Deputy\u2019s Management Action Group (DMAG), was set to be one of the key strategies in section 911 for increasing employee satisfaction, team building and improved communication. A report in July 2019 to DOD from the National Defense Council indicated that DOD\u2019s senior leadership forums, which included DMAG, should be implemented in 2020. However, DOD\u2019s organizational structure of DMAG and the structure of DOD\u2019s information technology organization are not consistent or clear. We recommend that these aspects become more standardized to clearly define cross-functional teams and organizational requirements which have not yet been completed. DOD is required to annually revisit the structure and functions of the National Security and Strategy Secretariat (NSSS). Each year, NSSS, with oversight from the Secretary, submits its Annual Activity Report (AAR) to Congress. The report is supposed to include an assessment of threats to national security and any measures the department is taking to address them. This assessment also includes a set of requirements in which the department was supposed to assess current capabilities and recommend strategies for its modernization. In addition, a report from the department\u2019s annual assessment identified a lack of comprehensive information security capabilities to evaluate security risks. The report recommended that DOD establish a National Security Information Systems Integration program that integrates security systems across all DOD networks and infrastructure, including those shared with the public. Additionally, the report identified the need to further develop and implement the department\u2019s strategic communications system. According to data DOD provided in April 25, 2019, reports from all 16 components of the department in the National Security Information Systems Integration Program office and the Office of Strategic Communications were either substantially compliant or noncompliant with all but one of the 10 objectives, which could create barriers to the ability to use the report as a planning tool. Additionally, DOD is required to annually revisit its structure and functions at the National Security and Strategy Secretariat. Additionally, NSSS provides periodic reports to Congress on each of its 10 objectives and the department\u2019s progress in meeting them since receiving guidance for them in August 2020. Additional information can be found by reading the report at. According to information DOD provided us in June 2020, we were informed that the Directorate for Information Processing Services at DOD still lacked adequate capabilities which allowed them to be properly integrated into the IT networks of other DOD components. The report to Congress from the National Security and Strategy Secretariat has not yet been made publicly available as the department is currently creating, and therefore, we were not provided with the most recent report. According to the information provided to us in June 2020, the DOD Network Assurance Center is completing its move to the consolidated DOD Information Technology Enterprise Services contract by January 2021. DOD will then take the capability provided by that contract, and move it from the Directorate for Information Technology Research and Development to Defense Information Systems Network Information Services (DISNIS). In general, the DIT\u2019S Strategic Information Technology Systems Security and the DITO, formerly the Information Security Analysis Center (ISAC), is responsible for providing DOD\u2019s end users with DOD information systems security solutions which are then applied to physical systems security, systems reliability and information assurance as a whole.

In determining whether to impose sanctions, the United States considers several factors, including the specific facts at issue, the individual\u2019s or group\u2019s previous behavior, and the general situation in which it transpired. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of State, and the Executive Office of the President are authorized to impose sanctions. The sanctions enforcement authorities are primarily the Office of Foreign National Transactions for trade-related sanctions, the Office of Export Enforcement and Compliance for product-based sanctions and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Programs for sanctions-related export control. Under the National Security Act, the President may authorize other sanctions without the need for congressional approval. The President may also exempt entities that were previously subject to sanctions sanctions, are permitted or required to be the subject of certain sanctions. In addition to sanctions, the United States takes other actions in response to foreign policy challenges to the country or nations. The United States may also impose criminal penalties on individuals who violate U.S. sanctions laws. This section does not apply to any action undertaken before November 12, 2019, as Treasury has been authorized to assess civil penalties on persons and entities that do not comply with sanctions requirements.

Under two DHS executive orders, the DHS now responds to \u201callegations of misconduct by DHS employees to ensure greater accountability. The DHS began implementing new requirements for training and performance of its agents and officers. The DHS issued multiple memos advising the field offices to review the immigration policies, procedures, and programs used by the Border Patrol. In addition, the DHS also began a PEP program. The PEP allowed DHS officials to prioritize their efforts in removing aliens, who posed a threat to national security, infrastructure or public safety, and other aliens whose detention would be beneficial to the federal government. The executive order and new DHS policy did not require agents to document these cases, but to prioritize them whenever possible. ICE also began interviewing aliens during their removal and removal attempts. DHS\u2019s Office of Principal Legal Advisor OPLAP prepared additional guidance to ERO officers on how to identify potentially removable aliens, a process for determining removable aliens to the field officers, and procedures for the treatment and processing of aliens identified or arrested for criminal purposes. Enforcement Operations. In the first decade of the United States, immigrants arrived and settled in many parts of the United States, mainly from the European countries. The United States welcomed immigrants between 17905 and 1846 who were willing workers, and later, from 1850 to the Civil War migrants who were often viewed as a threat to the population and the society. The immigrant flow slowed during the Civil War and has become increasingly regulated since. However, the government continues to provide assistance or assistance for the government in processing immigration. DHS reports that in FY 2012, 9.9 million individuals, 9.8 percent of the total population, entered the United States. Since the 1980s, a significant number of immigration requests in the United States have come from the Middle East and South Asia. DHS and CBP identified many of these individuals including criminals, and therefore, the government implemented heightened security measures, such as additional checks upon entry or the use of technology such as X-ray machines, or other techniques such as biometric recognition to help determine an applicant\u2019s identity. These measures help DHS provide a secure environment for all immigrants who come to the United States. The Immigration Process. DHS reports that in FY 2012, there were approximately 1.9 million immigrants with U.S. citizenship and 1.3 million illegal or nonimmigrants processed during the year. DHS identified the number of individuals entering the United States by region. Immigrants are processed by the immigration processing center in New York, known as the INS. DHS reports that in FY 11, 2.1 million new immigrants, including 600,000 on immigrant visas. DHS reported that the total number of new immigrants coming into the United States in FY 12 was 1.6 million, which is the lowest number since DHS began recording the statistics in 1999. DHS reports that, since the 1980s, it received thousands of requests for information and documentations related to the entry of immigrants into the United States. They received approximately 8.1 million requests for documentation in FY-12. DHS reported that the number of in-person applications dropped between 2004 and 2006 by about 20 percent compared to the number in 2000 and 2006. DHS reports that, in FY 12, new information system upgrades were accomplished in the processing of individuals entering the United States. ICE reported that they began conducting in-person interviews using the electronic system in FY 10, and that DHS identified the number of in-person interview conducted between 2004 and 2010 was approximately 5 million. DHS reported that, since the 1980s, it has received thousands of requests for information and documentations related to entry into the United States. DHS reported that approximately 8.1 million requests were received in FY 12, and, that the number of in-person applications dropped between 2004 and 2010 by.about 20 percent from around 2000 and 2006. DHS reported that, in FY 12, new information system upgrades were accomplished to improve services. DHS reported that, since 2005, there has been the decline in the number of in person applications submitted. DHS reported that in FY 12, approximately 25 percent of the foreign nationals entering the United States illegally did so on a J-1 or a other temporary visa, whereas in 2000, it was closer to 50 percent. DHS also reported that, of the 600,000 immigrants coming in each year on immigrant visas, approximately 90 percent of these individuals come from Asia. DHS also reported that since 2005, 75 percent or more of the illegal immigrants submitted have been from China.

The Coast Guard identifies risks to its vital assets by using quantitative methods to measure reliability and vulnerability. It also tracks and evaluates its inventory of assets, both in use as well as in long-term maintenance condition. The Coast Guard established a process to classify all of the real property by tier and determined minimum investment targets to help maintain all mission-critical and mission-supportive systems with current and modern systems. Moreover, the Coast Guard uses this classification system to make decisions about which systems are most likely to be critical to the Coast Guard, and those that could be reduced in size. The Coast Guard recognizes that to maintain these systems, they have to invest in infrastructure improvements, which are typically done during and following each mission cycle. With the use of an asset management system, the Coast Guard determines the life cycle of its assets, which can span from 20 years and be longer. In February 2019, we found that most of the Coast Guard's real property, assets, and equipment were either outdated beyond the year 2018 or the maintenance life cycle was shorter than 20 years. In some cases, the Coast Guard has implemented adaptive equipment replacement programs to reduce the maintenance and upgrade costs in older systems. This adaptive program is currently operating as the Coast Guard has made the systems they use for search and rescue and other operations less expensive through their adaptive maintenance program. Moreover, the Coast Guard's adaptive program is one of the examples of innovative ideas that it has implemented to keep its older systems in better condition. For example, they have used technology to create new tools to replace existing tools that deteriorated and no longer worked. The Coast Guard has replaced older systems in search and rescue operations with adaptive products that can be used as long-term options.\nIn addition to Coast Guard's adaptive technology approach, and new construction and renovation projects for replacing older systems, there are other notable innovations the Coast Guard has undertaken. They have started using virtual simulators to replicate real-world scenarios for training their personnel in rescuing, repairing, and maintaining their systems. In February 2019, we found that all but one of the Coast Guard' systems are either under or currently being replaced with virtual simulators to help prepare personnel. In February 2019, we found that the Coast Guard was using virtual and augmented reality in the search and rescue mission. They are able to use augmented reality in virtual simulators to provide trainees with interactive, high-fidelity visuals of their environment, but in the real world, it takes some time to convert existing applications to an alternative form.\nIn addition, the Coast Guard is using innovative communications systems to improve connectivity, speed decision-making, and enhance the safety of personnel on the sea and its facilities. For example, it has implemented wireless systems at sea and air bases to enable better communications between ships, planes, boats, and helicopters. Additionally, the Coast Guard has been using advanced fiber networking systems that enable personnel to make decisions faster. They can use the network to detect abnormalities and assess system status while they are conducting their daily patrol duties.\nThe Coast Guard has also established innovative systems for detecting dangerous marine and terrestrial wildlife, tracking illegal substances or contraband of interest, and conducting search and rescue operations. For example, the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Rescue Subcrew in Cape May, New Jersey built a helicopter for this mission known as the Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cape May. The mission is primarily for search and rescue and other law enforcement tasks. It also is capable for conducting additional mission-support tasks such as countering criminal activity that is present on land, water, and in the air. The Coast Guard has also introduced virtual simulators and remote-televised simulators to train personnel on a variety of complex and diverse tasks for real-world scenarios. 12\nThe Coast Guard has even been experimenting with drone technology to aid in its various missions. The Coast Guard has found drone technology so adaptive, that it can be used for conducting search and rescue, monitoring waters for illegal fishing and other tasks. The Coast Guard has also been utilizing drone systems for maritime safety and security operations. In February 2019, we found that the Coast Guard's drone fleet had flown more than 4.5 million laps. Their goal is to increase this volume to allow for drones to be used for rescues and patrols\u2014the latter task is currently underway.\nIn each case, the Coast Guard has made substantial investments to leverage leading technologies and innovation\u2014and to integrate them with and into existing technologies\u2014which not only provides enhanced capabilities, but which can substantially reduce costs to better support operations and personnel. The Coast Guard's use of virtual simulators with 4G, internet connectivity on the sea and at shore provides additional benefits", "TEXT: BLS currently produces a number of different price indexes to estimate price inflation (see table 1) and applies a set of expenditure weights to derive the CPI-U and W indexes.

A program can fail or breach baselines that could result in a program suspension, penalties, or other remedies. DHS uses several mechanisms to manage and sustain acquisition program performance over their lifecycle, including the APB, a program manager, APB meetings, and program risk management plans. DHS also uses tools such as the Integrated Product and Engineering Toolbox and the DHS acquisition policy and management practices handbook to guide acquisition decision-making efforts. The DHS acquisition approach differs among the key components, which will be detailed below. For DHS\u2019 individual programs, details include major program office acquisition program manager in charge; program managers that act as coordinators and technical experts to their major end-users; program managers or their representatives that are responsible for programing and life-cycle management; and program managers or their designees that are assigned a specific mission within the DHS organization. DHS acquisition programs are unique in certain ways. DHS does not manage acquisition for individual missions, but rather DHS components manage for DHS components. Major DHS acquisition programs are reviewed by DHS at acquisition program levels. DHS requirements and guidelines are applied to acquisition of various components, including those of DHS components. DHS has several tools in place such as an Integrated Product and Engineering Toolbox (IPET), and Acquisition Life Cycle Tool (ALCT). Each DHS component has a major procurement office, known as the Major Component Acquisition Program Office (MCOP) that performs the development and management of their individual programs. However, the DHS acquisition process differs among the key components, which will be discussed in detail below. DHS acquisition programs are unique in several ways. DHS does not manage acquisition for individual missions but may manage individual missions within DHS components. DHS requirements and guidelines on major DHS components are applied to DHS acquisition of DHS components. DHS has developed tools such as the DHS APB, IPET, ALCT, and other tools for DHS acquisition management. DHS tools include the DHS Acquisition Management Information Tool (AIIT), Office of Acquisitions (OAU) and the DHS Acquisition Management Tool. DHS uses tools to manage and sustain acquisition program performance over their lifecycle, which includes program management, cost control efforts, risk management, life cycle management, and technical efforts. DHS also has tools such as the Office of Acquisition and Risk Management (OARM) and DHS\u2019 acquisition policy and management handbook handbook to guide acquisition decisions. DHS may apply unique approaches to DHS and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) business units across DHS components such as DHS management team for DHS components. DHS acquisition policy and practices are different and unique across DHS components that perform acquisition business functions. DHS has specific internal requirements in order to ensure compliance of DHS. Major DHS acquisition programs are unique in multiple ways as follows: DHS may not manage acquisition for individual DHS components but may manage individual DHS components throughout DHS. DHS requirements and guidelines are applied to DHS including DHS components. The DHS Acquisition Life Cycle Tool (ALCT) may be used to guide DHS acquisition management decisions. The Office of Acquisition and Risk Management (OARM) and DHS Acquisition Management Tool (AIIT) may be used to guide DHS and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) business functions DHS acquisition strategy differs across DHS components that perform DHS business functions DHS provides for the DHS Acquisition Management Tool (AIIT) DHS offers acquisition process support and training options DHS, DHS acquisition policy DHS\u2019 Integrated Product and Engineering (IPP) Tool DHS\u2019 risk-based management system DHS Acquisition Manager, Program Manager, and Mission Executive (PM) DHS has specific internal requirements that apply at acquisition business functions DHS may manage DHS and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) business units that perform DHS functions DHS will only manage acquisition business functions based in DHS Business and Support Units (BUS) DHS will only manage acquisition business functions for DHS business units that manage DHS mission-related resources DHS will only manage an acquisition program in DHS acquisition business models DHS is responsible for managing and sustaining the DHS Acquisition Management Tool (AIIT) DHS Acquisition Business Plan DHS Acquisition Business Plan DHS\u2019 Acquisition Life Cycle Tool (ALCT) DHS Acquisition and Risk Management (ARIF) process DHS may provide acquisition process support and training options DHS will be responsible for all DHS business functions related to the DHS\u2019 Acquisition, Integration, and Logistics (A&IL) portfolio DHS will use DHS business process management tools and processes to manage and sustain an organization\u2019s life cycle management processes DHS only manages DHS components DHS may also apply DHS tools outside the acquisition process DHS will not manage DHS business-related functions DHS will be responsible for DHS business-related functions.

The first part of the text summarizes the study\u2019s results of the study\u2019s methods and its use of data. The second part discusses the study\u2019s findings: air ambulance organizations are increasing their number of providers in response to the demands of the general public; the number of air ambulance base locations across the nation has increased, as has the number of base locations that have been involved in air ambulance services; hospitals and other facilities are generally paying less for air ambulance transports than patients in private insurance have typically been billed for these costly services (e.g., air ambulance transport costs are higher for some Medicaid patients compared to Medicaid payers); air ambulance operators generally pay higher costs for air ambulance transport than those charged for services by providers of other health care services as well as more than 50% of air ambulance providers in the country are in a position to expand their fleet size and also increase their geographic reach. In addition, more than 60% of air ambulance providers are in-network providers, however, only less than 50% of air ambulance providers were found to have payment plans in place; about 40% of air ambulance providers report that they have air ambulance transport volume that is higher than their current capacity; about 60% of air ambulance providers were reported to be able to handle 1,000 trips or 1,000 patients a year; half of the air ambulance providers reported that air transport was a low-profit enterprise, with a median annual net profit ranging from $10 to $100 per client. Finally, the text also summarizes information gained from the study\u2019s analysis of air ambulance providers\u2019 financial data from the financial filings of 8 Air Ambulance Providers. RELATED ITEMS: Air Ambulance Providers Financial Filings: A subset of air ambulance operators that use the National Air Ambulance service provider, AirMed International, was interviewed to determine the business and financial model of their service. A subset of air ambulance providers (about 20%) who provide services to a specific region and are not currently on the AirMed International service provider\u2019s network were interviewed separately to assess providers\u2019 views based on a variety of topics. They included the quality of service, how often they are asked to transport patients, and their views of a fixed-price model of air ambulance costs and the concept of \u201cair ambulance membership model.\u201d One additional survey was developed for the research project that was mailed to all Air Ambulance Providers in order to measure their views on the Air Ambulance Providers\u2019 use of air medical services. Air ambulance providers were identified by their participation in AirMed International, a 24 hr emergency and non-emergency medical service provided to medical facilities for all patients in the nation. AIR ambulances are commonly asked to transport patients by air ambulance providers, whose medical providers are paid for the services. However, the Air & Space Science Center at the National Institute of Aerospace Research (NASC) conducted a survey of 8,000 Air Ambulance Providers to determine which of air ambulance providers preferred to be added to AirMed International\u2019s service provider network. 8,800 surveys were mailed and then analyzed by the Air & Space Science Center at their site. The survey sought information about their customer business and their air ambulance practices. The air ambulance providers were evaluated on their customer and patient business practices by the National Air Ambulance Service Provider, AirMed International. This study was requested by the National Air Ambulance, which is AirMed International. The survey was mailed out to Air Ambulance Providers.

TE/GE is accountable for the tax compliance of approximately 2,500 tax-exempt organizations annually. An Exempt Organizations examination group monitors compliance activity of tax-exempt organizations of all sizes. The examination group uses classification (classification is an industry) to determine which type of audit is necessary for each tax-exempt organization. The Classification Committee decides on the type of classification for each tax-exempt organization using criteria which include the organization\u2019s financial status, type of tax-exempt reporting form submitted, other types of compliance activities, and its compliance activity history relative to compliance issues it has successfully addressed. The CP&G Operational Guidelines provide a standardized approach to compliance operations at both federal and state levels. Most tax-exempt organizations are required to prepare their own tax returns or file Form 990. Approximately 7,500 organizations for which Form 990-S is used each year are audited annually by CP&G. An Exempt Organizations Operational Guidelines Compliance Group is responsible for CP&G\u2019s daily operations. TE/GE\u2019s Exempt Organizations compliance staff are a combination of professionals with extensive expertise in tax-exempt organizations including accounting; tax; compliance and risk; risk analysis at tax payer level; healthcare compliance (e.g., medical care and pharmaceuticals); medical and insurance claims; medical insurance plan/payment plan/reimbursement accounts; tax compliance systems; IRS and state procedures and practices, IRS reporting requirements; self-insured plans (including self-insured health plans, health reimbursement arrangements, etc.); health insurance; individual self-care and preventative health screening; healthcare provider information; and data exchange/system/system access processes. TE/GE works with IRS\u2019 Compliance and Enforcement employees by communicating information regarding compliance requirements and tax-exempt organizations of varying size. They also answer questions posed to Compliance and Enforcement employees. Compliance & Guidance CP&G\u2019s tax-exempt groups include the Nonprofit Tax Compliance Institute (NTCI) (established in late 1980s); The Society of Certified Public Accountants (SCPA) (established in 1940); the Exempt Organizations Advisory Committee (EOAC) (established in 1980 to 1982); and the Exempt Organizations Tax Specialists Association (EOTSA) (established in 1992). CP&G is primarily responsible for tax-exempt organizations that are audited annually. For tax-exempt groups with less than $50 million in gross receipts and less than $500,000 in tax-exempt gross income, CP&G is responsible for determining whether an organization is tax-exempt. For tax-exempt groups that generate more than $50 million in gross receipts and $100 million in tax-exempt gross income, CP&G is responsible for determining tax-exempt status. Exempt organizations are tax-exempt organizations required to file Form 990 to file their financial statements with the IRS. CP&G is responsible for ensuring compliance by reviewing returns, identifying return discrepancies, determining tax eligibility and providing information necessary to the IRS. The Exempt Organizations Tax Specialists Association (EOTSA) is the primary provider of voluntary compliance services, including assistance with Form 990-N (the electronic filing for tax-exempt organizations). The Taxpayer First Act required tax-exempt organizations to electronically file Form 990 and/or Form 990-PF with a copy provided to TE/GE by a professional tax preparer or CPA. The act also mandated an independent tax-exempt organization to certify to the IRS that its information has been verified and that its tax-exempt status will be honored. A CP&G tax-exempt examiner will also review the data and determine if the information is accurate. CP&G has a comprehensive compliance operations manual, which covers a wide range of topics, including tax compliance requirements. CP&G also provides training and support to the Exempt Organizations Examiners and Compliance Specialists for tax-exempt groups. Exempt Organizations Tax Specialists Association (EOTSA) Provides tax-exempt organizations with additional free support and consultation services, such as tax compliance and reporting resources, and educational on how to navigate the nonprofit community. The Taxpayer First Act requires organizations that operate as a business or corporation to file a copy of Form 990-PF and return Form 990-P and other schedules to CP&G. The act also requires an annual verification process by the organization or its designated professional tax preparer to verify information reported by the taxpayer. Exempt Organization Verification process includes the following steps: \u2022 Verification of tax-exempt status by a tax professional for tax-exempt organizations and businesses reporting Schedule B to a tax preparer tax-reporting requirements \u2022 Determination of whether a professional tax preparer was used to", "American Samoa, an overseas U.S. territory, has a population of approximately 56,000. It exports a variety of fish and coconuts, but relies heavily on U.S. government aid for a significant portion of its revenue.

Figure 4: FEMA\u2019s emergency contracting workforce.", "The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is a federal law that imposes several financial reporting, gift, and other restrictions on political appointees. Although it does not mandate a complete audit as part of a financial review of the agency, OGE will review compliance across the organizations in its portfolio. The Act and the resulting regulations require reporting on certain transactions involving the purchase of public property, and certain gifts in excess of $200 or $10,000, depending on the value of the gift. Agency leaders and OGE have identified a number of potentially conflicting ethical obligations under the Act. One recent significant case involving a violation of the Act was the alleged acceptance and subsequent dismissal of a subordinate employee in a sensitive administrative position. The Supreme Court ruled in June 2003 that the Ethics in Government Act\u2019s core ethical obligations are not \u201cirrebuttable\u201d in an employee\u2019s view under this case. In that case, a federal criminal proceeding was set aside by the Supreme Court as impermissible, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the employee, in the absence of an express waiver, must be given the opportunity to exercise a complete defense before being prosecuted, even the death penalty cannot be \u201cirrebuttable.\u201d The criminal statute is the same in this case. In January 2017, OGE was requested to review the Ethics in Government Act\u2019s application to the agencies in the Interior Department. The Act generally requires the Secretary, Secretary\u2019s Council, and each of the executive branch OGs to establish an ethics system that applies to all employees of their organizations regardless of the position of each employee. On several occasions, OGE has explained that there is no absolute prohibition against an employee of a federal service serving at the pleasure of the appointing authority in the event of a felony conviction for any offense committed by the employee within the previous four years. However, OGE will require each agency to establish a financial review policy that will also include the Ethics-in-Government Act. Each OGE investigation also will include a financial assessment. In connection with this case study, OGE also assessed whether there were any cases involving the former Secretary of the Interior where the Ethics Act might have been breached. The case study included former Executive Secretary Cecil D. Andrews, and former deputy secretary H. Dale Magney, who had replaced Andrews in December 2019 before the case study was completed. Former deputy secretary of the Interior James A. Baker III testified before Congress that in the early part of his tenure, the Office of Financial Oversight and Economic Regulatory Compliance (now called the Office of Financial Enforcement of the Interior and the Environment) established a \u201cgift ban for personal purposes\u201d between his office and upper level management. When asked to expand on this, he did not explain the exception to his original ban. He was asked in multiple occasions during his testimony whether a gift rule existed for a political appointee. He could not produce any documentation for any gift he received. He explained that once he left the Interior Department in 2019, he had to go to the ethics office for guidance on any gift he received. He could not remember if he received any gift during his tenure at Interior. The former Assistant Secretary to the Interior, Michael Baca, also testified in November 2019. He was asked if 5 or 10 employees within the Interior OEO were found to have been breaking the gift ban rule. He had no data. He also testified that he did not have any instructions that could be considered a gift. For his entire tenure, he worked in OEO as an Ethics Division employee and, after the Government-wide Accountability Act took effect in 2010, he began working to design the Human Resources System. In response to OEG questions during a January 2020 interview with the former OEO Director at the time of OEO\u2019s transition into Interior OEO and Director of Ethics and Compliance at Interior-OEO, he explained that OEO had begun the design work that existed a comprehensive Human Resources Security Plan, which included specific provisions for gift and gratuity rules. OEO had also worked with Interior OEO to establish a comprehensive Financial Management Rules and Standards (FMRS). As the design stage ended, the final document was being fielded across the Interior Department. OEO established its human resources policies in 2019, at which time OEO provided comprehensive FMRS training to all employees. OGA was working on this subject in 1st quarter 2020, when OIA released its Office of Financial Report on Financial Management Practices. In the report, OIG recommended that Interior OEO should conduct comprehensive FMRS training after design approval of the FMRS and prior to completion of the entire project. OGA was reviewing the report when it was released (see Figure). OEA has identified numerous problems in existing systems, but the Interior Department Office of Ethics is the only OEO within which the OEA has been involved.

In 2018, there were 294,221 registered aircraft.", "A thorough review of section 961 at Dodd-Frank Act implementation at the Federal Government reveals that in general, control environments were dynamic. They were adaptive to agencies\u2019 changing objectives and risk environments, as were the control activities. The internal control effectiveness testing model used by agencies incorporated risk assessment as a dynamic part in the testing process. A control\u2019s test of risk tolerance and internal processing controls are used to assess the risk of the control environment. They are essential components of the effective internal control system. Most agencies evaluated testing procedures with their external auditors. In many instances, auditors found that systems did not meet their risk assessment needs. Agencies were generally successful in completing the implementation of control testing procedures, except for one agency (the Office of Thrift Supervision). Some agencies found that their external audits were lacking. Most agencies\u2019 risk assessments were performed as intended. The agencies found that the implementation of controls were an ongoing challenge, but for the most part controls were maintained throughout the Agency/program. In general, agencies felt that their existing systems met their design objectives. Agencies also generally found their implementation of testing procedures very difficult, and their external auditors found it challenging to complete their due diligence. Most agencies evaluated their internal control testing procedures with their external auditors on a regular basis. Management found that system errors, if they occurred, usually were corrected promptly. Most agencies were able to continue their testing process even with the COVID-19 pandemic. Most agencies had limited resources, and it was difficult for them to perform more frequent testing throughout the system. They generally maintained a system that provided for the timely completion of their annual internal control testing. Testing of risk tolerance and internal processing controls were also completed properly and timely. Most agencies found their risk assessments were completed timely. The Internal Control Team at each agency found the internal control activities were going well and generally performed well. They found one agency was struggling with its control over processes. This agency received additional resources to help them implement their internal control procedures. A test-of-purity for controls that tested 5 times or greater. More than one-half tested at less than five times while a few Agencies found 8-10 times per year testing was needed. Some agencies noted their internal financial reporting was limited to a few times a year. They found the Internal Control Team was functioning well. The Office of Thrift Supervision found that internal control processes were not meeting all their internal goals; therefore, the OTS decided they should be added to Appendix A, but they were found to be not meeting several of their OTAA annual requirements within the past two years. In general, agencies had good risk assessments, with exception for some agencies that had high risk assessment scoring on their annual assessment. This may have caused internal control activities to be more difficult than they should have been. Most agencies noted that the risk of error on processing was very low. Most agencies\u2019 risk management systems were in place. Each agency generally found that their internal programs were well managed and organized. \u201cMost agencies were able to accomplish their requirements using this OTAA model. While each OTAA is unique, they essentially can be categorized by their approach and results. The OTAA model allowed agencies to adapt their internal control system to their size, complexity, and objectives. The model allowed them to keep the internal control system in check while keeping it in line with the organization\u2019s objectives. OTAA testing procedures proved to be a cost-effective approach to internal control systems. Most agencies found they are well on their way to meeting their objectives in the OTAA model. They found that they have been able to adapt this model to their organization and structure. Furthermore, they realized that they were taking their risk tolerance process a step further than it existed in their implementation of the OTAA to ensure better controls were incorporated and a more robust environment. Some agencies reported they had a hard time communicating their control testing and risk assessment findings to their programs. Agencies also reported their employees were reluctant to perform internal control duties at their worksites. One agency noted the need to incorporate data on their \u201cout of control\u201d processes. Most agencies found that they were able to maintain adequate internal controls. Internal controls were most easily adapted where the organization structure was not as complex as those agencies where the number of units are being expanded. Agencies also found their internal control environment was being tested continuously and that their program has been updated over time to meet OTAA requirements. (1) Financial, procurement and administrative control over all external contacts and transactions; (2) Information technology and systems processing to ensure security controls and adequate data integrity controls; (3) Risk analysis \u2013 review for determining financial risks and strategies for managing financial risk; (4) Information Technology (systems processing) \u2013 review and audit procedures in the development, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of all internal control systems and applications used by the agency; (5) Allocation of resources \u2013 review the allocation of human and financial resources by reviewing their programs, processes, and practices.

These findings, based on research reviewed by the USDA, point to the importance of ensuring adequate nutrient intake, including vitamin A and C and essential fatty acids, not only to maintain general longevity but also to prevent or manage a variety of chronic diseases in older adults. CONTEXT: Older adults are an increasingly vulnerable and growing segment of the population, in the United States alone, and their demographic traits and health outcomes are largely dependent on the type of foods they consume and their nutrient intakes. The nutrition science community also recognizes the importance of individual nutrient needs of older adults, who may have distinct dietary habits in light of current scientific evidence. Research reviewed for this fact sheet found that elderly adults and older adults have greater risk for a variety of chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, that have an increasing prevalence every year. As the majority of older adults have chronic conditions, researchers and physicians alike are interested in determining the most appropriate treatments, such as dietary and nutrient guidelines, to help older adults receive the right amount of necessary nutrients to maintain a reasonable chance of surviving age-related chronic diseases. ==========================================================", "The Flood Risk Reduction Act establishes a federal flood insurance program to protect families, communities, and private property from potential damages caused by flooding. Communities are encouraged to adopt building codes and floodplain ordinances, mitigate flood heights with floodplain construction, and adopt cost-effective methods to manage flooding risk. Properties can be insured to provide coverage for flood damage, which includes property and contents up to $5 million, exclusive of other insurance and with deductibles typically in the range of tens of thousands. Flood insurance can be either a stand-alone product or part of a federally-backed private insurance policy. When the Flood Risk Reduction Act was finalized, about 200 communities were participating in NFIP, and through this program, about $16.5 billion dollars was distributed to municipalities, counties, and states as funding to build and maintain flood control structures. To get started on flood prevention and preparedness, visit FEMA\u2019s website or FEMA-Ready Community website at, or call 1-800-FFL-ASSIST (1-800-324-7321) to speak to a representative. This is a one-source reference for flood loss costs that can be a key indicator for flood mitigation.

Communities are encouraged to adopt building codes and floodplain ordinances, mitigate flood heights with floodplain construction, and adopt cost-effective methods to manage flooding risk. FEMA helps fund state and local floodplain management programs and community-level mitigation activities, including acquisition of susceptible development. Flood insurance premiums are discounted to reflect reduced flood risk resulting from community actions that meet three goals of reducing flood damage to insurable property, strengthening and supporting floodplain management, and encouraging a comprehensive approach to floodplain mitigation. The Flood Risk Reduction Act was finalized in 1993, impacting over 200 communities by 2000. Floodplain and flood risk mapping are two important components in helping communities prepare for and recover from a flood. The Flood Risk Reduction Act is a federal initiative that protects private property and related public infrastructure from flood damage. Communities can participate in the Flood Risk Reduction Program to help protect their property from costly flood damage. The goal is to enable local leaders and individuals to plan for and mitigate against possible loss of life and property due to flooding. In addition, FEMA provides funding, information, and engineering expertise to help communities develop and maintain floodplain and watershed infrastructure. FEMA-Ready Community website at or call FL-READY 1-800--324-7321 for more information. Floodplain and flood risk mapping are useful tools in preparation and recovery from natural disasters. The Flood Hazard Risk Analysis Tool allows access to floodplain mapping data, including information on floodplain and elevation elevations. FEMA coordinates an online tool, also known as the Personal Flood Hazard Estimate or Flood Risk Information System, for residents of participating communities. The Flood Risk and Recovery Planning Guide is a comprehensive guide on the principles and practices used in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from flooding. Communities can apply for funding and/or grants through the NFIP program, which works with local governments to administer floodplain management programs to protect properties that may experience flooding. The National Flood Insurance Program was adopted after floods devastated Southern California in 1994. A new and simplified National Flood Risk Information System was adopted in 2004 to serve the local communities. FEMA coordinates resources between communities and agencies as they seek to build resilience toward flooding. The FEMA Floodplain Mapping Program is a voluntary federal program, through which FEMA works with local jurisdictions to create and update floodplain mapping information. There are two primary types of mapping 1) floodplain mapping and 2) watershed mapping. Communities or public utilities, government agencies, and others involved in floodplain management or watershed protection. There are now 1,058 communities that currently participate in the program by obtaining flood insurance coverage. They will be provided floodplain mapping through the Flood Risk Mapping Program, as well as floodplain construction and maintenance for all floodplain properties. The National Flood Hazard Mitigation Act, enacted in 2012, authorizes floodplain management and other practices that build floodplains\u2019 ability to withstand flooding. NFIP, established in 1990, allows communities impacted by certain floods to obtain federal flood insurance protection\u2014including buildings, contents, and other eligible collateral property\u2014 if required to rebuild a damaged residence or business. There are a one-time or reoccurring eligibility requirement to receive flood insurance protection, and certain requirements may vary depending on the community and type of floodplain and building. Floodplain residents are required to purchase flood insurance coverage from a private insurance broker or from an authorized agent. The Flood Risk Model was created under the Flood Risk Reduction Act of 1993, providing free flood maps and floodplain information to local communities and", "Several significant issues continue to arise in the human rating study and SLS integration that cause delays in the program and raise concerns about SLS performance on certain tests. \u2022 SLS tests are failing on a regular basis as a result of a problem with the SLS core stage \u2022 Cost and schedule baselines for SLS and EGS have been significantly revised. \u2022 The EGS launch schedule is not a realistic target, and the EGS team reported it would need 1.5 years to complete all associated testing requirements to finalize launch plans. \u2022 The SLS is not performing very well in the testing program. Its ground tests at Zeroground have been a continuing issue in the program. Program managers are very concerned that SLS would be unable to meet its 2018 date for integration testing at the Kennedy Space Center as a result of continued development problems. SLS Testing. Several issues continue to plague the integration of SLS and EGS that threaten its completion. Problems that arise during integration tests at Zeroground cannot be attributed to test environment issues per se, but rather are associated with problems with the SLS equipment, systems, and integration interfaces. In June 2019, a series of test failures occurred during EGS testing. The failures affected two major components associated with human transport systems. One of these failures, a fire in the ALC-1 spacecraft mockup of a future crew module, could not be fully diagnosed and fixed by testing teams. It would require a new, unplanned test in the later summer 2018 timeframe if the problems with EGS tests could be resolved. Testing Schedule Changes. To ensure that the human rating study and SLS integration study are completed on time and without interference, the NASA Administrator agreed to the following recommendations: \u2022 By June 2020, NASA will provide a plan to mitigate the scheduling risk between the baseline established in the programs baselines in June 2017 and the Artemis-1 launch date of June 2020. In addition, NASA will also provide a plan for the program to reduce the risk of schedule extensions. \u2022 In early September 2019, NASA announced plans to establish a new, long-range evaluation program for the SLS. This is anticipated to involve multiple rocket launches for crew training, including NASA\u2019s first human transport mission. \u2022 The EGS team stated that additional time was needed to finalize the EGS test schedule. \u2022 In early August 2019, we reported that officials in NASA\u2019s Human Spaceflight Office felt it necessary to review the SLS and EGS program\u2019s integration testing timeline because of concerns with human hardware performance and its possible impact on the timeline of the EGS integration testing program. In August 2019, we also reported that the EGS program office has requested additional NASA resources\u2014specifically engineers and resources\u2014to prepare its infrastructure at Zeroground. However, no official request has yet been granted. Major technical challenges currently unresolved among various SLS, EGS, Integrated Operations Control System (IOCS), Launch Readiness Laboratory (LRL) and International Space Station (ISS) include: \u2022 A fire in the ALC-1 spacecraft mockup of a upcoming crew module. The cause is unknown and further investigation is recommended. \u2022 Scheduling issues identified during testing of the SLS integrated safety avionics system (ISAS) and the SLS EPGS (electronics health system). \u2022 In June 2019, the SLS Integration Testing Team reported a discrepancy in data from one of its SLS Integration System Tests (STST) of the spacecraft. The team stated it identified an incorrect value in one of the spacecraft sensors and recommended the removal and replacement of those sensors at the next pre-integration development review. The SLS Integration Test Article was removed from the orbiter during pre-INTEGRITY testing. SLS Testing. Since launching the EGS and crew transport in November 2018, the SLS testing program\u2019s integration teams have encountered problems in integrating the spacecraft and crew elements of the test article. In the first few weeks of June 2019, the EGS testing team observed problems with the test interface between the EGS and the SLS EPGS. The EGS and SLS Integration Testing Team reviewed the test data and identified that it appears the error could be resolved with a simple reconfiguration of some of the spacecraft electronics systems. During a follow-up SLS integration test in June, the team again observed EGS and EGS problems. The EGS and SLS Integration Testing Team reviewed the test data and determined that the issue could be resolved by reconfiguring some of the EGS electronics and updating some aspects of the interface between the EGS and SLS. Additionally, some of the EGS errors were of sufficient concern that a test article from which they occurred would be used in a future EGS flight test. The EGS team confirmed that the problems were not related to the E", "According to USDA, beginning with NSLP\u2019s authorization in 1946, an array of nutrition assistance programs have been utilized to meet food needs of the most vulnerable populations. Currently, eight programs are targeted specifically to children, with responsibilities including program planning and the identification, location, and supervision of in-school meal servers. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires agencies to estimate improper payments, implement measures to decrease improper payments, and report significant findings to Congress. USDA implemented recommendations from two reports to FNS and continues to work on strengthening school meal program integrity initiatives. For entities involved in program oversight, FNS may need to refine and strengthen guidance on oversight of local SFAs.", "CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFLO) is responsible for inspecting pedestrians, passengers, and cargo entering the United States via land POEs that are regulated. Traveler and passenger IDs are captured electronically, and a lookout is placed on suspicious travelers in TECS. Once processed, travelers can either proceed directly to the vehicle processing line or exit the primary area after providing a ticket and entering the secondary area. Primary. In the primary area for travelers on- foot, commercial vehicle drivers can pass through radiation portal monitors to detect radiation. If the vehicle does not pass through the radiation scan, it is directed to the secondary area where inspection occurs using a variety of scanners and detectors. During the inspection, travelers are required to move to the immigration processing line where a CBP officer will conduct an interview as well as a physical examination for explosives, and a background check by the Office of the Attorney General (OGE). At this checkpoint, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) officers typically conduct an inspection of personal belongings and may also provide a document of personal belongings to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) officers who are required to check a U.S. Citizen\u2019s documents, including passport. Upon the completion of the checkpoint, if U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) requirements are met, traveler must take his or her vehicle and baggage to the secondary processing area. At the secondary processing area, travelers must bring a gate pass to the inspection line where a CBP officer will conduct an interview, a background check by the Office of the Attorney General (OGE), and scan and document the traveler\u2019s documents to be forwarded to OISB in Washington, D.C. If the traveler fails the interview and OGE check, an administrative penalty may be imposed in addition to other penalties. In the secondary processing area, travel and border processing are integrated (see figure 4), and a traveler may either be processed directly inside the terminal, or continue with the walk around the vehicle and then exit for the secondary area. Typically to move to the secondary processing area, travel documents, commercial vehicle drivers, and pedestrian groups will enter the secondary processing area via pedestrian lines and vehicle lanes based on the vehicle\u2019s type (automobile, commercial vehicle, or pedestrian). The pedestrian line will be followed directly into the secondary processing area where the inspection will be conducted, followed by a secondary inspection by law enforcement. Pedestrians may then exit the secondary processing area when clear of all personal property. Pedestrians traveling in a commercial vehicle are required to enter or exit their vehicle at the designated check-in points. The process is repeated for all vehicles that require primary inspection. The CBP officer will conduct a document examination on the person\u2019s personal papers and a document check on his/her passport to determine whether it is genuine (see figure 5). Secondary. Once processed at the secondary area, travelers are required to enter a secondary processing area where the remaining documents are collected and an interview is conducted, followed by the secondary inspection by law enforcement. In this area, border and personal documents are collected, and travelers are permitted entrance into a commercial processing lane from which the driver may exit. The process is repeated for all vehicles that are required for secondary inspection. In the case of an invalid travel document, a traveler may be required to go through the primary processing area (see figure 6) or may be flagged at the exit of the secondary processing area. If an invalid travel document is found at the exit of the secondary processing area, the traveler is required to exit and go through primary processing. In this case, travelers who have been processed at the secondary processing area and those who cannot be processed in that location are given instruction to proceed to the exit of the secondary processing area to the exit of the secondary processing space where CBP personnel will continue the examination. Once processed, travelers are allowed to enter the vehicle processing lane where they are permitted to drive in the direction marked on their car, to a vehicle processing lane, a parking lot, or the parking lot gate. In addition to the interview and criminal check, the secondary processing area includes a document examination by border officer, the U.S. Passport acceptance point, and the OISB processing offices as explained above. Additionally, a U.S. citizen can submit his/her documents from home, and the documents can be submitted at a drop-off location, to be submitted to OISB. The processing time for entering a commercial vehicle, including the interview on top of any other document checks, is generally about an hour. If secondary inspection is performed, an average processing time of 3 to 4 hours is generally required. This process is repeated for all vehicles that require processing. (See figure 7 for an example of how the document review process works at the secondary processing area.) Customs Processing. Travelers can either proceed directly to the secondary processing area to undergo the secondary inspection or continue to", "Despite substantial investment, some federal IT initiatives are struggling. Agencies can best succeed by consolidating data centers, improving transparency, and taking steps to enhance IT governance. Our work at the Office of Government Accountability Foundation supports this approach. -Download Now", "We identified 7 federal programs that provide child care assistance for low-income students to provide the most inclusive summary of child care affordability in relation to educational resources to the federal government. In order to accurately identify the programs\u2019 goals, we categorized them into five sub-groups: early-childhood education, child development, child care, K-12 education, and higher education. 2019 Report to Congress: Early childhood education in the United State continues to grow, but the field has not kept pace to provide early child care access. Child care and development is among the hardest for states to fund. Child care quality and access is of particular importance among families and children that often face barriers that limit their availability to child care resources. Early childhood education is linked to many positive outcomes including higher incomes, better physical health, and more positive child development. In this Report, we argue that child care costs have grown disproportionately in relation to wages and the cost of providing education at institutions colleges and universities. In order to better understand child care costs, we are also looking at the financial assistance families receive to help pay for child care and are finding that families often cannot fully help pay for child care costs. While parents are finding it increasingly difficult to provide adequate child care, most are still working despite many challenges. The federal government, which has been supporting early education and child care since the 1950\u2019s will now need to continue to support a field that has grown enormously over the past 13 years. A combination of child care and education subsidies and subsidies to help provide child care will be needed to maintain the access to opportunity of all children in the United States. 1. Introduction The Child Care Report: Evidence-based research into child care costs and child development outcomes are in dire need. In a country of wealth, America has an extraordinary struggle with child care costs. In this Report, we review the current state of child care affordability in light of these disparities. Child care in most other countries is more affordable and more readily available than in the United States. Access to and the affordability of child care has diminished since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. In addition, a large portion of the child care workforce has relatively low educational and earnings levels. Over 75% of child care employees have an associate degree or some college, while almost 75% were child care teachers. Half of the child care workforce does not have access to basic benefits, such as child health care services. Child care costs continue to grow exponentially in relation to wages. In 2017, the cost of child care for lower-income families has grown more than 18%, which has almost doubled since 2001. In all of the country over the past two decades, child care costs have increased by about 300 percent. When children are young, their greatest challenge is survival and they require more extensive supports for their child development. As children grow older, child care becomes less of an objective, and families may be facing financial challenges related to child care. To better understand how parents are finding it to provide child care costs\u2014whether through access to health care, and child care\u2014we examined how child care spending has changed. We found that in 2013, child care costs for families with children in child care is around 50 percent of their income. The greater cost of child care can act as a barrier for families and children to access higher levels of education or higher paying jobs. In this Report, we examine the financial assistance families receive to help pay for child care costs versus the type of child care they choose. We also examine trends in child care eligibility, including whether the costs of child care and education can affect a family\u2019s access to child care and health care services. Additionally we are examining why parental leave has not kept pace with maternity leave in the past three years. In 2013, parental leave averaged around $1.5 billion dollars, while by 2016, it was around $2.3 billion dollars. Many states have not seen wage growth since the last recession. A family that earns under $1,000 per week for the parent is considered low income. However, a family with children needs to be able to generate $2,500 per week for child care and family expenses. The cost and quality of health care is of particular concern to families. Approximately 60 percent of families who need a health care provider for themselves may face out-of-pocket costs that exceed $300 per month. Child care costs vary greatly by region. New York, the most populous state in the country, spends $17,000 per year on child care for a four-year-old child. In contrast, Hawaii spends $25,000 per year per child. We found that in nearly all of the children\u2019s early childhood programs the costs per day for one child is less than $5. We also found that the costs for child care, and child care programs were becoming increasingly centralized. The cost of", "The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency is accountable for the lead role in responding to disaster events, and that lead role extends to state and local governments. These responsibilities include coordinating with 22 other federal agencies to implement the National Response Framework, including identifying critical resources\u2014personnel and property resources\u2014to meet the needs of local government entities, as well as private entities, such as utility companies and construction firms. Many federal agencies, including those from the military and federal law enforcement organizations, are involved in the disaster response. In addition to responding with their own staffs and resources, state and local governments can provide additional critical support. In particular, staff from those local governments can assist FEMA. Staffing resources are required when responding to multiple disasters and a federal government\u2019s own staff requirements make it necessary for federal assets to also engage critical resources. Staff from that local government can provide logistical support in responding events. Although funding does not remain permanent long-term, assistance is available on an ongoing basis via the President\u2019s Disaster Declaration as well as Public Law 93-288, Emergency Disaster Relief Act. Funding comes from multiple sources, including grants, loans, federal loans or other federal funds, and funding from companies and government agencies. FEMA is responsible for coordination not only between federal partners (including the Treasury Department), state, and local governments, also with the private sector and other non-federal organizations. During the response, FEMA responds to requests for assistance from state and local governments, including providing critical resources, such as emergency communications and essential supplies, and resources to meet various safety and protection needs, housing and medical care. Assistance is also offered during post-disaster clean up, as well as long-term recovery efforts, and in response to other crises or threats to public safety, such as hazardous materials. FEMA is not limited to emergency assistance, however. FEMA also provides assistance to support a wide range of activities, including emergency construction of public buildings, or even to replace a damaged or destroyed public structure (e.g., bridges). FEMA is responsible for the long-term funding of this type of infrastructure work, either by FEMA or grants from other sources. FEMA is not limited to public infrastructure; the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for all building and construction funding. FEMA has the authority to grant federal disaster or emergency property assistance grants. During the response, a large range of additional responsibilities are performed for homeowners and residents, such as providing emergency funds directly under the individual assistance program, assisting a victim in filing -12-\nSustainability Practices for the U.S. Government, Office of the U.S. Government Federal Employee Safety and Health Council (FEST, Federal Employees and Sick and Injured Fund) is responsible for handling employee medical assistance, which includes emergency services and health care. The Federal High Way Emergency System (FHES) is responsible for managing emergency medical services, ambulance and emergency response units. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which operates a system of general aviation terminals across America, is also required to provide emergency medical transportation from an FAA Medical Officer into medical facilities (e.g., the 911 system). The Health and Human Services Emergency Medical Assistance and Patient Treatment Emergency Program Act authorizes states to establish their own grant programs for individuals. All the above Federal organizations participate in and share data in order to carry out their responsibilities. As FEMA and its government partners continue to respond and assist in emergency and recovery efforts, the demand on FEMA has been unprecedented and the level of assistance required and complexity of the response has been large scale. As stated, FEMA\u2019s role in mass care, including providing shelter and medical 13 assistance, support to essential goods such as power and water, or other public services such as a local hospitals, is in keeping with the principles set forth in its 2011 National Response Plan. The National Response Plan was adopted in accordance with a legal requirement to establish a coordinated response to provide a unified federal effort for all emergency response assistance. The law defines \u201cEmergency Assistance\u201d as \u201cany response that is not covered by the other elements of FEMA\u2019s response, including response during special events, including special events that adversely affect an essential element of public service. When a request is made to FEMA for assistance and FEMA does not identify medical or emergency response elements within the request, FEMA is authorized to provide those elements or provide emergency medical care or other related assistance or services. When FEMA responds to a request from a state or local governmental entity, FEMA\u2019s assistance is deemed to be a \u201cpublic assistance\u201d program and the FEMA funding for this category of assistance is subject to restrictions.\u201d The requirements of this definition of \u201cEmergency Assistance,\u201d as well as FEMA's responsibility to provide emergency medical care, are further elaborated. FEMA was not limited to an emergency response, but that required an emergency declaration to assist those impacted by Hurricane Wilma. As you saw above, FEMA also provided housing and temporary shelter for displaced citizens, assisted with rebuilding community infrastructure (", "This text discusses a U.S. government program called the Nuclear or Radiological Detection and Analysis Program, designed to assist states, large cities, and territories to detect and report nuclear or radiological materials from unauthorized sources.

In addition, in addition to requiring air carriers to implement existing requirements, directives also can require the implementation of additional security measures in place of existing measures during specified time periods. Our analysis indicates more than 50 percent of the directives pertain to threats-driven directives, with foreign airports\u2019 vulnerability affecting more than half of the directives. It should be noted that the duration of each directive is a variable that can vary over time.

However, due to the variety of situations and incidents involved, it is difficult to provide an exact number of incidents. The methods agencies use to counter threats and assaults include deploying additional law enforcement officers and utilizing multiple organizations and levels of law enforcement. Agencies also build relationships with other law enforcement entities to create coordinated responses and countermeasures. Additionally, employees are provided with basic safety training, which is designed to help them protect themselves when engaging with the public.

Examples include schemes involving misrepresentation of the price of goods or the quantity of goods, misrepresentation of the type of goods being sold, or false invoices. These schemes can be used both to avoid taxes or to move money that is the product of criminal activities, between countries or within countries, using the laundering of assets as the principal mechanism. This type of crime is becoming increasingly complex as technology has allowed for more sophisticated laundering schemes and a wider range of criminal activities can now result in a TBML scheme, including criminal activities involving cryptocurrency. In these types of criminal activities, different types of payments can be used, including cryptocurrency that is used as an instrument of the transaction. The type of crime and the type of payments are becoming more complex as technology facilitates criminal activity. While technology has made it easier to launder assets in TBML schemes, criminal organizations need new methods to launder profits in order to maintain their operations and financial activity. METHODS USED: Methodological triangulation was used to provide consistency in the data used for this analysis and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the material discussed herein. RESULTS: TBML by its nature involves an individual person (criminal) or the entity they have set up to launder the money on the one side of the transaction is no other person including their parents, spouses, and children. Consequently, criminal activity is a significant proportion of the profits earned in TBML. The analysis by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Inspector General showed criminal activity accounts for over 70% of all transactions in some of the major TBML schemes. Methods used in these criminal activities by TBML offenders can range in complexity from simple transactions of one to a few payments which are disguised as travel expenses. In the most complex criminal operations, money laundering and large payments can be accomplished in multiple stages of payment processing. These criminal organizations often use multiple entities to carry out their transactions and launder the funds or other proceeds. Furthermore, these criminal organizations and their individual money launderers will use various methods or techniques to launder their funds, such as using an intermediary person or entity to mask their source of income. TBML can also be used to launder assets or profits, such a money laundering criminal enterprises have to launder money in ways that match the type of assets that they hold in their criminal enterprises. Another way a criminal organization can launder their profit, not discussed herein, is by using a shell company in a foreign country to launder the money earned in their criminal enterprise so that it appears as though this money was not earned in the country where the criminal organization has been indicted. TBML can be used to launder money in any currency even through exchanges. These global networks are increasingly complex such networks as the one operated by a former Israeli Defense Minister, Ehud Barak in their operations against a potential nuclear threat. These networks often involve multiple individuals or entities to launder income or value from their criminal operations. Ultimately, the analysis of TBML data by DHS OIG showed that criminal networks that launder criminal activity often have complex networks of individuals including multiple legal entities that launder the funds. This criminal activity has been used by criminal organizations to launder profits in billions of dollars around the globe. Examples of this type of financial crime included the laundering of proceeds from illegal cannabis sales. The criminal networks have been involved in laundering over $100 billion in illicit proceeds from cannabis sales in which multiple countries were involved and their criminal networks are interconnected through various criminal financial intermediaries. These criminal networks are designed to launder criminal proceeds out of their jurisdiction of origin and can be located anywhere in the world as criminal networks are often global. 5.4% of all individuals involved in TBML operations. These criminal networks also have different methods of laundering their illicit proceeds. One common method used by criminal organizations was using online payment systems, such as Bitcoin, which can be utilized to transfer the money in large quantities. Financial networks were not analyzed by DHS OIG because of lack of data pertaining to their use in TBML. Another criminal activity involved the use of global banks to launder criminal proceeds. One example of this is when criminal networks launder money through their online shopping companies. Criminal networks are able to launder criminal activity proceeds into a legitimate online marketplace even though some of their transactions, transactions are still subject to bank fees. Criminal networks often launder their illicit proceeds from these stores in large amounts. Criminal activity in this type of shopping is known as transnational organized purchase. Criminal networks involved in these criminal operations have been designed, 17,000 criminal network financial transactions and 21,000 criminal network payments involving the payment of illicit proceeds. DHS OIG found that criminal networks often use multiple methods in order to launder their criminal funds, including buying legitimate goods to hide their illicit funds; buying and selling of assets of legitimate businesses in order to launder criminal proceeds generated from the activity; making payments to businesses or", "AT&T has an overarching approach that includes three phases. Phase 1 (2015 to 2018) focuses on the core, transport, and core-backhaul elements of the network design. These infrastructure components provide national coverage, allowing rural and outlying areas to have access. Phase 2 (2018 to 2022) focuses on regional and high-population density markets, the latter having regional coverage from North to South. This phase includes additional network infrastructure elements\u2014access to fixed and deployable \u201cdeployable\u201d assets, such as in a transportation vehicle, to provide network coverage in remote areas. In addition, AT&T agreed to provide deployable cellular assets in a total of 24 states. The remaining third phase of the design process is the nationwide backhaul. After being designated the nationwide backhaul provider in 2018, AT&T is working to deploy fiber-optic infrastructure, build and upgrade key network facilities, and deploy additional fixed and deployable equipment nationwide.

The agency had previously been required by Congress to develop strategies related to challenges facing the U.S.-flag fleet and to develop U.S.-flag maritime strategies, and DOD/DOT officials agreed that DOT should complete the maritime strategy on time. We identified several challenges facing U.S.-flag vessel competitiveness, including challenges in maintaining employment and wages, and in attracting U.S.-citizen mariners, which, in turn, would address long-term viability of American-flagged vessels. Since DOT had been working on the strategy since August, we recommended that they meet their goal before Congress extended the current extensions of the deadline.

WOSB PROGRAM OBJECTIVES We previously reported on the WOSB program\u2019s objective of ensuring that WOSB firms are able to compete to receive and retain Government contracts and subcontracts. A key factor in the SBA\u2019s success in achieving these objectives is to provide technical assistance to business development centers (BDCs) to help businesses understand the WOSB program requirements and how their business can meet them. However, our analysis did not identify the specific number of BDCs that SBA offers to a business owner to have the opportunity to receive technical assistance. Our previous reports have shown various weaknesses in the certification process and reporting requirements, including the limited ability to identify fraud, the lack of information provided to businesses, difficulty in verifying information provided by a business about technical assistance from the BDC, and inconsistencies between eligibility and certification requirements. We also found that SBA did not effectively address business growth needs that result from a decline in contracts due to a lack of continuous funding. Consequently, we found that an inadequate amount of business development funding resulted in the lack of WOSB firms in SBA\u2019s database and the inability to assess their financial stability and other business needs. We found that the certification process for WOSB firms can be lengthy and the required documentation can be onerous. Similarly, SBA has inadequate reporting procedures for verifying the eligibility of WOSB program participants. With the WOSB program facing an overall decrease in participation that occurred at its inception, with only a few thousand WOSB firms currently registered, we found that the program has not effectively addressed the issue of the relatively low rates of participation of WOSB firms. Similarly, the annual eligibility examination requirement was established in 2014 and has continued for five years. However, our analysis found that WOSB firms do not have access to this important tool in some cases. Instead, in many instances, new WOSB firms receive in-person assistance from a BDC, and the SBA must verify their eligibility before allowing them to submit a WOSB certification package. This process, in its current state, does not effectively serve WOSB firms and does not keep pace with the rapidly changing technology and communication markets that have emerged. Additionally, SBA is not systematically identifying and communicating information to the WOSB program-participating firms or to WOSB program applicants regarding any new business development funding opportunities. WOSB Program Implementation Challenges WOSB program implementation deficiencies reported in our previous report include lack of proper guidance to businesses on eligibility and certification requirements, failure to properly analyze and act on fraud risks, failure to provide proper oversight with annual onscreen examination of a firm\u2019s eligibility, and limitations in WOSB program funding. WOSB INQUIRIES A survey of businesses that received program-specific guidance from the WOSB program as well as on- or off-site technical assistance from BDCs was also conducted. The survey asked businesses for written feedback regarding each BDC event and whether they found their interactions with the BDC to be helpful when a business developed new or additional business resources. With 200 WOSB firms that are registered to participate in the WOSB program, WOSB program participants have not experienced any recent changes of a BDC\u2019s services or their frequency with their WOSB program participation. In July 2019, all 12 WOSB BDCs that report to SBA to maintain WOSB program data reported that the annual fee to participate in these activities had increased. The most recent reports available indicate that their current cost was about $5.4 million per year, or approximately 12 percent of their annual WOSB certification fees. BDC services accounted for approximately 5 percent of all WOSB-registered firms. The 18 WOSB BDCs currently receiving SBA WOSB program grants have reported in our analysis, 11 years after the implementation of this initiative, that they report no evidence that business development activities are meeting SBA\u2019s criteria for performance. While the data we were able to analyze on WOSB program performance is somewhat consistent and appears to be declining, our review of the WOSB program\u2019s overall impact could be better. Since SBA\u2019s WOSB program has operated since December 2014, we are seeking to obtain some additional information, such as data on the number of new businesses joining the initiative. However, our initial findings were significantly limited by funding constraints in the WOSB program. At the $5 million in current annual federal funding for WOSB program, we have found that a program in which the number of WOSB firms in registration has decreased each year since the program\u2019s conception could potentially be impacted in its ability to provide necessary technical assistance. We also have concerns about the WOSB program\u2019s ability to reach and maintain all W", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that it does not have any property, goods, or other tangible personal property or funds that it adminises.

In keeping with VA\u2019s long-standing mission to provide quality health care services to qualified U.S. veterans, in 2018 VA began taking steps to transition some of their medical care services to community providers authorized by VA\u2019s Community Care Programs (VCHP) to provide convenient and timely medical management. To be aligned with Veterans Community Care Program(VCCP) for which VA received appropriations for FY 2015, VA began to transition some medical care services to preferred and authorized outside providers beginning July 1, 2018. The VCCP allows veterans and their families to access a broad array of civilian medical resources. Veterans may use these services by appointment or \u201con demand\u201d whenever they call. Many of them, however, choose to use VA\u2019s services primarily by visiting VA hospitals and medical care facilities that provide free medical care and a comprehensive range of services. VA\u2019s goal is to continue providing an integrated and quality veteran care system by increasing its VCCP with new civilian medical providers, while maintaining the quality and scope of medical services provided to eligible veterans.

Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program provide health care services to eligible individuals with very low incomes. This program has also included outreach to women veterans; individuals with medical-related disabilities, those recovering from medically related injuries from service, those who have experienced traumatic brain injuries, and other medical conditions.

Health Care Provider Directory Search for a local veteran/patient care centers or providers. The VCCP may include some medical groups and other non-VA organizations which are selected for their ability to provide appropriate health care services to veterans in a specific local community. A veteran may be authorized to access VCCP services as part of a visit to a VA hospital or medical care facility where the doctor sees the patient during the visit or at a clinic where the patient may choose to make an appointment. However, the program may also cover veterans who make a \u201con demand\u201d appointment with a civilian medical provider. The VCCP provides health care services to eligible veterans living in urban and rural areas throughout the United States. VA is responsible for administering the VCCP. There is currently no VCCP provider network, and VA relies on a wide array of other civilian medical providers. A physician is authorized to be consulted solely by a civilian medical provider in accordance with the OMMT or OMM. The initial consultation fee is waived for veterans. If the practitioner chooses to refer a patient from VA to a civilian medical provider, the provider may still charge the patient a consultation fee. There are no standard service elements that are required by VA, and fees are determined in accordance with the negotiated fee schedule between VA and the civilian medical providers. VCCP is no longer a program that provides direct VCCP care to eligible veterans and their families, rather the VCCP now facilitates a more coordinated and coordinated patient referral system. VA is collaborating on its efforts to provide 360\u00b0 health care to veterans. All VA care facilities and health care providers are now in the VCCP. Veterans can schedule a \u201con demand\u201d appointment at a civilian medical provider and VA will pay the fee, as long as the \u201con demand\u201d appointment is within a medical facility of a VA hospital. If necessary, some civilian medical provider sites at the VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia and the Veterans Treatment Center in Minneapolis have extended their service hours specifically for patients that are in the VCCP.

Floods are the most common natural disasters in the United States. Some 23 million properties have purchased flood insurance through FEMA\u2019s Community Assistance Program. In 2008, FEMA implemented a voluntary program recognizing FEMA-enabled communities that exceed the NFIP requirements. Over 70% of floodplain management activities in cities and towns are due to FEMA aid. By 2017, nearly 71% of all flood insurance policies issued in the United States were written with CRS communities. CRS classes are arranged based on the number of flood insurance purchases issued per capita and the goals of a community\u2019s floodplain management activities. Special flood hazard areas are targeted for NFIP improvements. Communities can group themselves to CRS, and can benefit financially through NFIP premiums. Communities can upgrade floodplain management measures for new properties purchased in certain CRS classes through the CRS program. CRS goals are flood protection, increasing public awareness of floodplain management, and insurance aspects of NFIP. Communities that purchase NFIP coverage have 30 percent of the maximum floodplain map and FEMA aid of up to $30,000 if homes are substantially damaged. The minimum requirements for CRS are 25 percent of new construction and 50 percent of existing structure coverage. New NFIP floodplain maps are completed every 10 years, and by 2021, nearly 10 percent of the United States will have been mapped by FEMA. Approximately 44 percent of all flood insurance policies written in the United States in 2015 were written with CRS communities. CRS ratings are voluntary to reward CRS communities that move forward with their floodplain management. These three goals: reducing flood damage to insurable property, protecting new buildings, and supporting floodplain management aspects of NFIP, all contribute to making NFIP a long-term solution for flood protection.", "ESG factors in ESG standards such as Regulation S-K are becoming increasingly important to investors, even though it is now generally acknowledged that their impact on financial performance is not significant.

Although the Navy approved the VH-92A program, their costs were driven up with the need for a replacement helicopter. In the case of the VH-92A, the program experienced high costs and performance issues, making it difficult to keep pace with the Navy's timeline of delivery for the in-product modification phase. To rectify the situation, the program was able to reduce its costs by exercising the Lot ll option for an extended period. The Marine Corps\u2019 acquisition strategy changed the number of years for the low-rate initial production and the size of the full-rate production runs, with the goal being to make the program more efficient. By doing so, the Navy could achieve operational readiness of its new helicopter sooner. KEY TAKEAWAY: In order to keep the project on track after the program was restructured, the program office was able to perform a timely briefing to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy to gain approval for the new lot. This decision enabled the program to keep its cost per helicopter under budget while ensuring the Navy achieved operational readiness of its new helicopter as soon as possible.\nThe Marine Corps needed to replace aging helicopters as part of their broader modernization plan. The program encountered both technical and cost challenges with the delivery of the VH-92A, prompting a review of the program. Upon restructuring, the program successfully increased efficiency and minimized associated costs. A key reason for restructuring the program was the need to buy additional lots of helicopters each year to prevent a lengthy schedule deviation.", "Preparations for hurricane recovery must begin as soon as possible if they are to be implemented in a cost-effective manner. In addition, preparations should include a multi-year comprehensive plan to mitigate energy, environmental, and socioeconomic hazards. With respect to the electricity transmission grid, infrastructure may include transmission and distribution power lines, transformers, poles and wires, and substations. The utility could also be involved in recovery measures, such as providing temporary power generation units and/or distribution and transmission circuits, both to support restoration and to provide critical backup power for key functions or to restore public safety services. Additional resources, such as telecommunications capacity and related infrastructure, will be needed to restore critical public, safety, and commercial networks. A thorough review of the electricity infrastructure can help ensure successful recovery. Similarly, the power grid should be re-established in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective. Power must be restored expeditiously as people may need power for jobs and to support critical social services. Power can be provided by generators or by alternative energy sources. The use of solar panels for power generation offers the potential for significant cost savings. Similarly, generators can be used to support microgrids for remote locations or for the use of solar or other renewable sources. In Puerto Rico, the electrical grid is comprised of transmission and distribution power lines that are supplied by the utilities to their customers. The transmission lines can carry power from multiple generators along the path of the grid from generation back to distribution in the customers' homes or business locations. As of our latest update (from a November 2018 USF Geology study), the electrical transmission lines that span Puerto Rico are comprised of transformers, poles, and wires. Several hundred miles of cable conduit along the path of the transmission power lines may be replaced or replaced with other types of cable, depending on the cost of repairs. In addition, the existing transmission power lines can support additional energy capacity, such as the use of power lines for solar or other renewable energy sources. The transmission power lines are typically located well below the highest point in the community of the transmission power lines, in order to minimize the visual impact and the risk of damage when a tornado or hurricane occurs. Transmission lines also serve additional purposes, such as supplying fiber optic networks for Internet and telecommunication service. Transmission infrastructure must be reconstituted or modified to ensure that it can continue to provide adequate power supply to customers. The USF Geology study identifies several transmission lines across Puerto Rico that are at risk of damage during a hurricane due to their low elevation. The main transmission lines that run in underground tunnels can be difficult to maintain. The Geology USF Geology report identifies transmission line improvements necessary to maintain the power transmission systems after a hurricane. Several hundred miles of cable conduit will likely need to be replaced or replaced with alternative cable. New transmission lines can also be used to support additional energy capacity. For example, lines can be used to wire solar or other renewable energy sources. Transmission power lines in Puerto Rico are typically placed several feet below the highest point of the transmission power lines in order to minimize damage. While transmission lines also serve additional purposes, such as supplying fiber optic networks for internet and telecommunications, transmission lines will have to be reconstituted or modified in order to continue to provide adequate power supplies to customers. In particular, the USF Geology report identifies several transmission lines that are at risk of damage during a hurricane due to their low elevation. A total upgrade of these transmission lines would be required to maintain power transmission systems after a hurricane. The upgrades would be costly, with new transmission lines likely requiring USF Geology recommends transmission lines would be required to maintain power transmission lines after the destruction of the existing transmission power lines in Puerto Rico. In order to support customers, the USF Geology study also identifies transmission lines that were at risk of damage during a hurricane due to their low elevation. Several hundred miles of cable conduit along the path of the transmission power lines may also be reconfigured or replaced. In addition, the transmission power lines may serve additional purposes, such as providing fiber optic networks, so re-modelling is essential. These transmission lines are costly to upgrade and need to be replaced or replaced with alternative cable. The transmission lines are at risk of damage during a hurricane Due to their low elevation. Transmission lines can also serve additional purposes, such as wiring solar or other renewable energy sources. TRANSMISSION LINES SHOULD BE IN PROGRESS NOW DURING RECOVERY FROM THE HURRICANE 2017, USF recommends upgrading transmission lines to maintain power transmission system after a hurricane. Transmission lines that are in danger during a hurricane are essential for modern telecommunications networks, since cables that are located in the ground usually remain in place during extreme weather. To minimize the damage and minimize their restoration costs, the transmission lines should be upgraded or replaced after the loss of a major hurricane. Transmission lines that remain in place can help ensure that power is restored quickly after a hurricane, and it is essential to make them physically strong and robust in order", "The National Biodefense Strategy and its associated plans brought together existing biodefense efforts within the federal government, with significant consequences for the government\u2019s approach to enterprise-wide biodefense. The Strategy and plans were developed with extensive government oversight, including development and a data call with all the agencies listed in Figure 1 in order to document the size and scope of each agency\u2019s biodefense activities, which is important because agencies have had different approaches to data collection. The challenges in data collection and analysis are expected to be iterative and adaptive to the needs of the agencies and their program staff. Agencies have the most expertise in the first-year data collection step, which could lead to more efficient and precise data analysis in subsequent years. Agencies can commit to using the results of the current data collection period to adapt their implementation to the needs of changing public health threats. Agencies must also make clear to each other if they have completed the data collection process and understand the limitations and use of the data they have received.

Costs, including printing, mail and other services, totaled approximately $9 billion ($12.3 billion to be exact), up from the more than $7 billion in similar service costs in 2006. According to the Bureau, the 2020 Census will incur approximately $10 billion in printing costs. The 2020 Census also will have a cost of approximately $3.8 billion attributable to the legal challenges involving the citizenship question this Census cycle. In addition to the $15.3 billion overall estimate, the Bureau is on schedule to incur additional costs, of about $9 out-of-pocket expenses. However, since 2010 the cost of non-response and re-mailing has declined significantly. Overall, Census costs have been steadily increasing over the past 40 years. For example, at the time of the 1970 Census the Bureau had about 5.4 employees for the Census Enumeration and Statistical Programs unit. In 2018 the unit was employing about 19,000\u201420,000 employees. Thus, the number of people involved in each Census is growing exponentially higher. The Bureau\u2019s largest cost categories for each Census cycle are printing and mail services. In 2010, printing costs were equal to about $1.7 billion. By the 2030 Census the Bureau is projecting to spend roughly $4 billion on printing costs every three years. The cost of printing and mailing will remain roughly in that amount for each Census cycle (a total of $19 billion) including the 2020 Census. The biggest overall cost is the $8 billion in mailing costs the Bureau estimated for this Census. The Bureau currently estimates that costs for the 2020 Census will be between $19 billion and $25 billion, which would be down in 2010 from the previous estimation of about $25 billion\u2014which suggests costs were significantly underestimated. The 2020 Census will be the most costly in history, spending over $14 billion. The costs of printing and mailing have remained roughly the same cost-per-respondent as in the past, for approximately $300 per respondent. 2020 Census Costs (Excluding Costs of the Census Decennial Census (C3)) (in millions of dollars) Census in 2020 2020 Census costs (excluding costs of Census 2010) Approximately $10 billion approximately $15 billion Additionally, approximately $3 billion was set aside by Congress for the cost of printing and mailing, which is larger than any amount that is currently on record for printing costs per Census.

Agencies are required to: (1) develop and maintain a work schedule and job requirements for the ICT workforce necessary to conduct the work of the agency and maintain work-life balance; and (2) develop a human capital management system including a capability, job description, staffing and vacancy requirements, performance, and succession plans pertaining to all the employees engaged in the agency's workforce and a process for recruitment plans required by HRRA. The OPM guidance also includes the following requirements: (1) Conduct a self-assessment of the agency's human capital planning and development process; and (2) develop an annual progress report for FITARA, including: (1) a strategy or plan for the agency's transition to the FITARA human capital goal. This goal should describe the agency's human capital planning in areas such as workforce acquisition, retention, development, and deployment; and describe the workforce development priorities and strategies. The agency should be able to use the guidance to identify or create any necessary roles, positions, or functions that are required to successfully complete the FITANA goals; and create an ongoing accountability system to document results and measures of success. (2) a human capital work schedule to ensure that the human capital goals and objectives are effectively linked with the agency's work; and (3) a process and criteria by which a career of succession to the FITANA goals is maintained. This could include a description of competency-based requirements or a list of skill sets the agency looks for in talent acquisition and promotion. Agencies should use this guidance to ensure that all positions that are identified in their FITANA performance goals are filled with the appropriate workforce. This includes the development of a human capital plan and goals that describe the agency's plans to recruit, retain, and develop the agency's workforce in all IT positions that require either coding or coding specific roles and skills. The plan should also identify the skills that are necessary to complete the FITANA goals and objectives. FITARA implementation plan will be due on June 30, 2017.", "Information about space acquisition personnel is essential to enable DOD officials to better manage the workforce and plan strategically for the development, implementation and sustain of space systems. In 2017, DOD had approximately 8,000 military personnel assigned at 2,500 locations across the country to 3 of 16 major weapon systems programs. Data indicate that DOD had about 8,000 military, civilian, and contractor personnel working on space acquisition, including 1,800 at the 3 Space Development Agency locations. Many information systems exist that could be used to assemble additional workforce demographics, to help identify and manage space workforce needs, and to better inform DOD personnel of space work across the organization. Key elements of the space acquisition workforce include civilian education and engineering positions in research and advanced design and design roles, including those in the R&D area to conduct system- level testing. DOD had more than 1,400 personnel working on FFRDC management at its Washington, D.C., offices. DOD space acquisition managers are responsible for all space-level development roles at more than 10 locations across multiple DOD organizations, including at the Strategic Capabilities Office located at the Air Force Research Lab in Orlando, Florida. At SDO, space engineers are involved in development of satellites, such as the Joint Operational Environment Program, in addition to the operation of a variety or other functions that support the design, development, and launch of satellites.

One of three key features of NDAs is their review of time frames, especially with respect to initial review process and development/review of new drug products in clinical trials; some key features also correspond to FDA\u2019s development/review of drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions. The Cures Act was enacted on December 13, 2016, requiring FDA to accelerate FDA review of and guidance to patients about new drugs. A CURES ACT COMMITTEE AND CONSULTANTS was created to establish new methods of conducting clinical trials. The main goal that FDA is required to facilitate under the CURES ACT was to make the drug delivery process faster to patients, FDA officials said, by providing a pathway to real-world evidence as a tool. These data, which are based on clinical trial outcomes from a range of source, are referred to as real-world evidence. FDA\u2019s use of real-world evidence in drug review is not yet common, but it may be used in future as well as other types of data analysis, according to FDA officials.\nAccording to FDA, many new drugs are difficult to evaluate due to the limited number of patients affected by the disease and their availability for clinical study. The FDA must assess and evaluate products in order to determine their safety and effectiveness.", "ASPR and CDC have an integrated response process to prepare, monitor, and respond to public health emergencies involving infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika, MERS, and others. According to CDC officials responding to Zika, over 5,000 cases have been reported in the United States since 2016. CDC\u2019s role in responding to outbreak-generated illnesses includes helping develop and distribute medical countermeasures (e.g., vaccines to prevent epidemics), conducting surveillance and tracking illnesses, coordinating the exchange of information between health care and public health entities, and responding to public requests. In addition, CDC provides public health-oriented support and information about non-communicable diseases from the CDC-led Global Health and Medical Research and Development program (GMMR-P). For example, the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) provides information to the public about emerging public health threats. Emerging public health threats also include such diseases as Ricketts County (fever, inflammation) Lyme, Malaria, Yellow Fever, and Dengue fever. In many cases, prevention of disease has been demonstrated with the availability of vaccine. These diseases include Ricketts County, Lyme Disease, Pneumococcal/Strep/Di/Vermedia/Hepatitis A/Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C/ Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Human Papillomavirus/Meningitis/Tuberculosis, Zika virus, Yellow Fever, Malaria, Dengue, Ricketts County, Lyme Disease, Pneumococcal/Strep/Di/Vermedia/Hepatitis A/Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C/ Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Human Papillomavirus/Meningitis/Tuberculosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CDC\u2019s Immunization Program also develop tools that encourage vaccination, such as materials showing how vaccines work, as well as other communications. The public health approach, including surveillance and response, is also applicable in preparing for or responding to public health events such as public health emergencies, natural disasters, and other public health hazards such as biologic threats, chemical, radiation exposure, and communicable diseases. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working collaboratively to provide information for individuals from the private sector (e.g., small businesses) to government agencies, which serve the public in a non-exclusive role. The National Informatics and Information Sharing (NISP) initiative is used in public health emergencies to gather comprehensive, up-to-date information on patients, their medical history, treatments, and medications from individual practices (e.g., hospitals and HEP-DD practices) and/or electronic medical databases. In a broad-based response strategy, CDC, ASPR, and other federal entities are engaged in a unified response to a public health crisis. This response may apply to biologic or other medicines to public health emergencies. As part of the response, CDC collects and prepares its inventory of medicines, which includes some drugs that are FDA-approved for public health use, yet are not approved for general sale or practice in the U.S. Drugs are often prescribed by a doctor in order to prevent or treat infections, heart disease, or other illnesses. Drugs can come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules or tablets, suspensions, oral sprays or lozenges, and injections. Some medications may take time to reach the market due to long development and manufacturing processes or FDA approval requirements. If this occurs, FDA may use a form of a drug called an \"unapproved product use pathway.\" These tools are FDA approved only for certain groups of patient, such as children in some cases. For FDA-approved public health use, the FDA or CDC may also collect data from public health drug usage in order to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and quality (e) of the medication used in large numbers of individuals in the United States. In situations where a drug has previously been approved exclusively for public health, it is prescribed to the public health authorities of countries that cannot afford or access FDA-approved prescription drugs for treatment of certain diseases. A comprehensive list and description of FDA and CDC regulatory requirements applicable to public health emergency drugs can be found at\nThe CDC has a long history of performing clinical and laboratory testing to ensure that drugs and vaccines are safe and effective. ACDC website () is a repository of materials that support public health emergency preparedness and response. The public health emergency preparation section, at, includes information about the emergency and resource networks available from ASPR. CDC also offers a public health response to biological, chemical and radiation threats. Public health resources for preventing and responding to biologic and non-biologic medicines and vaccines can be found at (http://www.fda.gov/fdahelp/centerip/diseases/public/what-should-you-do-i-an-emergency", "Among nations reporting goods and services procurement to our trade databases based on input to our input-output database, 84 percent (19 of 23 countries) reported that input to the database includes information from a central government procurement database. As such, in most of the countries in our study, the government procurement data collected by the WTO is a secondary data source that the government uses in conjunction with its own procurement practices. However, in the 8 countries and the European Union (EU) covering all GPA parties, the WTO reports separately on the GPA transactions, which accounts for about 97 percent of the total GPA volume.

Japan reported approximately $12.9 billion of trade in goods with 26 GPA parties, with trade in the categories of medical and scientific instruments, information processing equipment and medical aids reporting the highest import values. On the other hand, Japan reported almost $70 billion in trade in goods with 34 non-GPA parties, an increase from $56.4 billion in 2009. Japan reported that in 2010, it reported nearly a third of all U.S. exports to Japan, accounting for more than half of all Japanese exports to America. In 2009, approximately $23 billion of bilateral trade was between India and Japan, representing 19 percent of India\u2019s overall export dollar value, and 39 percent of Japan\u2019s overall export dollar value. The value included electronics (7.4 percent), clothing (7 percent), machine tools (2.6 percent), steel (2 percent) and miscellaneous (10 percent). USG procurement by region and WTO member nations.

FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 specifies that FAR requirements for delinquent taxes reporting must be included in contract solicitations, and requires contractors to submit delinquent tax information to the appropriate contracting organization. FAR \u00a7 52.211-1-8-1-2 requires that contractors perform their commercial activities at a commercial activity location. FAR \u00a7 52.211-1-8-2 specifies that contractors must submit a statement, as part of their commercial activity location, on time, each quarter, or submit it as part of their annual contractor report (CFO and CPA statements need only be submitted to the OCAFP). FAR 52.211-8-4.1(2) requires contractors to report on time on a form, as a line item, quarterly to the OCAFP the amount of sales receipts from the FAR. FAR 52.216-5 requires contractors to keep an accurate accounting system, and FAR 52.209-11 requires contractors to report delinquent federal taxes reporting each year. FAR 52.213-4 requires that when an extension is granted for past-due payments, or a waiver is granted, a delinquent tax reporting statement (the statement provided in FAR 52.209-11) is required to be submitted to the OCAFP at a later time.

Additionally, OHE is not required to track time spent on implementing its action plan, even though it was clear that VA intended the plan to have lasting value. As a result, VA (as a whole) is left to its own devices to track its implementation of both VA\u2019s plan on health disparities (which VA had to prepare as part of its action plan in order to receive its share of funding) as well as its action plan on accountability and performance measures. A lack of information also limited the scope of our assessment. In the context of our limited information, we found that VA\u2019s plan lacked clarity and consistency and focused on performance measures and external outcomes at the office level, which can have an impact in health systems. It was unclear whether VA was making progress and whether the goals set were reasonable to achieve in relation to its population and health disparities. For example, VA intended to track wait times for health care utilization using EHR data for 2019. VA claimed the data could \u201chelp inform\u201d VA\u2019s action plan that aims to reduce the average wait time for a new patient appointment by 10 minutes.

FY2013-18 Division costs are based on AOC\u2019s current data, as well as information from the Joint Commission\u2019s report from April 2018. Other sources of Division cost details include Appendix II. There were only 7 projects listed at the end of FY2018, as the agency\u2019s projects are subject to annual appropriations cycles and projects may only be able to receive funding in some years. 25 BUDGET REPORTING DATE: October 2018 U.S. Office of the Architect of the Capitol SUBJECT: Architecture of the Capitol (Construction) INITIAL PAGE (DATED): 10/29/2018 23 NPS Photo by William Russell, AOC. CONSTITUTAL OFFICE: Secretary of the U.S. Capitol Police AOC PROJECT OVERVIEW: Architect of the Capitol \u2013 Construction INITIAL PAGE: 10/29/2018 26 The Division reported that as of October 2018 their total direct cost is at $126.7 million, approximately $6.3 million less than the prior year. On November 25, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the first time ever, found unconstitutional the provision in the law authorizing the President to remove AOC from the Government\u2019s fiscal year budget cycle. The court held that the provision violated the separation of powers by giving the President sole authority to remove the Chief Architect of the Capitol without Congressional review. The court ruled that the provision also violates AOC\u2019s \u201cprecedent by law\u201d because AOC has become part of the \u201cinternal workings\u201d of the U.S. Government and so the law allowing AOC\u2019s removal without the President\u2019s review violates the separation of powers clause. AOC had been established by the United States Constitution and, in addition, was exempt from the 1974 Congressional Antitrust Split Case Settlement Act, which prohibits AOC from providing information to Congress on matters that arise at the Office of the Architect of the Capitol\u2019s workplace operations. There was a potential for a U.S. Supreme Court case if Congress chose to allow AOC to remain in government without prior review. At the same time, AOC was able to prevail on appeal, in June 2018, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the case. Despite the outcome, AOC has been the subject of Congressional oversight since 1902. From 1906 to 2018, Congress mandated that AOC, along with its other duties (e.g., architect, design and construction engineer), must be subject to AOC\u2019s consent after they received AOC\u2019s findings and recommendations before any further use of the project funds. At the time of this report, the OCC still reported 20 open cases of AOC\u2019s work on a variety of projects including construction related to historic and modern building systems, design of architectural works, and various mechanical, electrical, and other systems on the Capitol complex (e.g., replacement of elevator cabs, boilers, chillers, plumbing, lighting, and electrical poles) in FY2018. According to OCC, FY2019 will see approximately 12", "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)CRC program works with an network of private partner firms in the area to provide confidential counseling service(s).

The report includes detailed information on state Medicaid populations. The report finds that between 70% and 90% of Medicaid recipients are dually enrolled, which means that there is significant overlap in their coverage with Medicare and Medicaid programs. The report also finds that more than 40 percent of Medicaid payments (not exclusive of those made to Medicaid managed care entities) are Medicaid-only beneficiaries. The majority of states also spend more than half of their budget on Medicaid. The report also examines state-specific rates of poverty among Medicaid recipients. The report concludes that states should invest more in Medicaid providers' administrative costs, in particular by administering programs such as fee-for-service based Medicaid.", "- Bitcoin, the first and most widely circulated blockchain-based cryptocurrency, is the product of software that performs complex encryption computations to verify the validity of transactions taking place on the network. Users transact electronically and value may be denominated in dollars or may be exchanged for another virtual currency. The market size is estimated at $1.2 trillion. In late February 2018, the price of one bitcoin, the most widely circulated virtual currency, ranged from $9,256 up to $26,600. The maximum market capitalization for the most widely circulated virtual currency, as measured in U.S. dollars, has been estimated to be around $225 billion ($64.4 trillion). Users\u2019 assets range from a few dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. The market size has been estimated to range from $1.2 trillion to tens of billions of dollars. Payments processed via cryptocurrencies vary, but their use has been steadily growing in the past several years. By the middle of 2017 the market capitalization of the most widely circulated virtual currency, bitcoin, exceeded $23 trillion. In March 2018, the price of a bitcoin reached a new high of around $26,600. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency peaked around $225 billion in November 2019. Users of virtual currency may exchange $10,000 value for a single small dollar transaction or larger, potentially ranging into trillions. Payments made in bitcoins are becoming increasingly common, especially for a smaller amount. There is no universal digital currency, such as PayPal. Different virtual currencies are used for different purposes including travel in foreign countries or online shopping. There are many different types of virtual currencies and related services, and the market is becoming increasingly complex. It is becoming difficult for the Federal Reserve to provide guidance on digital currencies for this reason. There is no centralized authority to provide guidance for digital currencies, but the Federal Reserve has a working group that is keeping abreast of events related to virtual currencies and financial innovation. The IRS has indicated that digital currencies would be subject to existing federal tax laws, regulations, and sanctions. The tax implications of virtual currency payments are similar to physical payments. They could amount to taxable income or they might qualify for a tax exemption. In general, there are several steps to take to get started using digital currencies, such as determining which currency to use for payments, selecting the appropriate wallet, and determining how much to maintain in assets on the platform. It is important to research digital currencies, particularly the more specialized types, to ensure that they are compliant with U.S. law and tax requirements. In particular, the IRS has recently stepped up their oversight of virtual currency users and businesses that conduct digital currency activities.", "Under T-2017, DHA restructured 4 TRICARE regions with an emphasis on a single network of providers. The change resulted in an overall decrease in beneficiary TRICARE coverage for the T-2017 region, which includes Alaska, the District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, and the 13 surrounding states. Due to contractor transition errors, one- 2 -day provider service delays, and other factors, a new performance-based incentive incentive was set for TRICARE contractors in the TRICARE Select PTA. A complete update from the 2015 TRICARE Contractor performance reports were completed, resulting in 93 percent of vendors receiving the highest level of 4 stars, 98 percent complying, and 99 percent on track to achieve 5 stars, compared with less than 70 percent of vendors in the 2009 contractor report. The TRICARE Select PTA has been renewed for one more year, extending it to June 2020. Performance-based incentives continue with vendors in the Contractor performance reports. Contractors in the Contractor performance reports in each TRICARE region are identified in Table 1; Figure 1. 8 Contract Performance Report and Contractor Performance Report. For Fiscal Year 2016 (FY), the T-2 Contract Performance Report was completed during this time period and is included in Appendix 1 (see Appendix 8).

The contractor who meets less than what is required in this area (the \u2018vendor award\u2019) will be rewarded with the amount of financial assistance they would have received to meet the T-3 requirements to be able to do that. To ensure contractor compliance with the vendor award requirements (T-3), we will be tracking this information. The criteria for TRICARE FFS (T-P) and TRICARE FFS (T-GS) will be the two most important topics on this report. The current list of T-3 performance metrics will be reviewed quarterly, and revised at the end of each contract year. Each contractor will be required to report the appropriate information to their customer service centers (see Table 1). This report will be completed at the end of each T-3 Contract (FY) on June 29, 2016. As DHA is transitioning the T-3 contract from Region 2 to Region 5, it will be changing the TRICARE Contract Report # to 5P, as well as changing this report from a table to a report. The current report format with a single region map will remain the same to allow comparisons and analysis across the same region. The contract report will no longer provide geographic map locations for region 2 (Florida and the 13 surrounding states) and will instead be divided into sub-regions, Region 2A (Alaska); Region 2B (Maine and Vermont); Region 2C (Virginia and North Carolina) and Region 2D (Marianas and Guam).

TSA is responsible for addressing threats on the airside of transportation systems including the U.S. commercial and economic airspace. For all airside and terminal-side travel and related systems, TSA is able to detect, assess, and recover from these hazards. In-Depth Risk Management Process (IRM) is a standardized process for managing threats and vulnerabilities. Figure 3 describes how TSA\u2019s Office for Infrastructure Security Risk Management works with industry stakeholders and foreign stakeholders. TSA works with other government agencies such as DHS, FBI, and NSA. In addition, TSA works with the International Aviation Organization and Transportation Safety Board to assess threats, develop and enhance TSA\u2019s threat-based transportation security requirements, and coordinate with DHS and other partners. TSA manages system security for passenger rail in areas such as authentication techniques, access control systems, fire suppression, and anti-terrorism measures. The NIPP and IRM provide a risk management framework used by DHS and its partners. Figure 4 shows the NIPP\u2019s process for risk assessment. The NIPP offers a web-based platform for each of DHS\u2019s critical infrastructure sectors, where users can share information related to security risks, threat assessments, or incident reports, such as cyberattacks and physical intrusions. 2013 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM FOR PARIS(PIPELINE) The National Intelligence Programmatic Infrastructure Protection (NIPP) manages risk analysis using a comprehensive framework and is comprised of a working group on a 24- hour operations center. Working Groups and Information Sharing with Foreign Partners There are many organizations that can assist DHS with information security. DHS has formed a number of working groups with foreign partners to identify transportation security gaps in information, communications, and intelligence capabilities. DHS works closely with the Transportation Security Research and Applications Lab (TSERAP), which has a partnership with the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and the International Railway Federation (IRF) to develop information system designs for all segments of the rail industry. AAR also operates a National Rail Safety and Security Data Management Center. DHS has also initiated working groups with foreign partners in the field of threat assessment, incident management and vulnerability assessments. While DHS is in the process of establishing a new International Partner Program, the NIPP website remains a resource for information sharing. While DHS may not have the capability to provide additional support to small-operating railways, DHS works with them through the Office of Safety Assurance and Rulemaking where the majority of small railroads fall. Other working groups include DHS working with local law enforcement, DHS working with DHS\u2019s National Cyber Security Division, and DHS working with DHS employees at the DHS Regional Information- Sharing Centers (RICS). As DHS continues to build new partnerships to help share intelligence and data regarding rail transportation, DHS is continuing to build relationships with foreign intelligence/security firms. DHS is working with an international transportation information system to allow for greater information sharing and intelligence analysis. DHS is also working with Russian entities in the field of threat assessment in rail and aviation. DHS is working with the Chinese government and intelligence community to build a working relationship in the area of transportation security. As DHS expands efforts to address foreign adversaries, DHS established an International Threat Assessment Division, along with an International Countermeasures (Countermeasures) Division, both under the Office for Global Threat Intelligence. DHS is continuing to work with China for cybersecurity assessments. DHS has a bilateral agreement to cooperate with Taiwan. DHS worked with the British Railways (BR) after the Boston Marathon attack to address the transport sector. DHS works with France\u2019s Ministry of Defense in France and with Rail Italia in Italy. Homeland Security Information and Analysis Division coordinates with the Rail Security and Safety Council for Rail safety in the UK. DHS is also building a relationship with other countries to help address common threats. 2013-NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM FOR PARIS(PIPELINE) DHS works with other national security agencies in Germany, Canada, and Australia, among others. The DHS Office of Global Threat Assessment works with Germany to build a shared understanding of potential cybersecurity threats to both Germany and the United States. The DHS Office of Homeland Security Research and Analysis collaborates with Australia. DHS also works with Norway and Sweden. DHS has collaborated with South Africa on matters of shared interest. DHS has also worked with Singapore. DHS collaborates with Sweden from the DHS Office of Global Engagement, and DHS and Sweden have a partnership for sharing information on potential cyber threats. Australia, DHS and Canada are working with DHS to build a network of rail stations to allow DHS to monitor rail safety and security, and DHS is working with France on rail security. DHS is also working with Norway on rail security. DHS is partnering in Canada because DHS has been working with Vancouver B.C. Since 2018.

Additionally, agencies evaluate how to manage legacy systems costs and are required to maintain key systems associated with nuclear waste storage, depending on the location.", "Since the October 2019 report, the United States has made progress in many areas regarding climate change resilience, such as developing adaptive capacities and supporting resilient infrastructure in urban areas. Some agencies and intergovernmental organizations have also made progress in climate change resilience. Yet, the country still has not seen much of the federal civilian government\u2019s investments on climate change strategic projects. In the October update, we reviewed 21 new climate change high-risk areas and 43 climate change high-priority projects identified as possible targets for mitigation strategies. In the United States, most federal climate change strategic projects are initiated and funded on the state level and not in coordination or a standardized approach at the federal level. At the operational level, as of September 2019, federal climate initiatives were not consistently reported to OMB, despite federal agencies committing to implementing climate change initiatives in the October 2016 report. Agencies implementing climate change initiatives at the federal level typically focus on risk assessment and mitigation activities, while in the case at the state and local level, the efforts are more focused on the impacts of climate change and the resilience of infrastructure and communities exposed to it. More recent initiatives also exist at the federal level to coordinate resilience efforts. The DHS is establishing the Climate and Environmental Risk Assessment System to coordinate interagency support, to manage the DHS\u2019s environmental compliance program for climate-sensitive areas, and to streamline response to any crisis. The department is also integrating Climate and Environmental Risk Assessment System data into the DHS\u2019s systems for personnel, property, and information systems. In all of these examples, the federal government plays an important strategic role in coordinating and integrating existing individual agency risk- and resilience- focused initiatives to achieve the desired outcome for a more resilient nation.", "The Secretary of Defense may enter into ACSAs with authorized countries and international organizations for the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, and services with the military forces of that country or international organization.

DHS prosecutes certain classes of immigration crimes; DOJ prosecutes criminal offenses in the district courts for all other federal criminal crimes. Specifically, they coordinate their efforts in criminal prosecutions and investigations for immigration- related offences. With respect to prosecutions for illegal entry, immigration enforcement is not the lead crime in criminal cases prosecuted by USAOs. In the United States, federal law enforcement agencies are responsible for prosecution of criminal offenses, while the courts are responsible for interpreting the law and rendering jury verdicts, as previously discussed. In the meantime, DHS is responsible for criminal prosecution and the courts for civil trial. According to DHS and DOJ, the vast majority of individuals prosecuted for criminal immigration offences are prosecuted for their immigration offences in court. In particular, DHS 2018 Annual Report stated that most of these prosecution cases involve criminal defendants who have violated several criminal statutes, including criminal offences that are not immigration-related. \u201cImmigration offenders may receive more lenient sentences, reduced fines, and other benefits to assist in their reentry into the U.S. In addition, immigrants may require more assistance and services to become lawfully present in the U.S. and/or the U.S. may become more dependent on immigrant services and services to immigrant populations once immigrants become present in the U.S. as lawful immigrants, permanent residents, temporary residents, or persons with work visas. (DHS 2018 Annual Report, ) DHS and DOJ 2018 Annual Report DHS\u2019s criminal prosecution for immigration offences, which can include felony criminal offences and misdemeanour criminal offences. DHS stated this is only 11% (as of December 2019) of the criminal cases they handle, and are likely to handle lower volume of these cases. DHS and DOJ typically work closely together throughout the criminal investigation and prosecution cases in the U.S. If an immigrant has been determined to be legally present in the U.S., DHS will refer such a case to the DOJ for a civil trial. In that case, the proceedings are similar to litigation in the federal courts and criminal sentencing proceedings in court. According to DHS, it has \u201can excellent track record of prosecution of Immigration-related offences since 2001.\u201d DHS 2018 Annual Report DHS is currently implementing the policy \u201cTo ensure that DHS and DOJ work together to make joint determinations related to criminal cases involving immigrants. DHS is developing a program where all criminal cases will be referred to DOJ for a civil trial. DHS has a \u201csmall unit of attorneys in its Immigrant Assistance Division which handles cases regarding all criminal cases involving alien defendants. DHS lawyers assigned to their respective offices are likely to represent alien defendants, in criminal prosecutions, immigration cases, and civil litigation, including in the federal courts. (Annual Report DHS, ) DHS has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to ensure the fair, efficient, and transparent processing of lawful immigrant petitions. This policy involves DHS and DOJ working together to monitor the process of all criminal cases involving their alien defendants. DHS has also implemented automated entry system for DHS\u2019 Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Processing System, where a large proportion of the criminal prosecutions involving immigrants are conducted. DHS reported that the Immigration Courts receive over 10,000 criminal cases each year relating to illegal entry into the United States. DHS officials have stated that criminal prosecutions for illegal alien entry offences will likely decrease in future, as DHS' 2018 Annual Report noted they have become more lenient in their sentencing of offenders. The number of such offences in criminal judicial proceedings now number only in the tens of thousands (see chart below).

In some cases, individuals may face challenges finding available and qualified providers to serve as their clinical or case managers. Others may lack information on the types of treatments available. MA plans may face difficulties recruiting psychiatrists or other behavioral health providers to their networks. (See fig. 1; and see appendix for additional sources and methods information.) METHODS: We selected a representative group of MA organizations in 2019 in each of the geographical regions of Medicare. There are 12 geographical regions within Medicare (i.e., 7 geographic regions and 17 geographic markets. We used census population figures from the 2010 Census to calculate the size of our target population for the 12 geographic regions (). We used publicly available Medicare claims data from the CMS database for 2018. We identified and recorded behavioral health services as a separate type of physician services in this analysis, as is the case in the 2015 MA market. Since we are interested in the types of treatments available to individual beneficiaries, we also analyzed the types of treatment codes and services that MA plan networks have paid to providers for the 12 geographic regions during 2018 (which may be more limited for behavioral health services). The results presented are in a variety of categories and can be found in appendices. RESULTS: A total of 2,623 MA organizations in 2019 had payment arrangements/ contracts/agreements with behavioral health organizations that also had a behavioral health service practice. According to the MA organizations we researched, the prevalence of behavioral health services among Medicare beneficiaries was low at approximately 14 percent of all benefit-eligible individuals. MA organizations in the Southern region of the U.S. had more behavioral health services available than the Northeast and Midwest. In 2018 behavioral health services are included in 80 percent of regional and 90 percent of all MA organizations for adults. (See figs. 1 and 2.) Figure 1 Medscape Annual Physician Fee Survey Figure 2 Medscape MA Organizations Survey Results Results from the Medicare Beneficiary Survey suggest that 15 percent of elderly adults have received annual health maintenance checks from a provider. In many cases, the annual health maintenance check has the same prevalence as the overall rate of medical checkups. On other occasions, beneficiaries have received these visits from a specialist physician who has a direct- patient contract with Medicaid that is more recent to their use than other physicians in their area. In addition, the survey results indicated that approximately 80 percent of medical practices report offering behavioral health services to their patients. We found that behavioral health claims were a low percentage, about 13 percent, in the Medicare market. According to the 2019 Behavioral Health Organizations survey by the National Alliance for Insurance Consumer Information Technology (NCIC), on average, 15 percent of MA organizations in each geographic region. This includes 17 percent of MA organizations in each geographic region in 2019 and 15 percent in 2018 (see figure 2). Results from the National Health Statistics Yearbook survey show that in 2017 there were about 90 percent of U.S adults receiving a \u201cregular health examination\u201d to help maintain their overall health. However, these practices that involved health checkups were a relatively minority in 40.3 percent of all physicians interviewed. There are two types of financial incentives that can be offered to individuals with high levels of behavioral health needs. Medicaid has a federally funded, per capita capitation health insurance plan. In addition to its direct benefit offerings, some state Medicaid programs provide Medicaid health benefits coverage for an individual if he or she has a qualifying, health-specific condition. Similarly, Medicaid may offer medical financial assistance, which may cover co-payments, payments for premiums or health insurance plan premiums. More specific financial incentives for individuals with behavioral health needs depend a state\u2019s health care information strategy (HCIS) to design benefits packages that include mental health and/or substance abuse treatment, which are covered by Medicaid. These benefits are provided to individuals at the point of service in a health care provider\u2019s facility, who then bill Medicaid for it. Medicaid was paid, on average, less than $1 percent of any given cost. The rest of the cost was paid by the individual, with Medicare reimbursing about 80 cents for each patient dollar spent, meaning on these costs individuals are not able to collect out-of-pocket patient cost. In addition, these benefits may have to be billed out as part of a patient\u2019s hospital admission, which will be covered by Medicaid and will be passed along to the patient. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries may be able to receive out-of-pocket costs for behavioral health services at a hospital, outpatient centers, or physician practices. Our survey results indicated that 64 percent of physicians reported that they were compensated more for a \u201cpatient\u201d than they would be paid by Medicaid alone.

India is the leading originator of APIs and finished drug products destined for clinical and commercial use, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all global drug manufacturing, followed closely by China and South Korea. A product-specific risk assessment conducted by CQMI (in Australia) ranked Australia second among foreign manufacturers supplying drugs to the U.S. market, followed by India and China at respective distances from the number one position. The average distance between manufacturers and U.S. consumers was about 6,300 miles, 1,100 miles less than in a similar 2008 report. India, China, and other Asian countries accounted for nearly double the number of drug manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. with about 70 percent of all Asian manufacturers locating in the U.S., largely because of the lower labor, safety, and environmental regulations in manufacturing facilities in these countries. Asian drug manufacturers took nearly 12 percent of CDER inspections in 2019. However, in 2008, only 4 percent of all foreign drug establishments that participated in the FDA\u2019s Drug Shortage Evaluation Program had on file GMPs for finished drugs. The number of manufacturers who kept full-time foreign drug staff in U.S. offices decreased by nearly 20 percent from 2017 and 20 percent from 2008. Overall, the FDA is continuing to develop processes to detect drug manufacturing locations in Asia. It also has implemented policies, including GMP requirements, to ensure quality and safety standards for finished drugs. At the time of the report writing, the FDA had 27,200 drug establishments in the U.S. subject to inspection and an additional approximately 1,400 in Europe. The FDA also inspected 16,600 pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States during calendar year 2019 and conducted 1,400 GMP compliance inspections (FDA), and 2,200 non-fda compliance visits (ORA) to foreign manufacturing facilities 2019. Data for the most recent year-end and other years was gathered from the CDER\u2019s Annual Drug Shortage Evaluation report during a fiscal year audit, which the FDA started in fiscal year 2019. The report covers the current inventory shortage situation in the manufacture and import of drugs. It has been published since 1999 and is supported by about 40 percent of pharmaceutical manufacturers using the product in at their manufacturing facilities. The FDA also provides the report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to aid in tracking drugs subject to the FDA\u2019s Shortage Control Program (SCP). It also assists the U.S. Department of Defense in determining whether a drug has the potential to become a weapon of mass destruction. The FDA conducts more than 3,000 inspections of pharmaceutical sites per year worldwide. In calendar year 2016, the FDA conducted approximately 20,450 GMP compliance inspections of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers. In fiscal year 2019, FDA conducted 25,000 GMP compliance inspections of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Of these GMP compliance inspections, 7,200 were conducted at overseas manufacturing establishments. As part of a broader effort to reduce data on product expiration dates and lot matching of products, FDA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report the results of their expiration date inspections to FDA as part of their product-specific report that contains information such as product name, form number, lot number, and batch number. The FDA also conducts several thousand GMP inspections per year, which are limited to pharmaceutical facilities subject to FDA\u2019s regulatory compliance inspections. For calendar year 2019, the FDA conducted approximately 2,600 GMP inspections (mostly pharmaceutical) and 30 GMP inspections related to the manufacture of bulk drug products (mostly for generic and over-the-counter drugs). In terms of pharmaceuticals, the FDA examined approximately 1,100 drug product API sources in FY19. Each of these sources also received a product-specific report with expiration dates on products that will be used in clinical and commercial use. The FDA also reported to FDA the results of three separate product-specific inspections of foreign drug establishments subject to inspection by FDAs Office of International Operations during the 2019 calendar year. A total of approximately 26,000 GMP inspections were conducted in fiscal year 2019. Each of these inspections was targeted at the manufacture of drug products, finished products and bulk drug products. The inspection scope included: API, bulk drug products, finished drug products, drug product GMP compliance, and commercial drug product manufacture, including finished drug product manufacture. The major categories of product GMP compliance violations found include: lack of appropriate documentation on drug product manufacture (including product specifications and process parameters), inadequate procedures and process controls (including poor quality monitoring for finished drugs), documentation concerns based on inadequate processes to demonstrate drug manufacturing systems for finished products, deviations from established process parameters", "Many federal programs provide aid to 80 low-income people by administering cash, housing, and education to address different types of needs. Some federal efforts are designed to help families increase their economic self-sufficiency and personal well-being through assistance with housing, child care, healthcare, and training. Other federal programs offer more comprehensive services, such as job skills training.", "STEP is a 10-year program that grants financial assistance to U.S. small businesses that are interested in exporting. The program provides grants to assist small businesses in expanding their trade activities. Each state must submit applications for STEP grants annually. SBA tracks the spending of its grants across the United States. Of the nearly $140 million in federal funds provided to states for this program, more than 99 percent of it was allocated to state departments of commerce, not SBA. The median grant size across all states for fiscal years 2015-2017 was $373, and grants usually went to companies specializing in a variety of products. Most of the firms receiving STEP grants were trade wholesalers, retailers, wholesalers, and other businesses. They also received help to become exporters and to use the Internet to sell internationally. \u2014 \u2014 Figure 1: Funding Structure Figure 2: Allowable Uses in SFTEA SFTEA allows small businesses to apply for $50 million in grants annually, for up to 10 years in 15-year cycles, to fund various export- or trade-related activities. In fiscal years 2011-2017, STEP has distributed a total of $54.1 million to states, and these funds have usually gone to a variety of businesses operating in nearly all industries. The median size of a state expenditure for these funds was about $373 during the fiscal years 2015-2017. Figure 1: Funding Structure Figure 2: Allowable Uses in SFTEA The $50 million in SFTEA has been used, since inception, to fund a variety of trade- and export-related activities such as paying for trade show fees, marketing costs, translating foreign languages, making payments in foreign currencies, and establishing relationships with other small businesses.", "The Bureau\u2019s 10-year ERM framework, designed to guide the implementation and management of 500+ risks.

SUMMARY GOAL: To identify risk events related to the 2020 Census and determine appropriate actions to ensure they are mitigated prior to November 3, 2018. BODY This section is a high level description of the data and information required to identify risks. Risk Management Plan The Bureau\u2019s Office of Risk Implementation had been working on ERM since 2012 when it was implemented as a risk management plan. A review of the Bureau\u2019s ERM Framework and plans showed a variety of approaches to risk implementation. A review of the Bureau\u2019s risk assessments and risk management work shows that the Bureau had a solid risk management framework and a well-implemented ERM process in place. While the Bureau\u2019s 2020 Census risk management plan was quite comprehensive and involved a variety of activities, it was a rather narrow- scoped project. The Bureau has 22 census- related projects in place with 6 under construction, 5 in- progress, and 4 being planned, for which they had identified, or were in various stages of identifying, risks. Of these 22 projects, 15 had been deemed completed, although 3 had not been updated for several years (figure 2). Figure 4 shows the list of 2020 Census-related projects the Bureau has had since the Census Census Bureau. 2018. \u201cThe Census is Counting: Census in 2010.\u201d This Census was published in December 2018 and provides a wealth of information on the American population and ethnicity, among many other things. The report also emphasizes the need for Census data to be accessible. A separate article on census data usage may be found on the Census Bureau\u2019s website at. 2018 Census Statistical Estimates. This document contains statistical information on the Census population, housing, finance, and economy. Some of this information is available for free, but Census also provides an extensive library of data charges that users can find in the Bureau\u2019s website at, on the Census\u2019 website at. Census Bureau Census Designated Statistical Area Statistical Sampling (CTSA-SSA) data. This project has been done several times over the past decades to examine changes in the U.S. population. The Census Bureau has been able to use this data both as a means of validating Census data and as a supplement to it. Census Designated Statistical Areas (CTSA) and Census Sampling (CCTS) have been used to provide a measure of change in the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau released a series of Census 2020- related products in October 2018.

In contrast, recent studies estimate that climate change will result in billions of dollars in economic losses annually. A High-Risk list including major sectors, methods for managing climate risk, an economic analysis that provides several findings regarding damages from climate change, and other relevant information to identify possible risks to the federal government, as well as a discussion on actions needed to adapt to a changing climate. TEXT: According to FEMA, a property may lose one or two square feet of structural material to sea-level rise in a year. Sea-level rise is expected to accelerate and increase over the next ten years\u2014as much as three inches per year\u2014and by 10 to 20 feet per century. The federal government can adapt to climate change by addressing the current and projected trends\u2014and building a variety of adaptation and resilience tools into their existing programs. For instance, FEMA is currently reviewing and updating the Community Assistance Program (CAP) to be more flexible and innovative as climate- and natural-hazards pressures, changes in the population, and more complex and dynamic communities become the norm. In contrast, many U.S. communities currently lack well-defined and reliable climate and natural hazard risk identification techniques and tools that are capable of adapting to changes in climate patterns. FEMA is reviewing its Flood Hazard and Risk Mapping program to enhance its mapping features, which can be used to identify, understand, and adapt to flood hazards and losses that can result from rising sea-level estimates. Communities can utilize FEMA\u2019s existing expertise in community risk assessment and emergency management to help them design and improve their own risk management and climate adaptation plans. FEMA has begun pilot testing and feasibility assessment of tools and technologies to implement climate adaptation into existing programs, such as its Disaster Assessement and Risk Analysis (DARA) Model, which FEMA currently uses at approximately 40 sites around country. The new FEMA Climate Toolkits for Building, Planning, and Codes in America provide resources and tools for building and planning resilient in the current environment. There are several ways that the federal government can reduce the costs associated with managing climate change\u2014in addition to the High-Risk List discussed. FEMA is a proven and important model for addressing climate change impacts, but FEMA may also need to work closely with other federal agencies such as NOAA-NWSRA and U.S. Geological Survey on climate adaptation initiatives. Finally, FEMA could become an important hub for providing climate-adjusted training, financial assistance, and/or technical assistance to its local communities and FEMA-partner organizations. (FEMA and FEMA report no information on the impact of climate change on FEMA\u2019s operations.) Other Sources: FEMA's Assessment of the Risk, Impacts, and Critical Needs of the Nation to the Natural Hazards (FEMA) report No. 1, titled Analysis of Critical Community Hazard Risks. The report describes the risk and severity of natural hazard impacts. FEMA's report titled Climate Hazard Risk Assessments (HRA) provides communities with methods to analyze their overall climate risk. FEMA's report Risk Management, Preparation, Awareness and Mitigation (HMAM) provides information on how communities can prepare for and manage natural events and hazards from climate change. FEMA's Report High-Risk Areas (A) is a state-specific version of FEMA's FEMA report, Climate Hazards Impacts, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigation Strategies (Hazim). FEMA has developed a Risk Evaluation Assessment (FEMA-R.O.C) process to aid localities in developing future risk management strategies. FEMA's report, Climate Change: Effects, Impacts, and Adaptation: Updated National Drought Guidelines for Water Managers, is intended for water resource managers who live and work in dry, non-urban areas. FEMA's Assessment of Coastal Hazardities from Climate Change (FEMA) is a study that evaluates coastal hazard, resulting from climate change, and methods or best practices to use for managing these hazards. FEMA produced a report in December 2017, Climate Change Adaptation Strategies and Climate Hazards Impacts Vulnerability Analysis (Hazim) to help local governments and planners better understand climate change. In this report, FEMA reviewed the extent, severity, and frequency of climate risk, as well as best practices for risk mitigation, and provided the most effective strategies for adaptation. FEMA's Climate Hazards Hazard Assessments (AHA) includes a comprehensive catalog of climate hazards. FEMA's Report Climate Hazard, Risk, and Vulnerability Assessments (PHA) uses FEMA's Flood Hazard Mapping Service to identify flood hazards. FEMA provides guidance for building and implementing climate risk-management strategies.

The Access U.S. Telecom Access to High-Cost Telecom Act is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and implemented in connection with state programs. In 2009, an FCC task force issued a reform plan for USF, a system that in current practice distributes billions in annual subsidies to more than a million high-cost U.S. telephone carriers. The reform task force recommended changes, including: increasing support to all types of businesses to offset higher costs and the lack of broadband connectivity; and moving forward with the transition of broadband support from the traditional monthly support mechanism to a one-time, $10.25-per-dollar payment, as opposed to annual rate of return support. The model-based support mechanism, which is new under the Access U.S. Telecom Access to High-Cost Telecom Act, is designed to facilitate wireless networks in underserved rural areas by creating efficiency in the system. The program is aimed at service providers to ensure wireless 2 connectivity is available in areas where wired service is lacking, and where high costs for broadband speeds make the service unaffordable. The program also can be leveraged for business development activities in these areas.

Several U.S. telecommunicators who are regulated under the Act receive more from USF than from the carriers. The Act requires carriers: to offer broadband Internet subscriptions at \u201cwireline speeds\u201d for rural consumers; to submit data indicating usage patterns to USAC for all services 3 & 3.5 bps, when appropriate; and to use a certain amount of the USF to upgrade infrastructure and equipment. The FCC issued the 2007 USF transformation plan (released April 3, 2007) and updated it in October 2020. Several times in the past decade, Congress and FCC have extended 1.8 bps for rate-of- return carriers (ROCs, which use tax-exempt financing) and certain geographic areas from which their revenues are largely derived. The USF \u201ctransition to broadband\u201d (B-Y) assistance program requires carriers to provide 1.8 bps, with a $1.99 million \u201cone-time fee per service to", "Drugs manufactured in the U.S.-exported to another country are subject to the FDA\u2019s regulatory authority to ensure product quality and efficacy. In this report, we discuss the U.S. drug inspection system and summarize the results of the FDA\u2019s international drug inspection survey. The results indicate that foreign drug manufacturers face challenges in complying with the FDA\u2019s standards. However, the survey reveals that foreign drug manufacturers generally meet a minimum level of requirements on a variety of topics. The results provide a baseline to evaluate future trends in compliance. TABLES: FIGURES: See figs. 1, 2, and 3 for examples of tables and data elements. TABLES: SEE FIGS. 2 and 3 for tables and data elements to view and extract. TABLES: SEE FIGS. FUELS AND FOOD FOR DEADLY DRUGS: FDA\u2019s New Guidance for the Treatment of Cancer-Related Drugs. See fig. 2a for product-specific data. See figs. 3 and 10 for product-specific data. There are several ways for FDA to use this data and these methods may include product inspections, re-inspections if there are noncompliance, and the submission of information directly into FDA\u2019s electronic system. The data reported from this survey may be used by manufacturers as they may make important determinations about their products or products by their product developers. These results might be useful by ORA investigators, whose job may involve a review of products or companies that fail to meet FDA requirements or who need additional product information regarding an FDA approval or adverse event reporting. The results may be especially useful for foreign drug manufacturers that need to comply with FDA requirements in the United States. FDA uses a variety of methods to evaluate and implement foreign drug inspections through ORA investigations and visits at foreign sites. After 1999, the import of bulk drugs into the United States has shifted from product-specific inspections by laboratories to inspections of all drugs imported from overseas by FDA. These are summarized in Table 2-3. See Table 1 for general statistics on recent inspection numbers. TABLE 2-3: Total amount of drugs imported into the US FDA\u2019s drug inspection procedures FDA\u2019s number of imported drugs that they have inspected is at the top of the table. See Figure 2-2 for more information on U.S. sales of imported drugs. Each year FDA receives hundreds of \u201coffsite\u201d complaints from patients or consumers alleging that drugs they may have ingested did not conform to FDA\u2019s current manufacturing standards. As a result, FDA performs unannounced inspections of drug manufacturers to investigate the allegations and determine if there was any misconduct. FDA has found that, on average, about one-third of complaints alleging off-label use of imported drugs in the United States could be attributed to products imported from China and have originated from manufacturing facilities in China. The majority of drugs imported into the United States are of the generic variety. FDA has implemented its quality systems guidance of using laboratory test results that must comply with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 82000-2. During an inspection of a drug manufacturer, FDA can perform a sampling of laboratory products in order to detect a noncompliant batch of product. FDA may require a specific number of items, of a different product type, or combination thereof, to be sampled by FDA for laboratory testing. FDA uses laboratory test results to decide whether additional inspections are required. See Table 2-4. As a result of recent inspections of Chinese manufacturing facilities, FDA had identified two problems and is in a position to conduct unannounced inspections. The FDA had conducted its first unannounced inspections of imported drugs in China for more than 30 years, since the first inspection in 1978. By 2018, almost all of the Chinese inspections that had been performed had been unannounced investigations that led FDA to investigate compliance-related deviations of manufacturing operations. TABLE 2-7: Quantity of drugs imported into the USA FDA performs inspections at its own expense and may assess fees in accordance with certain fees outlined in 21 CFR 7\u20131, part of the FDA\u2019s Enforcement Policy. See Tables 3a and 4a for a detailed breakdown of costs associated with inspections and tests or laboratory tests of all drugs imported into the U.S. FDA performs two types of additional unannounced inspections: one for laboratory testing of all products and one for testing a single product. During laboratory tests, FDA had identified some serious issues and may perform \u201csite-wide\u201d inspections and/or laboratory tests in addition to the unannounced visit. The results reported in #2 above were based on the most recent FDA reports. As of October 2017, FDA reported that at a certain number of Chinese drug facilities that it inspected in 2007, 2018\u20132019, one in four had no records, and one in 19 Chinese drug product records were not properly filled in, according to the FDA\u2019", "In 2018, 43 states (or all states in fiscal year 2016 that received federal approval) operated part of their Medicaid program under demonstrations. Two decades of national data and regulatory transparency requirements for new demonstrations are applied by CMS to assess applications for new state-approved benefits. Since 2006, CMS has reviewed the execution of nearly all applications, and, to date, a wide range of states have successfully been approved for Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations. This report identifies and evaluates the transparency framework in place to ensure that the evaluation is comprehensive. We found that in the majority of cases, CMS\u2019s checklists and monitoring requirements for evaluation design and reports have been met under each of the STCs in place for each demonstration. States are required to submit specific information on the progress made by demonstration states through 2018 due to fiscal year end 2018, but only states operating a demonstration were required to submit this information. The findings were based on data from federal databases available in October 2018. Although the majority of states reported no additional monitoring reports, a few states report having received more reports over time, as states adapted the requirements to meet the state\u2019s needs. Most states (about 81 percent) reported no significant changes in Medicaid benefit coverage (e.g., expanding coverage of mental health treatment) between the end of the year and the end of the fiscal year. About one-third of demonstration states reported that no state-approved services for beneficiaries were added during 2018. A wide range of states report significant changes in service levels (e.g., provider reimbursement rates) between the end of the fiscal year and the beginning of 2018, including significant increases in the reimbursement rates. Most (about 76 percent in 2018) of demonstration states reported that, during the same period, an appreciable number of health care services are being used under the Medicaid demonstration. A minority of states report increased funding for new Medicaid programs in 2018, but the majority (nearly two-thirds in 2018) report that no funding is available to meet the increased needs. The majority of demonstration states report no significant changes in Medicaid benefit coverage from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018 (roughly 80 percent). A very high proportion of demonstration states report that at least one entity is providing financial or other assistance to help states administer their Medicaid programs (about 80 percent). Although a large majority of states report no significant changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates in 2018, a few show substantial decreases in the rates. The percentage of demonstration states reporting new Medicaid beneficiaries in 2018 varies widely (less than a third of demonstration states in the third quarter and well beyond 50 percent in the fourth quarter, with a range between 27 and 80). The majority of states report a significant decrease in the percentage of demonstration beneficiaries from the previous quarter to the current quarter (about two-thirds in the third and fourth quarters), while about one-third report little change. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: For fiscal year 2016, there were at least 43 state demonstrations that operated part of their Medicaid program in 2018, up from 22 in 2016. The proportion of states reporting meaningful decreases in the percentage of beneficiaries has doubled since 2016, from less than halfway to a majority. Of the 47 states that reported an increase in spending in their Medicaid programs, nearly one-third reported that the increase exceeds 20 percent. A relatively low proportion of demonstration states report annual health care costs. The proportion of demonstration states reporting new Medicaid beneficiaries increases after 2016, with even a few states reporting a significant increase relative to each other. A majority of demonstration states reported that their Medicaid coverage in 2018 is similar to that of 2016. The findings indicate that the transparency requirements and process in place are working effectively, and that few states report significant new services from year-end 2016 to the 2018 fiscal year. To improve transparency and the quality of care in managed care, most demonstration states report only financial or other assistance from outside entities in FY 2018. The states and CMS would benefit from establishing common metrics to track progress and address disparities in cost and health care utilization among demonstration states. Since CMS\u2019s approval of new demonstrations has no expiration date, the transparency requirements in place have to remain in place until they are otherwise addressed. The process for monitoring demonstration states can be improved in a number of ways, such as by requiring states to track patients\u2019 data on a regular basis.", "WATER is one of two or three critical assets required in all war operations and conflicts, as well as in daily operations. There are significant questions regarding water availability in and near future. Army is managing water in accordance with DOD guidelines. The Military Departments are adopting best practices of water management. (See table below for detailed information.) Water scarcity is an issue for Army infrastructure and, if not addressed appropriately, can be a constraint for mission success. Army 20-year infrastructure forecasts anticipate that in 2045, more than 30% of Army water demand could not be satisfied because of limited resources, including water distribution lines. At that time, more than 50% of Army water will meet the Army\u2019s existing water quality standards or better. Army water resources include water source locations that need to meet Army water quality standards. For example, Army water source locations can include reservoirs, treatment plants, pipes, and pumps. Army water sources can be of the following types: groundwater, surface water, and other water. Army also manages wastewater generated from Army facilities by treatment of wastewater onsite on the bases or by recycling of the waste stream by Army wastewater treatment plants. 6 ARMY WATER MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES Army water policy and guidance is based on 30 principles that will be described below. These principles are: 1) Water as a resource, 2) Water conservation and accountability, 3) Water redistribution and trade-offs between water use and water for Army and Community Operations, 4) Water pollution: water used for Army or Community Operations, 5) Maintaining water quality in accordance with Army water quality standards, 6) Use of alternative water sources such as solar power, including, but not limited to 7) Solar-powered water purification stations, 8) Waste management treatment facilities on base, 9) Water and energy conservation practices, 10) Environmental and energy planning, 11) Water and energy conservation practices, 12) Waste management on installation, 13) Waste of water due to inefficiency, 14) Use of water as a weapon, 15) Water availability for Army water use, including Army water use requirements, 16) Water use standards by installation, and 17) Water use standards for Army facilities managed by an integrated facility support management system.

Page 2 GAx October 2019", "Under the working group\u2019s 2011 MOU, agencies are working to identify and address environmental justice issues. However, some agencies are struggling to determine where to report their progress and are unsure of their duties and responsibilities. As an output method, agencies could use NEPA analyses to consider environmental justice, similar environmental justice data sources could be used for case development, and the Environmental Justice Working Group could be a resource for agencies in the process of developing a comprehensive environmental justice strategy. To implement EPA\u2019s NEPA Environmental Justice Guidance, agencies need to adopt NEPA procedures that require them to consider environmental justice. EPA has not yet been provided information on how many agencies met the MOU\u2019s environmental justice requirements. A comprehensive analysis of agency progress in addressing environmental justice could be provided by incorporating the Small Business Administration\u2019s Business Environmental Roundtable Action Report on environmental justice into the Agency\u2019s report to Congress. Agencies should also be more aggressive in incorporating environmental justice into their public participation programs and have their progress in implementing environmental justice shown to their external stakeholders, including community organizations, environmental groups, and others. Agencies must also develop an integrated environmental justice policy and a coordinated environmental justice strategy that is designed to implement multiple environmental justice frameworks including the MOU\u2019s. Agency plans and actions related to environmental justice must be identified through existing NEPA procedures that apply to NEPA programs and projects, as applicable.

Due to the potential for catastrophic immediate fallout from the improper use of radioactive material, evacuation and relocation (up to 5 days) are recommended. When evacuating in response to radiation, these evacuations normally occur in areas with populations of fewer than 10 inhabitants. Radiological emergencies may occur (in areas with populations of larger than 10,000 inhabitants) and evacuation may occur. Domestically, NRC directs its radiation licensing and regulation tasks in the United States and other facilities.", "First, DHS and FEMA established a collaborative framework in 2016 to improve FEMA\u2019s process for assessing the economic ramifications of disaster recoveries, which FEMA has yet to finalize. DHS then conducted two-year follow-up periods (2019-2020 and 2020-2021), and FEMA assessed $10 billion in grant and other disaster payments to more than 4 million people in 2019; FEMA has yet to finalize their assessment. DHS and FEMA have yet to undertake a strategic framework to prioritize and coordinate their investments in resilience after major disasters. DHS and FEMA are providing disaster relief for Hurricane Maria in August 2019 and for the other hurricanes and wildfires in September 2019. The FEMA Disaster Financial Assistance Division (DFAD) administers the Public Assistance program, which through FEMA reimburses states for their public assistance payments to private property owners for losses greater than the $25,000 disaster threshold. FEMA disburses payments to local governments with public assistance costs for local government disaster expenditures, while payments to personal property owners are administered by the state and local governments. As of September 2019, $46 billion has been obligated to states, territories, and local governments in the Public Assistance program since 2005. In March 2019, FEMA awarded approximately $32.9 billion in CDBG-DR funds to 4 grantees as of February 2019\u2013$19.8 in Puerto Rico and $12.4 billion in Texas, with $5.3 billion awarded to Florida. Grantees were required to report their disbursements for fiscal years 2016 through 2019 to FEMA by November 3, 2019; if FEMA has not received the reports, state and local governments must still submit their disbursements by December 3, 2019.", "For the next fifty years, the state and local government sector is expected to be in sync with GDP increases. However, by the end of this simulation period, excess costs per capita will likely outpace GDP growth due to health care expenses. Additionally, employee compensation will increase on average faster than GDP. 1\n2 In order to calculate percentiles, the average, minimum, and maximum value were determined for GDP (%), state and local expenditures (%), and total expenditures (percent of GDP). Total expenditures are expressed as a percent of GDP. Exemptions include items such as local property taxes; the cost is calculated by applying the percent of GDP to the dollar value of the costs. Percentiles for state and local government expenditures are based on current and 50-year simulations. Expenditure components may differ slightly in the 50-year simulations due to lower health benefits costs. Table 4 summarizes percentiles of overall expenses (both employer and employee contributions) and the percentiles of each of the three individual components (total health costs, benefits payments, and wages/salaries). These percentiles were derived from a current year 50-year simulation based on health care costs in excess of GDP costs and the 50-year simulation based on current projections of a 25 percent employer contribution per capita for employee and retiree health costs to an ever-increasing amount. The difference is used to provide an indication of change in percentiles.

The specific guidelines that are shared must be consistent with the requirements in the applicable laws and policies. Due to the evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment, the best practices for implementing cybersecurity requirements may be found in future guidance or standards produced by the National Institute for Information and Security Technology\u2019s (NIST) Information Security (INF-A) standards. NIST is a Government Executive publication that will continue to be our online source for cybersecurity information and will be the source of information on this list and many others in the future. Agencies that share information using an information system that is hosted by a partner or shared between agencies will receive an NIST Assessment based upon their current and appropriate information protection controls and technical infrastructure requirements. This assessment must be taken into consideration where NIST is required as part of a specific acquisition or contract for an information system, or where an FBI investigation involving an incident, or the security information of an FBI employee, requires an FBI analysis. Agencies that share data using a shared information system system need to use a shared authentication method that provides a means of verifying that all users are authorized to access the system so that they can share information securely in accordance with policies. Agencies will use a single authentication system that provides a shared password, PIN card, or other personal identification method. Agencies will also use a single authentication system that provides a shared authentication method. Each user, in accordance with appropriate control measures, will be able to log in to the system with a standard account. The user will interact with the information system using application software, which may need to employ specialized functionality such as password/entrance security, data validation, or data modification authorization techniques. In addition, the user will interact with standard interfaces provided by application software. All software applications must have a unique (public) API address assigned to them so they can be accessed over the network from any source. Network access will occur on a shared connection using an authentication scheme that matches the authentication system in place, which will have access to the shared system. It is also identified as the authentication technique for any user interface access, which is public, to ensure that applications will function normally in each environment. A single authentication system using the government account system allows the same user ID/password to access multiple accounts on the same authentication network, which includes multiple shared information systems (SIS). The term \u201cpublic\u201d in terms of access is defined as \u201caccessable by a single user or a limited number of users,\u201d whereas \u201cpublic\u201d can mean access to the same data by multiple users. The term \u201cpublic\u201d and the term \u201cshared network is also defined in the terminology section of NIST documents FIP-13 and NIST SP 800-39/13/10, \u201cGuideline for Authentication of Persons to the Information System,\u201d that is referenced in our discussion. A unique (public) IP address for the user interface and a shared authentication are also described in FIPS-17/7/2. The system will be a single user ID, but a single authentication system is required. Access from multiple locations within the system is possible, but it is also possible to restrict the access to only one or more user that are defined in the database. NIST recommends that single authentication systems be implemented rather than separate authentication systems for each component with the same \u201cshared\u201d account/password. If access to the same system is restricted to a single account, a user may have difficulty accessing multiple applications or components within the system using a single password. In other cases, each component (system, agency, or even individual sites within a system) may have its own account, password, and authentication procedures. The use of a shared user account is also applicable when access to a single information system is permitted. Any authentication system that will access the network must be assigned a static IP address. The shared authentication system used for the government\u2019s information technology system (GITSU) is assigned a static IP (subnet) of 10.100.0.0/8. In addition, agencies will use IP addressing of a common domain name (.gov or.org), a (/) or a (.). NIST recommends that the (/dot) domain be used in combination with a static IP address and/or the dot domain be used for the purpose of protecting sensitive information in information systems that are authorized to access or transfer sensitive information. Access and exchange of network resources between federal bodies and their component entities is required on a shared, public network or a wide area network with a single account. An account for each individual component may have a different name that must be authenticated by the same password. It is also referenced that authentication systems used by federal agencies include single user accounts, but we do not recommend that these individual accounts be utilized beyond the appropriate requirements based on specific security needs. The authentication system is required for accessing and", "Agencies are failing to implement IT governance and processes. Agencies must modernize their $90 billion IT Investment portfolio.

Coast Guard Chief of Staff established the Office of Coast Guard Human Resources Strategy Committee in 2016. The Office implements the Coast Guard Human Resources Strategy, a comprehensive strategy supporting Coast Guard \u201chigh performing human capital\u201d efforts and focuses on workforce development, workforce information management, and the Coast Guard\u2019s diversity and outreach programs. Coast Guard Chief of Staff established the Office of Coast Guard Human Resources Strategy Committee in 2016. The Office implements the Coast Guard Human Resources Strategy, a comprehensive strategy supporting Coast Guard \"high performing human capital\" efforts and focuses on workforce development, workforce information management, and Coast Guard's diversity and outreach programs. Chief of the Coast Guard Staff The Coast Guard staff are organized into three groups: civilian employees, enlisted members, and commissioned officers.\nThe Coast Guard, for example, found that nearly 90 percent of the Coast Guard\u2019s information management processes were paper-based, even though nearly 90 percent of information was entered electronically, while paper-based processes are more resource intensive. When the Coast Guard switched to electronic-based processing, it made about $1 million/hour in resource and process improvements for its staff of over 10,000. There are more than 80 percent of Coast Guard staff in support roles for over $350,000 in resource value per hour. The Coast Guard spends more on administrative, support, and IT requirements than in any of the country\u2019s other military forces, requiring them to develop and implement innovative ways for tracking, monitoring, and controlling their IT networks and processes through automation. The Coast Guard realized that \u201ca little bit goes a long way\u201d in the past, but realized they had to make much more comprehensive changes in data tracking in order to improve their IT systems and their business processes. This led them to transition $1.3 billion dollars in IT-based processes, which included a data storage initiative with \u201cno single user that can access any data.\u201d Today, more than 350,000 documents are processed daily by the Coast Guard (approximately 10 percent of the workload) using automation techniques. The Coast Guard is currently preparing to transition their personnel systems system to a service-wide ERP system, which will not only include \u201cthe Coast Guard of the Coast Guard, in addition to the Department of Interior and Homeland Security Office of Personnel Management, but it will also provide a centralized portal for users to apply for and maintain a range of benefits.\u201d The Coast Guard has also adopted a strategy that is based on the Navy model, which includes the following strategies: 1. Deployable Information System Strategy: This means the Coast Guard is transitioning its IT systems into the current Navy IT infrastructure and applications, so they can share systems. 2. Shared Service Strategy: The Coast Guard will transition into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take on more / different missions. Currently, DHS is the primary system for the Coast Guard. 3. Cloud and Data Center Services Strategy: The Coast Guard is transitioning from an \u201cold, stand-alone Data Services Center (to) DHS\u2019 Information Infrastructure Management / Cloud Services Program, to a modern, cloud-based platform. They are currently adopting Azure and moving to an all-public cloud application.\n(1) The Coast Guard uses an information service center (ISC) in Fort Worth, Texas, as the primary system for the management of its data, information, and communications systems (ITS). It is responsible for all aspects of network communications, including those related to the integration and support of multiple applications and devices over the single IT infrastructure. The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 1403 standard was recently implemented by the Coast Guard and other organizations within DHS. The Coast Guard is transitioning into DHS\u2019 Information Infrastructure Management (Cloud) and Data Center Services (DCS) program. The current Coast Guard ISC will be transitioned to DHS\u2019 Central Data Hub (CDH), so all data processing and network services should be transitioned to DHS. (2) The Coast Guard Information Technology (CTIT) Directorate currently manages multiple data and IT networks across all Coast Guard locations. These networks were either built individually at each Coast Guard location, or on a piecemeal basis as the Coast Guard consolidated into its single headquarters. The IT and OT network structure will not be centralized at the Coast Guard, but instead dispersed to the field locations, where the Coast Guard will have multiple sites for the continuity of its IT infrastructure (e.g., one for system development, one for computer network and hardware support, one for network operations management systems, etc.).\nThe Coast Guard", "In the past five years, GSA completed 36 major Federal Government Construction Projects at a total cost of approximately $3.2 billion and an average duration of approximately 43 months; 64 percent of the projects were R&A, with R&A projects costing an average of about $42 million yet taking about 13 months longer than new construction projects; 25 percent of the projects were located in GSA Region 11.

The IRS has not provided an update since 2015 and has not responded to our April 2015 comments for a recent update on the overall tax gap, which is now more than $4 trillion. As a result, taxpayers, businesses, and the government are not well positioned for the tax gap. A common theme in tax gap studies is the idea that noncompliance could be reduced by developing better strategies for reducing the tax gap, including better tax compliance incentives. For example, our 2016 study on small business income tax reporting concluded that tax compliance rates have increased significantly over the past decade. We found that tax compliance rates were higher among small businesses in 2016 than we had been the case since 2005, a development largely driven by improved enforcement. Taxpayers, businesses, and government agencies all benefit with no more extensive changes on tax administration, which were estimated at $68 billion. We also found that smaller businesses, which are more common in the payment of taxes, had a significantly higher compliance rate in 2016. Compliance rates were also higher at all age levels. In addition, we found that businesses are significantly more likely to pay taxes, as we discovered in 2016. In contrast, 95 percent of businesses in 2016 did not report any payment of payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are critical for funding a broad range of government services, including workers' compensation insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and disability. We also found that self-employed businesses paid more taxes on net profits than businesses that are incorporated. Small businesses are significant contributors to business and sales tax revenues, yet their tax compliance rates have fluctuated for decades. However, our 2016 study identified that small businesses have recently had a higher tax compliance rate. As we reported, IRS compliance efforts during the 2000s had resulted in a more than 50 percent reduction in tax evasion, though we are now more than a decade later. With the tax gap as vast as we reported in 2016, as well as a continuing influx of newly-established business, we are losing ground. Even so, we believe the 2016 study will point us towards strategies to significantly reduce the tax gap. Some areas, we argue, that could be worth revisiting are the number of reporting entities that are subject to both civil and criminal investigations for tax evasion and false reporting of income. For noncompliance related to employment tax, taxpayers should know who is conducting the employment tax. Some (especially small businesses) should report only on Form 1094, which is a noncompliance mechanism. IRS and states have used their respective administrative tools for reporting to third-party information reporting and noncompliance mechanisms. For noncompliance related to small business income tax, there will likely be additional reporting requirements. This could include identifying taxpayers for whom income is reported each year to IRS and who receives wage and employment tax withholdings for 2019. For taxpayers related to income tax, we believe that Congress should be considering more information reporting and collection options for income tax filers, taxpayers, and intermediaries. We found that taxpayers are only subject to a single assessment on their tax return. For the IRS, we recommend that it be able to obtain detailed data from taxpayer returns if they need to and that a taxpayer-specific collection system be implemented. For the IRS, in the case of fraudulent filers, the tax gap is typically a victim of a false claimant. For this type of error, taxpayers should be able to report fraudulent filers in a way that IRS can respond with a \u201cno\u201d answer. At least for fraudulent filers, an additional civil penalty would deter bad behavior. We recommend an additional penalty to discourage filers from claiming tax credits, deductions, and other incentives in the case of fraud by taxpayers, while leaving these benefits to nonfraudulent taxpayers. We also encourage reporting filers and taxpayers to IRS and tax agents to catch wrongfully listed filers and taxpayers. The IRS should be able to respond with a \u201cno\u201d answer because the tax gap is a victim of fake filers. This would encourage proper and complete tax compliance, which could result in better fiscal condition for both taxpayers and businesses. Table 1: Tax Gap, Fiscal Year of Reporting..

Table 1: Short-Term Holding Facilities and IHSC Staff", "In 2009, Congress passed CHIPRA significantly raising the ad valorem rate applicable to large cigars that are imported. Before CHIPRA, federal excise taxes on each tobacco product were higher than on cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco and small cigars. CHIPRA equalized\u2014on a per stick basis for all tobacco products\u2014the federal excise tax rate paid by manufacturers of these products.

CHIPRA does not apply to small cigar manufacturers. ** $14 per $25 pack. ** Small cigarettes include small cigar products such that they are not roll-your-own, or do not roll-your- own into the base of the cigar in a way that allows for federal excise tax. Electronic tobacco products are tobacco products that are manufactured, processed, and made in a manner that are unique than other tobacco products. In addition, electronic tobacco products are made in an FDA-regulated factory and the nicotine in these products is extracted from tobacco. Additionally, electronic tobacco products are not offered for sale in a manner that is unique or different than other tobacco products. Tobacco products, including but not limited to cigarettes, small cigars, and pipe tobacco, can only be produced by manufacturers that are regulated by the FDA. These items can be made and sold as long as their nicotine content is limited to 10 percent or less. If they contain even small amounts of nicotine, these items are prohibited from being made by manufacturers that are regulated by the FDA as a separate category, known as \"small cigars\" or \"cigarettes.\" As a result, electronic cigarettes have been marketed on TV. Furthermore, 7.2 percent of adults and 20.3 percent of current cigarette users used electronic tobacco products at the time of interview, making these products a very high consumption category. Of the nearly $10 billion in ad hoc taxes, small cigar and roll-your-own tobacco manufacturers had to pay 100 percent of the tax on a product that was defined as large cigar, small cigar, or cigar box that is not 100 percent tobacco. Currently, the excise tax on large cigar and small cigar manufacturers are each set at $13.32 per thousand sticks/1 gram. Cigarette, roll-your-own tobacco and cigar box manufacturers are only responsible for paying $50 per pack of 5 cigarettes; $3 per pack of 25 cigarettes or a maximum of $.50 per cigarette for an amount less than $10 per pack.

They do so on a case-by-case basis for UACs and at least a mandatory detention period for asylum-seekers. Family UACs are typically transferred to ICE together pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings. DHS-HHS roles in processing immigration families are: DHS and HHS separate children from parents, and DHS officials manage decisions to place children in expedited or full immigration proceedings. DHS-HHS roles for processing families are generally limited to family separation and processing of cases that DHS officials determine involve criminal issues. The average time children UACs spend in the Border Patrol is approximately 2 hours, a DHS official said. They are held in a shelter, in which they are required to make a secure call to a UAC hotline, after which a HHS case manager will decide the best way forward for each family unit. The DHS does not have sufficient resources to house families in the manner that the federal government used to conduct detention centers. Border Patrol agents and officers do family processing, such as deciding on family separations. ORR and Immigration Judge\u2019s Office use family processing guidelines in deciding which cases to refer for case-by-case review for UACs within 72 hours. As a result of increased cases of immigrant families seeking asylum and having children in detention, DHS recently implemented a zero-tolerance policy along the southwest border, resulting in a slight increase in families being apprehended there. There were 3,326 beds for a family residential center. Family processing guidelines used to decide which cases to refer for UACs within 72 hours. 1.8 million cases were processed within 1-4 days of intake; some families waited as long as 30-40 days or more for their final hearing. DHS, HHS, and ICE personnel each took slightly different approaches on how to adjudicate family cases within 72 hours. DHS was able to complete family status change petitions for these families within an average of 6-8 weeks. DHS also reported the average time children UACs spent in the border patrol is approximately 2 hours. DHS has approximately 2,500 in-use detention centers. The DHS has custody of these children through either HHS or Homeland Security Affairs, which are a network of DHS and HHS positions. Children would be placed in a shelter or family residential center before being released to a HHS caseworkers. DHS also has two offices on the southwest border where they have access to a detention bed capacity. DHS has separate detention centers for juvenile offenders. Children would be transferred to another DHS center. DHS must assess the child\u2019s safety and make a joint decision with HHS and CBP whether these children should be separated from their parents in a detention center. DHS has the ability to release in-custody children or those in detention status. HHS/ICE/CBP UAC children will be transported to a center 18 miles away from the field in Karnes City, Texas. Children at Karnes City are placed on a detention bed, not a detention centre. The average length of time that a child would be there is 60-90 days. Families are then transported to a DHS facility on Paseo Padre Blvd., in Brownsville, Texas. DHS works with the UAs to facilitate the children\u2019s release to their families as soon as possible. Homeland Security UACs are placed in a detention centre, or a detention centre with dormitories. There are some other immigration detention centres where families would be held up to 30-40 days. Some of the families in detention centres are held up for more than a year. DHS has used a policy whereby children are released to US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) custody for the final portion of their family processing proceedings. DHS is able to provide DHS/CBP UACs with a variety of support services in addition to legal processing. Some of the DHS/CBP processing processing services offered. These include the processing of biometric data, fingerprinting, background checks, and social security checks. DHS also has immigration processing centres in 10 cities in the United States. DHS works with 21 immigration offices in the world and manages their processing of a variety of immigration cases in the United States. DHS has 18 immigration offices where they manage processing. The DHS is also processing immigration cases from countries outside the United States. On the non-immigration side, DHS also performs certain other functions in the U.S. for their nonimmigrant visas. For these purposes, the average time was 26 days. There are two ways to do immigrant visas processing, U.Visa processing and O/O process. The U.Visa processing time is 4-9 months, whereas the O/O processing time is 11-42 days. DHS also has the use of a wide variety of tools to", "The Interior Department has oversight responsibility for the development of federal oil and gas resources located under more than 260 million surface acres, 700 million subsurface acres, and 1.7 billion acres offshore. In 2017, BOEM leased approximately 8.7 million acres for 10 new lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico. The Interior Department estimates that these leasing activities will result in more than $1 billion in royalty revenue.

Last Updated: 09 September 18, 2018", "DHS components, HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (ORRA), EOIR, and various other federal agencies have policies to help determine the validity of the identity of UACs. CBP documents personal information from each person, conducts biographical data entry on forms, and works with the UAC\u2019s legal representatives, among other steps. FIGURE 1: Immigration proceedings typically include a variety of DHS components for DHS\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Identity Management (OFEO) to perform identity detection procedures. For the purposes of this report, DHS components are generally referred to as HHS OFETR and SSA\u2019s Office of International Research and Analysis as DHS components. DHS\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Identity Management (OFEO) has several roles in UAC procedures. This report briefly describes these roles: \u00a7\u00a7 252.17 and 252.18, respectively). USCIS conducts a biographical data collection, Form I-765, and obtains biographical data from each applicant. In reviewing the biographical data entries on Form I-765, USCIS reviews its guidelines on fraud, error, and other common issues associated with the application package, and verifies the accuracy of the data. If USCIS documents indicate that the person is ineligible to receive a petition from the Attorney General, DHS OFETR performs a biometric identification verification (UAV) of USCIS A-file material. As OFETR has learned that many DHS components and EOIR generally retain biometric identification material on their applications for use in UAV processes, DHS components are generally required to use a DHS-developed biometric identification system, DHS Office of International Research and Analysis (DHS OIRA), to verify USCIS\u2019s data findings. Additionally, DHS components are required to keep track of USCIS data and DHS data on each UAC case, as necessary, in accordance with DHS component policies and procedures. DHS procedures are used extensively in processing UACs, a process that can be extremely time consuming. In processing these cases, DHS components have developed procedures designed to provide timely process and decision-making capability, by providing the following resources and guidance to their customers: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 DHS\u2019s [I]NSE processing system, which is a DHS core element, conducts multiple checks, including biometric identification, in order to prevent fraud and identify ineligible individuals. DHS component procedures are designed to work together seamlessly, by establishing clear expectations of DHS workload procedures. DHS, in these instances, has also developed procedures to keep UACs from becoming lost in DHS systems. These procedures include, among others: DHS requiring UACs to be physically present at the start of processing; DHS requiring UACs to appear with a parent or legal guardian in certain circumstances; DHS requiring UACs to submit and maintain documentation supporting claims that a child has no lawful immigration status; DHS implementing check-in procedures at the beginning and end of a request in processing UACs, to ensure that all DHS components are performing and communicating correctly; and DHS requiring UACs to wait for a short period of time before their application process can begin. In addition, DHS has the appropriate systems and processes, with the addition of EOIR, to ensure consistency and uniformity in the UAC\u2019s data entry and processing at various DHS component offices and components, as applicable. DHS\u2019s processes and procedures are subject to continuous DHS updates as DHS learns, through DHS\u2019s [T]alented, Impeccable, and Vigilant and Safe (TAPS) initiative, that DHS has to stay current and modify DHS processing procedures, which is DHS\u2019s goal for all of DHS\u2019s processes, including the one dealing with processing the UAC\u2019s. DHS components do their best to keep a UAC\u2019s records on the correct DHS system. DHS has a system in place that can help DHS components locate information on any DHS application. DHS, in its processes (as applicable), is required to: Use its IENS database and INA, e-verify DHS application, to validate that the family applicant is in the DHS system, and DHS has appropriate documentation to support their claims; document the identity of every DHS application and processing event in the DHS database; and process DHS application documents within established DHS processing standards. DHS\u2019s IAD, as applicable, is used to validate UAC\u2019s identities before processing their documents and the application for an Alien Registration Number (ARN). UACs for whom DHS provides the application processing are required to complete an Online Nonimmigrant and Immigrant Form (INF), which is a form DHS uses to validate all INA applicants, including UACs. DHS must evaluate any applications submitted by UACs. DHS may, on occasion, use an online visa processing system, such as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), to process the visa application if a UAC\u2019s application is accepted", "On average, economic mobility is declining, and the data suggest racial/ethnic differences. Parents and the geographic location of where a child grows up are also important predictors of economic mobility. 1. Intergenerational Economic Mobility Measure This chart is a modified version of an earlier, related chart; it shows the Intergenerational Economic 2. IGE Intergenerational Economic Mobility (I.E.E.) Index. In 2016, the IGE index was 0.88. It is constructed using data from the Census Bureau and SCF. Children born from 1871 to 1982/1934. 3. Intergenerational Education and Economic Mobility of Asian American Households in 2016 In the 2016 census, Asian Americans had a higher median individual income than the other racial groups. They found a statistically significant income advantage relative to the other racial groups. Asian Americans with a college degree were highly likely to have a job in 2016, even more likely than all groups except whites. The largest absolute socioeconomic mobility deficit in 2016 was for Asian Americans living in the South. In the rest of the country, Asian Americans and Whites had similar median incomes. 4. Millennial Economic Mobility Index (MEI) The Millennial Economic Mobility Index (MEI), constructed using data from Pew Research Center, was created as an index for mobility among 1.4 million adults ages 30 and older. In 2016, the median economic mobility rate for Millennial households was 58 percent vs. 62 percent for non-Millennials. The economic mobility metric looks at economic mobility of the parent generation of children ages 18-38. It is constructed using data from Pew Research Center, and it is used to determine the economic mobility of U.S. children from birth to 32 years old. 5. Income Inequality: Economic Mobility and Inheritance in the Postfinancial Crisis Era The median income income of nonresident, full-time employed U.S. adults in 2016 was 82 percent. While the income of full-time employed Millennial adults had risen by double from the early 2000s, it was still lower than their parents at age 30. The median income of Millennial adults in 2016 was about 67 percent, which was slightly higher than their parents at age 30, while still lower than their parent's at age 30. The research finds that income mobility is declining despite increasing college attainment and rising wage rates from 2006 to 2016, which is consistent with previous research that Millennials are facing an overall deterioration in economic mobility. 6. Economic Mobility of American College Graduates In the 2001-2016 American Community Survey, 55 percent of people with a higher education have some college, 67 percent graduated from high school, and 61 percent of adults lived in an apartment or condo in 2016, whereas in 2000, only 34 percent of adults were living in an apartment or condo. In 2016, the median income of households headed by college graduates was 72 percent, whereas the median income of households headed by high school graduates was at 50 percent. College graduates had 26 percent of household income, while those with a high school diploma had only 18 percent of household income, which suggests 6-year olds may be on pace to attain the same financial status as college graduates later in their life. 7. Income Inequality Decades After Inequality In Childhood Is Growing The median wage of children born to mothers between September 1949 and April 1962 was 21 percent higher than that of children born in 1970. In addition, the poverty rate among children born to mothers after September 1962 was 13 percent higher than the children 1949-2010 cohort. The latest research shows that the income inequality gap has increased since 1960, and that children born to younger mothers (1949 or later) experienced a 43 percent greater income inequality compared to older mothers 1960 to 1960. Older mothers also held a larger portion of household wealth (62 percent) compared to younger mothers (38 percent). The proportion of wealth owned by younger mothers of children born to younger mothers has declined from 42 percent in 1970 to 11 percent in 2000. Even with the decline in income inequality in the past years, children born to white mothers earned higher median wages than children born to nonwhite mothers (see fig. 6 for median earnings). Similarly, the median household income for children of black men is higher ($27,390 per year) than children of white men ($18,990 per year), and children of Hispanic non-Hispanic men have a median income of $17,710 per year, which is lower than that of white men. 8.

Methadone was available to approximately 25 percent of veterans receiving medication-assisted treatment (Methadone). VHA works with external treatment providers on the ground to provide medication-assisted treatment (Methadone) by prescription, while VHA has opioid overdose prevention initiatives. Prior to June 6, 2019, eligible veterans could access community care by authorizing community care. On June 6, 2019, the Veterans Community Care Program went into effect, which consolidates existing programs into one streamlined program.", "U.S. Navy ships are repaired or maintained primarily at overseas homeportings, where maintenance roles can vary greatly from the ship\u2019s operational department. The Navy bases its ships at overseas homeporting stations for the maximum material cost and maintenance cost efficiency, as the vessels\u2019 upkeep periods are usually more than just a few weeks. The Navy reports that type commanders and a working group are involved to ensure that required maintenance is accomplished and that the ships reach their intended service life at a 7- to 10-year period, with the ship\u2019s homeport often chosen to allow for maximum efficiencies. Ships with older hulls and systems\u2014up to a decade\u2013 have to undergo maintenance and repair of complex mechanical and electrical systems, not easily replaceable. The maintenance and modernization cycle of vessels in the forward deployed region is a constant part of the Navy\u2019s program. In the late 2018 period, the Navy maintains 3,500 ships and submarines on the modernized DDG-9 class (a guided missile destroyer). Maintenance is a critical element of the Navy\u2019s mission to defend the country. While the Navy has modernized its fleet with many advanced systems and devices, such a ship\u2019s combat systems and weapons must still be maintained. The Navy must keep track of its ships\u2019 equipment usage throughout their 40-year life cycles to sustain the capability of the system to perform required maintenance and mission tasks. As the U.S. Navy prepares for the modernization of many of its older ships, there will still likely be a requirement to maintain each vessel\u2019s mission equipment capabilities through repairs and periodic maintenance, ensuring its readiness for deployment on the modernized ships.", "The Direct Loan Program provides assistance to students, parents or guardians for payment of the cost of education. Borrowers can receive a range of benefits from the federal government, including fixed-rate federal loans, grants for tuition, fees, etc., and more flexible loans that allow borrowers to repay in monthly installments rather than a single payment. Each loan type requires the borrower to certify income, family size and other information before receiving loan amounts. All loans have repayment periods of from several months to 25 years. The Direct Loan Program currently includes several types of loans (see sidebar). Current loans are Subsidized Stafford Loans, which allow a part of the loans to be forgone in order to apply for a Pell grant. They are made available directly by Education to undergraduate and graduate students, or through a consortium of colleges. These loans also are tax-exempt until the borrower begins repayment or the funds are repaid. They are the only federal student loans available to graduate students, as well as the only long-term loans that do not repay during a borrower\u2019s non-payment-related bankruptcy. A lender can charge up to 3% on top of loans for borrowers with adverse credit. To be eligible for federal student loans, eligible candidates must meet certain citizenship requirements. However, citizenship requirements have been amended to allow for an option of a non-citizen, permanent legal resident, or the child of any other eligible citizen or permanent legal resident. The amount that students can borrow depends on their status as the recipient(i.e., recipient will repay all loan amounts) or co-recipient(i.e., co-recipient will co-repay all loan amounts) of these loans. A borrower can have multiple loans(i.e., up to ten) in existence at any time. The maximum amount a borrower may receive is $23,000 per year and $108,000 to $120,000 throughout their entire college career at most colleges. In addition, graduate students can receive $500,000 in loans. There is no specific minimum income limit. In the case of a student\u2019s death, the university or college is responsible for payment of loan balances that were due at the time of the student\u2019s death under the terms of a loan repayment plan. It is important to keep track of the monthly payment on each loan, as well as any changes to the income of the student or parent as circumstances change. Students are encouraged to contact Education regarding any questions or concerns regarding payment of their federal loans. They may also refer to the website of each of the more than 1,000 financial institutions (\u201cFinancial Aid Offices\u201d) involved in administering the Direct Lending program. Information and application materials can be obtained from Education by calling 888-557-7280 or visiting the websites and. \u201cDirect\u201d or \u201cDirect student loans\u201d in general refer to loans made by the government as opposed to the loans made by the College. These loans allow the borrower to receive the federal money through any approved institution \u2013 generally a university, college, community college to attend at... even if the student is at his or her own home. Federal student loan programs are available to help pay for cost of education at colleges, universities, and vocational schools; and for some vocational and technical training programs at community colleges. The federal Direct Student Loan Program provides interest-free loans up to $10 million annually. The loan is awarded directly to the student for purposes similar to tuition and fees, room and board, and other expenses directly related to education. The program is administered by the Department of Education and has established policies for all educational institutions. The interest rate is currently set at 3.75%, but it varies on an annual basis. The maximum repayment period is 25 years, which for most loans can be extended in increments of five years. There is a $50 fee associated with submitting all loan information to the Department of Education. To apply for federal student loans, the student must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form (see figure). Once the Financial Aid Officer processes the application, the student will receive an offer of (direct) loans from the Department of Education.", "Lebanon is a small, religiously diverse country bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Illustrated in figure 1) with tensions among religious groups concerning sectarian power-sharing. Since 2013, objectives support the LAF, ISF, and state institutions for national defense, border and maritime security, and counterterrorism. U.S. agencies provide security assistance to LAF, ISF by supporting LAF and ISF with training, equipment, and sustainment. LAF, ISF, and US security forces are required by law to jointly report their use of Foreign Military Sales equipment.", "SEC supervisors are perceived as skilled. In one-third of survey participants\u2019 organizations, SEC supervisors are perceived as either very good or excellent supervisors). In general, survey results showed that SEC\u2019s supervisors are well-regarded by employees. Approximately three-fourths of SEC employees said that their supervisors are approachable and are willing to answer their supervisor\u2019s questions (90 percent of survey participants). In contrast, somewhat less than half of employees indicated that their supervisor actively sought their opinion on topics at work, and nearly four-fifths indicated that their supervisor listens carefully to their employees\u2019 suggestions. The results of our survey of SEC employees also indicate that their supervisors are well-regarded in other areas. For example, almost all employees who participated in the survey (97 percent) said that their supervisors are trustworthy. Similarly, more than 80 percent of survey participants strongly agreed that their supervisors should be included in decisions about when to fire an employee (85 percent), and agreed that their supervisors should be included in decisions to terminate an employee\u2019s access to secure facilities (80 percent). By far the largest number of employees reported that their supervisor asks their opinion about the performance of others, at well over 90 percent. Of those employees in our survey who work in SEC\u2019s regional offices, a full 93 percent agreed that their supervisor is willing to answer their questions about how to perform their job duties. In addition, most survey participants agreed that their supervisors have the technical knowledge and skills for the complex and complex tasks required at SEC. For example, 99 percent of employees indicated that most of their supervisors are well-regarded in their technical work. In summary, Survey results generally showed favorably about SEC supervisors. A full 90 percent indicated that their supervisors ask them for their input and listen closely to their suggestions. Furthermore, about five-sixths of employees confirmed their supervisors\u2019 willingness to answer their questions, and close to 90 percent of employees agreed that the SEC\u2019s supervisors are trustworthy, well-regarded, and should be involved in important decisions. SEC Mission-Critical Functions SEC\u2019s Office of Human Capital Management ( OHM ) was recently renamed Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) in order to change its mission to an agency leader in ensuring that federal employees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. Its primary role is to ensure (a) that SEC employees have the most relevant and up-to-date skills and knowledge from recognized experts who are experienced in the latest technologies, best practices, and methods; and (b) to continuously implement strategies and techniques to use these skills to enhance SEC\u2019s service to the Congress and its clients. They also provide management, human resources, and administrative services to SEC. Figure 2: The Agency\u2019s Mission-Critical Functions. The chart listed in figure 2 shows the structure and functions of SEC\u2019s Office of Human Capital Management (OHC). The current structure is based on the 2001 Act and has been amended since by the SEC, resulting in some shifts to the current structure. The SEC also performs the Human Capital and Technology Support Services that supports about 500 employees. The information technology system in the OHC is currently named the SEAC system, based on the system\u2019s structure. This name change recognizes the move from a unit-based system (OHME was formed into \u201cOEM,\u201d which has been renamed OHM ) to an acronym-based one (\"SEAC\"). The current structure and roles of the Human Capital, Technology, and Other Support Resources (HCTER) function are currently consolidated in the Office of Human Resources. SEC employs approximately 8,000 employees, most of whom are full-time and whose positions are in the range of mid-career to executive and administrative roles. Human Capital Office The current OHC has a team responsible for human Capital services (Human Resources). The HR team is comprised of approximately 400 employees. (Approximate values for these employees, as well as salary and per capita, are listed below or see figure 6 on page of Appendix III. Human Resources The OHC team operates the current HR system, which includes the Human Resources division, and serves as an important resource to each division within the OHC. A number of other OHC divisions are located in various OHC offices. These OHC offices are in the DC area, with about 250 employees each. Figure 6: Human Capital HR. In 2010, 94 percent of,600 employees reported that they would be likely or very likely to leave SEC. Figure 3-A: The Agency\u2019s Compensation Program. This survey includes the average salary and per- capita salary of SEC employees. The most employees reported that their salary is within the range of $62,000 to $77,000 per year. In addition, the average age (age is based on years reported), which was approximately 44, is slightly higher", "The Modern Technology Fund Act authorizes $1.8 billion over the next decade, which is available for agencies to modernize their IT systems and move them to the cloud.

The most recent initiative, Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS), was supposed to be delivered in three increments but faced challenges, including integration of SPADOC and completing space situational awareness data collection. Since COICCS program plans were not aligned with the program's financial and information technology needs, program costs exceeded the required budget.

The ISPS states that it will focus on specific space program goals outlined by the Space Force to establish a space network and command structure.\nThis report summarizes the Air Force\u2019s efforts to modernize and consolidate command and control and space situational awareness systems at a total cost of approximately $240 million over 15 years, including a decade of design delays, overridden program costs, and an inability to meet requirements.", "In the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, ESF#8 coordinators, including ASPR, were requested to help a population of older adults who were among those that suffered the most. The response required extensive evacuation and a significant level of medical care. In comparison, approximately 16 percent of the general population in 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia has an average age of 65 or older, or 3.3 million older adults. DOD, VA, FEMA, and ASPR provided a coordinated response across multiple locations to support the evacuation and medical care of older adults. The response was orchestrated through the established processes of the National Response Framework, as well as those processes unique to each organization. The process included identifying and integrating stakeholders at each level of emergency and coordinating across jurisdictions to provide assistance and support to older adults. Older adults in both rural and urban areas can be served through multiple systems and platforms, including the mobile medical clinics, fixed and mobile treatment facilities, and tele-medicine services. In conclusion, the entire response, from the evacuation of older adults to post-recovery efforts were coordinated and executed to meet needs and improve lives of older adults by providing timely, effective, and coordinated medical support. In summary, following the National Response Framework and other guidelines, FEMA led the response efforts in coordination with local, state, or other federal agencies. FEMA requested assistance from both medical and other support agencies, including but not limited to the DOD, VA, civilian, or foreign assets. ASPR supported the response at both emergency and response levels. ASPR and other organizations provided medical response teams, evacuation, patient care, and medical evacuation support to evacuate older adults and support their medical recovery. ASPR evaluated HHS\u2019 response activities, collected feedback about the response activities, and developed corrective actions to address identified areas for improvement. Additionally, ASPR also reviewed the age cohort of population in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and compared it to the age cohort of the general U.S. population. While the National Response Framework processes are unique to each agency, ASPR has the role of coordination the response efforts across federal agencies. This coordination is an integral part of supporting older adult evacuations and ensuring timely and effective medical care.", "FAA\u2019s FAA Air Traffic Service operates the New York, Oakland, and Hampton, Va. flight information regions from which FAA-air traffic controllers receive information on an aircraft\u2019s position using ADS-B. The technology also provides surveillance of a craft\u2019s progress which can be shared with pilots. Domestic air traffic controllers typically receive information via radar, as well as with ADS-B. However, the technology\u2019s role in air traffic management in certain airspaces remains uncertain based on available data.", "Ensuring that there is time to perform acquisition planning activities and identifying the contracting workforce required to execute mission needs can help agencies establish a strong foundation for successful acquisition outcomes. However, our report identified challenges in FEMA\u2019s acquisition planning practices and tool, as well as issues with FEMA\u2019s contracting guidance and plans. To overcome these challenges, FEMA should develop a new contracting strategy for its acquisition planning process, which includes clear objectives of advance contracts and prioritization of their use. FEMA should also update existing guidance on its procurement process, including how it prioritizes the use of advance contracts for disaster response work. FEMA should be sure that contracting officials are familiar with MAPS and are aware of FEMA\u2019s acquisition planning guidance before entering into new agreements, which limits their ability to exercise their own judgment (and further increases efficiency). FEMA should also be sure to consult with its acquisition officer prior to entering into certain contracts. In 2/11/2019 FEMA sent a letter saying that current FEMA procedures for \u201cbridge contracts\u201d will result in bridge contract funding, and that bridge contract funding will be in the line item budget. The letter also included FEMA's intent to implement MAPS and its plan for all phases of MAPS. According to FEMA, FEMA has implemented a new procurement strategy called \u201cProject Acquisition Management (PAM) System\u201d. This new system allows FEMA to track contracts across the entire acquisition lifecycle \u2013 from start to finish. FEMA explained that their \u201cold\u201d procurement strategy allowed FEMA to perform pre-selection for contractors, but that they were now adopting a \u201cfar more modern procurement technique\u201d involving a competitive evaluation. FEMA's plan includes the use of the PAM strategy across their \u201cold\u201d acquisition model, so that a more modern and competitive procurement will have occurred. For more information on FEMA\u2019s PAM model, refer to DHS\u2019 Management of Federal Programs Report to FEMA, which describes FEMA\u2019s current procurement process. DHS required FEMA to develop a new contract model to make contracting easier, more efficient, and more flexible. DHS now recommends that FEMA use their new contracting tool, MAPS and related guidance to enhance its internal procurement system. DHS also stated that FEMA needed to clarify its procurement processes to ensure that the new system meets FEMA\u2019s requirements. In addition, DHS stated that FEMA needed to define its procurement strategies for specific types of acquisitions and/or contracts. DHS encouraged FEMA to take an integrated approach and create strategies for sourcing and procurement, since DHS cannot guarantee procurement performance. DHS also recommended that FEMA develop a new solicitation to create a contracting vehicle of a \u201cfull- life cost contract.\u201d DHS stated that this contract allows DHS to manage their risk of contracting problems and also allows DHS to save their time and resources when negotiating with vendors. DHS also encouraged FEMA to use PAM to track vendor performance, where PAM will be responsible for tracking and monitoring contracts to help FEMA perform a risk assessment and perform performance evaluations of vendors. DHS also encouraged FEMA to develop a new contract for acquisitions of \u201cpre-manufactured medical products\u201d. DHS stated that FEMA could use the DHS Procurement Gateway system or DHS\u2019s Acquisition Transformation program to handle the procurement. DHS now recommended that FEMA no longer pay the costs of FEMA inspections for all medical products and consider using PAM to track their supplier\u2019s compliance with safety, quality and regulatory requirements. DHS also encourages to FEMA to clarify which contracts (if any) require PAM to improve vendor performance. DHS\u2019 comments were helpful to DHS in identifying areas where FEMA needed to improve and enhance the internal information systems and processes available to both DHS and FEMA..", "Medicaid expenditures are financed jointly by the federal government and the states.

Additionally, the ACS has expanded its measures of households and households to new geographic levels, from Census to Census-block level. Although the ACS has a wider geographic range, for the 2020 census the Bureau has decided to sample the decennial geographic units of the Census and ACOs. As in previous censuses, respondents to questionnaires, also known as \u201ccensuses\u201d will answer queries regarding data ranging from the number of years spent in the current household to the number of years the current household has been located near a body of water or on other nearby geographies. Additionally, data that are usually collected from the Census in the census form include respondents' marital status, race, Hispanic origin, and place of work. Census 2030, mandated in the 2010 Census Act, will be conducted every 10 years beginning in 2020. Census questions will continue to be structured to be flexible and adapt to changing population characteristics. Census responses will be collected throughout the year beginning October 24, 2020. Census materials will be available for all U.S. locations through November 24, 2020. They can be acquired for $.44 in a variety of languages. The Census Bureau will take in every one centimeter of data. Census results for Census 2020 (a decennial census) will be collected from each respondent electronically using census questionnaires. Census questions will be tailored to current population characteristics, including the number of years a respondent and his or her spouse have worked in the same place. It will be possible for Census 2020 to be conducted through electronic questionnaires. Census materials will be available for all U.S. locations through November 24, and responses may be submitted online. The Census Bureau will take in all data, regardless of respondent preferences, from approximately 1.7 percent of Americans; or 3 out of 100,000 in other words. Census results for Census 2020 will be collected from each respondent who will complete an electronic questionnaire. Census questions will be tailored to current population characteristics, including the number of years a respondent and his or her spouse have worked in the same place.

On December 12, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order on National Security. In its final form, which was made public on February 6, 2018, the Trump administration ordered the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop plans to modernize the Census. This approach will include moving census questions in areas not previously collected and adding new data on geographics and the economy. GSA also established an Information Technology Modernization Program Council and instructed the Census Bureau to implement several projects. Those include using census data to support the Census' ability to serve as a data provider for additional census organizations, updating Census-based data products that are used for internal and external purposes, deploying data analytics systems designed to provide real time data that supports operational, analytic and policy-based responses, and modernizing and automating geospatial data collection, analysis and visualization capabilities. Two large scale tests are scheduled to occur in 2019 through the Census Bureau Administrative Professional Census. These tests will test several major components of the Census Bureau\u2019s administrative operations. The Census Bureau conducted a test of the modern Census questionnaire on Census interviewers in 2016. They will begin testing Census questions for interviewers in 2019. The Census Bureau began field testing of Census questionnaires with a small sample of Census staff members and contractors in 2018. According to Census Bureau Director Gina Goldstein, the Census Bureau will begin field testing with a small sample of Census households in 2019. Ms. Goldstein remarked that the Census data should be available for online and future mobile use. The Census has conducted several large scale tests in the past few years with different Census forms. These tests included the Census Supplemental Questionnaire to determine the number of housing units on household blocks, to test Census coding logic as well as data and other questions. One of the more recent tests was of census questions related to census and 2015 census in the Census 2010-2015 survey. This survey used Census language to ask a cross-sectional sample of households and housing units about census and their related data. The survey was administered between August 10, 2016, and October 1, 2016.

In 2016, we noted that in the future, SBA\u2019s 8(a) program would have to be retooled to be aligned with the business enterprise environment that ANCs are in. For our review, we noted that only one of the participating ANCs had 100 full-time employees, which was considered a small business in 2016. While SBA had made progress in determining the number of firms in the 8(a) and non-8(a) classifications for the program, we noted that it did not provide an overall number of current or past participants for the program, which could make it difficult for ANCs to qualify for the program. SBA also reported that none of the ANCs in the 2016 regulatory compliance review received additional business assistance loans. An example of the confusion and lack of clarity were the discrepancies from one year to the next between the 8(a) program\u2019s annual report and the list of the 50% of ANCs required to enter 3-year monitoring contracts. 4.

ANCs must be: - Native-owned; - Small, as determined by the SBA Small Business Act; - A Small Business, as defined by the SBA Small Business Administration. ANCs must also be - In general, a small business - which is normally defined as small or small average business. - It must primarily be the extension of business benefits, and/or business assistance. + In some cases, the SBA may make loans up to $35,000 to small businesses. - The entity providing the business assistance must not be for-profit, including not for-profit businesses. - It must primarily be involved in a physical enterprise. SBA defines an enterprise as a group of companies (one or more which are legally separate from one another) each of which has its own separate financial and legal functions, such as a separate accounting system. ANCs, in general, are typically smaller than their ANCs in the state/territory the corporation serves. In the 2016 Report to Congress (2nd year report to Congress \u2013 FY 2016), SBA noted that there were approximately 11,000 ANCs in the USA that had entered the 8(a) program since its inception in 1985, with 8,796 of them being sole-source ANCs.

This plan includes (1) short-term, incremental funding to address Navy infrastructure shortcomings, (2) strategic investment to enhance the Navy\u2019s global operational readiness, and (3) significant capital investment during the short-term and long-term OPFRP. This text briefly discusses an important element of any program\u2019s cost estimating process, specifically, the estimation of cost elements. The overall objective is to ensure that costs are not just determined, but that the estimates are of reliable quality (i.e., of reliable value) so that the cost accounting can be used as a measure of program success. This text will briefly discuss two elements of estimating cost elements: (1) the use of life-cycle costs to ensure reliability of cost estimates in future and (2) determining the scope of costs within an estimate. Costs of 6 the program (as opposed to those in the long-term) are a good candidate (see figure 4 and chapter 2). Costs of the program within the short-term, rather than for the complete project, are preferable due to 6 the complexity and uncertain-ty of short-term cost estimates. Figure 5 and Chapter 24 discuss this process in greater detail. This text will briefly discuss both concepts. Cost elements, as defined below, are used for cost estimating, lifecycle costing, and performance planning, and are critical to 7 cost estimating. The text will briefly discuss these processes, as well as the importance of a well-documented cost estimate. In addition to the reliability of the cost, the accuracy of the estimating process is fundamental to the cost estimating process. Cost elements are required to ensure timely, accurate, and reliable information can be given the decision maker. Table 5-1 through 5-6 list examples of costs required for capital equipment and 8 supplies; and Table 5-7, figure 5 and figure 6, illustrate how life-cycle costs are determined. The text discusses the importance of a good comprehensive description from design to retirement of the component parts. Finally, the text discusses the importance of having a cost estimate document available and incorporated into the project plan to ensure accountability. Each program element required for the cost estimating process will be discussed further in Chapter 8. For most capital systems, it is also important to recognize that there may be unique life-cycle costs. For examples, life-cycle costs for a major ship-based combat weapon system can be approximately 400 times higher than the costs of the same weapon system for an Air Force space system. For example, according to a report published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), although the Air Force had budgeted $1.5 billion over 7 years for one major space program, these funds were not available until 2017. If GAO estimates the program started in 2008, according to the Air Force\u2019s timeline, the program cost would have been about $1 billion; however, by 2017, the Air Force reported the actual cost of the program from $450 million for design phase to $850 million at 8 5.7. The GAO GAO reported that although the Air Force could be ready to complete the design phase in about 3 years, it would not be ready to begin manufacture for about 10 years. Cost elements necessary to inform the cost estimating process are listed in Table 5-1 and Table 5-7. Figure 5 shows examples of some of the cost elements that must be estimated as part of each of the five major cost estimating categories or types: acquisition, cost to modify or enhance, reliability, recurring and maintenance costs, and cost to operate, sustain, or transition. The text further elaborates on the cost to operate and sustain major assets and ships, explaining why ship classes are selected. In this context, ship classes represent a grouping of ships based upon class construction (e.g., cruisers, frigates, etc.), and generally, each major class construction has a different maintenance cost. Navy officials also emphasized that the cost to operate a capital system is based on whether it is designed or engineered for continuous operation. There are only a few classes that are intended to continue in service for decades. There are an enormous number of additional elements that must be taken into consideration when performing a cost estimate, depending on the situation. Costs to design or construct a system that can be kept out of sight or location could be a fraction of those in use and are difficult to capture. Depending on whether the 9 assets are new or being repaired is critical for how long their use will affect the cost, or in the worst case, how long until a major overhaul (major overhaul time of an asset is a critical determinant of the cost to operate a vessel). Major ship systems can be as large as multi-billion dollars.

The cost of maintaining child welfare programs varies by state, with 30 percent of a state\u2019s allotment often used for room and board costs for youth aged 14 or older who experience placement in a foster home or group home after their 16th birthday.

In many cases, organizations may provide employment services to veterans, such as a resume-writing program or employment counseling. At the individual level, veterans may choose to pursue employment services at a local veterans\u2019 center or to seek employment services from a civilian resource center. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDERS To develop a realistic employment plan, counselors may work with a veteran through the regional offices and regional veteran service officers to get an understanding of their service-connected disability, education, and employment goals. Job placement assistance may be provided at VA employment services centers located at each regional office. The VETS-D Resource Directory for Veterans Training provides counseling and resources to veterans entering the job market post-service. A \u2018Veterans Employment Center\u2019 exists at the Southern Nevada Job Service Center, which is part of the State of Nevada Career Nevada system. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDER. Individual veterans in VA\u2019s VR&E rehabilitation program can seek a variety of support services such as job training, job placement, and educational assistance through the Transition Workshop at each Regional Office. They may also seek employment assistance through the Employer Pass-Through Partnership program (E3), a private-sector employment program that allows veterans to enter the civilian workforce. There may be a combination of individual counseling and collective counseling occurring during this phase. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDERS. As of VA\u2019s fiscal year 2019, 98 percent of case files by individual veterans are being managed by individual case managers. Each case file is a one-of-a-kind case that the individual case manager is responsible for managing. Individual Veterans may request job search assistance through the State of Nevada job service centers, located at each Regional Office, which provides counseling and other employment-support services. The Job Center Network, a veteran-specific training and employment services network, can provide individual employment assistance in both the public and private sectors. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDERS. Individual veterans can enter the job market through VA job fairs, networking events, and job search assistance programs like job placement assistance. Employment assistance centers located at each Regional Office of the VR&E Program can also provide individual employment assistance and job skills training. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDER. The VA\u2019s Employment Assessment Tool (VETS.gov/VA-employement-tool), developed by Office of Personnel Management, can assist current veterans in identifying their job prospects and help them create a job plan. Another web-based benefit available to veterans using their own computers is the My Next Move website. This website provides access to information about job postings, resume writing services, and other job preparation resources that can be utilized to pursue a successful employment goal. In addition to the job fairs available at the Regional VSO centers, VETS also conducts multiple job fairs annually across the country. MEDIUM OF TRAINING PROVIDER. Individual veterans in each of the 56 regional offices can contact their local VR&E case manager to receive information and assistance. A web-based resource called the VR&E Job Skills Information Tool is available on VETSUSA.gov. The tool offers an individual-specific search screen that allows an individual veteran to discover job opportunities. Additionally, VA regional offices may provide on-site job training opportunities and virtual job training to current and former veterans. Individual employment counseling through the Job Counseling Program is also an option. Additional resources and job hunting assistance can be provided by a range of community-based", "Education and Child Welfare \u2026\nView Full Document", "CORROSION Deter, where applicable, is a part of DOD\u2019s equipment acquisition process, that is, ensuring 7.3.2 CORROSION CONTROL DEVICES 7.3.2.2 CORROSION CONTROL DEVICES Figure 1: CORROSION OFFICE relocation map.

Abandoned mine sites may be contaminated with hazardous substances, may pose physical safety hazards, or may be costly to address. A variety of authorities can help landowners manage these properties as well as the environmental concerns associated with them.", "Treasury borrows money from the federal treasury by issuing marketable debt, offering a variety of different maturity periods, sizes, types, and frequencies depending on the overall market conditions, the level and risk of interest rates, and other factors. These steps by Treasury are designed to accommodate the unique financial needs and risk tolerance of these diverse investors. Treasury reports that since its inception, Treasury has issued a variety of different Treasury securities (see figure 1) for purposes of financing various federal expenses, including the debt ceiling being reached and Treasury deficits in the budget, with the ultimate aim of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and reasonable long-term interest rates consistent with its mission to maintain the proper amount of Treasury securities to meet U.S. financial infrastructure needs. Since issuance of these securities in mid-1930s, Treasury has been primarily able to avoid the market risks associated with the issue of Treasury securities and its lending activities. Treasury does not have large financial firms as its market intermediaries, like the Federal Reserve system. The $1 trillion investment in Treasury securities by the Federal Reserve can be a larger source of demand for Treasury than a market of private financial institutions or money market funds. Currently, Treasury borrows about one-third of its U.S./Treasur y securities from the market. Treasury is primarily responsible for maintaining the amount and structure of sovereign wealth in the nation\u2019s funds. Treasury operates similar sovereign wealth tools/programs that could be replicated by states, counties, and even smaller jurisdictions. These tools allow small or rural localities to make the same kinds of investments for their funds. Treasury\u2019s program involves investments in U.S./Treasury securities and/or Treasury money market funds by smaller localities to enable them to raise the portion of their government payroll that is funded in real-time from Treasury payments rather than being subject to payroll taxes at the end/after their payroll is funded. The program also allows small and rural municipalities to create their own sovereign wealth funds rather than being at risk of default in case of a \u201cfailure in paying revenue taxes on income received \u201c (R.H.Sahlquist, Treasury/IMF/IFSB, \u201cSovereign Wealth: Global Survey 2019\u201d). Treasury also serves as an investment pool for other U.S. governmental funds such as the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The U.S./Treasu ry can also directly provide the funding of state and local governments, as well as education and infrastructure projects. Treasury has made U.S./ TREASURY (in all capital letters) programs available to smaller cities and towns, enabling them to access the real-time Treasury payments to fund payroll taxes, including for their first responders. Treasury offers access to Treasury\u2019s programs to municipalities, counties, and all other eligible local governments. Treasury can provide financial instruments used to raise funds from its financial partners. The U.S./Treasu ry does not have a direct program to help businesses purchase Treasury securities, but Treasury has been instrumental in assisting municipalities with local business financing. Treasury currently offers a variety of financial products, including Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPs), Treasury securities, Treasury money markets, and Treasury tax-exempt bonds, to financial companies in the market-place/ secondary market, and Treasury\u2019s financial partners. Treasury also has a program involving Treasury money market funds used by small and medium-sized cities, towns, and counties to stabilize the city/county\u2019s tax base by raising the portion of their government\u2019s payroll expense that is funded by payroll taxes/federal funding in real-time. Treasury also currently offers a marketable fixed-term Treasury bond that is a derivative, and thus can be held by a non-competitive bidder, such as a bank, at Treasury\u2019s calling. Each month Treasury sells Treasury securities at auctioned prices that do not include accrued costs of federal loans of approximately $800B taken by Treasury. These Treasury \u201cbill back\u201d purchases have a price/yield spread that was negative in terms of yields with Treasury securities, but positive with Treasury money market funds, with each Treasury securities/Treasury money market fund relationship subject to the Treasury Secretary\u2019s determination (R.H.Sahlquist, Treasury/IMF/IFSB, \u201cSovereign Wealth: Global Survey 2019\u201d). The Treasury's website is Treasury.gov, and one of the many topics that can be found is Treasury securities. According to these sources, Treasury securitisation typically consists of a series of Treasury securities issued separately from a similar series of federal funds to market its securities globally. Generally, Treasury securities may be purchased directly from banks and other market-makers. Treasury Securities are typically \"callable,\" meaning that the Treasury \"\"calls\" all or some, but not all of the Treasury securities of the same date and class (\"series\" of Treasury securities), for Treasury money market funds. Treasury Securities can be", "The USEC Fund was created in 1992, was privatized in 1998, and its balance is used in the DOE's USEC Enrichment Program. As of September 2019, Congress has not passed legislation to rescind the USEC Fund balances. A decade later, we found that DOE's efforts to use USEC Fund monies to support efforts other than the USEC Fund's authorized purpose of environmental clean-up expenses and the USEC Enrichment Program could lead taxpayers to incur unnecessary costs. However, there is currently no legislation in place to restrict their use, leading to potential mismanagement and potential costs to taxpayers. As of September 2020, we have not found that the Department of Energy intends to use its remaining USEC funds in a manner that would result in an authorization to rescind the balances from the USEC Fund. In the past, DOE's effort to use USEC Fund monies to support efforts other than the USEC Fund's authorized purpose of environmental clean-up expenses and the USEC Enrichment Program could lead taxpayers to incur unnecessary costs. Currently there is no legislation in place to restrict their use. In September 2019, we have not found that DOE's current goal to repurpose USEC Fund monies to support the Department's needs other than USEC's authorized purpose has diminished our ability to understand the balance of taxpayers' money at stake. As of September 2020, DOE has not implemented the \"goal of permanent rescission of USEC Fund balances\" as suggested in our 2010 report on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. DOE's use of the USEC Fund balances to support nuclear fuel enrichment for new reactor applications on USEC lands could not occur. DOE's cost estimate for its USEC Enrichment Program of $4.95 billion is not a credible estimate of our potential cost to taxpayers; DOE's estimates range from $1.5 to $2 billion annually. The DoD has not implemented the \"intent to use\" the USEC Fund and, as of August 2020, no new authorizations to use the USEC Fund for enrichment new-reactor operations have been initiated. The DoD has not yet taken action in its current 2020 \"Defense authorization act\" to rescind the \"intent to use\" the USEC Fund, as required, after having used it for nearly two decades. The DoD's failure to fulfill USEC Fund recreations in the act would result in a need for taxpayers to pay additional expenses without our information on how much of this costs. The DoD has not taken steps to permanently rescind the USEC Fund from environmental clean-up activities until we initiated our reporting in early 2020. In February 2020, we suggested that DOE's cost estimate in FY 2019 of $4.95 billion for USEC EKP, a program to enrich uranium for new reactor applications on USEC lands, could not occur. DOE's estimate ranges from $1.5 million to $2 billion annually. DOE's failure to fulfill USEC Fund recreations in the act could result in a need for taxpayers to pay additional expenses without our information on how much it costs. DOE's estimates range from $1.5 million to $2 billion annually. The DoD has not yet implemented the \"intent to use\" the USEC Fund for enrichment new-reactor operations. By 2030, DOE estimates we received from the DoD and OGEM that there would be between 1,500 and 4,000 USEC Fund-financed reactors in operation. By fall FY 2021, we found that DOE has not yet begun USEC EKP implementation. In the latest USEC budget request for FY 2022, the DoE is requesting funding for three new USEC EKPs. USEC's Board of Directors in August 2020 authorized the enrichment of uranium and other materials that could be used in USEC's processing complex in Paducah, Kentucky, to support the manufacture and delivery on contracts for the nation's nuclear power reactor system. USEC also is developing uranium for potential use in various nuclear weapons programs. Although DOE has not yet released its 2021-2025 planning process for USEC, the Director of that agency, Dr. Mark Hibbs, in April 2020 suggested the likelihood of DOE restarting USEC EKP by FY 2026. In a September 2020 interview, Dr. Hibbs noted that DOE is currently in the process of developing a new USEC EKP implementation plan. At that time, his office was in the process of beginning to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide the necessary clearance documents for a feasibility study on USEC Enrich", "The BMDS has been steadily moving forward since its start-up in 1988, although there are still challenges that MDA must overcome. BMDS development is intertwined into MDA\u2019s processes due to the agency\u2019s BMDS mission. The BMDS is MDA\u2019s program office for missile defense. Some key points to note in this text include: MDA was established in 2002 with the mission of developing a number of systems, known as elements, that are responsible for protecting against ballistic and hypersonic missile attacks. While MDA has made strides in improving transparency, its management of the BMDS programs\u2019 baselines is not advanced, and many uncertainties exist, as stated in the report. MDA has started engaging the defense intelligence community, and its approach toward reducing concurrency is commendable, in spite of challenges still present.", "In 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia agreed to undergo a wide range of civil, nuclear, and environmental safeguards. In response to a subsequent review of Russia\u2019s nuclear safeguards program in 1997, President Clinton initiated the High-Level Group (HLG) on February 16, 1998, to examine the \u201cstrategic context of Russian nuclear weapons.\u201d The HLG was cochaired by Secretary of Defense Colin Powell and Ambassador-at-Large Richard Lugar, and formally reviewed its findings in a March 1998 report. At the time of its inception, the HLG found that over the past several years Russia had conducted several significant nuclear arms reduction measures, reduced its nuclear weapons stockpile to the lowest levels in recorded history, and agreed to a 10-12 year program under which Russia was required to dismantle all nuclear weapons that the U.S. determined to be in violation of MPC&A agreements. However, despite Russia\u2019s decision not to sign some MPC&A documents that required destruction of nuclear weapons, Russia was able to continue to develop new nuclear weapons at the time of the HLG study\u2019s completion. In response the U.S. Secretary of Defense General Colin Powell announced a reduction in nuclear forces, or MAD, and a similar arms reduction program as Russia, leading the HLG to state that it found no evidence of further arms agreements between Russia and the United States. The HLG also concluded that the Russian nuclear posture has been driven more by political considerations than actual military ones. Regarding the HLG\u2019s findings on the nuclear-theoretical and weapons capabilities of Russia following the reduction in nuclear weapons and subsequent destruction of many nuclear warheads by Russia, the HLG and DOD/NSA remain in disagreement on whether a significantly better posture could ever be attained by Russia. The HLG concluded in its report that MCCS&U&C&A would \u201clikely remain the primary means of Russian non-strategic nuclear material in the foreseeable future.\u201d In response to the HLG report Russia, and Russia\u2019s nuclear industry, were in agreement regarding this fundamental concern that Russia should be permitted to continue to produce nuclear weapons technology. Both Russia and the United States remained in disagreement on the HLG\u2019s findings regarding the effects of MCCS&U&C&A programs on Russia. The HLG report expressed strong disapproval on the lack of information from Russia regarding MCCS&U&C&A, citing Russia\u2019s refusal to allow U.S.-based experts into Russia to make sure that Russia was following through on its commitments associated with MCCS&U&C&A program. In response to the HLG\u2019s report, Russia and the U.S. signed the Moscow Memorandum on December 7, 1997, to cooperate with one another on nuclear issues and security. That Memorandum and others that followed were seen by Russian government officials as the primary means with which to gain U.S. cooperation in securing MCCS&U&C&A technology. The HLG recognized that although MCCS&U&C&A technology was likely the best way to achieve long-term Russian non-strategic nuclear material nonproliferation, the HLG could not predict Russia\u2019s ultimate intentions. The HLG stated that \u201cMCCS&U&C&A\u2019s technology could be either stolen or otherwise used by criminals in an insider threat or in an outside attack. One need only to review nuclear materials that surfaced in the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union to appreciate how criminals had been able to use such materials to build nuclear weapons.\u201d The HLG recognized that because there was a significant chance of rogue actors acquiring the technology, \u201csecurity-seeking countries\u201d should ensure that the U.S. government would continue to implement long-term controls on the technology in accordance with the NPT and to ensure compliance as required. It was recommended by the HLG that the U.S. government would keep on the pressure for a period 10-12 years after MPC&A would be completed and no new nuclear weapons production would be allowed to continue. The HLG saw that 10 years after the end of the MPC&A program, Russia would still be subject to the same U.S. controls as long as the U.S./Russia relationship continued during the period. The HLG recognized that if Russia was not able to reduce its nuclear weapons, it would not be unlikely that Russia would attempt to develop them. The HLG also stated that Russia had a history of engaging in both overt and clandestine arms control and nonproliferation measures when MCCS&U&C&A agreements were in place, causing the Russian position to be in \u201cconflict with the U.S. position.\u201d The HLG further recognized that the main concern about MCCS&U&C&A programs was that Russia might divert", "Since the enactment of the CFO Act, federal financial management has improved substantially. Many significant improvements have been made in the areas of finance systems, internal control, financial reporting, cost reduction, and the integration of various financial management systems. OMB has made significant progress in improving financial management, including the development and implementation of a 5-year government-wide financial management plan. Treasury, as well, has provided significant support to federal financial reporting. Financial Information Technology Act of 1999 The original legislation of the Financial Information Technology Act of 1999, Financial Services Modernization Act of 1990, and Administrative Procedures Act, signed into law by President Clinton in 1998, have had long-term impacts on federal financial performance. The Administration initiated several long-term projects and implemented a large-scale enterprise data and systems modernization program. As a result, most of the agencies have implemented their information technology systems more effectively than ever before. Since the establishment of the Department Information Technology Management Modernization Act of 2000, all federal agencies, except for the United States Postal Service, have been required to implement their information technology systems to achieve a greater interoperability with each other, increased efficiency and transparency to external customers, and a more secure network environment. As a result of the Administration\u2019s focus on improving program support information technology, federal agencies are increasingly finding success in their efforts for deploying more effective business solutions, improving program efficiencies, and streamlining their decision-making processes through collaborative technologies. In addition, a number of existing Federal systems will be migrated and/or replaced. The Administration is implementing many long-term strategies for streamlining the government's business information systems capabilities. Several are the creation of business support information systems. Information Sharing and Data Management Act of 2002, the Financial Systems Modernization Act of 2001, and the Government Performance and Reporting Act of 2005 The Financial Services Modernization Act and the Financial Systems Modernization Act of 2001 were both enacted to encourage and streamline the conversion of Federal systems from traditional systems to modern, integrated systems. The Information Systems Modernization Act of 2004 has continued this effort by requiring agencies/sub-units to make \u201cfirst time\u201d implementation/upgradation decisions by providing greater flexibility to agencies to share information systems in the Federal Government. Agencies must now consider the implementation of integrated information systems and must develop implementation plans at every level before any upgrade will be implemented. This bill also established an executive reporting channel. The 2005 Federal Financial Management Act (FFMA) In 2005, the Office of Financial Management (OFM) released a new federal financial system for the agencies, the Financial Systems Modernization Program. The program allowed OFM to replace current, outdated information technology systems and systems that still rely on outdated computers. In addition, agencies were required to update to a more modern, integrated financial and asset management system, and to move beyond standard practice, which enabled agencies to achieve the financial management benefits associated with integrated financial systems or software applications. During fiscal year 2007, agencies also completed several long-term data modernization efforts that enabled them to consolidate their current data, move more data out of the Federal system, and reduce data duplication. Under 2005 Executive Order (EEOC) 13063, agencies implemented new federal information technology systems and services into legacy systems. As a result of these efforts, agencies improved their technology infrastructures, expanded their capabilities for system integration and data management, and improved customer service, and thereby made progress in improving overall financial management. Agencies that have moved to fully automated, integrated, and automated payroll system as required in the 2005 Executive Order and/or those still requiring manual processes have had a more streamlined transaction processing. Many agencies are now able to reduce manual processes by processing human resource information electronically. The Human Resource Management Modernization Act of 2009 encourages agencies to move to the use of computerized, data-processing systems. The Financial System Modernization Program of the Federal CIO Council (now known as the Federal Enterprise Performance and Information Management Program) provides agencies with modern-era core financial systems. All agencies with their own payroll system now receive annual payroll processing. With all agencies now using their systems in electronic format, information technology systems are becoming the foundation for many additional core processes. Federal agencies also made use of new innovative methods such as the use of emerging technology to communicate with its external customers. This approach used available tools, including the Internet, to provide improved customer service within the organizations, by simplifying procedures, and making communication faster. The Office of Financial Innovation and Integration (OFI) established a new vision to move all of the current Federal financial systems to a more robust, reliable, and integrated set-of-components that will be implemented in a timely manner using emerging and new technologies. These efforts are expected to lead to a more effective federal financial management system.

In-bound vehicle traffic and pedestrian traffic at a land border crossing. The secondary side of the building may also include a cargo inspection or animal inspection facility and can lead to a variety of pedestrian pedestrian lanes and lanes for trucks, and the various gates for commercial traffic with pre-primary inspections for certain types of documents. Commercial traffic and cargo traffic at the secondary side of the building can typically be separated from the pedestrian border. In-depth facilities and equipment analysis of a land border crossing can be obtained by utilizing GSA\u2019s OFA Building Operations Manual (OFA OAM) or GSA Access Compliance Certification Program (ACCP) for the GSA Access\u00ae Cardholder Benefits for Federal Employees and Retirees. The number of lanes at each terminal depends on the type of traffic at each location. Commercial traffic at secondary points along the border typically passes through the secondary side of the building. The entry point for commercial traffic into the land border crossing is a dedicated checkpoint at the secondary side of the building. In addition, each lane that CBP uses for commercial traffic has an associated gate. In many cases, there are distinct secondary points of access at certain gate points along the border to expedite through pedestrian traffic. For example, secondary points of entry for commercial traffic include dedicated lanes at each gate point. In addition, a checkpoint for secondary traffic, in addition to the main gate, may also be present for passenger and commercial traffic. A secondary vehicle inspection area is typically located at the end of the main pedestrian bridge. The last point of primary inspection is typically found within the secondary pedestrian terminal. The secondary pedestrian terminal is typically located on top of a bridge that extends into the ground of a river or lake. The secondary pedestrian terminal is also typically located within a pedestrian tunnel. The tunnel may also extend into an adjacent structure to accommodate a bridge that intersects with the pedestrian bridge. Both the main pedestrian bridge and the secondary pedestrian terminal are typically located at the end of the pedestrian bridge that spans one or two of the borderland areas. 17 CBP officers conducting primary, secondary, primary-secondary or secondary-secondary checks of these pedestrian border tunnels will enter the tunnel at a terminal, typically a pedestrian access point (\u201cTAPPOINT\u201d), which may be located at a border tower. The secondary access points may be located within the commercial pedestrian areas or the pedestrian area. These access points may be located within a tunnel that connects the commercial pedestrian area to the secondary side of the tunnel.

Challenges with program delivery in areas such as education, health care, and energy operations are exacerbated by inadequate staffing levels, program funding, and capacity requirements. Three agencies have made strides in addressing program delivery challenges. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: We believe the high-risk areas and associated challenges are not fully understood by Federal Health Care employees including staff from IHS, HR, BIA, and BIE employees. In FY16, we identified specific action items needed to help ensure program delivery continuity at federal agencies including IHS, HR, BIA, BIE, and OPM. OPM has a number of programs involving Indian Health Services, including its IHS-managed medical and dental equipment program. Our high-risk list was added to OPM\u2019s high-risk list in February 2017 when we found that program delivery challenges were a risk across all three agencies administered by four Federal Health Care (FCHEC) employees. These four employees are employed by three different entities and have varying amounts of experience, as reported to OPM. While we have continued our monitoring and reporting efforts at OPM to include a high risk area for IHS that was added to our high-risk list in February 2017, we find that this is a high-risk program administered by OPM and have found that OPM continues to have challenges with program delivery, management, and human resource workforce, capacity, and funding. IHS employees who directly deliver, manage, and support the majority of IHS facilities were found to face challenges in 2016 with a reported vacancy rate of about 30 percent across various IHS activities. HR employees at IHS are finding it difficult to meet staffing needs to adequately provide service to tribal communities and agencies. IHS is facing program funding shortfalls at all three levels and is currently undergoing a transformation plan that is expected to include the hiring, onboarding, and training of additional HR employees. We recommend this transformation plan and strategy be implemented along with a plan of action that addresses program staffing and needs for infrastructure improvements. We also recommend OPM continue to monitor ongoing workforce trends and adjust the IHS Workforce Data Collection strategy. We encourage HR and IHS employees to engage stakeholders in tribal-state-level partnerships and collaborations, and seek strategies for program funding where appropriate. As IHS continues to transform HR, we suggest that HR employees also prioritize program administration, such as program continuity, IHS mission, and HR strategy alignment, to ensure HR services are effectively provided to meet tribal needs. The challenges faced by OPM in program management are not dissimilar to those faced by IHS and OPM. In the 2017 High Risk List, OPM continued to administer the Federal Employee Health Program (FEHP). In October 2016, we reported that BIA/IHS has the largest tribal employee base of any Federal Government program with 45,000 employees/3,200 employees across each agency, and that BIA/IHS has overstaffing in management positions and is experiencing shortages in specific staff positions. For example, BIA continues to experience vacancy problems in a number of positions, with only 50 percent of BIA positions filled at that time. BIA also has been facing financial deficits and high program costs for years. BIA continues the effort to streamline their administrative functions, with ongoing improvement projects across various areas. On August 2, 2016, OPM launched a Transformation Plan for OPM, which will ensure that OPM is well positioned to adapt to changing federal Government needs. As was the case with the previous Transformation Plan for IHS, which was launched in April 2015 and has a performance timeline of 4-5 years, OPM is in need of a strategic transformation plan specific to the HR function. OPM should explore the benefits to employees and taxpayers of having a HR Transformation Plan in place and developing standardized HR services, training, and support resources. This includes the need to align the HR workforce of IHS with the IHS strategic HR goals of IHS by ensuring the IHS employees provide services at the appropriate staffing level. We further encourage HR employees to meet the challenges IHS may face in HR program management and the transformation of HR and IHS programs with a high degree of cooperation and communication in order to best meet the needs of IHS and its constituents. These challenges faced by IHS, including challenges with program delivery, management, and human resource workforce and capacity, continue to be challenges of IHS, and require a concerted effort to address them. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDENDRCS\nAs information technology improves in government, they need high performance network services with speed to keep up with applications like mobile video and voice applications. These 3D applications are often complex requiring greater network data throughput. When the applications come across a network with less than the data throughput capacity network components, which are the IHS and Federal Agencies network components, there will be latency (", "In March 2017, OPM was instructed by President Trump to develop a reorganization plan to improve the efficiency and alignment of federal agencies. This included plans to transfer OPM\u2019s functions to GSA, integrate OPM\u2019s \u201cPerformance Analysis Center\u201d into GSA\u2019s \u201cPerformance-Based OPM Strategic Plan,\u201d and create a \u201cPerformance Information Management and Analysis System (PMA)\u201d in coordination with the Government Performance Modernization Act Act (GPRAMA). According to this plan, OPM\u2019s functions will be transferred by the end of fiscal year 2020, when a merger will be completed by both organizations. According to the GPMA, a specific federal agency will be designated as a \u201cPMA\u201d and will be instructed to complete a number of critical administrative tasks, including data management, reporting, and business support. According to GAO Act of 2019, the reorganization plan 5 years to 6 years if GSA provides sufficient time to make significant progress. According to OPM\u2019s Executive Director David P. Montoya, OPM\u2019s workforce reduction plan is the most significant administrative reform to impact government agencies since the 2000 reorganization plan. According to these documents, each of the three agencies had been assigned to three project management offices to support OPM\u2019s merger: Information Technology Systems; HR Operations; and Financial Management and Support Services. 5 years to prepare for such a large reorganization plan. According to the PMA\u2019s 10 years. 6 years to consolidate and transform government operations, resulting from OPM\u2019s reorganization. Although OPM has the leadership of this reorganization, we cannot be certain that the 11-16 months of time allotted will be sufficient. On May 15, 2019, President Trump ordered an end to OPM. Specifically, this law passed with a \u201cPublic Law\u201d designation rather than being attached to any other legislation. Public law 2,109-432, which was formally known as the \u201cNational Technology Transfer Initiative (NTI) Act (HR 607)\u201d, was initially introduced in 2017. According to the President\u2019s reorganization plan, OPM will be merged with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Treasury (Treasury). The National Archivist\u2019s OPM was created in 1894 to administer the government. The Archivist was appointed by the President to serve five years. The Archivist was required to manage and maintain records in a variety of formats and languages, including English-language versions\u2014to the extent possible, from the time periods between 1917 and 1993. In 2017, President Trump ordered OPM and OPM-OCTIC (the \u201cManagement Information Systems Improvement Act\u201d) 7 weeks and 6 months to complete a reorganization that will include an OPM merger with an agency called the Office of the National Archivist (ONA). In the President\u2019s request letter, OPM was ordered to complete the merger of its functions and responsibilities in all of its organizational layers by July 2019. OPM will also be transferred its functions to the Office of the national archivist (ONA). All of the merger\u2019s 6 components must be completed within the time period of 6 months. The President\u2019s request letter stated that in addition to serving as a repository for paper documents and electronic documents, OPM was also required to maintain digital records, digital image, microfiche and microfiche images, and digital or electronic records (e.g., images of documents and records received). In addition, OPM will be required to maintain files for personnel, employment services, human resources, human resources management, and human capital resources. According to the Department of Defense (DOD), the OPM merger would have 10 years to complete. OPM, the Office of Chief Technology Officer, and the Defense Information Network (DISN) have all been under the direction of DOD and will be transferred into OPM as well as the other agencies in the OPM/DOD transfer process. According to the GAO review, the Government Performance Information Management system (GPMS), which 8 months to complete). Other components of the GSA reorganization are currently in progress. To date, the Office of Information Technology Security (OIT) has been created and renamed in GSA (e.g., from Office of Information Network to Office of Information Network Security). In addition, OIG has been created to help ensure internal compliance, including the management of OPM\u2019s information. (The details of what they accomplish are discussed in the GPMA\u2019s chapter on GSA.) As part of the 6 months required to complete the reorganization, OPM will work on transforming the organization and its capabilities to facilitate the transfer of personnel, technology, and support services. According to OPM", "In 1996, the federal government established a new intelligence gathering effort called the Transportation Security Act (TSA). TSA\u2019s mission is to ensure aviation safety in accordance with federal, state and local laws. TSA is responsible for aviation security at airports and commercial and air carrier facilities, including ensuring that air facilities meet certain performance standards. The following text is an overview of TSA\u2019s responsibilities within aviation. As an intelligence gathering organization, TSA is responsible for identifying potential individuals with criminal or terrorist history as well as providing training and guidelines to airport operators and air carriers to ensure they are in compliance with regulations in addition to TSA\u2019s own compliance. By using these procedures, TSA is able to increase overall aviation safety, reduce aviation risk and ensure that all travelers are safe from the beginning and end of their journey. It is important to note that TSA \u201cis the nation\u2019s foremost organization for aviation security which is the foundation upon a safe aviation system that we rely upon to get from one place safely, on time and without much hassle. Security is the very reason air travel is possible and it needs to be maintained. The TSA\u2019s goal is a simple one. The American public is best served by a safe, thorough, and efficient traveler security process.\u201d -TSA Commissioner, C. Scott Hammons TSA Background TSA is the government entity that governs security for all air transportation in the United States. \u201cTransportation Security\u201d originated from (TSA) acronym stands for Transportation Security Administration / Office of Transportation Security. All airports are required to enforce TSA regulatory requirements which includes the rules of security checks, scanning of luggage and property, and passenger inpection. Airports are classified as Category X or I. Category X contains the highest number of security measures and Category IX is the lowest. All travelers are subjected to a screening check to ensure that passengers are meeting TSA requirements. TSA is responsible for security checks, including checking travelers for metal objects and not allowing metal objects be carried on board. The TSA screeners are contracted from private companies to perform the security screening. They have various levels of competency and levels of training that is required. TSA is an organization of federal and private sector personnel who work in a cooperative manner. TSA also includes in-place counter officers at airports to work as a team with airlines. Air Carrier Security Program (ACSP) is a program to implement aviation security requirements by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA established an Aviation Security Certification Program (ASCP), which provides a certification program through which individuals from a company can get aviation security credentials that are recognized by the FAA. The ASCP is regulated by TSA so that the FAA can ensure 100 per cent of the aviation industry meets that recognition by TSA. Additionally, TSA includes in a program the Aviation Security Enforcement-Plus (ASE+) - a program that allows individuals from certain organizations and companies that are pre-approved for the program, like non-airline travel agencies, airports, terminal owners, airlines or companies in the aviation industry to get security credentials recognized by the FAA. (TSA has a more detailed explanation of this program on our website.) There are more background details that are available from the TSA website, including detailed diagrams of how TSA regulates airports, including its airports in certain cities. As a result of the TSA\u2019s success of identifying suspicious behaviors and devices, TSA has implemented new security measures. TSA implemented a new program for airlines called the \u201cContinuity Assistance Program (CAP),\u201d which helps the aviation industry, such as airlines, airports, and ground handlers, to be resilient in the case of an incident like the one at JFK airport in 2016, which is when a fire broke out at Terminal 8. There were a number of factors that contributed to the fire, and airlines have needed additional help in case of similar incidences in the future. TSA has conducted a fire drill with some airlines and airport operators in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago. In addition, TSA has a more detailed information on the TSA CAP. -TSA Commissioner, C. Scott Hammons TSA Programs TSA offers different programs or resources, depending on the circumstances a person or company may be in. Those are generally not limited to the above mentioned (\u201csecurity clearance process\u201d). In general, for each situation, one may need to choose between either an interview, or other screening process. TSA has the following programs/resources: - TSA PreCheck TSA PreCheck is a program that screens passengers from the USA and Canada to reduce wait time for airline travelers. If the screening results warrant pre-travel service for an additional fee, it allows travelers to bypass the metal detectors, x-ray machines, and other security measures that airlines are required to perform before boarding. - Global PASS Global PASS is a program to which passengers are screened by TSA employees at ticket counters and baggage drop counters and may also be screened behind the metal detectors with metal detector machines. This program is voluntary, but highly recommended by TSA for travelers. - U.S. Government", "NASA has not established a sound business plan to manage costs, and may have underestimated cost and schedule challenges facing the SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems programs. These three programs are closely linked to each other and to NASA\u2019s Constellation program. The report concludes that the management system for these programs may not be able to manage the new risks and uncertainty that has been identified. This, in turn, has resulted in uncertainties regarding program funding, schedules, and cost. The recommended actions are to restructure the SLS and Orion program offices to identify the risks and cost associated with the program, and to fully implement these actions. These actions will complement NASA\u2019s existing process enhancements to address program challenges. While these actions are a step in the right direction, they will not occur soon enough to guarantee NASA will reach its goals. NASA uses a number of management processes that are tailored to the needs of the SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems programs. Some of these practices are sound and should not be changed. However, some practices are dated and need to be modified. For example, the cost review process that requires contractors to provide a plan with cost estimates and schedule is outdated and does not adequately provide a management control mechanism for program costs. The report also recommends using a more formal process for program cost baselines and baselines for cost, work, and risk items for each contractor to better estimate program cost and timeframes. NASA agreed with all of the report\u2019s recommendations and generally agrees with the report\u2019s conclusions. The following table describes current NASA management practices. Table 1: NASA\u2019s existing management practices and actions needed to improve.

NASA reported in 2019 that 19 of the 22 tasks associated with the cost review process do not provide current, reliable, or documented cost estimates. NASA reported that 26 of the 52 requirements and tasks related to cost baselines for Exploration Ground Systems do not provide current, reliable, or documented cost estimates. PAGE 12 of 23 NASA reported that 20 of the 26 contracts for Exploration Ground Systems have been executed without a defined funding baseline and 5 of these contracts do not provide a cost baseline. NASA reported that 4 of 5 contractors do not have a cost baseline for Exploration Ground Systems. NASA reported that 2 of the 10 milestones that NASA established have not been met to date.

However, there were a decrease in overall applications due to terrorism-related refusals; EO-2, which suspended foreign nationals for a 90-day period, was also implemented. TABLE 1: Provinces and Countries With an Inability to Issue Nonimmigrant Visas in 2016* *In case of conflict between the data and the Department of Homeland Security's data, the Department reported visa adjudication outcomes consistent with the number of nonapplicants. These countries were Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea, South Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

According to DHS, since October 9, 2011, 95 cases have been identified where possible terrorists or other criminal groups were involved; DHS continues to provide the EO to the Department of State. While DHS has reported to the Department of State that the countries covered in EO-2 implemented adequate measures to cooperate in the screening process, DHS has not specifically identified any country that has undergone EO-2. DHS reported that 38,000 \u2014 approximately 9 percent \u2014 NIV applications received in fiscal year 2016 originated from the United Arab Emirates. DHS reported as of March 1, 2017 that for fiscal year 2017, 7 countries received $2,565,992 in nonimmigrant visas. During that same fiscal year, DHS identified 1,257 refusals of NIVs due to terrorism-related concerns\u2014approximately 8.25 percent of all NIV applications. DHS reported that for fiscal year 2017, the nations that were refused NIV adjudications during the prior fiscal year in NIV applications in fiscal year 2012 had increased from 89 to 104. DHS reported 1,256 of the NIV applications in fiscal year 2017 being due to terrorism-related concerns due to the review of the EO. DHS also reported having 1 NIV adjudication being denied in the Middle East and Africa for a country during the fiscal year of FY 2017, but DHS reported as of FY 2017, 5 countries in the European theater received NIVs during that fiscal year. DHS reported that DHS has added 7 countries in the East and the Indo-Pakistani regions. DHS reported that 9,792 \u2014 approximately 34 percent \u2014 of all NIV adjudications in fiscal year 2016 originated from 4 countries: Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman. DHS indicated that in fiscal year 2017, approximately 3,000,000 visas were granted, including 9,790 NIV applications. DHS noted that EO-2, implemented in March 2017, was no longer applicable as of August 2018, so DHS does not report any nonimmigrant visas processed in subsequent fiscal quarters. DHS has identified 63 countries whose NIV applications have been denied in FY 2016 and FY 2017 and have been reviewed for potential safety. DHS reported there were approximately 1,257 NIV applications from 7 countries that were reviewed by DHS for potential safety concerns. These 7 countries included Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. - - *The countries covered in EO-2 are Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, South Korea, Syria, and Yemen. ** EO-2, according to DHS, DHS nonimmigrant visas section Table 3: NIV Adjudications Denoted number of applications in fiscal year 2012. *This data is based on DHS's data that the Department also provides the EO to the Department of State.

Since many of the remaining elements are the same as those required by the Act, and VA has provided updated information on some of these, we do not recommend changes for these elements at this time. Additionally, we found that VA has not developed a plan yet for delineating the overall resources needed by VBA and Board to successfully implement the new appeals process. VA stated that in its November 2017 plan testing its new Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), VA addressed all 23 required elements, including delineating all resources needed by VBA and Board. Although VA has provided updated information on some elements, we do not recommend any changes to the current plan at this time. Information Technology Information and System Sciences", "There are an increasing number of cybersecurity incidents reporting at the Federal level, and these incidents are becoming more complex and difficult to manage. The Federal government continues to address these challenges through new regulations, tools of the trade, and improved collaboration. The complexity of these systems is expanding each year, so new federal cybersecurity capabilities must be released with greater frequency. Continued improvements that are incorporated into these systems will have a positive effect on the public at large and the economy as a whole. These technologies and efforts are helping strengthen Federal Cybersecurity capabilities (RAPs) in the United States. The report, \u201cFISMA Annual Report: 2018 Cybersecurity Risk Management Plans\u201d (July 2019) is accessible by clicking here.\nIn April 2015, a DHS initiative that calls on state and local governments to adopt the risk-based principles of S. 1233 (the DHS CyberScoop project) was expanded to include all 50 U.S. counties. The project, now known as the DHS County Risk Assessor (D/CR-CRA) Program, seeks volunteers to develop a risk-based assessment, which would provide state and local authorities with valuable information about the county-level risk to DHS-assisted categories of critical infrastructure and/or cyber infrastructure assets (e.g., ports). Currently D/CR-CRA includes more than 400 Risk Assessors in 15 states. A report submitted to DHS in January 2015 indicates that DHS should increase the number of county risk assessments completed in fiscal year 2015 by 32 percent. DHS is continuing to update the DHS Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RAP) Report, which will help DHS \u201cimprove communication and collaboration\u201d between the federal government and county governments for the fiscal year 2020 budget process in order to keep all DHS systems, personnel, and information system assets and assets, including DHS\u2019s network infrastructure systems and associated physical environments, in a secure posture. The DHS-created DHS CyberScoop Initiative is still operational, but its scope has been expanded from cities/counties across the United States to also include counties, to reduce the amount of information to DHS\u2019s Cyber Command (10 U.S.C. 2050); an increasing number of state and local governments are seeking the DHS assistance in building their risk-based assessment (RBA) plans. D-CRRA will continue to provide DHS-assisted information and assistance to DHS regions, with DHS teams now working with county risk assessors in 27 DHS-assigned regions. DHS-CRRA will continue to provide DHS-assigned risk assessors to DHS regions and DHS systems. There are 27 DHS-assigned risk assessors in DHS regions. DHS has expanded its Cyber Crime Program to provide a number of services to support DHS cyber security efforts, and to further foster cyber crime threat reduction partnerships established with DHS-funded cities and counties. DHS has established a new effort to help communities across the country better prepare for potential attacks on computer systems. DHS-CRRA is helping identify the need for additional cybersecurity capabilities including 24 hour a day/365 days a year cyber monitoring of DHS information systems. During DHS-CRRA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2014 activities that commenced October 2014, DHS has received numerous requests and questions regarding the RAP product from county assessors. DHS has updated its RAP guidance to further clarify the RAP format and to aid DHS in achieving DHS-CRRA\u2019s goal of completing a county risk assessment no later than November 2015. DHS has agreed to a DHS/CRRA request for DHS-CRRA to be granted an indefinite extension through at least November 2015. DHS has agreed to DHS-CRRA\u2019s request to grant DHS-CRRA a new DHS Public Assistance award to DHS for Fiscal Year 2016 which will allow DHS-CRRA to continue to provide DHS with resources such as DHS-CRRA\u2019s Risk Assessment Tool.\nThe DHS FY2020 request included DHS\u2019s requests for resources for support cyber security and physical security, including DHS\u2019s request for additional RAP product work for $1.5M and for DHS Public Assistance funding for $1M. DHS, in partnership with DHS Regional Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (IISC) Office of Community Development, (OCD), has been funded $10M per year for the past 3 years to provide DHS with cyber security and other support services. DHS is now requesting funding for additional DHS Community Development Office of Information Sharing (OCD) programs, including OJFSG (OJFSG), ICS (IN-SERVICS), and D/CRRA (the DHS County Risk Assessor Program). DHS had requested $5M OJFSG, $15M IN-SERVICS, and $10M for D/CRRA. D/CRRA has been funded for the past two", "Synchronization of medication in retail pharmacies has increased in recent years, with a majority of retail pharmacies offering the service, but data on patient adherence to medication is minimal.

In addition, each campus will have one command, including the CMF, for its in-resident training. In-Person requirements will exist in this program for the CMF where the lowest number of CMF will be at their respective CMF\u2019s facility. All initial CMF training for those personnel assigned to a CMF will be required on location within their CMF\u2019s campus. This training will be delivered during each initial training cycle during each CMF cycle. The training, to the degree practicable, will be conducted by the respective CMF\u2019s, and will adhere to all minimum training requirements. The CMF\u2019s will conduct training of their individuals and units to establish a standard and ensure they are prepared to assume any necessary responsibility, which are defined in the CMF\u2019s training plan.

VA is facing increasingly sophisticated attacks on its systems and networks. Many of these attacks target the VA\u2019s online presence, including its web-based systems, which can range from simple to very complex. VA reports a large number of incidents annually, but the number of reported incidents steadily decreases from fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2018, VA reported 1,762 incidents involving various threat vectors. The \u201cOther\u201d category represents 41 percent of the incidents, while other threat vectors are the most commonly reported categories, demonstrating that organizations need more robust controls to properly protect assets. VA is regularly targeted by cyber criminals, and reports a variety of incidents ranging from sophisticated hacking attacks to simple web-based assaults. VA reported 1,776 incidents involving multiple threat vectors in fiscal year 2018. This number has been steadily increasing, with a 26 percent increase from fiscal year 2017. Agencies reported a lack of government-wide metrics to manage cyber incidents. FISMA requires each federal agency to manage information security risks that are similar and shareable across agencies. FISMA requires IGs (Information and Information Security Managers) to help each federal agency develop metrics and other tools based on the five core security functions to help federal agencies assess and improve information security programs and related practices.\nA significant percentage of cybersecurity incidents reported by VA involve simple web-based assaults. VA reported approximately 40 percent of incidents in fiscal year 2018 related to web-based attacks. In each fiscal year studied by VA to date, web-based attacks have remained the most common threat seen by the agency.\nMany of these attacks target the agency online presence, where incidents may range from simple to very complex. VA reported a total of 1,746 incidents in fiscal year 2018, and more than 80 percent of incidents were related to web-based attacks. This number is a significant increase from fiscal year 2017, which saw approximately 1,700 incidents. Although a significant percentage of the reported incidents were in the \"Other\" category, the \"Other Threat Vector\" category has the most incident reports in each fiscal year. This suggests that cyber criminals are targeting VA to exploit vulnerable websites. This is not surprising, considering the agency\u2019s large size and the complexity of its IT infrastructure. VA reported 1,771 incidents involving multiple threat vectors in fiscal year 2018, a number that has been steadily increasing. These incidents involve a diverse range of systems, including web servers and databases, as well as complex applications, which could be difficult to track all incidents from one single endpoint. These cases could be more challenging to manage than internal IT systems or external cyber incidents involving more complex organizations. VA reported 1,746 cyber incidents in fiscal year 2018, a number that is close to the 1,763 incidents reported in fiscal year 2017. In each fiscal year, the Agency for Information Technology (AIT) and the Federal Information Security Managers have continued their efforts to implement the National Information Security Framework (NISP). VA has been steadily implementing the NISP across its IT infrastructure as part of its commitment to improving information security compliance. The agency\u2019s goals include reducing its number of cybersecurity incidents overall, as well as mitigating the impact of an incident should it occur. Since 2016, VA began a multi-year update of its IT infrastructure with a focus on implementing systems that would meet the rigorous requirements of the NISP. VA implemented the NISP in 2016 to manage cybersecurity risks across its IT infrastructure. As part of its implementation, VA implemented NIST\u2019s cybersecurity guidance, NISP v3, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The NISP provides specific, standardized guidance on how Federal agencies approach cyber security in a cohesive manner. In November 2019, VA announced a plan to complete an additional update of its IT infrastructure security by July 2022. This includes expanding their use of NIST\u2019s risk assessments, implementing a vulnerability scanning tool into all VA systems, and deploying NIST authentication standards. VA also will begin the implementation of a network and service provider portal for secure virtual networks. VA, in addition to its update with the NISP, is also implementing the Cybersecurity Executive Order, which consists of 10 Executive Orders that establish voluntary best practices in cyber security within government agencies, including VA, to improve cyber security in their networks and systems. VA has implemented many systems to help ensure secure information security. VA, through its AIT and the VA Office of Research and Technology (OIR), is actively implementing the NIST Cyber security framework which includes 4 categories of security controls (P1: Code of Practices and Procedures; P2: Policies and Procedures; P3: Training and Personnel Security; and P4: Data and System Protection). Additionally, VA", "DMDC provides access management, security, installation security, and law enforcement services to 16 Military Service Installations in the United States. The service assists U.S. military and non-military law enforcement agencies at their 11 domestic installations and/or sites in the United Arab Emirates. DMDC administers a global security program for the Department of Defense and DoD agencies and partners including NASA, FBI, CIA, OSSI, DHS, FBI, CIA, NSA, Marine Corps Logistics Base Norfolk (MCLB Norfolk), Joint Base McGuire-Johnson, P.A., and multiple Army Reserve installations. DMDC is the lead office on the global installation-based personnel and equipment security program and manages all DoD installations in the country. DMDC assists U.S. military and non-military law enforcement agencies at more than 50 domestic civilian sites, such as the FBI\u2019s Washington, D.C., Headquarters, the Office of Inspector General\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the CIA headquarters in Virginia. Outside of the United States, DMDC provides installation-based services to military installations in Germany, at NSA Langley and other sites, in the Middle East, and at locations in Africa. DMDC\u2019s services and capabilities are available in multiple languages. As an independent Department of Defense entity, DMDC is subject to oversight by the Department of Defense, including DHS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Intelligence Community. The U.S. Army is the sponsor of DMDC, but the installation-based services are provided exclusively on a fee basis, and are consistent with the DOD\u2019s and DoD\u2019s overall security and privacy requirements. DMDC was originally established by the Department of Defense in 2007, when it was designated as the DOD\u2019s single source provider of security and counterintelligence services. While DOD components no longer use the system to provide the service to personnel at their own local installations, DMDC staff continue to provide services to military installations in Alaska, Bahrain, Europe, Okinawa, Pacific, United Arab Emirates, and Japan. DMDC\u2019s installation-based services assist 3,700 U.S. Department of Defense customers worldwide, ranging from U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and Army logistics, to Army Reserve, Air Force Research Laboratories, and all U.S. Coast Guard installations worldwide. DMDC delivers information security services\u2014from classified networks to unclassified domains\u2014to DoD organizations, including DoD Intelligence Community and National Security Agency organizations. DMDC helps the military conduct military operational activities and combat missions in a seamless and safe digital network. On a daily basis, DMDC assists DoD organizations with their tactical communications requirements. DMDC currently provides services and guidance to over 60.7 A FOIA request to the Army Intelligence and Security Group has been pending for more than one year. 7 In FY 2017, the DMDC headquarters office was awarded a FOIA request to acquire an updated list of sites with which DMDC personnel have security clearance. 3 The DMDC has expanded the scope of its FOIA requests to all DoD networks. Since DHS no longer handles FOIA requests for non-Federal agencies, the Army is now the default information security provider. The Under Secretary of Defense Information Security, Information Technology, and Analysis (CYSA) Department of Defense Information Technology (DODIT) has been the Army's single source for FOIA requests for the past two decades. DMDC provides DHS with a FOIA processing fee for all 6 FOIA requests per fiscal year. Due to the complexity of DHS's large organization, DHS and Army share the FOIA responsibilities. DMDC has received FOIA requests from DHS in the past and DHS was the agency primarily responsible for processing the requests\u2014not the Army. In March 2018, DHS transferred most of their FOIA responsibilities to the Army, while retaining control over their own systems. However, DHS maintains an information system that can assist Army FOIA requests for data. Army\u2019s FOIA processing fee has been $60, which is the equivalent amount ($30 for DHS and $30 for DHS). Since DHS manages DHS, DMDC works directly with DHS when it comes to FOIA requests. DMDC (DMDC) was established in 2006 as a Department of Defense (DOD) organization. DMDC\u2019s services and capabilities are available in multiple languages. As an organization that provides services and capabilities to DoD, military and non-military installations worldwide, DMDC is subject to oversight by the Department of Defense, including the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). On multiple occasions, DMDC has been given information concerning the FOIA processing fee that will apply to a user\u2019s request. As part of an FOIA settlement agreement, DMDC was given the capability to accept FOIA requests on behalf of DoD, DHS, and other agencies.

Of the 190,800 physicians in 26,000 private practices or GPOs, 76 percent have incorporated a NP/PA. Hospitals, with 76 percent incorporating an NP/PA, lead in a number of private entities\u2019 adoption of NPs/PAs. In contrast, more than one-third of private practices, hospitals, and clinics paid for by insurance to hire a physician have incorporated a physician assistant to help medical staff. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that 10 percent of physician practice visits are made to physicians working in a solo practice, which likely results in under-utilization. Physician assistants can serve as a solution to shortages of healthcare clinicians, and in many cases, serve as a viable alternative for some healthcare practitioners in a wide range of practices. In our 2018 report on P As training, we found that Physician GME funding provided by the Medicare GME program totaled close to a billion dollars for physicians. HHS also reported in 2018 that in contrast to physicians, fewer than half of practice sites pay for a physician assistant\u2019s training. Physicians. Physicians generally begin their education with their undergraduate degree followed by the completion of a three-year integrated MD or DO degree. These MD or DO degree programs are part of the AAMC\u2019s definition of allopathic medical schools. Physicians undergo 3-7 years of additional training in graduate medical education after a comprehensive training in internal medicine (three to four years), after which they may begin their private practice experience. All medical schools are governed by a set of guidelines including curriculum, competency requirements, and standards required for accreditation. The AAMC currently lists all medical schools that are accredited. Physicians must complete a clinical clerkship throughout their education. In the most common clinical clerkships, one to three months are devoted to each subject area. Physicians are then able to apply to residencies\u2014years of training following medical school or during the course of an additional residency program (usually five years). In addition to their formal education and clinical training, physicians are trained in a variety of subjects, including law, ethics, and public health. Physicians often seek a certain area of concentration on their own that may not be part of their degree program. For example, more than 50 percent of practicing physicians in medical, surgical, and other specialties will choose to undergo additional training in a field such as clinical nutrition rather than undertake a medical degree after completing their undergraduate studies. There are a number of medical and scientific societies that physicians are encouraged to join to help with clinical and personal development. More than 25 medical specialty organizations work directly with physician specialty organizations, which provide comprehensive resources to help physicians complete their training. These organizations also provide comprehensive clinical guidelines and other materials to physicians as they practice in their private medical offices. Physicians who want to remain medically active, such as those nearing retirement age, may choose to do so in a hospital setting, often for reasons of personal satisfaction or for additional income. These hospital arrangements or relationships can be between the physician and either their hospital or a system that provides practice management services to facilitate administrative duties. Physicians often provide medical care through medical clinics or group practices and may choose to remain in private medical practice or incorporate into private health care practices, such as employment practices or medical group practices, depending on their particular employment preferences. The National Institutes of Health reports that the average salary of US physicians grew 4 percent between 2016 and 2017. Physician education through an MD, DO, MD, or DO program averaged $200,150 in 2014 at a two- to three-year period between 2007 and 2014. In contrast, according to the AAMC in 2016, MD, MD /DO programs will continue to receive public money in a variety of ways (e.g., Medicaid and Medicare), but MD, DO programs are only two percent of all US physicians who complete their training. In addition, more than 1 percent of all physicians\u2019 clinical care is provided by physicians working in their own private practice. Physicians also receive a variety of additional healthcare services from a variety of physician specialty organizations. Physicians (or more formally physician assistants) have the primary responsibility of managing a practice. For example, they are responsible for a number of tasks such as ordering, billing, coding/abstracting patient information (CPT codes and Diagnosis related to payment codes [ICD-10 codes]), managing patient electronic records for a variety of data management processes, making diagnostic decisions/preferences, prescribing medications, and administering treatments, depending on their medical specialty and training. They may also take on administrative duties such as negotiating with insurance providers and other staff members of the healthcare business, and managing office and staff. These physician responsibilities can require from hundreds to thousands", "The sale of U.S. arms to foreign governments and organizations has been ongoing since at least World War II and has been governed by specific acts of Congress.

The number of illegal drug seizures made by Border Patrol has decreased since FY2013 while methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl seizures have continuously risen. Analysts suggest that smugglers adapt to the drug barrier that separates the ports of entry. Some are finding ways to circumvent it underground, through tunnels, by subverting the traditional transport patterns of drug smuggling within communities.\nThe United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing security at the nation\u2019s ports of entry. In the 1990s, officials constructed a system of physical barriers along the southwest border in order to deter or limit the migration of Mexican drug cartels. After a spate of drug-related violence that occurred over a decade, CBP began discussing possible methods to increase the Southwest border\u2019s durability. President Trump authorized it in January 2017. Currently, there are two physical barriers along the 650-mile southern border: a 30-foot high barrier on the Mexican side that ends over 100 miles north of the ports of entry, and a 22-foot high barrier on the American side, which is found within 100 miles south of the ports. The goal of each barrier is to deter drug smugglers, human and property traffickers, and terrorists from entering the US ports of entry. In a report issued in February, Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkin and the Inspector Generals of the CBP and Customs Enforcement announced the first major update of the \u201cSecurity Strategy\u201d since its creation in 2009. The \u201cSouthwest Border Security Strategy\u201d outlined a range of measures to enhance the long term sustainability of Southwest border infrastructure enhancements.\nThe report was presented in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. In July 2019, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkin announced more than $1.43 billion in funding from the Department of Homeland Security to begin construction on roughly 700 miles of upgrades along U.S. ports of entry fence, including 2-foot border barriers that are meant to deter illegal drug trafficking. In July 2019, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkin announced that the Trump administration plans to dedicate up to $1.43 billion over the next five years of the Homeland Security bill Congress agreed upon to bolster the Southern Border Security Project (SBSP) with 2-foot physical barriers. At the end of July August 2019, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkin and a panel of senior members of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unveiled a $5 billion request from President Donald to Congress. The DHS is advocating for an increase in money for construction work along the border ($5 billion) as well funding for maintenance initiatives that are vital to keeping the physical barriers running. Some of the President\u2019s budget requests included (1) an added $5 billion from DHS to enhance border security infrastructure along the entire length of the border and (2) $2.5 billion in additional funding specifically from DHS to maintain and update construction and maintenance of existing physical infrastructure along the border.", "A report on trends in leveraged lending, who holds its loan, usually receives a stream of collateralized revenue generated by the borrowers.

Banks hold the bulk of their leveraged loans; banks alone also hold over half of leveraged loans in the current market. Banks\u00e2\u00a2 financing also comprises a higher proportion of leverage loan volume than \u00e2\u00a2 historical averages, while nonbanks alone \u00e2\u00a2 roughly half the market \u00e2\u00a2 comprise all loans in the current market.

Specifically, (1) the House is the first chamber in either chamber to pass bills before the bill can become law, and (2) it is the Senate that serves as the final gatekeeper that must act first if the House, or House of Representatives, is unable to act on a bill before an expiration date. A detailed process on how congressional procedures affect specific types of bills is on pages 428-432, and Chapter 2, \"Congressional Rules and Procedures for Resolving Conflicting Positions,\" covers procedures on how the House and Senate resolve conflicts.\nAgreement on the identity of the measure (e.g., H.R. 1 or S. 1) is essential in determining which chamber to act first. When a measure is first referred to the other chamber by Congress, it appears on the docket. Before Congress can submit a bill or joint resolution to the President for his approval or disapproval, the body must agree on the identity of the measure to move it forward. To act first on a bill, one chamber may be given the title of the bill in question. The House, for example, may be titled \"H.R. 1,\" and that title, as well as the text of the bill itself, would be presented to the Senate. From that point forward, the Senate's role in the legislative process ends. The bill is no longer in (re)decemoration; instead it goes to the president as a bill for Congress to act upon, whether for approvement, revision or final action. The Senate may act either first or second on a bill. To act first does not imply that the Senate performs a different role than does the House. The House is the first chamber, and the Senate the second, but the roles are often complementary. The Senate's constitutional duty to represent the people in the legislative process gives it a unique role in Congress; the House, on the other hand, has a more direct role in enacting the federal laws.\nTo be precise in the determination of which chamber in which to act first, one needs to refer to all of the chambers in the legislative process. Each chamber (House and Senate) is responsible for approving bills before they can be signed by the President. In practice, the President cannot act alone in the federal legislative process. The President, as commander-in-chief, can act alone on foreign policy, but that generally involves making treaties, not writing domestic or economic legislation. In Congress, all the chambers are organized under a system of checks and balances, with each chamber possessing separate and distinct powers. Only once in nearly two hundred years has there been a serious disagreement between the chambers on the constitutional procedures relating to Congress' powers. That disagreement was about the right of Congress to tax revenue; the disagreement came in the 1791-1790 period between a Congressional ruling against taxing the property of the state of Maryland, and Article I, \u00a77 in the 1791 Constitution. Since 1791, the basic rules for the legislative process have been codified and passed down. In all legislative houses of Congress in 1855, there were separate rules. In 1913, most of the rules were consolidated. The Constitution states nothing about the number of members in either house. The Senate, like Congress, has a quorum requirement. All of the chambers of Congress have separate quorums requirements and are different between each chamber. The most stringent rule applied to all three chambers is in Article II, \u00a72, clause 2, where the supreme court declared in 1794 that a member of Congress can \"be a witness for his brother in the district court...\" As time changed and 1794 legislation faded, members of Congress were required to wear a black band on their sleeves indicating their membership in the House, with a white band showing their membership in the Senate.\nAgreement on the text of the measure is essential before Congress acts first on a bill that is not yet in law. The agreement on version should be by unanimous vote. Both chambers have a right to pass legislation on a matter. As was the common practice in 1860, after the passage of a bill, the bill's titles are placed at the bottom of the act; the Senate's vote was unanimous, but the text of the act did not include the Senate's action. In 1870, the law changed to place the Senate's part at the top of the bill, after the bill's title, and the Senate also had to include a specific word: \"concurred.\" In 1902, the House of Representatives added the word \"and\" after \"agrees\" for clarity before the Senate. This form of the law in 1971 became known as the \"CONGRESALEBILITY CLAUSE\". The clause stated that a bill's text cannot be passed into law if", "FY2020 budget request for the judiciary comprises approximately 2% and includes a Supreme Court request of $106.8 million, for the judicial branch activities, including $7.62 billion in discretionary funds and $669.8 million in mandatory funding for judges' salaries and judicial retirement accounts, with hearings on the budget request of $106.8 million in the Judiciary Subcommittee of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, conducted on March 11, 2019, with opening remarks from the Chairman and Subcommittee Members Quigley (R-IL), Fudge (R-OH), Johnson (D-GA), and Himes (D-CT).

He also discussed the Supreme Court's use of cameras during court proceedings, stating that cameras could negatively affect the Court's functioning. Justice Roberts also stated that media coverage of court proceedings can be misleading, since people are \"not seeing the judicial functioning process\" as well as they are not seeing a \"complete picture\" of what occurs in the courtroom. // A - // C // // B // Text: P E O L LY S: THE HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIARY System: The Judicial Branch, System: The Judicial Branch, Title: Judiciary Authorization System Type: Organization, Title: Judiciary System, System: The Judiciary System, Subtype: Organization, System: The Judiciary System, Description: The Judiciary is the judicial branch, which includes three levels: the Federal Courts, the State Courts, and the Public Courts.

He dies in Wuhan's hospital, on February 10, 2020. 2020. The virus will be transmitted the next day to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, and to the central city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in the southern China province Shandong, and in eastern China Zhejian province. In Guangdong province, China's southern economic hub, the virus will spread to Hong Kong, South China Sea port of Zhuhai, where China's exports are mostly bound for Europe, and Macau. An outbreak of the virus is forecast in China. On January 20, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency of the virus, affecting China imports. On March 12, a coronavirus outbreak was reported in the central city of Ningbo. From March 24, Chinese authorities began testing Chinese exports for the virus. China reports its first coronavirus-related death on February 14. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the virus can be transmitted to humans from animals and people-to-people and the virus can spread into several small outbreaks over the next few weeks. In May, China reports that six new COVID-19 cases are found outside China, bringing its total to 99 cases. On May 21, H7N9 influenza virus-the first animal host ever to be linked with the COVID-19 outbreak-was reported in China's Jiangxi province. On May 18, China reports it would conduct a phased trial of 4,700 health workers to receive the first-known COVID-19 vaccine in early July. On June 23, China reports that almost 100 new cases of the virus were reported in Hunan Province. China reports 13 new COVID-19 cases in China's Hubei province on June 29. The Chinese Communist Party says at least 1,300 of the COVID-19 cases reported in China's Guangdong province are linked to cases of the virus in Hong Kong and Macau with China's COVID-19 virus spread in Guangdong and into southern China. China reports a rise in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China's capital Hubei province. Chinese authorities test more than 1,800 passengers in Wuhan airport after a doctor dies and 9 of the 14 medical staff in Wuhan hospital infected.

Nevertheless, although the poverty rate among older Americans is not as high as in 1966, the number of aged poor has increased and now exceeds the number with incomes below the poverty thresholds. Although the official poverty measure is based on food consumption, the measures of poverty among aged Americans are based on the federal government's comprehensive measures of poverty, from which poverty is calculated as a product of an average family's adjusted income and the average poverty threshold and a multiplier reflecting the poverty rate. The SPM is the Census Bureau's main method of measuring economic or poverty problems of the population. Its product is that of 40 individuals in the population (excluding the homeless) who are randomly selected at $200 per person per year. The products of average spending on housing costs and food costs plus other current costs are used to compute each individual's poverty score. Since the SPM is only based on items that are in a common denominator with most of the population, for many items it is impossible to compute a figure for poverty income inequality. For instance, to compute the percentage of aged Americans with incomes below the SPM's federally mandated poverty thresholds, it is necessary to include a direct link with food costs and an adjustment for SPM underestimates if the population 65 years and older comprised a significant portion of the public in 1966, as it does now. In the past, most of the aged population received benefits from Social Security and Old Age, Survivor and Disability Insurance (OASDI, commonly known as Social Security) which in turn helped the aged in a number of ways, including the reduction that the government costs of these benefits have to the general public. The OASDI is a federal income safety net program for the aged poor, designed to provide low-income elderly Americans with the guaranteed economic stability that is necessary to ensure the basic maintenance needs of aging household members. This report discusses income, poverty, and poverty among Americans aged 64 and older. It explores poverty among Americans aged 64 and older, poverty rates among age groups in 2017, and factors that may hinder or enhance poverty among older Americans. It also presents data on the Social Security Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits.", "The text is extremely important to the discussion of the current state of our economy. It makes clear that, for the most part, the government's job is to provide direct and indirect subsidies to companies so that they can remain in business. The main thing that has changed now since the start of COVID-19 is that new government assistance is going to the businesses that have already been in business since 2020, as there can't be a significant number of new companies starting up in our country without help from government. The current crisis is going to be long term, and we are seeing it in many sectors right now. If we are going to come out of this crisis as robust as the country, we'll have to try to find new ways to allow more small business to start up, rather than rely on larger businesses. In our country, we give to the rich more than we give the poor. If you can find a way to make government more efficient and to take more of the tax burden from the wealthy, that's where we need to go now.", "On December 2, 2019, the Trump administration a[i]claimed the deaths of hundreds of Americans or coalition servicemembers in Baghdad, Iraq. The statement cited Soleimani's development plans for Iraq and the region, and his approvals that led to a drone strike that killed an Iraqi militia general. Soleimani's demise has raised tensions in the Middle East; Kata'ib Hezbollah is a leading militia in Iraq, and Tehran has maintained a close relationship with the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in neighboring Iran. Soleimani was widely regarded as one of Iran,s most powerful figures, second only to the supreme leader. Analysts question whether the demise of an agent involved in dangerous conflicts will have long-term implications for Iran or U.S. relations in the region. The U.S. Department of Defense stated that Soleimani was killed in a drone strike while leaving Baghdad International Airport early on January 3, but his whereabouts and circumstances surrounding his death remain a source of speculation.\nText: Relations between the US and Iran have been mostly confrontational since 1979, with Iran's Islamic Revolution removing from power the US-backed Shah and replacing him with a Shia-cleric dominated system. Numerous U.S. administrations have treated Iranian policies as a threat to US interests in the Middle East, particularly Iran's support for armed groups and other armed groups. Following the withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA), the Trump administration has taken several steps in its continued campaign against Iran, including designating the IRGC-QF as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and designating it to the UN Security Council to implement economic sanctions. The US Department of Defense announced on January 2, 2020, that IRGC-QF Commander General Qasem Soleimani was killed in a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport early on December 31, 2019. In addition to Soleimani's death, U.S. officials claim that he was involved in planning an \"immediate\" attack on US personnel and facilities in the region.\nU.S.-Iranian Relations: Tensions on the Rise Text: Relations between the US and Iran have been mostly confrontational since 1979, with Iran's Islamic Revolution leaving US-backed Shah out of power, replacing him by a Shia cleric-dominated system. Numerous U.S. administrations have treated Iranian policies as a threat to US interests in the Middle East, particularly the IRGC-QF. In late December 2019, an array of U.S. officials claimed that Soleimani, who has been widely hailed as a \"\"global\"\" Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander, had coordinated attacks against US forces and intelligence officers in Iraq and Syria. A. In recent years, the Trump administration has taken a series of steps in its campaign against Iran, including the withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Multilateral nuclear agreement, designating the IRGC-QF of the Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and enacting additional economic sanctions. B. To implement economic sanctions on Iran to punish the country for developing nuclear weapons, the US Congress designated IRGC-QF Commander Qasem Soleimani as a Global Significant Media Entity (GME) which allows the US government to designate them and their related entities to be subject to sanctions. C. On December 30, 2019, the Pentagon claimed that a US Air Force drone strike killed the mastermind behind the attack, Soleimani. In addition to being involved in plotting an imminent attack on US personnel and facilities in Baghdad International Airport (BIA), the US claimed that Soleimani also was developing plans to attack American forces and civilians in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. D. Just weeks before he was killed, Soleimani is believed to have been involved in a secret exchange of information between Iran and Hezbollah. According to some security analysts, the death of Soleimani may bring tensions on the world stage to a boil, particularly Iran. Moreover, the way that the US intelligence officials described the attack to Congress may cause the US to face international resistance.", "This report summarizes the most significant health care-related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the 116th Congress, particularly those related to CHIP/ACCHIP (see Appendix A for description), with a focus on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA/ACA 2020) and CARES Act (P.L. 116-136). Each grant provides funding to 50 or more states and territories that serve as the states for the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Rec REACH (Probe) program. Funding is for 3 years or until the date that the program is modified or the recipient state decides not to continue its application in the program's current scope. The report describes how the current law has expanded eligibility for, and provision of, CHIP/ACCHIP funding through the ACA. ACA and CARES Act also have provided funding to states for administrative expenses associated with program implementation. Additional ACA/CARES Act provisions covered in this report, to the extent enacted at the beginning of the 116th Congress, provide 3 or 6 months of additional, transitional funding for SRAE for each grant recipient (see Table 1). The report also describes how the ACA/CARES Act provisions expand Medicaid eligibility in the program and provides a list of provisions that are scheduled to expire at the end of the current congressional session. These provisions include a provision that provides a 10 year extension to the 1992 law that authorizes the Health Care Reform Resource Project (for which there was no activity in the 116th and 15th Congresses, despite the expiration in 2006). It also includes a provision that limits the amount of time to which the Medicaid program pays for non-inpatient care provided for the state's share, as well as other provisions applicable to state and territory Medicaid programs. A complete list of provisions in this report is found 12 pages of the report. 2 tables", "T h Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) serves as the financial institution for carrying out federal farm commodity price support and production programs. CCC is subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture at the USDA. The mission of the corporation is to carry out commodity support, but the corporation also manages a portfolio of financial resources derived from the $100 million authorization. Operating on a business-like basis, the corporation has made important strides over the years in achieving its current stature. Although numerous issues affect CCC operations, several have been most significant in causing friction and controversy among USDA stakeholders. For most of the corporation's history, there has been tension between CCC and USDA over the extent of CCC's role in supplying a financial safety net and the scope of the safety net for CCC. There were long-term debates regarding how best to use CCC and how best to define CCC as a cooperative financial institution to the Federal courts, which concluded in the 1980's that CCC is primarily a government entity. The issues over the management of CCC's capital structure were particularly problematic. The corporation's $3 million appropriation was insufficient for CCC's initial needs and several subsequent acts have authorized a stock certificate-issuance program that has been used to expand its capital $13 billion portfolio. There were continuing issues regarding how closely the corporation follows the statutes and rules of the Farm Service Agency, which has provided a number of challenges for CCC to comply with Farm Service Agency (FSA). CCC has been involved in a number of controversies that continue to be unresolved. For more than a decade prior to the 1930s, USDA was able to make significant contributions to the farm industry. However, CCC's role in agriculture was not developed until a national agricultural crisis occurred in the early part of the 20th century. The depression of the 1930s, brought about by the economic fallout of the Great Depression, caused severe harm to farmers and created a need to provide financial relief to millions of farmers. Several initiatives followed, including the New Deal, the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 (AAAsAA), and the Commodity Credit Corporation. In recent years, CCC has expanded its roles in rural development and infrastructure to help rural communities. In addition it serves as a financial institution that provides a wealth of financial services to rural America. The USDA has $22 billion in sales and services and nearly 800 positions to accomplish its many and varied tasks. USDA provides assistance to farmers to buy or sell agricultural products or otherwise improve their bottom line. As agricultural markets have changed, USDA has served farmers with fewer commodities for sale. There has also been a need to provide financial assistance to farmers suffering from the declining ag industry. USDA has found new markets in international trade and rural development, but its mission and responsibilities are broad and varied. This includes the financing of a number of rural transportation systems, providing emergency disaster assistance, and helping rural small businesses to develop or expand. Other duties of the USDA to assist rural communities include supporting and developing small hospitals and medical facilities. Several USDA rural economic programs exist in addition to ARC/MCP's Title I programs. CCC has served as a partner and an innovator to USDA missions in a number of areas including insurance, lending, retirement, and health care. For almost a decade, CCC's primary method of operating as a cooperative financial institution has been to borrow 4% of an American farmer's net farm income or less if the farmer receives less. Farmers are then able to use these funds to buy products from CCC for resale (see CCC's History). CCC also provides a variety of financial instruments to farmers. CCC provides loans to farmers to purchase agricultural or other assets, such as buildings, equipment, and machinery. CCC loans are guaranteed by the USDA, the Rural Development Agency (RDA), and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). CCC provides these loans at very low rates of a few percent, which means CCC effectively bears all but 1% of its costs. CCC loans also provide an opportunity for farmers to be able to obtain more credit than they would through traditional lenders. CCC also provides short-term consumer credit to farmers, as well as more complicated programs such as life insurance. Despite these many initiatives, CCC continues to be a controversial figure for a number of stakeholders. Issues affecting CCC include issues related to its board and its directors. Currently, CCC has 12 members on its board. CCC Directors who meet the statutory term limits are required by the National Farm Service Act to serve for five years. CCC Directors serve on an unpaid basis and receive no salary or compensation. CCC Directors also serve on the FAS council and receive a salary from the FSA. In addition to serving on these councils, CCC Directors are also required by law to act in fiduciary responsibility. CCC Directors are not required to make a financial audit of the corporation. The Auditor General recently received information from an outside source that CCC Directors had received an $8 million annual payment from CCC. This has led", "On February 10, 2020, the Trump Administration proposed a $44.12 billion (including $158.90 million in mandatory retirement funds) request for additional SFOPS funding, which is nearly 1% of an April 2020 BCA cap of $1.58 trillion. The SEO committee recommends funding in this amount, and requests Congress to consider including emergency pandemic funding in SFOPS to help address the COVID-19 epidemic globally. If the SFOPS request is enacted without any changes, the gap between the existing and proposed level would widen to nearly 3%; thus, the Trump Administration's suggested $13.08 billion increase from FY20 would not be sufficient to address that gap. The current SFOPS funding levels will be even tighter due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and other factors. For many of the SFOPS accounts, their FY20 levels are closer to their FY19-level funding of about $8.02 billion, and that level will decrease even further in FY21. A significant percentage (approximately 22%) of SFOPS funding already goes to administrative expenses each year, so it is even more likely that Congress and the Trump Administration will continue their recent efforts to streamline the SFOPS process by shifting more funding to core missions rather than supporting non-core tasks that can be done elsewhere. Therefore, the Administration's request of $2.12 billion (from the previous $2.43 billion in FY20) is 30% or less than the gap between existing and proposed levels. While the SFOPS request increases the share of mandatory SFOOS funding, it also includes the $58 billion Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (PUC) appropriation, which is not part of the SFOPS funding formula. This also increases the gap between existing and proposed levels, so that SFOOS funding is 7.8% or more than $38 billion in a larger fiscal year than previous years. SFOOS funding for these requests in FY20 was $158.90 million, which is nearly 0.5% of the total SFOOS appropriations of $13.58 billion; the total appropriations for SFOIPS and OFOIS together in FY20 was $162.40 million (or 7.2% of FY20 SFOIPS and OFOIS). Based on the pandemic-related appropriations and funding requests, it is likely that the SFOOS caps for FY21 will be lower, likely around $4 to $6 billion. Congress could enact such changes while still continuing to work on fiscal year 2021 appropriations, which were temporarily delayed when Congress closed from March 14 to April 8. A pandemic-related increase in additional SFOPS funding would be required to meet the same FY20 percentage as FY21. The SFOPS request includes $7.48 billion in SFOOS funding, which is 64.6% or more than FY20's $12.33 billion than was enacted. This indicates that Congress could enact SFOOS funding that is almost double SFOOS funding in a fiscal year than previous years if other fiscal year 2021 appropriations are delayed due to an economic downturn. Even with this request, less than one-third of sFOOS SFOOS funding levels could be maintained through FY21. A larger share of the SFOOS funding in a fiscal year is spent on administration and overhead costs, with only $20.50 billion of the FY20 total devoted to that (16.9%) compared with $43 billion of the FY19 request (41.9%). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, it is reasonable to expect that Congress and the Administration will seek more efficient ways to utilize SFOOS funds. In light of the pandemic, the SFOOS request to Congress is just as relevant as it has been in past years. In addition, a temporary global emergency pandemic supplemental funding request of $14 billion would provide significant support to public health institutions and the health sector at large. This fund is specifically intended for non-SFOOS costs, such as testing, contact tracing, PPE, and treatment costs related to COVID-19. The Administration also released a COVID-19 response estimate in early April ($2.2 trillion in FY21), which supports this request by emphasizing significant funding needed for this pandemic. It is likely that in addition to the requested $1.58 trillion in CIPSS-like additional funding for the health care sector, additional COVID-19-related funding for the SFOOS and the global healthcare system will follow. Despite being enacted on time to avoid most COVID-19 related shutdowns, the cost of pandemic-related relief is an increasingly pressing fiscal year challenge during the pandemic. Therefore, Congress needs to consider enacting further COVID-19 stimulus funding along with the SFOOS request in FY21.", "Fully autonomous vehicles, which could carry out many or all of their functions without any human driver, may someday bring about sweeping social and economic changes and breakthroughs in traffic safety.

A bipartisan caucus in the U.S. Congress comprises a House Baltic Caucus with almost two-thirds bipartisan support, aiming to maintain and strengthen a group of three countries' relationship. U.S. policy is driven by a Baltic relationship in which Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania prioritize membership in NATO and the European Union. The U.S. House Baltic Caucus comprises members with more than two-thirds bipartisan support, but it's not a U.S. policy caucus due to a lack of congressional power. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania stand out among post-Soviet states, as they lead countries in the Baltic Group of the European Union and NATO while maintaining largely democratic systems and free enterprise. A majority of their populations are ethnic Russian-speaking, and recent Russian propaganda campaigns target them for destabilizing the region; but most U.S. representatives have pushed back against and dismissed such allegations. Congress established, maintained, and continues to promote a Baltic relationship, as well as bipartisan, bicameral institutional support for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from a number of standing committees and individual Members. Members of these parliaments, while historically the center-right and center-left in their respective countries, have a variety of political backgrounds and are in various ways involved with the bilateral relationship. The European Union as a whole is a supporter, but not a member, of the European Partnership with Russia and Eastern Europe since 2017. The United States, especially through the Baltic Caucus and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been consistently supportive of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, while pushing them to cooperate with the EU in a variety of areas as well. The Baltic states play a lead role in U.S.-Russia relations and the new U.S. administration could continue the trend. In response to Russian propaganda campaigns, the Baltic states have their own Baltic security network.

After more than 60,000 COVID-19 cases were reported, on March 13, 2020, President Trump issued Public Health Emergency Declaration 1.1 (E.O. ). This set emergency authorities in the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, and (on March 17) the Treasury. These authorities were used on a wide range of policies to respond to COVID-19, including increasing testing, issuing medical advice, and deploying medical personnel. Other federal agencies quickly followed suit, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Homeland Security (TSA), and the Department of the Treasury issued guidance to public and health care organizations. The VA provided regular updates to Congress on its response activities (H.Res. 1148, March 11); its response to COVID-19 in its facilities (H.Res. 1151, March 12); and the provision of emergency medical care to veterans nationwide (H.Res. 1157, March 13). VA medical facilities provided care services to over 9 million veterans in FY2020. The VA also implemented new medical and safety guidelines to ensure the health and safety of its staff, patients, and visitors, including screening procedures, providing protective gear, and implementing telemedicine in its clinics. In March, VA provided regular medical and diagnostic assessments, such as COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, to millions who presented in person with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. By March 17, all VA medical centers had implemented measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. The FDA released COVID-19 Drug Supply Chain Security Act (H.R. 6075, March 23); the Department of Education released a number of related rules that provided guidance or restrictions on tuition payment that could be paid using student GI Bill benefits (H.Res. 1185, March 24); and the Small Business Administration (SBA) issued emergency assistance loans to small businesses adversely affected by COVID-19-based disruptions (H.Res. 1187, March 24). These types of emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are now used routinely in response to emerging outbreaks of new infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant consequences for the VA's budgetary requirements for medical care for veterans. In February, VA hospitals and clinics treated more than 100,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, including more than 13 thousand patients, making it one of the largest healthcare systems in the world. In March 2020, the Department of Veterans Affairs released two important documents highlighting the immediate threats, impacts, and recommendations for COVID-19 response. One document, the \"COVID-19 Impact on the Department of Veterans Affairs and VHA 2020 Strategic Plan,\" outlines the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) immediate risk of COVID-19, outlining the significant steps and strategies available. This plan outlines numerous plans across a variety of divisions and offices within the Department (VHA) and is detailed below. The Office of Medical and Health System Modernization (OMHM) is the department in charge of providing medical care to veterans and has been coordinating the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) and the Department of Defense's (DOD) response to the pandemic since early March. The VA has more than 2,000 hospital locations. The VA is preparing for an influx of COVID-19 patients across the country and the department is coordinating its response. The VA was early in providing COVID-19 testing to Veterans. Some 300 VA clinics had conducted about 700,000 COVID-19 tests statewide by mid-March. The VA has initiated a partnership with the private sector and other healthcare entities through the VA Office of Information Technology (OIT) to support medical laboratory testing by implementing a laboratory test that will include more than 100 labs nationwide. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) study has found that coronavirus attacks the respiratory tract, and the department is developing treatments that use blood plasma for patients. These are examples of some of the more unconventional methods that the VA will use to help treat COVID-19. The VA is working closely with the Department of Defense (DOD) to address certain challenges that they may face as a result of COVID-19. There are approximately 7.1 million patients enrolled in VA health care services. The VA serves approximately 8 million outpatient visits annually. It is also important to note that the VA is using telemedicine technologies to increase the accessibility of virtual health care care to the public. Approximately 100% of the VHA health care provider team is now utilizing virtual care. The department is also actively providing COVID", "The tax-deductible component in contributions made to qualifying organizations is the subject of the tax treatment of charitable contributions, and certain types of donations or properties are more likely to be excluded from its definition. Major legislative changes that affect the amount the taxpayer may deduct for contributions to qualifying organizations, depending on certain type/class of property or the type of organization that received them, begin with the first installment of the Internal Revenue (Tax) Circular 120 in 1917. 1 The report concluded that the Charitable Deduction has been utilized and \"an important source of charitable contributions.\" The Internal Revenue Service began to expand the scope of the tax treatment of charitable contributions through tax rulings and the Internal Revenue Manual itself in 1961. In addition, Congress in 1976 extended the existing legislation for two years. Later, Congress changed the basis of taxation for charitable donations to be made by direct attribution of the income, and, therefore, deductions up to 100% of taxpayer's adjusted gross income for contributions to qualifying organizations. The tax treatment of charitable contributions began to undergo significant changes in the 1980's when the IRS made a number of important rulings. In addition, Congress in 1986 extended the deduction for all taxpayers in their current version. As a result, deductions up to 100% of adjusted gross income are available, although the tax treatment of additional donations beyond that amount was restricted to organizations that file Form 450 or Form 990. In 2001, Congress approved the \"Taxpayer Relief Act,\" which extended the deduction through 2017 for taxpayers who file a return. As a result, the deduction may apply to certain charitable deductions \"up to the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income minus 25%.\" As of 2017 and earlier, the 100% deduction is available to taxpayers who choose to make their donations through nonoperating charities. For taxpayers who choose to use a nonoperating foundation, the maximum amount available to a property or entity up to the property's fair market value at the time of its contribution is 25% of its fair market value at the time of the charitable contribution. Taxpayers can choose to use this charitable deduction before or after the tax year in which they donate to a qualifying organization. A taxpayer who decides to subtract their donation from their income in the year he is making it may increase the value of his deduction by up to 25% of 100% of his AGI. After 2017, the maximum amount of the deduction is set at 35%\u00e2\u20ac\u201da limitation that is phased out after 2017 and is scheduled to end after 2020. The 25% rule was set to expire by the Tax Cuts Reconciliation Act of 2017; however, the measure was modified and extended for two years in February 2018. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, containing many new tax deductions including a temporary, 100% deduction of charitable contributions (\"Code R 130), extending through 2025 (). In response to the enactment of the TRAP, CRS staff developed a detailed report on the tax treatment of charitable donations, which provided information on Code R 130, which allows taxpayers to deduct up to 100% of their AGI, if they choose to make their deductions to Code R 130 organizations. CODE R 130 tax treatment of certain donations to qualifying nonprofits and governmental units is discussed below, where the rules have been made permanent by enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The tax law is, however, subject to change by Congress in further legislation. A number of tax deductions are generally available to taxpayers who meet certain criteria. In many cases, these deductions are based on the \"number of years you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve held employment tax\u00c2 \u00e2\u00b0 or \u00e2\u20ac\u00b0 years of social security income\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0 or \u00c2\u00b0 years of life\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0 years \u00e2\u20ac\u00b0 years of unemployment\u00c2 \u00c2\u00ae years of retirement\u00c2 years of disability\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years of service\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0 years of health\u00c2 \u00ae years of military\u00c2 years of maternity\u00c2 \u00c2\u00ae years of disability\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years of sickness\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years of medical care\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years of medical education\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years of service\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years\u00c2 y years of education\u00c2 y years of medical school\u00c2 \u00c2\ufffd years after which an employer\u00c2\"s plan\u00c2\u00a2 becomes the\u00e2\u2020\u0086 \u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd", "This report summarizes democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Policies about net metering depend on several factors, including the size of the utility's customer base and their priorities or the tax incentives available in the state and federal policies. State net metering policies are generally designed to encourage DG. 2. The number of U.S. electricity customers participating in net metering has been growing steadily since roughly 2013, when the EIA's data starts. EIA data show average annual net metering participation growth approaching 10%. Hawaii leads EIA data with more than 15% of customers participating in net metering. 3. The number of net metering customers in the United States in 2018 increased in every state, but the states that report the highest participation rates do not necessarily have the highest total net metering capacity. Some states with growing net metering may expect net metering to increase a lot more than is currently the case in those states. The high participation rates in Honolulu and other areas indicate those Hawaii's policy regarding net metering is similar to most other states: net metering is generally required, at least in an amount proportional to electricity sales or consumption from the utility's system of all customers (not necessarily customers of different net metering customers) for 5 years. In most states, the policy is more flexible with respect to meter size. In some states, a customer may be required to pay for only 100 kWh of electricity per months, while, in other states, the limit may be as low as 20 kWh per month. Some states (e.g., Hawaii) offer net metering regardless of the customer's usage as long as they agree to an annual fixed charge, and there may be other options for residential owners in some states. Some states also allow nonresidential customers to participate in net metering, such as those offering feed-in power and charging stations. The size of total net metering power in California (excluding those customers that contractually agreed to be paid for the retail price of electricity) is similar to that of all electric load in the state. 4. The main benefit of distributed generators (DG) according to the EIA is that they can create a new resource and reduce the need for other costly forms of generating capacity, such as the construction of large-scale solar and wind power facilities or natural gas plants, especially in areas that don't have the cost of these facilities' associated transmission infrastructure. Other benefits of DG include improved public health, noise reduction, decreased water cycle disruption, and more compact infrastructure for all energy users. The EIA, however, recommends that DG be installed before transmission facilities, since transmission facilities provide a centralized location for the introduction of new generation while DG must be near the load of potential customers (e.g. factories, residential areas) to provide the benefits. 5. Since the introduction of the EIA in 1980s, EIA has been the official source of DG performance measurement. The EIA reports aggregate DG capacity by region, state, and generation technology. It is important to note that DG is often an option to mitigate new transmission investment requirements for a transmission-intense system. In 2018, DG provided approximately 10.4% of the electricity used in the United States. DGs contribute to the \"inter-modality competition\" in which smaller DG sites compete with larger power plants in certain circumstances. 6. DG can be a way to avoid the costs of conventional transmission infrastructure or new plants. EIA has noted that DG is often more expensive than conventional generation methods in certain cases, however, in others its costs are comparable or cheaper to alternative technologies. 7. DG technology is typically more efficient than its transmission infrastructure, resulting in higher costs per kWh of electricity produced. EIA has reported that DG and their transmission infrastructure are nearly equally efficient. However, DG is considered to be a more sustainable energy source and can serve as an alternative source to conventional generation methods. 8. In some cases DG is used to mitigate new transmission investment costs and new transmission construction costs that can be incurred with DG at more frequent or more continuous frequency than conventional transmission infrastructure. There is also a report on the use of renewable portfolio standards to generate and store DG. 9. DG is considered a way to reduce new transmission infrastructure investment costs, even though transmission investment has been declining due to the increase of distributed generation. 10. The policy costs associated with DG exceed the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure costs, but the EIA has been estimating that DG is less cost to consumers than DG cost and electric transmission and distribution rates are rising. However, DG is typically a less costly overall solution from an economics perspective than the power generation method, and the benefits of DG and other renewable energy technologies can benefit multiple customers. In some cases, the costs of new transmission infrastructure can be avoided by DG, reducing costs of all energy users including those of transmission infrastructure. Finally, DG technology is typically more efficient than its", "In FY2020, Congress provided approximately $900 million in international food assistance through different accounts in the Agriculture and SFOPS appropriations bills, including $900 million in the Food for Peace Title I Direct Credit and Food for Progress Program account, the Food for Peace Title II Grants account, and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program account.

Technology offers convenient and fast transactions for consumers and businesses. Payment apps linked to bank accounts and payment cards allow individuals to send payments to each other. TEXT: T his report examines technological innovation in payment systems used to process retail and wholesale transactions, such as cards, and electronic payments for retail and wholesale consumers. Retail payment systems, such as credit and debit cards, automated clearing houses, and point-of-sale terminals, have increased in popularity as consumers embrace cashless transactions. Technological advances in digitization and data processing and storage have greatly increased the availability and convenience of electronic payments. According to the Federal Reserve's triennial payment study, retail electronic payment usage rates have been in decline. The number of transactions of retail electronic payment systems, credit cards, and ACH systems have been increasing yearly. In 2015, the total retail payment value was $586.8 trillion. B y 2013, mobile payment apps have increased in consumer adoption; the majority of mobile payment transactions occur through a mobile device. However, a decrease in payment card usage has occurred since the introduction of mobile payment apps, with 2015 retail electronic payment usage increasing 4.4%, indicating a decrease in payment card usage in 2015. The share of transactions processed through new products is increasing, with a decrease in the number of payments made with checks in 2015, which is likely due to a decrease in traditional check payments.\nPayment systems consisting of cardholders, merchants, financial institutions, processors or service providers have been in use since the 1960s. Technological developments in digitization and data processing and storage have increased the availability and convenience of electronic payments. Recent research indicates that mobile payment usage is declining, while other trends suggest an increase in processing of retail and wholesale payments through electronic methods. Financial institutions that provide payments services include card networks such as Visa and Mastercard, check networks such as PayPal, and mobile payment companies such as PayPal.", "Edge providers generate revenue by selling content or offering subscription services.

The scope of this report is limited to the effects of COVID-19 on federally funded R&D. In addition, the report discusses issues that may arise from COVID-19, as well as actions being taken on the behalf of federal agencies and private organizations to combat the virus. Actions being taken by federal agencies, such as closing R&D facilities, relocating employees to work remotely while permitting limited on-site work, and changing processes to comply with distancing requirements, may be in response to COVID-19. Some laboratories may be open to a limited number of mission-critical events and personnel may be required to travel via chartered flights for short meetings instead of using telework. Research in the field is focusing on the COVID virus, vaccines, and treatments, to include the identification of the virus, its spread through the community, and the development of new treatments. Additionally, research is being conducted on the economic and public health effects of the virus and its effect on access to resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted scientific discovery and innovation in the U.S. It has resulted in a demand for more timely and timely access to scientific expertise and resources. Federal R&Ds continue to play an essential role, responding rapidly to emerging challenges as well as providing scientific insight into emerging economic and public health challenges. Due to COVID-19, certain federal research laboratories such as NASA's Center for Biological Diversity Sciences are closed, and others such as NIST are shifting some employees to telework arrangements to adhere to the necessary distancing requirements. Agencies are responding to the pandemic by shifting their R&D efforts in support of COVID-19. Despite this pandemic, some R&D facilities may be able to remain operational to some extent as certain functions, even involving remotely accessed laboratories, may be critical to combat the virus and its associated economic impacts. During this COVID-19 pandemic, the federal federal research and development enterprise is contributing to a rapidly expanding body of rapidly growing scientific knowledge and to developing innovative therapies to help mitigate the economic impact of the virus. A large portion of federal R&D is already being conducted remote, and access to facilities has been curtailed in many federal research laboratories and some are undergoing social distancing. Most NIST employees are working remotely but a limited number of them are onsite providing limited essential services, including calibration of precision instruments, the distribution of time and frequency signals, and maintenance of the National Vulnerability Database. Research in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is being focused on the characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccines, and treatments to lessen its impacts on communities. Research on all topics is continuing, including those focused on public health and economic impacts of the pandemic. Most federal research laboratories are currently closed or operating with limited access to government funding. Federal R&D continues to advance critical scientific frontiers, but access to government scientists may be limited in the shorter term at least. While many federal offices are making best efforts to keep on working through the pandemic, some agency functions may be impacted as well, and some may incur additional costs. In addition, the unprecedented depth of the pandemic and the related economic and public health effects continue to create challenges for the entire scientific enterprise, including federal laboratories. Research on coronavirus, vaccines, and treatments will continue to advance, and agencies and private sector organizations will continue to support the discovery and development efforts of critical therapies.", "Dams may provide flood control, hydroelectric power, recreation, navigation, and water supply, but may pose a potential safety threat to populations and the environment when they fail. Federal agencies own a large percentage of American dams; therefore, federal programs account for a large portion of the dam safety effort. Rebuilds or alterations to dams are uncommon yet may be needed to repair dams that have sustained serious damage. Numerous potential risks for dams include aging and inadequate maintenance, increased populations in or about reservoir areas that encroach upstream or downstream, and increased development of land upstream or downstream of dams. Dam safety generally focuses on prevention of dam failure, response to actual dam-related emergencies, and routine maintenance by dam owners and regulators. Federal programs like the National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) have a broad role in dam safety, monitoring the status of dams in their inventory and helping dam owners/operators assess their risks and complete risk assessments. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), a federal agency responsible for building and maintaining dams and reservoirs, is a key contributor to dam safety. Several federal agencies are involved in dam safety from a regulatory perspective. State dam safety programs may serve as a source of additional funding for dam operators and rehabilitation activities. Dams vary (e.g., location and reservoir size), so it is generally desirable to divide the safety risks into three groups: high-risk dams, moderate- or low-risk dam sites where dam safety initiatives are common, and sites with minimal safety problems. The level of risk increases as dam projects become more complex\u00e2\u0086\"e.g., geologic, biological, or geological\u00e2\u0088\"more sites are at higher risk of incidents, and the consequences include greater potential impacts to downstream recreation, navigation, and hydroelectricity (\u00c2\u00a520 Million loss for recreation, \u00c2\u00a550 Million loss for navigation, \u00c2\u00a520 Million loss for hydroelectricity)\u00e2\u0086\u00e2\u00a2\u00c2\u00aa\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b8\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b8\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00aa\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c3\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00ef\u00bf\u00c2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd \u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2", "NATO leaders sought to highlight the alliance's achievements and alliance's deterrence -- notably, the Trump Administration's NATO policy has increased military spending at a significant level.

"Text discusses credit unions as institutions that are member-owned, provide many other financial products, engage in consumer and residential lending, and have restrictions on lending similar to

The report, which is in its sixth year, covers minerals ranging from valuable rare earth and rare metal components to common mineral resources like limestone, sand, and gravel when mined on federal lands, where no Federal royalties are required. It covers all minerals produced on federal lands as well as the process used by the US Department of the Interior to negotiate long terms mine leases. The report covers a wide range of topics in the mining sector such as a discussion of the current federal regulations for mineral resource production. One of the top topics under discussion in the report is the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands. This law allows any person or entity to purchase the lease rights on any federal land that contains any valuable mineral or mineral deposit. The report explains the process of doing so (the process is more complex than acquiring and developing petroleum reserves). The report also covers the various forms of royalties and their definitions. The term \" critical minerals\" is used in this report to refer to a category of minerals with significant national defense and energy needs. While most U.S. mining companies hold multiple leases, the report covers only those companies actually providing minerals. Companies are required to provide the public with detailed information about mining operations. Additionally, the report presents information and statistics about federal land minerals, royalties, Federal royalties, and mining laws and regulations. The report concludes that the General Mining Law of 1872 is no longer in force. The federal government now manages minerals on federal land that can be used for non-mineral purposes. These include public land for hunting, fishing, wind, solar, geothermal, conservation, science, recreation, and the creation of new species. In 2012, the US Department of Interior reviewed and consolidated 25 different federal mining law permits to improve consistency and simplify the process.

DOD spent approximately $390 million on the three-year period to conduct the audits. The Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) reported an estimated $153 million in financial materials errors in FY2019 and an estimated $5.3 million that was unaccounted for in FY2017 due to lack of DOD financial statements. DOD's FY2018 financial statement audit was based on GAAP; however, the FY2019 audit and the underlying line items were based on GAGAAP standards related to financial reporting of internal controls that are not GAAP-based. The majority of DOD's financial statements for FY2018 and FY2019 were completed by 23 outside auditors. DOD spent approximately $413 million on its FY2018 financial statement audit; however, approximately $406 million was spent on its FY2019 financial statement audit. The Department of Defense (DOD) is subject to an integrated financial system (IFS) that is composed of accounting, financial management, budgeting, collection, payments, travel, and inventory systems. These systems, also known as the Business Information System (BIS) and Management, Accounting, and Performance Reporting System (MARS) are interconnected with each other and the use of a central financial system allows for effective financial management of the Department of Defense \u00e2\u0080\u0094s $4 billion budget. In FY2019, there was a significant error that included the failure of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (OIG) financial management systems to report $152 million in the Treasury Department account in DOD's financial accounting system. The Department of Defense OIG provided it did not have the ability to provide a specific amount to identify the errors. In July 2019, there was a significant error of $153 million in the Treasury Department account in DOD's financial accounting system due to an error with payment processing. This error required payments processing. In October 2017, there was a significant error of processing problems affecting all of the military accounts payable accounting modules due to the Treasury Department processing system being down. In February 2018, there was a significant error affecting a portion of the DOD accounting system that caused financial statements not to record the correct amounts of DOD funds. There were specific errors in the Treasury Department, Defense Finance and Accounting Command (DFAC), and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) accounts. Overall, there were not any significant errors in the FY2019 financial statement audits. Both the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (OIG) in FY2019 and the Department of Defense IG reported unaccounted for financial errors totaling approximately $4 million for each fiscal year. According to the IG, the Department of Defense spent approximately $153 million in FY2019 for errors in processing payments. According to the IG, DOD is still using the outdated legacy financial system. DOD has made progress in transitioning to a integrated financial system and modernized DOD processes for accounting and finance, but the financial system, which was constructed to address issues and streamlining of accounting and finance functions, is still not adequate in ensuring the proper financial management controls.

The current annual allotment of 50,000 diversity visas is split between two pools: 25,000 for asylum seekers, political refugees, and \"other.\" While there are no direct amendments to this system, the INA has been modified or extended for at least six years, including the 10-year temporary relief in FY2019 and the expiration renewal in NACARA. The INA is applicable to immigrants who can apply while in the U.S., but, for asylum-seekers, the application must be made in a third country that is open to receiving large amounts of refugees. INSIDE: Chart is \"A summary of family reunification and diversity immigrant laws.\"\nDiversity Visa Eligibility Requirements For A Family-Based or Employment-Based Immigrant To Apply:\nA foreign national, except from certain Arab countries, must have at minimum a high school education, or 2 years of training or experience in an occupation that requires 3+ years of training or experience in the U.S. That qualification may be waived from certain countries after a review of individual circumstances. The INA allows certain special categories of immigrants to apply for a diversity visa, as listed below.\nINSIGHT: In the past Congress made up to 20% of DV's the annual allocation, which is now set at 55,000 visas each year. Also, the current number available to apply is 26,000. On December 17, 2019, President Trump extended the number of visas to issue in 20,000. On February 24, 2020, President Trump has revoked the Executive Order allowing new DV applicants between the ages of 21 and 55. He is giving DHS 60 days between the issuance of the revocation and December 31, 2021 to allow the applicants to complete their application prior to the revocation expiry. An employee's U.S. spouse may apply for a DV if they meet certain qualifications and requirements as listed by DHS.\nDiversity Visa Eligibility Requirements also allow for individuals to be eligible to apply for a 3-year provisional work visa after they have applied for the DV to ensure they meet employment-based immigration requirements. The INA may qualify certain aliens within the diversity immigrant categories for employment-based visas.\nINSIDE: Chart shows the steps to be eligible for a Diversity Visa. The chart gives an analysis of the Diversity Visa and the related immigration categories. It also shows the number of Diversity Visas that are issued each year.", "On September 30, 2015, Congress reauthorized the Livestock Mandatory-Reporting Act of 1999 ( PL-161-7 ) in the enacting law, P.L. 114-54.

In March 1922, it took over Afghan control from the British; its goal of reasserting its supremacy may eventually lead Afghanistan to go the route of Iraq and remove all the troops. At the U.S. Embassy, Kabul, Taliban elements remain on staff despite having been told to leave due to deteriorating relations with the Afghan government. The Taliban continues to offer a safe haven to regional anti-Shiite Sunni insurgents. Afghanistan: Country Profile Afghanistan Country Profile Afghanistan Country Profile - Afghanistan is a republic that has elected a President. Afghanistan is now an Islamic republic, with Islam being the only allowed religion. Afghanistan's National Constitution Law, 2010 constitutionally designates Afghanistan as an Islamic republic, which has Islamic courts that oversee laws. While there are no Sharia Courts in the country, Afghan law is based on Sharia; the constitution explicitly calls for the \"protection of religion and religious minorities\". The population of roughly 30 million has shrunk due to refugees now living in camps, the current death toll is an estimated 100,000 killed by the Taliban. There are now 10 US military missions in Afghanistan, with 13,850 US troops, most of them now contractors from private corporations.

The defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts' decisions and granted the defendant's new trial. On the defendant's third trial for the murder, which was not considered in the first two trials, the prosecution used peremptory challenges without submitting any race-neutral reasons to their motion authority. After a jury convicted the defendant of murder on four separate occasions, the defendant was sentenced to death. During the trial in his fourth case, the prosecution made peremptory challenges to each of two black prospective jurors but not to any of the white prospects. With a majority of the Mississippi Supreme Court siding against the defendant, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a motion to the defendant to revisit certain death-penalty proceedings concerning racial discrimination. On remand by the Mississippi Supreme Court, the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were reinstated after several lower courts' decisions were reversed by SCOTUS in Foster v. Chatman.", "U.S. vaccine developers, manufacturers, and the U.S. government have long been key players in global vaccination campaigns. The U.S. government is a top donor to the GAVI partnership to support global childhood immunization campaigns, and approximately 900 million children worldwide have received the necessary vaccines. GAVI reports approximately 400 million children receive the full vaccination schedule every year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has contributed close to $226 million for child vaccines since 2000. From 2000 to 2018, approximately 100 million children worldwide have not received full vaccination. The WHO recommends that all children receive 10 vaccines. Since their inception, GAVI has supported more than 700 million children's vaccinations against 12 diseases. Vaccinations have played a crucial role in reducing child mortality and lowering infectious disease incidence. In the United States, the vaccines are generally received in two doses and one dose of DTP3 is recommended within the first few months of age, with booster shots at ages 4-6. In countries with a lower number of years of vaccine campaigns, the introduction of vaccines can often result in widespread child deaths. GAVI reports approximately 400 million children worldwide received the full vaccination schedule of DTP3 and VDPVs by 2018. More than 100 million children worldwide have been immunized against 10 diseases in at least 70 countries since 2000 including vaccines against Hepatitis B (5.3 million children), Hib (6 million children), and rotavirus (15.4 million children). WHO immunization guidelines recommend that children receive their vaccinations by age 2, and that routine childhood vaccination be included in all immunization schedules. In 2018, 20 million infants and children worldwide were immunized each year. GAVI reports 100 million children worldwide have been immunized against 10 diseases since 2000. According to GAVI, close to 60% of deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases occur in just 10 countries. Nearly 1 in 7 deaths in under-5 children occur due to VPDs. Over 60% of deaths from VPDs occur in just 10 countries. According to GAVI, around 400 million children worldwide have been immunized against the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine combination since 2000. Over the past 2 decades, GAVI has contributed more than $2 billion ($227 million) for U.S. vaccine development and more than $10 billion to vaccine therapeutics in children in 70 countries. As of 2018, more than 1 million children worldwide are vaccinated against 11 diseases. Although immunization has significantly reduced mortality and death from vaccine-preventable diseases, there are 10 vaccine-preventable diseases that GAVI recommends be introduced into immunization schedules. Vaccination can reduce the incidence of infectious diseases up to 90%. Vaccine-preventable childhood infections were considered vaccine preventable diseases when GAVI was founded in 2000; however, the list of recommendations has expanded over the past 20 years to include even more infections. DTP3 has been replaced by the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis) vaccine. From 2016 to 2018, more than 300 million children worldwide received 11 vaccines. There are vaccines available to prevent each of the most vaccine-preventable 5 diseases (see Figure 4). The vaccine vaccines have been provided to approximately 80% of children living in low- and middle-income countries. In 2018, close to 90% of deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases occur in less than 10 countries. Vaccine-preventable disease incidence can be reduced up to 90%, and has been reduced 60% between 2000 and 2016. Since their inception, GAVI has provided approximately 1 billion doses of vaccine to over 870 million children. Approximately 75% of vaccine was delivered to less than 5% of world population. As a founding member of GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations), the United States provides $10 billion to GAVI each year to deliver GAVI-supplied vaccines to GAVI member countries. GAVI has donated a total of approximately $500 million to GAVI-supply countries since inception. GAVI has delivered more than 200 billion doses of vaccine and has supplied more than 2 billion doses of GAVI-supplementary vaccines to GAVI member countries since 2000. As of 2018, 10 vaccines have been established within GAVI's immunization system (see Figure 5). Global vaccine immunization has risen more than five-fold since 1980. According to GAVI, there are 10 vaccines available to prevent 11 vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there are vaccines and vaccination activities available to prevent an additional 34 vaccine", "In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted by the UNFCCC, providing the global instrument to reduce

the Transformation reform process has no single document detailing its goals and structure, and no comprehensive report summarizing its full scope. The approach to USAID reform may be seen as particularly inconsistent regarding USAID assistance to partner countries. Transformation has evolved from a \"new aid model\" to a general reform initiative where change is the dominant theme, though specific reforms are more \"focused\" in nature. At present, Transformation appears consistent with USAID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader efforts to prioritize reform objectives, which include assisting partner countries in reaching self-sufficiency and expanding economic opportunity in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence at the core of the evaluation suggests Transformation is now the overarching method for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) assistance, given the focus on reform of many processes and structures. The reform effort can be seen as inconsistent with USAID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier reform efforts in the 1990s and 2000s due to the more defined vision provided this year by USAID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Transformation. Even the Transformation \"highlights\" the range of objectives, processes, functions, and priorities within USAID that may overlap in structure with the reforms already underway for other U.S. government agencies. This suggests Transformation may be seen as more of a \"loose\" strategy for USAID transformation efforts, at present.

"The Navy aims to acquire large unmanned surface and underwater vessels and their associated technologies, as well as smaller unmanned aircraft and their associated technologies, in order to maintain the Navy's ability to accomplish diverse missions, such as countering a hostile Chinese presence as well as providing a rapid response for a crisis involving, for example, a natural disaster in California. CRS concludes that the Navy wants to replace the U.S. Navy's current fleet organization with a shift to a more widely distributed architecture and that the large unmanned vessels covered in this report would fit within that vision. This report explains how the Navy's acquisition strategies and its 2021 research and development funding requests might affect the size and type of naval architecture envisioned by the Chief of Staff Officer for the Navy during the 2021 planning cycle. HIGHLIGHTS: - The Navy's acquisition strategies for unmanned vessels have drawn concerns over their role in a possible military conflict with China. - The Navy wants to shift to a more widely distributed architecture and has requested $579.9 million in R&D funding for fiscal year 2021 to enable these shipbuilding and UV initiatives. - Current and future military ship designs have been driven by advancements in manned ship design and guided by military systems-integration requirements that also drive unmanned ship/underwater vessel design. - The Navy and its shipbuilding partners are exploring ideas and designs for UVs that provide alternative concepts for the Navy's Fleet of the Future. - A significant area of ongoing experimentation and innovation across Navy programs and systems are designed to minimize the impact on force integration and maintenance. - 7/1/2020\n-", "A review of FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Enacted 12/17/2019; and 11/27/2019 Senate passed bill (H.R. 2500, S. 1790); the Senate and House conferees conferenced on 12/20/2019, resulting in the Senate passing bill S. 1790 on 3/20/2020; the House and Senate passed a conference report (H.

The INA is an extremely restrictive and selective approach to immigration, and it offers almost no chance of lawful admission for its present population of millions of illegally present aliens. The INA's limited approach to legalization was part of a larger discussion on the country's immigration, and it requires a well-defined and detailed plan to expand that approach; currently, it appears to be incapable of changing, at least in the near future.

"The National Flood Insurance Program program (NFIP) authorizes federal financial assistance to property owners who choose to insure the losses under flood insurance policies issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The law, in part, authorizes the NFIP to sell insurance for residential property in flood-prone areas, or \"floods\". The NFIP is designed to cover the first $500,000 of insured losses each year of the program, which is expected to be less than $600 per NFIP policy.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program, established in 1962 and last amended in 2012, provides various types of insurance to residential property owners. The program insures NFIP participants against the cost of catastrophic losses due to flood damage. Some provisions of the NFIP extend coverage against non-flood-related hazards. In 2013 Congress amended and extended the NFIP until 2024, while retaining the NFIP's program structure. In 2019 the National Flood Insurance Program introduced new risk management options (risk-based pricing) for NFIP policies. In July 2014, the 42nd annual reauthorization, or 'REPEARED' reauthorization, was passed. The reauthorized the NFIP through September 30, 2024. Both the House and Senate, separate bills, have introduced plans to reauthorize the program through December 2029. The 2019 REPEARED legislation also added one-year extension for current property owners to maintain NFIP flood insurance, while they were still covered to the NFIP policy limits, from September 30, 2019, until September 30, 2024. An updated risk-based rating structure, or \"risk-based premium,\" was implemented in September 30, 2019.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides residential property owners with financial protection from flood losses. The program has not yet been reauthorized, and a 2019 REPEARED bill extension provided an additional one-year coverage extension for NFIP flood insurance from September 30, 2024. In 2019, legislation also modified NFIP risk-based premium structure. The NFIP was last modified by the HOME Act of 2014.", "On October 5, 2018, Congress enacted legislation, Public Law ((115-7)), which reauthorized CCS, to create additional incentives for state investment in CCS.

However, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), on October 23, 2018, directed DOE to expand the R&D activities on carbon storage to ensure its feasibility and to develop a policy for geologic sequestration. On October 24, 2018, Congress extended the R&D tax credits for carbon storage until December 21, 2020. On October 17, 2018, Secretary of Energy (E. Warren) directed DOE to develop a comprehensive R&D strategy for carbon storage and geologic sequestration. On October 24, 2018, DOE announced a request for proposals (RFP) for carbon capture technology related to fossil fuel utilization. On October 22, 2018, DOE directed DOE to publish a report on feasibility of geologic storage of carbon dioxide based on recent studies. On December 7, 2018, members of Congress introduced legislation to extend the carbon storage R&D tax credit (CRS Report R44852, Taxing Energy). On December 10, 2018, members of Congress reauthorized the SDWA to December 3, 2027 (public law 112-231). On October 30, 2018, DOE announced the availability of federal land resources for CCS\u00e2\u00a6 the resource is in areas where there currently is no land usage for the purpose of underground injection of CO 2 for geologic sequestration. The DOE will begin geologic storage of CO 2 this winter. \"Carbon capture and sequestration rule,\" (CRS Report R44921, CCS Regulations), available at. cstricton@crs.gov.\nThis report discusses U.S. federal policies on carbon capture and sequestration, including geologic injection practices, carbon dioxide storage requirements, and research and development tax credits.", "Table A-1 includes the names of the seven federal regional commissions and authorities, their functional duties and their locations within the U.S. The text of the table is available on the BLS website at.

Of the seven federal regional commissions and authorities, four are currently active--the New York State Commission and the Northeast and Great Lakes Commission. Two commissions were established to address economic distress in Appalachia. Seven federal regional commissions and authorities provide funding for local organizations and governments to address economic distress in designated areas, and they can also receive federal grants. Each group is associated with a state-led program on regional economic development led by the National Governors Association that coordinates federal and state resources. In addition, four commissions have been established in various places across the United States to address regional economic development objectives.

Agencies struggle with efficient disposal, inventory, and use of personal property assets. The Personal Property Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-419), established new tracking and evaluation requirements. Weak agency practices can lead to improper disposal of assets or loss of funding. Weaknesses in the existing internal controls procedures are identified. Agencies must continually survey their personal property assets, maintain adequate internal controls, and maintain updated inventories. When agencies have excess personal property, they have the option to transfer the property directly to another federal agency. Agencies may also participate in a Direct Transfer of Computers or Peripheral Tools (CTDOT) program. Agencies must comply with the Personal Property Management Act of 2018, directing agencies to perform an annual inventory, maintain updated internal controls, and timely disposal procedures to effectively manage personal property. Weaknesses in existing processes and procedures result in improper disposal, unneeded funding for storage services, an outdated internal audit plan, lack of monitoring guidance or training, and improper inventory management or inadequate records on disposal. Agencies must ensure that their personal property inventory control methods are established as a routine control that is subject to periodic oversight. Agencies use the PMF-2 form (Program Measures Form 2) to document their personal property inventory, and they are required to inventory personal property items on an annual basis. Agencies must also ensure that their disposal procedures comply with the CTDOT program. Agencies should be prepared to report personal property items on an annual basis.

Agencies must document personal property disposal procedures and the PMF-2 form on which these procedures were performed. Agencies must perform an annual inventory of property requiring immediate disposal. Agencies must maintain periodic logs of personal property with which they plan to dispose of it and the amount of property they have disposed of. Agencies must determine which personal property items they are currently responsible for, and document them on an annual basis. Agencies must update their personal property disposal procedures. Agencies must comply with the National Personal Property Council's (NPPC) Inventory and Equipment Management for Federal Government Operations\u00e2\u00b3 process. Agencies must establish a National PMFTP Inventory System, or alternatively, use the information contained in the OMB PMF-2 form to maintain records and data. Agencies must report on PMF-2 and/or FTSC information on a monthly basis. Agencies must meet each requirement of the PFP-3 form. Agencies must determine each property's disposal process. Agencies must maintain inventories of each personal property item. Agencies must have a process in place to ensure personal property items are disposed of properly. Agencies must conduct property inspections prior to disposal, and document personal property items that they are disposed of. Agencies must document their personal property disposal process that is subject to review. Agencies must be able to justify the amount of personal property items they dispose.

To improve the DOD enterprise-wide cloud adoption strategy, current efforts are being made to standardize existing IT systems and adopt cloud services at the Department\u00e2\u20ac\u201d including a potential transition of DOD IT systems to cloud-based services, and the adoption of a \"multi-cloud, multi-vendor ecosystem\" spanning both public and private cloud infrastructure providers. While DOD is behind several government agencies in moving to cloud computing, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Federal Technology Service (FTS) Cloud Community of Practice continue to work in conjunction with the Federal CIO Council (FCCI) to share knowledge regarding cloud services and identify best practices for implementing cloud services in government IT environments. To ensure the success of their cloud adoption strategy, DOD will be implementing a series of measures, including the release of a Cloud strategy document, the establishment of Cloud standards for all IT services, the development of a Cloud-based IT governance structure, and the integration of cloud-based applications with other DOD systems.

Specifically, the National Firearms ACT and GCA protect a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to acquire a handgun or rifle. The NFA bans possession, transfer, or sale of machine guns, as well as silencers and other types of firearms without proper background checks and license renewals. The GCA regulates possession, transfer, or sale of other types of nonantiquated firearms in addition to the more antiquated kind, including those containing a gun, powder gun, and frame. Background checks are required and renewals are mandatory to ensure firearms are used for lawful purposes. There are also federal requirements, on top of state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with regard to the purchase and usage of hunting firearms with ammunition. The GCA applies and controls both the purchase and usage of firearms across most of the country, including in-state transactions, which is a significant issue for those involved in state and local law enforcement activities. The GCA also regulates ammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export, import, or the sale of certain types of ammunition to foreigners.

In the 1990s, the country's nationalist-leaning governments were not well thought of by Albanians, and tensions periodically escalated between the parties. By the mid-2000s, the government and the parties had reached terms on a broad settlement. From then on, Macedonia's relations with neighboring countries as well as with NATO have been peaceful. This overall stability has not, however, eliminated challenges in the country's politics. The government has been accused of corruption, including allegations by opposition parties of misappropriating EU and Balkan funds. In 2016, the country went to the polls in an election that saw VMRO-DPMNE return as the majority party but with a smaller margin than the previous election. The new parliament had to deal with a serious COVID-19 outbreak. A new constitution was adopted in 2020, with a revised electoral system and a shift that the country's politics would be in a more \"Atlantic\" direction. (The nation's capital is still Skopje, despite the fact that its majority population is ethnic Albanian.) This, in turn, has led to the country's being viewed in Europe primarily as an ally in the war on ISIS, which could potentially affect perceptions of its alliance with NATO in the future. The country also faces several challenges, including an economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a high unemployment rate, and a small population that is projected to age disproportionately. The country is at a crossroads. While the 2020 constitution could potentially lead to a shift away from the Balkan, the EU also considers NATO a priority for the country. The country continues to attract visitors drawn in by its history and cultural heritage. Macedonia will be a key player in the region's larger conflicts and issues such as Balkan integration, climate change, and migration. (Goran G. Dikicenko) (see map on facing page) (see photo insert).

These principles include the exclusion of certain types of things and people from patentable subject matter. The report concludes by reviewing the major proposed changes to Section 101 under different legislative reform efforts. These included: (1) a bifurcation in patentable subject matter between statutory patent exclusions and all other statutory exceptions, (2) a change in who could sue patent applicants, defendants or plaintiffs or one of them, and/or (3) changes in the standard of judicial review of patentable subject matter decisions. The report also evaluates the legal effects of these legislative reforms, including the potential impact on U.S. businesses and inventors. The report closes with a suggestion that practitioners and researchers might want to consider the implications for their field, and concludes that there are several different paths to reform that would depend on the individual's level of experience, the type of lawyer or scientist that they are, or their particular research or practice. In one instance, researchers at their universities are routinely asked by their school's patent counsel to defend the scope of patents, particularly in light of the current uncertainty in patentable subject matter law. This report describes the basic principles of patentable subject matter and provides an overview of how the U.S. government has defined patentable subject matter under Sections 101 and 102, including Section 101. There are over ninety percent of patentable subject matter that are not covered by the basic tests set forth in Section 101. In a series of Supreme Court decisions in the past four decades, Section 101 limits patentable subject matter to three categories: law of nature, natural or physical phenomenon, or abstract ideas. While the test has not changed since the 1800's, the legal framework in this area has been subject to significant legal changes in recent years. In 2018, the PTO issued two separate guidance documents with a view that a patentable subject matter determination in a different judicial proceeding can apply here if the litigation has not challenged patent eligibility. This view, however, has been criticized for being too broad and for being an inaccurate reflection in real litigation of patentability determinations. Section 101 has not been interpreted by the courts by reference to non-statutory criteria. The \"subject matter\" of patents and non-statutory criteria of patentable subject matter are each still considered in legal practice. In a recent study of over 500 patents that had been litigated and upheld before the U.S. Supreme Court, a common trait among Supreme Court patent opinions is the breadth of criteria used in patentable subject matter analysis as opposed to the narrower analysis of those in the Court of Federal Claims. While many of the cases in this study dealt with questions of subject matter analysis that also overlapped litigation in patent law, they revealed that over 90 percent of patentable subject matter was not reviewed by the courts; and these results support the analysis by suggesting the current test of patentable subject matter is excessively broad. Many legal scholars have concluded from this empirical research that a majority of patent litigation resolves without the determination of patentable subject matter. It is rare to find any meaningful patentable subject matter test. With a view that a patentable subject matter test in patent law need a more rigorous and broader application of the principles and test found in patent law to properly adjudicate most patent and antitrust litigation, stakeholders in the industry appear to see the current system of patentability as too harsh. The law of patentable subject matter has been a subject of judicial and congressional reform in the past decades, and the outcome of pending judicial cases and Congressional legislation will be important developments to affect patent litigation. The Supreme Court is set to decide the case of Alice Corp. v. Quill Corp., pending before it at the end of this Report, likely to result in a clear ruling affecting patents under Alice/Mayo. In the meantime, however, it seems likely there will be no further clarity about the interpretation of Section 101 and patentable subject matter for many practitioners. The law governing the patentable subject matter of pharmaceuticals is of particular interest in patent law. In 1957, the Supreme Court first held that Section 28 of the U.S. Food and Drug Modernization Act (\"FD&MA\") was intended to grant immunity for non-approved drugs. The FD&MA immunity provisions do not include any limits on patentable subject matter. In 2004, the Supreme Court held that claims involving drugs in the U.S. Constitution and/or federal law must be given patentable subject matter. Currently, however, there is no law governing patentable subject matter for drugs and no limits to the patentable subject matter. Currently, there is a lack of clarity regarding a physician's legal duties with respect to prescribing drugs, a practice commonly referred to as \"off-label\" prescribing. This report explores the legal parameters", "This report summarizes the key points of an Arms Export Control Act of 1961 (AECA) report which looks at procedures for arms sales.

The program has faced challenges related to identification and selection of appropriate individuals and institutions by which to spend the available matching funds, and challenges of administering TEACH Grants relating to payment of grants and loan conversions of former students by eligible educational institutions. Several legislative actions have been offered, including bills introduced by both the Senate and House in the 109th and 110th Congresses. In addition to the 2008 College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, many of the other measures authorized the extension of TEACH Grants through 2009 or included TEACH Grant supplements in existing appropriations or authorization bills. During the TEACH Grant program authorization lapse that occurred between the 109 th and 110 th Congresses, an individual has been eligible for a TEACH Grant up to 4 years, with 2 years of active service, if a student qualifies a minimum of 3 years of college. The maximum individual grant amount has been $4,000 for individuals in their final year of undergraduate or graduate studies, with that amount decreasing by $1,000 each year. For all students, the maximum of $4,000 per year, with each year increasing. Since 1993, most of the existing TEACH grants have been converted to Direct Subsidized Loans. When an individual's grant is changed to a Direct Subsidized Loan (\"DSL\"), an amount equal to the grant program size for a year plus the 6.28 percent interest can be loaned to supplement annual contributions to the undergraduate or graduate education, including in-state tuition or fees. In 2008, the Congressional Education Committee has continued to hold hearings on the TEACH Grant program, with the 109th Congress requesting annual updates to how many individuals entered the profession with TEACH Grants. The current congressional legislation (H.R. 1091 ) expands the eligibility of students in their senior years of undergraduate or graduate studies, which was not previously available. In light of the continued decline in teachers into the profession, some of the legislation introduced from 2006-05 have included the TEACH Grant program as part of more education and teacher reimbursement legislation. In addition the TEACH Grant program was continued through 2009 for the existing students who are eligible to apply. A concern exists regarding the impact that TEACH Grant funds may cause universities and institutions to drop the program in favor of more traditional educational subsidies instead of the TEACH Grant program. The issue may arise with a high-achieving individual from an educational institution who, in all likelihood, is an early candidate for TEACH Grants. With a larger percentage of students attending universities and with the cost structure of most institutions and educational institutions being driven by tuition and fees, the idea that universities would be willing to allocate part of their revenues by funding the program creates a potential problem with its continued funding. Several bills (H.R. 1127, S. 1127, S. 1371, and H.R. 1585 ) in the 110th Congress addressed this issue directly, authorizing the extension of TEACH Grants through the years. This issue raises questions regarding whether the cost of administering the TEACH Grant program may become prohibitive, forcing some colleges to drop the program during these very competitive 2019-2020 recruiting seasons. One issue related to TEACH Grant administration is that the Office of Educational Research and Analysis (OERA), which administers the grant program, has found significant problems with errors made by both the applicants and institutions submitting documentation in relation to the program. The review and audit of applications and documentation has resulted in an increase in the time it takes to prepare an application, which is causing delays in funding approval. The problem has not been a small one to address due to the growing number of applicants from a variety of fields including engineering, health, and education. After OERA identified and resolved some of the problems they found the number of errors has been reduced. In the meantime there has not been an increase in the amount of money available for TEACH Grants, and in the last three years the number of applicants has been more than previously reported in the reports. This may be indicative of the fact that potential applicants in the 21st century are increasingly likely to attend colleges and universities where they do not have as many resources with them. Since the program requires a minimum enrollment of 3 years of college, the number of TEACH Grant applicants with undergraduate degrees have been steadily rising. An increase in application numbers in recent years suggests the popularity of the program has been increasing. Although there appears to be no sign of a decline in participation related to the TEACH Grant, the number of grant recipients of 45 percent of the grant awards in the 2002-10 school years has resulted in an overall drop in the grant amount. The amount of grants and loans disbursed by the federal", "A large number of U.S. farmers have received pandemic relief funds from USDA. The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) authorizes funding. USDA intends to make up to $7.3 billion in CFAP to help farmers and ranchers whose revenue has been lost or reduced. These amounts can be modified if need arises.\nIntroduction\nOn March 5, the U.S. Congress and President Trump agreed on coronavirus stimulus aid for individuals and communities affected by the pandemic. This report focuses on the COVID-19 emergency relief package enacted by Congress as a result of this agreement. A number of USDA programs are contained in the package, all with one goal: helping farmers, ranchers, and others obtain resources when needed. This goal was achieved on April 27 when President Trump signed the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) into law. USDA's current emergency response also includes a program that is similar to CFAP\u00e2\u20ac\u201d$3 billion for Pandemic Agricultural Disaster Assistance (PAD-PA) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which has not yet been enacted, despite having been part of several Senate Republican COVID-19 appropriations bills passed on March 22. That funding has been designated as having the purpose of providing direct funding to farmers that meet certain eligibility criteria, which is generally limited to farmers and ranchers, as defined by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) in Farm Security Act programs. USDA is still working on finalizing CFAP, including the timeline for distributing initial payments, so that USDA can deliver funds under the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, the Coronavirus-Induced Food Loss and Market Access Program for farmers, ranchers and other farmers, and other programs that USDA has identified as being affected by COVID-19. This analysis will focus on USDA's economic relief actions in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. For purposes of this report, we have grouped USDA actions into four categories: 1) CFAP, 2) PAD-PA, 3) USDA's Economic Assistance Resources to Farmers Affected by COVID-19, 4) USDA Direct Payments. The USDA Economic Assistance Resources to Farmers Affected By COVID-19 program also includes a direct payment program made to farmers and ranchers. The purpose of the direct payments program was to provide a payment to each farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0s share in the direct payment as a portion of the payment. The payments are made through Electronic Funds Transfer, Direct Deposit payments \u00e2\u0088\u00b0 as an option\u00e2\u00a2, and through the direct direct payment program; farmers have up to nine months to accept direct payment payments.", "In the, energy-intensive events are performed in energy production, distribution, and storage and management on a grid system.

This report identifies selected provisions in the CARES Act that may facilitate Congress's ability to provide oversight of its implementation. Each CARES Act category is discussed in greater detail below. Section 4020 of the CARES Act created a Congressional Oversight Commission. These oversight provisions are summarized below. A number of provisions within the CARES Act are generally related to other statutes. For example, one such provision requires that any COVID-19 loans or grants made by the Federal Government have a 3% fixed fee for administrative purposes. Another provision is an emergency response bill (H.R. 6201) that the CARES Act amends. This bill authorized the Federal Government to establish a COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support the costs and activities related to medical, psychological, and other emergency treatment, or treatment necessary in connection with a possible, or known or that could be required to relieve, assist, or alleviate a substantial portion of the economic effects that may be caused, directly or indirectly as a result of the pandemic, without regard to the date that any medical, psychological, or other treatment is authorized, provided, or rendered under the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency Response Fund by the Executive Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Section 4020 of the CARES Act established a congressional oversight commission. The congressional oversight commission is empowered to conduct oversight of any entity or program established to implement the CARES Act. It should also be noted that other portions of the CARES Act may trigger reporting requirements of other statutes, to include the Coronavirus Relief, Aid, Economic Security, and Unemployment Compensation Act of 2020. Among the requirements the CARES Act put on the Federal executive branch is to develop a report summarizing the aggregate amount and number of relief grants or loans to business entities (including non-profits) and individuals. The data is collected in connection with the implementation of the CARES Act and all data related to CARES Act entities and sub-entities will be reported in connection with the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Bill H.R. 6201 that was signed by President Trump in March 2020. Any information provided to GAO may be used in the development of additional reports and evaluations to improve service delivery, provide additional information to GAO, and enhance congressional oversight. The information that is provided to GAO may also be used to improve the quality and completeness of information in reports for Members of Congress prepared before GAO's investigation and to report findings to Congress. Section 4020 of the CARES Act, among other things, enabled three committees: the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations to receive reports by December 31, 2020. The reports were to summarize information related to the creation and use of grants or loans, the allocation of resources, and loans or loan amounts with their terms and conditions in the event payments are made. The committee reports can be used in Congress's ability to oversight the implementation of the CARES Act and also for congressional reporting to be held annually. As a congressional oversight provider, GAO also provides assistance and analysis to congressional offices, committees, Members of Congress, and their non-federal counterparts. Under the FOIA, agencies are required to provide information to a requesting party in a timely manner. GAO is also responsible, in part, to enforce and report in accordance with FOIA the right of users and participants in a particular program to obtain information, data, documents or other records that are or were classified during the time they were in the possession or control of that program. The number of reports, investigations, and special report requests we produce on a range of topics, often focusing directly on individuals and entities and their specific CARES Act related activities, is far greater than the number of reports we actually make that are released to the public. We are able to produce reports that include more detailed and specific information when requested by the clients requesting those reports. The report includes information related to these individuals and entities, such as their names, locations, type of entity, the loans, grants, loans, grants, or their other activities, and the details and characteristics of those programs. While it is our responsibility to provide timely and accurate services to our clients, GAO also acknowledges its need to provide information on a more timely basis to a large number of parties. In some instances, the amount of time between when we receive a request and when we actually complete the report is not as short as we would like it to be for the convenience of the public. In many cases, responding with a complete report is possible within a relatively short amount of time once a request is properly received. This is particularly true for the information and data we provide through special requests. Information and data from those reports can be released by us more rapidly than when reports are prepared under", "Worked example of WEP offset from Social Security and spousal benefits based on 1. a full 30-year covered employment for Social Security benefits, 2. a minimum age (for noncovered employment) of 62 years of age, 3. a 10-year residence or age- 5 years; and 0 years, and only spouses of disabled and-or retiree workers, which can be paid at a rate of up to $4000 per year, depending on the retiree's income. 1.

Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program has (as of FY2020) administered $1.2 trillion in federal student loans to 34.5 million individuals. Since its inception in 1994, one-half of the interest on Direct Loans (federal) has been allocated to the federal government by the Federal government. ED collects loan interest payments on $3 billion in outstanding loans (as of FY2020). These payments were due in March 2020. The federal government began disbursing monthly payments on loans that were due in the year 2022 or 2032, depending on the loan type, for the academic year that begins October 2021. Interest Rates and Fees: Loan interest is generally a variable rate, or one that is expected to change from year to year. The interest rate will be based upon a set of rates established each year by the Secretary of Education. The payment schedule that a borrower must begin to repay depends on the type of loan. For most loans under this program, federal payments are made by direct deduction from the borrower's income each month. The maximum loan repayment period of 25 years is used for all Direct Loans but for borrowers whose loan balances were $30,000 or less in 2020, the maximum repayment period is 10 years (1/12 of the loan amount). Beginning July 2021, a borrower who starts a payment on their $10,000 outstanding loan amount due within 10 of months before that payment date will begin to pay only half of the monthly payment. The remaining portion of the month payment will be made in the following 120-day period starting after the 10-month payment date in accordance with a standard monthly payment schedule that has been established. For a borrower whose Direct Loan amount was more than an aggregate of $10,000 in that year, but less than $30,000 ($750,000 yearly maximum), if a borrower's monthly payment amount is lower than $500, that payment amount will be based on 90% of the monthly payment due in 2021. For a borrower whose Direct Loan amount was between $30,000 and $750,000 in 2021, the payment amount to be made each monthly payment will be $500, or less than that if interest is less than 3.8%, which is lower than 150% of the federal rate. For a borrower whose Direct Loan amount was greater than or equal to $750,000 in 2021, the payment amount for each monthly payment will be $450, or less that if interest is less than 4.8%, which is higher than 150% of the federal rate. Beginning July 2021, the maximum repayment period of for new loans made to students whose Direct Loan amount is $5,000 or less each year is 12 years. However, for a borrower whose Direct Loan amount was greater than an aggregate of $10,000 in that year but less than $30,000, if a borrower's monthly payment amount is lower than $500, the repayment period for the remaining portion of the loan in 2021 will be a minimum of 120 months or under the 120 months it was set out for, or what is less than the 45-year payment period, whichever the borrower chooses. For a borrower whose Direct Loan amount in the year and within the last 120 months was up to $750,000, the repayment length will be a minimum of 15 years or under the full 35-year repayment period, whichever the borrower chooses. For a borrower whose Direct Loan amount is more than a $750,000 per year, the repayment duration and payment amount in 2021 would depend on the loan's size or amount, the borrower's income, and other factors, which will be established on an individual basis based on the borrower's monthly payment amount. If the borrower's monthly payment has no interest component, then a minimum payment will be $500 per month (150% of their interest payment) but less than the repayment period length that the borrower has selected. If the borrower's interest payment is $1,200 per month (12.75 times of the monthly payment), the lender will take up to 24 months to repay the interest and the remaining 25 years of the loan payment. (1) Beginning with the October cohort of students who received their Direct Loan from October 1, 2021 and each month thereafter, the amount of all student borrower payments due each month will be the full principal and accrued interest due on each of their Direct Loans to the date which payment is made each month and deducted from the borrower payment.

The poverty rate fell to 11.8% in 2018 from 12.3% in 2017, both lower than the Great Recessionary period of 2009-2010. Although poverty is often thought of as affecting those at the low-income end of the spectrum, over the past decade the share of people in poverty has been flat for those below the poverty line. In contrast, the share of people in poverty has risen among those that are above the poverty threshold (although still lower than its historic peak in 1965). Overall, income from work (or the lack thereof) is central to the economic fortunes not only for those considered \"working-age\" adults (aged 65 and older), but also to children (aged 6 to 14). The report shows that income from work is generally lower among those in poverty compared to individuals in the working-age population that are not in poverty. This pattern is particularly noteworthy after the passage of the Tax Cuts Opportunity Act of 2017 lowering the standard deduction from $10,000 to $7,500, resulting in a loss of about $8.6 billion in 2017 with just over a million taxpayers responding annually. This legislation reduced the size of the earnings bracket between $3,000 and $10,000 for the working-age population by the amount of $2,400. This reduced overall earnings in working-age households, which did have an effect on poverty in 2017. A large population group such as non-Hispanic whites might have relatively low poverty rates, but because of the group's size in the overall population it represented a relatively large share of the poverty population. In contrast, a small population, such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, might have relatively high poverty rates, but because of the group's size it represented a relatively small share of the poverty population. Both perspectives on poverty are valid and relevant to public policy.

DHS has authority to detain aliens who lack certain documentation, including asylum applicants and UACs. In light of high Northern triangle migration and growing foreign national demand for detention and removal services, federal agencies tasked to process the alien's eligibility for benefits may have inadequate infrastructure that is overwhelmed. DHS must increase its detention and removal capacity to process the volume of human migration from the region, particularly in Central America, and develop a more appropriate detention policy. DHS will need to find adequate detention, compliance, and adjudictive infrastructure to ensure that asylum and UAC cases are processed appropriately and efficiently.\nWith the growing number of asylum seekers from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the US government is increasingly facing a backlog of migrants that lacks proper documentation. They need to improve their detention and removal capacity to ensure that cases proceed smoothly, as well as develop a policy for processing asylum and unaccompanied alien children.", "On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national emergency to address the pandemic of COVID-19, effective 12:01 am Eastern Standard Time (US ET) March 13, 2020. Staff then searched public sources for guidance on the declaration and the federal aid process in response to COVID-19. Staff considered how to assist states in determining the types of federal aid authorized by federal law. The first 6 days of the public emergency declaration were within a narrow window and FEMA declared a Disaster Declaration on 3/23/20. The emergency declaration is applicable to all U.S. states, territories, and all federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native Entitlements. Staff explored all other aspects of emergency declarations and provided guidance on them. The information in this report has been validated through conversations with FEMA. This report is intended for use with state, territory, and tribal governments in the planning of emergency federal assistance. The report is intended for non-federal entities including school districts, cities, towns, and localities. To assist with the emergency efforts, FEMA set up special information lines \u00e2\u00a7-1 800-621-3366; -1.800.621.8423 (FEMA); -1.800.621.5323 (FEMA Disaster Recovery Center); and 1.800.462.9020 (FEMA 24/7 toll-free customer service number). It is also recommended that individual governments contact a FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) listed below for assistance in the emergency response efforts pertaining to COVID-19. The following lists the contact people for FEMA. If an individual needs further assistance than what the government FCO can provide, they should contact FEMA.

on the issue. With the recent departure of Theresa May from the Conservative Party as leader and Boris Johnson replacing her as PM, Brexit has been a topic of discussion that could continue beyond the upcoming election. Members of the House who championed the Good Friday Agreement would likely oppose any trade agreement between the U.S. and UK that jeopardizes it. A potential FTA could potentially address the issues around cross-border trade and travel rights, but its final form and impact on Northern Ireland would likely be a major point of contention with the Speaker's resolution. In December 2019, the House passed resolution H.RS. 585 expressing the need for a trade agreement between the U.S. and UK, while reaffirming support for the Irish peace agreement.\u00c2\u00c2 On December 3, 2019, members of the House Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy and the Environment held an\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2 hearing titled\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2 \"Protecting the Good Friday Agreement from Brexit.\"\u00c2\u00c2 In light of\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2 \u00c2\u00a3\u00c2\u00c2 \u00c2\u00a3\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2, which are the main currency rates in the trading relationship between\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2 the UK and the EU.

Since the Hate Crime Statistics Act was enacted in 1989, BJS reports data on the number of individuals targeted for the offenses of hate crimes, their victimization rates and the motivations behind these crimes. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Hate Crime Statistics Program collects supplemental data regarding hate crimes from law enforcement agencies. Data has been collected by UCR, NCVS, BJS, and various law enforcement agencies since the 1980s. Data on 9,000+ (approximately) hate crimes was collected in 2018. Most law enforcement agencies participated in the HCSP. BJS reports the victimization rates of hate crimes among the various victim groups, victim offenses, law enforcement agencies, and geographic areas. NCVS is a federally funded research program that collects and reports criminal victimization statistics from law enforcement agencies across the country. Data on victimized individuals and law enforcement agencies are reported to the FBI. Victims of a hate crime can be an individual, a business, or society as a whole, and statistics on victims of crime across all 50 states and the District of Columbia are collected. These data are collected voluntarily by law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis, and are reported each year to the FBI. The FBI's National Instant Background Check Service (NIBRS) allows law enforcement agencies to report the background checks on individuals through NIBRS. NIBRS data indicates the FBI can collect data from federal law enforcement agencies for individuals that cannot be found in other records. NIBRS data varies for each individual as to type of offense, offense elements, victim characteristics, victim offense characteristics, and the offender who perpetrated the crime. The data on the 21 most common offenses listed in the HCSA report reflect data from a total of 5,000 FBI law enforcement agencies. The FBI collects various statistics on hate crimes, which have been reported and compiled since the 1970s. These statistics are compiled and reported annually and are used nationwide. Some data is gathered from victim-offending jurisdictions, law enforcement agencies, and victim-offending jurisdictions. Data covers victim characteristics, offender, victim, and offender characteristics, and most data fields reflect offenses that occur at a national level. FBI data on victim of a \"hate crime\" (excluding data on crimes of anarchy, 3,000 offenses) can be considered by law enforcement agencies, public health and community-based organizations, and advocates for justice reform. PRS surveys of county law enforcement agencies reveal that racial bias remains a problem in the United States. Although the 2010 BJS survey found victim victimized in less than 13% of the 100 cities sampled, a majority of these crimes are characterized as \"solved.\" In general, there is an annual decrease in victims of the offences of rape, robbery, assault, vandalism, and homicide. Hate law enforcement, enforcement of civil rights laws, and victim assistance organizations are all used by victim-focused organizations and advocates. The victim of a \"hate crime\" can range from 8 to 60 years old. The FBI's National Instant Background Check System (NIBRS) provides data to state and local law enforcement agencies and other authorized partners. More than 250 types of criminal history/criminal background areas are available for check, including criminal history and criminal justice information, juvenile delinquency, sexual offences, theft, drugs, and driving violations. The NIBRS data set allows users to filter data by offence type, offence element, offence offence and offender characteristics (age, birth place, gender, etc.). The NCVS collects and reports criminal victimization statistics from law enforcement agencies across the country. Some data fields reflect the victimization rates of victim and victim offenders, victim offender locations and victim offender age range. The victim that a hate crime is committed against is the victim of the criminal offence; victim of assault/abduction, victim of theft, victim of robbery is the victim of the criminal offence. This information is collected each year from law enforcement agencies across the country. Crime laboratories are used to process and analyze data on hate crime, crime involving juveniles, and certain crimes of the elderly. Other forensic laboratories and medical facilities are used to analyze information on sexual offences and offences involving the misuse of drugs. In 2016, the FBI reported on 8,216 hate crimes, resulting in 9.3 percent of the offences in the United States.\nAccording to hate crime statistics for 2019, the most common offenders of hate crimes include whites (40%), non-Hispanic whites (40%), and Latinos/Hispanics (19%). The most common offenses include crimes of aggression (39%) offences involving offenders (37%) and offences involving property (34%) offences involving drugs (26%). These statistics were derived", "Private health insurance coverage of COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention continues to be a topic of discussion of private health insurers and policymakers. Most private health insurers do not provide coverage of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, despite ongoing public and congressional interest in the topic. Private health insurers require COVID-19 testing and coverage of related treatment, and in many cases, insurers\u2019 payment for diagnostic or treatment costs is a covered benefits of their policies. Both private health insurers and insurers participating in state-based exchanges (exchanges) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are subject to the ACA\u2019s ban on cost sharing for covered medical procedures and services for individuals in the coverage group. Private health insurers may contract with state health insurers, exchanges, and public health authorities for reimbursement for the costs of COVID-19 testing or treatment. Employers and individuals acting as small companies may purchase health insurance plans provided by insurance companies. Employers and individuals in the group insurance (self-insured group) market have access to insurance through workgroup trusts, and this type of plan may be purchased either through employers or by individuals (). Employers may self-insure COVID-19, but there are some limitations on which expenses they must bear (). The ACA's Prevention and Treatment Guidelines for Preventing Exposure to Community Use of COVID-19 Transmission (see resources) has recommended COVID-19 testing and treatment for employers. Private health insurers offering insurance to group of employees, also are legally obligated to cover certain services, which vary in scope depending on the provider. The public private partnership model among private health insurers, insurers, and state health authorities to provide COVID-19 medical support can be a model for more comprehensive medical care at minimal costs. While the costs associated with COVID-19 can be covered, some private health insurers may still be able to recoup these costs from state financial systems (e.g., Medicaid). Coverage of COVID-19 treatment is not uniformly available to all private health insurers (). Generally, non-public health insurance plans (such as employee, retiree, and trade union plans) are not legally permitted to offer COVID-19 benefits (). The ACA has mandated that insurance plans include coverage of COVID-19 treatment and have designated treatment categories for COVID-19. Private-sector plans are required to provide the same benefits under \u201cpublic programs\u201d (or \u201cpublic programs,\u201d which include self-funded or individual-based insurance arrangements) as are made available to employees enrolled in employer-sponsored plans unless prohibited by a state law. The ACA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services consider employees of nonpublic entities, such as school bus drivers, janitors, and food service employees, \u201cnot to be eligible for [group] health insurance (). (The ACA exempts some employees of public-sector employers from this requirement.) The American Medical Association does not condone nonpublic health insurances or insurance coverage of COVID-19 or COVID-19 treatment in general. Employers and employees may contract with each other outside the context of health plans to purchase one another\u2019s coverage (). The ACA requires that employers and individual insurers provide coverage for COVID-19 treatment and have specific reimbursement procedures. The COVID-19 bill that Congress passed may not specifically require that specific costs should be covered, and may impose costs on private health plans for certain services they must provide. Costs may also exceed the costs available to public or private health insurance benefits because of differences in costs for medical care. The COVID-19 Pandemic Premium Tax Credit provides an immediate refundable credit to individuals paying premiums on individual or family-sponsored private health insurance plans for health care costs.

Since 2014, most states have decided to expand Medicaid coverage directly to adults. According to a recent report of all 2020 FMAP rates, states typically charge 100% of Medicaid expenditures while they incur the federal FMAP, which reaches approximately 50% of 2018 State of the Nation (SON) direct costs. States' FMAP rates fluctuate from year to year. Of the many states experiencing annual FMAP rate changes, all but North and South Dakota changed by less than one percent. The FMAP is used to reimburse states for the federal share of most Medicaid expenditures, but exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, and services. The FMAP can also be used to determine the federal share of other federal programs. For example, it is used to determine the federal share of spending for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments authorized by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. In addition, the FMAP has been used to define how states can allocate funding to long-term services and supports for elderly, low income, and disabled individuals to help them stay in their preferred residence throughout the long-term.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion requires most states to contribute to the per capita personal income of the state's Medicaid expenditures (FMAP). Several times during the past two decades, this ratio increased and then decreased within a relatively short period. In the prior two economic recessions, beginning in the 2001 recession (FMAP began at 50%) and the 2007-8 recession (FMAP began at 100-130% depending on location), the FMAP rates increased significantly even though it was no longer used for Medicaid expansion. States generally face substantial financial commitments for Medicaid expansion. However, states have to decide whether they want their populations to experience growth rate at the per capita wage level or a lower one (minimum wage) in exchange for receiving 100% of the federally approved states' costs. In the FMAP context, even though the federal portion is 100%, the states must absorb roughly 70% of the states' per capita costs. This increase can range from 50-100%. There is a significant difference in states' per capita income (which varies by 30%-40%) from state to state. The states with the highest incomes generally charge the higher FMAP, and the states with the lower incomes typically incur significantly less. Some 15 states also expand Medicaid for adults (not elderly) because they provide Medicaid coverage to more than 133% of their state residents. In addition, some 20 states are transitioning from Medicaid expansion as it is no longer available for adults due to the ACA provision, which caps the expansion at 12.5 states per centum per year (the same amount available to expansion states). Medicaid was enacted in 1935 through the Social Security Act; its current version, the Medicaid waiver programs, includes Medicaid coverage of nursing care and treatment of certain disabilities. In general, eligibility for Medicaid is not based on individual income but rather on income of a family size (i.e., up to 8). Because of the pandemic and financial fallout of the recession in late 2020, many states are expanding Medicaid access to adults at 133% of poverty per capita per year until May2021. Some states have expanded Medicaid coverage to adults with lower incomes from 133% of poverty per capita, per year from January 1, 2020 to April 28, 2021. The ACA provision, FMAP, which caps the expansion to 12.5 states per centum per year, is no longer available in this expansion. States can no longer expand Medicaid access for adults into the expansion pool. Medicaid coverage of nursing care and treatment of certain disabilities remain in the Medicaid waiver programs. Other long-term trends in Medicaid expansion were discussed throughout all of the current ACA Medicaid expansion related to ACA provisions, such as coverage of children in certain income groups, children in Medicaid expansions being eligible, and an increased number of adults in Medicaid as a result of COVID. There may be other changes in Medicaid eligibility for individuals and families that could change as well. The FMAP rate is used for Medicaid expansion for adults up to 133% of poverty. Medicaid expansion is no longer available in this expansion for certain individuals of different ages. The ACA Medicaid expansion in select states also requires state-owned and -operating hospitals that provide emergency department care to receive Medicaid reimbursement under certain circumstances (in addition to Medicaid reimbursement of adult Medicaid applicants). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion in select states requires individuals and families with incomes 133% below the poverty line per capita to receive Medicaid coverage at 133% of", "DOD energy use of $11.9 billion last year was an increase over $10.3 billion in FY2017.

"DNN programs are currently facing increased budgets for FY2021-2029, even with reductions in 2020. Nonproliferation construction and disposal funds are requested for FY2021. The U.S. Surplus Plutonium Disposition Plant Project (SPD) is planned to complete construction in the 2020s. MOX is planned to be built at an undisclosed site in South Carolina and the U.S. plutonium disposal program is expected to continue through 2035 with funding appropriated for the Nonproliferation Construction Subprogram. In FY2027, the Nonproliferation Construction Project's Surplus Plutonium Disposition Plans and Funding to Complete Building the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Plant, and the U.S. Plutonium Disposition Program are expected to be appropriated. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (NTNF R&D) is a new initiative in FY2021. In addition to the M3 Material Disposition subprogram and Nonproliferation Construction Surplus Plutonium Disposition subprogram, the NTNF R&D portion of the budget request requests funding for nuclear forensics research and development. NTNF R&D funding is also requested for FY2018, FY2019 and FY2016 to replace old-style scientific equipment and to modernize laboratories. In addition, DNN's nuclear forensics program has been increased, and $500 million in funding is requested under the FY2021 budget request for this program. $40 million of DNN's Global Material Security (GMS) budget request is being replaced in the FY2021 budget request with funding for the material conversion subprogram. It will also include funding for non-HEU based molybdenum-99 production technology in the United States. Funding for this program is planned for FY2025, FY2027, and FY2016, respectively. Other DNN R&D programs have not had any new funding proposed in the FY2021 budget request. The budget request maintains the nuclear counterterrorism and incident response (NTIR) program at its current appropriation level. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project has been cut from its FY20 appropriations. Funding has been included in the FY2019 DOE/NNSA National Defense Program Act request to allow for the construction phase of the U.S. plutonium Disposition plan. In FY2016, MOX program R&D funding is also recommended. In FY2015, MOX program R&D is appropriated at $90 million. In FY20, MOX program R&D continues to be included with a $150 million appropriation. MOX program funding is also requested in FY2021, FY2022, and FY2024. DNN's Nonproliferation Construction Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) program is included in the FY2025 budget request as a new account element. The same can be expected to continue for FY2016 and beyond, with funding proposed annually in even-year budgets. The Nonproliferation Construction Project (MFFP) is appropriated in FY2016 and subsequent years to reduce risk associated with plutonium stockpile decertification. It also includes funds to build the plutonium plant, construction of a 5.9-megawatt peaking solar plant near the NDA base, and costs associated with a decontamination system for equipment used in the plutonium plant construction. Nuclear Security Equipment Fund (NSEF) FY2021 budget request is used for funding the cost of NSEF-A funding. The NSEF also contains costs funding the cost of NSEF-B funding. Both funding categories are being modified to a fixed- cost block system. $1.5 million has been proposed in FY2018 and yearly through FY2029 for the NSEF-A funding category. There is no new money for the NSEF-B annual funding category for FY2016 and onward. DNN programs have seen consistent appropriations in FY2009-2015. Funding requests continue to go annually in the DNN-authorized subprograms. Since FY2012, funding for the new DNN program for FY2026 and onward, as well as all existing DNN programs, have not been included in the request. The annual DNN-enabled subprograms continue to be included in the defense budget since FY2015. DNN programs have also seen consistent appropriations in FY2009-2015 from all existing programs. There are six new B and A programs introduced in the FY2021 request. In general, these are classified as research and development. The budget request does not propose any funding for most of these B and A programs because the only program requesting funding is the Advanced Photon Technology program.

The estimated cost of the 13 temporary business tax provision extensions in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, enacted as Division Q of the Final Further Consolidated Appropriations Law, 2020, is shown. Business-related tax extenders include business tax credits for health insurance and work-related learning. Other tax extenders affected tax deductions for adjusted gross income without regard to depreciation of tangible assets and for depreciation acceleration.

Several EV types emerged through the 2000s, including PHEVs, BEVs, and BEV plug-ins after DOE EV research, support for EV start-ups, and growing public demand. From 2010 to 2018, EV sales increased from 275,000 to 705,000, contributing around 4.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2018. 100,000 (or about 10%) of American new light-duty vehicles sold in 2019 were powered by renewable electricity and not contributing to greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The share of zero-emission electric vehicles in the overall fleet rose in that time period to 4.2%, or 42,000 vehicles. That was a roughly 20 increase in BEV sales. Many EVs will be powered by domestic wind and solar energy going forward, including 40,000 to 100,000 all-electric passenger vehicles, which will account for roughly 1 in 100 U.S. new light-duty vehicle sales with 8,000 sales in 2020, according to EV advocacy groups. BEVs and HEV (all electric) vehicles have been exempt from various fuel taxes and fees as well as from motor vehicle registration fees. As of 2020, there is no U.S. federal or state-imposed sales or purchase fees on either category of BEV/PHEV, and there is no sales tax. As of May 2020, California\u2019s sales tax (2.25% of the sale value for BEVs) and Hawaii\u2019s sales tax (2.25% of the value of the electricity purchased for the first five years in their service) are lower than the U.S. average (0.9%) while New York and Rhode Island also offer sales and property tax exemptions. EV and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) sales continue to grow as the number of PHEVs sold in the U.S. from July 2018 to September 30, 2016 has grown from a monthly average 8% to 10%. EV sales rose 43.43% from 199,000 to 300,000 in 2001, and from 2010 to 2018 rose 5%, or 23,000 cars. EV/PHEV sales had more than 250,000 in February of 2107 alone, and 300,000 by December 30, 2016, according to EV advocacy groups. Sales continued to rise 14% from July 2016 to December 30, 2016, up to 8,900 EVs sold by Tesla and 9,500 for Nissan Leaf. These new sales have been rising steadily for the past two decades that the electric vehicle market is estimated to be growing globally by over 12% a year. A total of 44.6 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2028, according to EV advocacy groups. Most of the recent EV sales growth and expansion came through Germany (6%), UK (3%), China [including Hong Kong\u2019s] (2%) and France (2%). EV sales are growing in Europe due to incentives such as Germany\u2019s renewable energy tax exemption, UK\u2019s tax credits, Belgium\u2019s 10% purchase tax, Netherlands\u2019 0.1% of their electricity sales back into the consumer bill, Spain's elimination of their sales tax, and France\u2019s 50% exemption, as well as Portugal, Ireland (15%), Italy (17%) and Belgium (20%). The Netherlands is the birthplace of all-electric cars and is using the tax incentives to spur its expansion. Sales for electric vehicles in China have surged from 2,000 in 2013 into 300,000 in 2018. China currently has the world\u2019s largest BEV sales, followed by Europe and the USA, according to Statista. In 2019, China sold almost 1.5 times more BEVs than in the year before and will account for approximately 23 in 2020 + 10,000 BEVs sold globally in 2020 due to incentives such as VAT refund for purchasing hybrid and EV vehicles. Although the country accounts for less than a share of 2020 sales, China is the world\u2019s largest BEV producer by volume (almost twice as many BEV/PHEVs in the U.S.). China\u2019s sales for EV/PHEVs (excluding BEVs) increased by a little over 1 percent in Q3 2018 from Q2 2018, according to the China Association for Automotive Industries (CAAI).

Most committee work is completed in a standing committee which then submits its report to the House. Each standing committee also has authority to'split' its responsibilities and become a sequential committee. The House has been known to consider sequential committees as a time-consuming mechanism, but a mechanism used almost every time. Committees of primary referral are subject to a deadline for receiving a report; failing which, their report is automatically discharged from further consideration. When a committee of primary referral has exhausted its report or its deadline, a sequential committee may consider itself discharged from further consideration and the House can continue its work. Committees may be created on a standing basis or by House Rule XII for each chamber, the legislative committee, or any standing committee. The members of a standing committee must belong to the House of Representatives or to another chamber. If a Member of the House leaves the chamber or a committee he may be replaced. Members of committees must belong to the immediate chamber so that the Committees may consider legislation passed by the chamber for which they constitute their committee. There are standing committees on certain committees, such as the House Rules Committee. Members of committees are generally considered a \"member in a specific House,\" unless they serve on the majority, majority, or minority side of committee membership, the minority then being members without \"primary\" standing in the committees of the chamber they serve. Members of these committees who are not so defined receive the same pay during session as a majority of minority Members in the House, while the minority Members are usually limited to one paycheck per year. (The first paycheck of each fiscal year is due in November, and Members in the minority then receive that pay.) If in any instance a Member receives payment other than once a fiscal year (unless the payment has been limited to a single year), it will be reported to the Office of the Clerk by December 31. A Member in majority on a committee then receives compensation as follows. The first paycheck of each year is due in November, and Members in the minority then receive that pay. The second paycheck of each congressional year is due in January and the Members in their respective chambers receive those pays. Members of standing committees are paid their per diem allowance once a fiscal year as follows: December 1-31, July 1-September 30, and October 1-31. Members of standing committees serve at the pleasure of the Speaker; however, a Member of any standing committee in a standing committee with primary responsibilities must be confirmed by vote by his chamber. In this case Members are also paid from December 1-31 for the fiscal year. Most Members of committees serving 1-24 years are also paid an extra paycheck between December 1-31. In 2010, there was a $1,500 annual increase in per diem payments to Members of standing committees in addition to any existing compensation. Members serving in minority roles on committees and those Members also acting in a majority role on certain committees may receive the same pay as those Members in majority roles. Committee Members must be paid in addition to their individual Members Pay, as follows: Members of standing committees December 1-31 and July 1-31, October 1-31. Members of standing committees serving in their majority role for those with the potential to receive a minority or payment for 15 months or a total of 2 years (from December 1, 2013) are paid their Members Pay after 1 year. Members of majority or committees for 15 months or a total of 2 years (from December 1, 2013) were paid compensation after 1 year only if there were no proceedings in such Member's committee during such period. Members of a committee serving in minority or specific roles in the Minority Members' Committees after November 1 of the year are also paid that Members Pay, at a minimum of $50 per month. Members in a standing committee are paid Members Pay for the fiscal year beginning on December 1 during the fiscal year. Members of standing committees serving a minority role are paid that Members Pay as often indicated. The Members' Pay is due to the Office of the Clerk of the House for each Member in 8 installments per fiscal year.

To address this issue, President Trump sought a federal initiative in 2016 to provide funding to state programs to support drug abuse treatment and prevention. The Trump administration also began implementing the Prescription Drug Addiction and Recovery Act (PRDA), which authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish a system for testing the safety and efficacy of drugs (including opioids) that are suspected of being prescription drugs and substances for the illegal trade. According to the National Institute of Medial Health, opioid analgesics were used by almost 7 million Americans in 2017, indicating that many people may be taking these medications on prescription, especially those who suffer from chronic medical conditions.

Arrangements as part of an \"endgame\" of sorts to raise Chinese global economic power, while at the same time attempting to ensure China's global reach, security infrastructure, and greater trade connectivity. Several observers contend that China's growing international economic engagement is not dissimilar to that of many U.S. officials. They express concern that China's FDI and construction initiatives pose a threat to U.S. economic and financial security interests, while others contend that China's rising global economic presence can support its military objectives and help China gain an edge in strategic international economic activities. Despite the complexities of economic and geopolitical relationships, U.S. and Chinese officials share a growing understanding of the implications of these developments. At the same time, the future relationship of the two governments, now characterized by China's economic and military power and America's security and diplomatic influence, may be subject to a number of unpredictable variables.

Many online tools and resources for residents will be available this year. A survey, being conducted for the first time in 2020, will gauge the impact of the 2010 census on Hawaii's population and provide comparisons.\nThe 2020 Census of Population and Housing, which took place from January 21 to April 19, 2020, collected data on numerous topics including income, education, housing, and geographic location. In addition to filling out the questionnaire, participants were also asked to share information about their home and respond to follow-up questions in a later mailing. The decennial census aims to capture population count information at the local level in order to redistrict congressional and legislative districts, allocate resources for schools and hospitals, and determine census-based funding for infrastructure, social services, and other public services. Qualitative data from focus groups were used to better understand respondent attitudes about the census and gain insights on the perceived importance and purpose of population counts. Census responses can be submitted online or mailed in, and information on the questionnaire, mail-to address, and the census coding system can be found at the Census Bureau's website.", "The Federal Highway Aid program is the foundation of federal transportation assistance. A federal act of law authorized \"surface transportation\" and highway use on Federal Property at the \"fixing\" level, including new construction of major highway and bridge infrastructure, the building of new minor rural collectors, and routine maintenance. More than 4.2 million miles of public roads in federal ownership received Federal funds, which totaled $220 billion for the 20 years following 2014. Federal highway apportionments are used to fund construction in \"core\" and \"metropolitian\" categories by states, with most highway funds apportioned among the states by statutory formula. Each state's share of Federal Highway Aid represents at least 40 cents for each dollar of Federal funding contributed. There is a large increase in highway conditions, the share of bad pavement in which vehicles must travel, as well as larger, higher-speed lanes. The number of major highways that receive Federal Highway Aid is small, numbering around 20,000, as compared to the number of pavements in the United States. Road conditions are varied; older roadways show evidence of wear and tear, while new construction is mixed. Major issues Congress will consider before reauthorizing the FAST Act include financing future roadway construction, and including bicycle and pedestrian facilities. These may require supplemental or additional Federal funding. The next federal reauthorization of the FAST Act will occur after September 30, 2020. Federal highway funding will probably remain at comparable levels over the next decade due to the expiration of MAP-21, and likely be replaced by a new vehicle user charge or a new gas tax increase. The annual inflation adjustments for highway costs, which are required in the FAST Act, are expected to rise from the current 2% to 3%, and will be critical for state and local governments to remain economically feasible. The next Federal highway reauthorization is slated to occur after September 30, 2020. Funding for the FAST Act may be extended if Congress does not reauthorize. Funding for state infrastructure assistance is expected to remain at $3.1B in FY20 and rise to $2B in FY21. (Table 7) The House Ways and Means Committee reported in August of 2019 to its House counterpart, the MAP-21 Oversight and Transparency in Federal Highway Aid Act, that most of the FAST Act's road funding has been distributed to the states, but nearly all federal highway funding is returned to the states. The FAST Act is set to expire at the conclusion of FY21, and Congress will likely reauthorize this highway aid program annually. The House Ways and Means Committee reported in August of 2019 to its House counterpart, the MAP-21 Infrastructure Stimulus Act, that nearly all of the FAST Act's road funding is distributed to the states, an estimate based on data reported to FHWA in August 2019. At the conclusion of the 20th year of the FAST Act, about 20% of total highway funding ($240B/1,400B) would be apportioned to the states. Of that $240B, about 90% of the funding would be used by the states for road and bridge construction. In addition, the states will see an increase of about $500B in non-federal road projects. All these funds are for construction or reconstruction of existing facilities using non-Federal Highway Trust Fund-contributed funds. This will be vital since most of the annual apportionments distributed to the states are earmarked to replace the costs of highway design and construction. FHWA estimates that each major road constructed in a state requires another $3.7B per year for design and construction by the states. Congress will likely reauthorize the FAST Act prior to the expiration date of September 30, 2020. The MAP-21 Infrastructure Stimulus Act ( H.R. 4851) is a Congressional proposal in the w eeks after October 1 st of FY21, and would include a one-year extension in its provisions. The bill is anticipated to be included in an upcoming appropriations bill or tax cut package. Approximately $500B is being proposed in the bill for highways, bridges, and railroads. The bill will provide an in-term extension on the 20-year Highway Trust Fund program until its reauthorization by Congress, with no reauthorization extensions until the 2022 or 2023 calendar year, or until further enacted procedures are enacted by Congress. The House Ways and Means Committee reported in August of 2019 to its House counterpart, the MAP-21 Infrastructure Stimulus Act ( H.R. 4851 ), which would provide a one-year extension in its provisions for highways, bridges, and railroads.

"USDA 2019 forecasts an approximate $32.7 billion loss in net farm income due to U.S. farmers missing the crucial FPD between June 6 and October 2, when most annual crop plantings occur. Many crops, including corn and soybeans in recent years, were planted later than usual, leading to possible late-planting discounts in insurance coverage. The FFPP indemnity was a major component of the crop industry\u00e2\u00a6s risk management safety net. If coverage declines, the proportion of risk-protected acres increases, as producers have to assume more risk and opt for insurance premiums in the late planting period due to late-season crop production. In a typical year, 12% of the U.S. planted corn acres are harvested in the September through May marketing years. Thus, a late planting of as few as 20 days in September could cause a significant loss to the U.S. corn crop (as much as a decline of over $50 billion in sales revenue). While corn and soybean plantings do not occur as frequently on wet ground, wetness is a typical weather issue this time of year (early-season plantings in Nebraska, the mid-Atlantic coastal plain, and along the eastern Mississippi River), and wet weather can reduce yields under favorable conditions. In addition, heavy precipitation in recent years in eastern China resulted in extreme flooding and damage. In the Midwest and western wheat belt, wet weather has reduced the quality of grain production in recent years, and wet soil, as well as excessive topsoil in some areas, makes for less productive wheat (wheat production is down for more than a year). Overall, wet growing conditions are likely to influence crop production and harvest in 2020. Wet fields are likely to result in a range of yield reductions \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a6 for all annual crops that account for 43%-80% of total U.S. agricultural production \u00e2\u00a2\u00a6 for the winter and spring crops in the southern U.S. \u00e2\u00a6 and for corn and spring wheat in the 13 coastal and wet states \u00e2\u00a2\u00a6 and for all annual crops that account for 50%-80% of annual U.S. agricultural production.

In 2018, 51% of U.S. exports of natural gas were sent to Europe and Asia while 99% of U.S. LNG exports went to Canada. During the Great Recession, a substantial number of U.S. shale gas production facilities slowed down due to lower prices. In 2011, U.S. natural gas production surpassed export volumes, and Cheniere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sabine-Lower Sabine LNG plant in Louisiana became the first U.S. facility to export natural gas in 2012. In 2018, LNG demand from the U.S. and its territories rose by 40%, making 6,900 BCF the first LNG exports from the U.S. Since 1996, LNG exports have been increasing steadily. Currently, U.S. LNG exports have reached 2,200 BCF in 2018. The market for LNG exports could rise by 2024, as LNG will compete with traditional natural gas exports in Europe. In 2018, 99% of U.S. LNG exports went to Canada, although Chile exports LNG from liquefaction plants to Asia since production began in 2010. In 2017, LNG demand from the U.S. and its territories jumped by 30% to 3.5 BCF. LNG demand from the U.S. and its territories increased more than 70% since 2010. In 2016, LNG demand from the world's top three LNG exporter countries, LNG Exporter Countries, U.S. LNG demand increased by 8 BCF. In 2015, LNG demand from countries that use LNG exclusively, LNG Exporter Countries, grew by 13% or more to 2,050 BCF. The United States LNG Exporter Countries have grown 3-fold since 2010. LNG demand in 2014 has nearly doubled in terms of 2015, which is largely due to export demand from China to its LNG-exporting provinces. In 2010, LNG export facilities in LNG Exporter Countries had 6,100 BCF-yearly production capability. LNG Exporter Countries are likely to see a substantial increase in LNG demand as the Exporter Countries have been adding large scale LNG export facilities to their portfolios. LNG demand in 2013 was 4.1 BCF, up 70% since 0.95 BCF in 2000. In Europe, LNG was in the \"fast track\" mode, while Asian LNG had grown by a factor of 7.0 since 2000. In the United States the demand for LNG has jumped by 70% since 2010, and by 30% in 2016. LNG demand is expected to grow 5.1 BCF in 2012 while LNG's current demand has risen to 1,300 BCF. (Source: \nThe term Exporter Country refers to countries that have an export business with oil or gas-based products. LNG Exporter Countries are countries that have a long-term agreement to supply natural gas to LNG Exporter Countries as part of their ongoing business to export oil or gas-based products.

The International Monetary Fund has already granted over $165 billion in financial assistance in a single year, which is unprecedented. The IMF has been actively engaged in responding to the pandemic with actions ranging from policy guidance regarding fiscal stimulus to providing additional financing to countries around the globe. In addition, the IMF has proposed debt relief mechanisms to help low-income countries to allow them to continue providing medical supplies and medicines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal measures such as increasing government spending or taxing are becoming popular tools to combat the pandemic, providing them with a temporary solution to help cope with the economic fallout. The IMF is also working to maintain stability in emerging markets. In addition to providing emergency financial assistance, the IMF has extended a broad range of measures to support emerging markets and ensure a continuity of business operations. While the IMF's lending capacity has been significantly diminished, the organization continues to ensure countries have access to needed liquidity to allow for the safe procurement of medical equipment and materials. In addition, the IMF is increasing access to COVID-19 vaccines for developing and emerging-market countries. To complement the IMF's multilateral cooperation with the private sector, countries around the world have offered debt relief to countries that have received IMF help. As the pandemic has caused an unprecedented decline in global economic output, the IMF continues to provide a variety of tools to help countries cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, including through targeted debt relief mechanisms. Although the International Monetary Fund is best known for helping countries manage financial crises, its lending program for developing countries is also providing significant aid in response to COVID-19. The IMF and MDBs have pledged significant new aid and loan commitments to low-income countries, totaling more than $250 billion in March 2020, in order to alleviate the immediate economic harm caused by the pandemic. (Graphs adapted from the IMF) In April 2020, the World Financial Organization (WFOW) estimated that developing countries will see economic output fall on average by 1.4%, while economic output for developed countries will decline by an average 11%. In addition, the WFP reports there has been an overall decline in income for 20-percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u02dbs population due to economic disruptions. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to trigger capital flight from emerging markets on an unprecedented scale. It noted that emerging countries typically experience capital flight to developed countries following crisis or recession, and that the pandemic may exacerbate this pattern. This will come at a time when developing countries need capital to respond to their COVID-19 response plans. The IMF has provided a variety of tools to help countries during this crisis, including rapid financing for medical supplies, tax relief, and access to emergency lending. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund is working to maintain global economic stability during the pandemic. In response to this pandemic, IMF Executive Director Kristalina Georgieva said the IMF would provide unprecedented financing, pledging up to $1 trillion from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fund Plus to developing countries by the end of 2020. In response to the pandemic, the IMF introduced new policy guidance regarding fiscal stimulus and central banks\u00e2\u00a2 role in providing liquidity to markets, and IMF Executive Board Chair Kristalina Georgieva announced several policy measures to support emerging markets and help countries cope with the pandemic. Additionally, several countries\u00e2\u00a2 central banks\u00e2\u00a2 fiscal authorities\u00e2\u00a2 and other financial institutions\u00e2\u00a2 authorities have implemented fiscal stimulus packages, including tax cuts and deferral of payroll tax payments. The World Economic Forum\u00e2\u00a2s April Global Shocks and Impacts Initiative includes a fact sheet detailing countries\u00e2\ufffds current and prospective fiscal stimulus packages and is a current summary of the \u00e2\u00a2 global economic outlook. A recent discussion paper from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u00e2\u00a2 Finance and Markets division reports that global government and commercial bank liquidity support is helping small and medium-sized enterprises across many countries deal with COVID-19\u00e2\u00a2 related supply chain disruptions. To prevent the economic collapse, a new IMF toolkit is helping several countries \u00e2\u00a2 including China and Indonesia \u00e2\u00a2 find emergency measures to protect their industries, small businesses, and \u00e2\u00a2 households from the health impacts of the pandemic. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors recently issued a\u00e2\u00a2 statement about the importance of \u00e2\u00a2 insurance authorities\u00e2\u00a2 efforts to support their supervisory structures during the current crisis.\u00e2\u00a2 The IMF is a major provider of liquidity support to developing countries. For example, a recent IMF report states that central banks and commercial banks in emerging markets continue to\u00e2\u00a2 be \u00e2\u00a2 an important source of financing for their economies. Countries\u00e2\u00a2 central banks and commercial banks continue to provide liquidity to emerging markets facing the COVID-19\u00e2\u00a2 pandemic.

These sources have weather-dependent availability and currently constitute a small part of the energy mix. \u00e2\u00a2 The bulk power system, consisting of power plants, transmission lines, and distribution networks, is the source of about 70 percent of U.S. electricity.

In response to these subpoenas, the executive branch implemented policies to increase cooperation with Congress on a range of topics. Congress and the executive branch have a complicated relationship. Congressional committees have broad powers to investigate, examine, and regulate the executive branch, and that power often necessitates a number of interactions between the two. While some aspects of this relationship remain unchanged, technology such as the introduction of televised hearings has increased the speed at which congressional requests are conducted. The executive branch and congressional staff are well-practiced in their respective roles in this process, but misunderstandings or differences in understanding can lead to tensions. In a case involving subpoenas to executive branch officials on a range of topics, congressional oversight has increased exponentially. In response, the George W. Bush administration established a number of new limits on the use of executive privilege--this administration's preferred term for \"spoofing\"--to include the development and implementation of specific guidelines on electronic communications. A decade later, with a change in administration and its own set of concerns, Congress continues to find ways to ensure compliance with subpoenas, but the process remains difficult and unpredictable. While congressional committees often focus on issues within the executive branch from the bottom up, there is an overarching concern with how high the level of accountability goes--from \"the Executive Branch\" all the way to \"the Legislative Branch.\" This is not the place to go there now, but if the issue of how well congressional oversight is functioning remains an unresolved problem, the current system's limits on executive communication should be explored. Congressional committees now have the option to subpoena executive branch documents, in addition to subpoena individual officers. The scope of these documents and the potential penalties for violation have increased. When the executive branch receives a subpoena, it's required to preserve and not destroy certain documents on a case-by-case basis. In addition, penalties of fines and imprisonment are applicable for violations of federal law. The penalties vary and can be severe. By analogy, we should consider the penalties against the individuals involved in a subpoena enforcement lawsuit and consider if the penalties have a real impact on their behavior. When Congress wants to investigate the executive branch, the results often take an additional financial burden on the people charged with the work. In the future, congressional committees should be required to pay the fees and expenses of their investigations and be bound to the rules of the House and Senate related to this work. While this requirement would have no effect on the investigation's main subject matter and the committee's work, the requirement to use taxpayer money for related to a certain subject area should apply all cases--regardless of the type of investigative or oversight mission being performed. Congressional committees and the executive branch should have more formalized guidelines and communication processes for understanding the procedures and practices of congressional investigation. In many ways, the rules by which Congress operates are based on an old form of communication, where the executive branch of government provides information for the Legislature. There is little evidence that the traditional structure of federal government would be able to work within an existing legal process, especially in modern times. An increased transparency and openness would reduce the tensions and obstacles between the parties in communication. For instance, it would be useful to consider the process of the Presidential Daily Brief and the Office of National Security Affairs Executive Actions. If Congress and the executive branch do not have some level of communication and work, the taxpayer is still required to pay for it. While the concept of executive privilege does no harm and has a long heritage, it still makes government officials hesitant to provide their advice and information for a myriad of requests. It might be an asset to Congress and the executive branch if Congress and the President could develop a system of diplomatic and mutually acceptable communication. The president does not have any legal authority to provide immunity for an executive branch adviser or appointee. The exception has created a special situation, where the President and members of Congress would have access under certain circumstances to a confidential advisor's documents. The rules by which such individuals \"must\" or \"are required to\" provide the documents has not yet been established, but the President is required to designate an interagency working group to perform the research and report findings by a certain date for Congress. The White House's handling of documents related to the 9/11 attacks was not consistent. For most of the first three months after the 9/11 attack, the White House refused any requests that it did not agree to in this context. The government's reaction was not just late. The first responses from the executive branch were nearly impossible to get from the Congress. The problem was not that there were too many items or too few items for Congress to review, but that there didn't seem to be an adequate set-up process.

"The Trump Administration's funding initiatives to construct additional fencing along the Mexican border raise issues relating to \"unbridled and unrestrained power\" by circumventing the Appropriations Power Clause, which is based on Article I's \"power of the purse\" grant. The lower court held that the challenged funding requests were an \"unconstitutional power grab[]\" with regard to the federal government, which could not be permitted without prior authorization from Congress. Thus, injurious collateral effects to the named plaintiffs resulting from the Administration not securing congressional authorization would satisfy Article III's prudential limitations rule and create Article I violations. Moreover, the Court held that the \"Trump administration's attempt to exercise, unilaterally and in the face of pending challenges to the constitutionality of the Wall and related policies, Congress' power to regulate land,\" cannot override the pre-established checks on the government's power in Article I before the Framers created Congress. While the Court thus concluded the Trump Administration lacked Article I power because Congress does not authorize the federal government to spend money in this manner, the Court left the underlying question of Article I power authority for consideration by the Supreme Court. A federal district court in the District of Columbia has been petitioned to issue an opinion that the Trump Administration has an \"unbridled and unrestrained power over the purse.\" The Court did not issue an opinion yet on this matter in early February 2019. In Texas, a federal district court stated that \"the proper balance of power between Congress and the Executive... [would be] seriously imperiled if the government's power to spend taxpayer funds were to be unchecked.\"[1] The Court thus reversed below and remanded with directions to the trial court to \"resolve the question whether Article 1 and Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grant the Congress power to [definitively] authorize executive-initiated construction spending by Congress.\" This is the first federal court to consider the Article I power question in regards to this issue. The Court does not explicitly hold that Congress did not authorize executive-initiated construction spending, instead merely remands to the trial court for a resolution of this issue based on the U.S. Constitution. This case is on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. [1] Texas D.C. v. Trump, No. 1:18-cv-2306 (D.C. 2016). [1] Texas D.C. v. Trump, No. 1:18-cv-2306 (D.C. 2016).

Cable systems were licensed by the FCC to operate without the states' review and oversight. Cable systems, seeking to expand their services and market, generally had to comply with local laws governing cable, PEG access, rates, equipment requirements, and programming. The FCC, however, changed its mind and found no fault with cable operators who provided equipment, programming, and PEG channels for public access. Legislation in the early 2000s altered cable service markets, as the FTC and FCC limited their oversight and regulation to cable systems of all sizes. Congress and courts continued to weigh in on many issues, especially at the local level. In the mid-2000s, cable operators began to lose access to channels and to subscribers. Some operators were also losing financial support from cable subscribers who, according to surveys and reports, were increasingly choosing to use the Internet. In an effort to regain the lost subscribers and the access they provided, cable companies in some areas offered new services in addition to and in competition with telecommunications, cable operations in their communities changed in 1970s during the introduction of new cable service technologies in that decade and subsequently, and in 1984 Congress approved a law requiring cable operators to give municipalities some franchise concessions. The act required cable operators to (1) serve PEG for their customers, and (2) provide some level of cable service at relatively low rates. In early 1990s, local cable providers were no longer able to survive. By 1999, many cable headend centers were being shut down or moved out of the home. Cable services in many communities are now limited to one cable provider. Many communities still provide this service. In general, cable service in 2001 increased 32 percent over a decade. Cable service also doubled in 1990s decade. In July 1998, Congress passed the Digital Television Transition and Consumer Protect Act (DTVCPTA) which required cable systems by law to provide cable service, and to provide access to PEG channels. At a federal level, cable systems were limited to providing PEG channels. Cable companies were required to offer PEG channels to certain municipalities, on a per-home basis. Localities could restrict cable operators' access to their PEG networks. Communities could also limit cable to the broadcast of basic government services (public access) or to the transmission of government-produced content. Localities could also set a per-home additional fee if cable service increased beyond a certain amount for cable customers. Cable service operators did not charge each other or share a common cable distribution network, but could provide PEG as long as the content originated from a locality where PEG channels were used. In addition, each cable service company's cable was a public resource in which FCC and the courts could also apply regulations in certain areas of content and operations. Some localities also adopted or proposed regulations regarding cable operators' content and equipment requirements. The following discussion contains a great deal of discussion on the effects that passage of the DTVCPTA would have on cable operations. The FCC has said that they are not compelled to write regulations for cable TV service. The FCC has already issued 1,000,000 PEG channels to communities within 10 miles of its headend facility at Silver Spring, Maryland. Currently, cable providers at that distance receive $7,000 per year in royalties when local communities receive 15 channels. By 2003, the FCC requires cable providers nationwide to receive $2,500 per year per PEG channel. It is not clear how that figure compares to what is charged. By 2001, cable TV service in many areas was losing the PEG channels that residents once enjoyed, and only 11% found local public access channels in their communities. Many small markets also lost access to basic channels. Cable providers were also complaining of increased costs, higher taxes, and increased competition. There was speculation that as the price of cable in markets began to climb, the proportion of households subscribing to PEG channels may increase. In many small markets, the costs of PEG channels could no longer afford the PEG. As cable systems grow, customers could become more aware of PEG access. Cable operators and their industry associations now promote PEG as providing economic benefits to small businesses and communities. Although cable operators and their associated local headend facilities will be subject to cable service provisions, cable operators will have to incur additional costs to access and run these channels. The FCC does provide public telecommunications services over wireless systems at certain locations in communities. Each city or town that is served by a citywide wireless system would also be entitled to a per-home additional fee. Cable systems that transmit cable signals over wireless transmission can also be eligible for local cable rates and access to information services. In general, cable providers will have access to wireless networks where the wireless transmissions are limited by the FCC. In 2001, Congress allowed municipalities to levy franchise fees on cable companies for access to local programming or", "The development of new financial technologies has long been intertwined with technological advances. Fintech may offer benefits and risks depending on the type of financial services in play. Among its possible benefits are increased efficiency, new markets of opportunity, lower transaction costs, improved risk management, reduced errors, and increased customer satisfaction. Risks might involve data security and privacy issues, regulatory challenges to the financial sector, potentially slower technological advancement, and high costs associated with information systems upgrades to support Fintech applications. In reviewing financial technology, Congress is examining the potential effects on existing firms\u00e2\u00a2 risk management practices and the financial authorities\u00e2\u00a2 regulatory strategies. Congress is concerned about regulatory barriers to Fintech\u00e2\u00a2 adoption and integration into financial services. The development of new financial technology may offer opportunities for expanding markets\u00e2\u00a2 access to finance. At the same time, technological advances may open a competitive challenge to large financial institutions, whose customers might have access to \u00e2\u00a2 competitive services provided \u00e2\u00a2 lower fees that the financial institutions might be able to match through new business or services. The financial institutions may also face a risk related to the quality of their data technologies. It is therefore important to consider the financial market\u00e2\u00a2 risks associated with changing trends and \u00e2\u00a2 regulatory requirements that would affect their technological infrastructure. Congressional committees may be interested in the implications of expanding nonfinancial or information technology risks\u00e2\u00a2 in the financial sector. Other questions that Congress may consider include: the implications of technological change in traditional financial services; the evolution of the US financial industry and regulatory structure; the possible effects of Fintech on bank lending; the challenges of data compliance and privacy; and the impact of Fintech on the role of the \u00e2\u00a2 Financial Service Regulatory Commission. As technological advancements continue to occur and become widespread, Congress may be interested in monitoring the effects in their \u00e2\u00a2 broader implications. They may also want to look at new ways in which the government could \u00e2\u00a2 manage and support data related to financial markets. As Congress considers these technological developments, Congress \u00e2\u00a2 and its committees may need to develop new ways \u00e2\u00a2 to address them as well. -- \u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u2022\u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u2022 \u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u2022 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd \u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\u2022\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd&\u00c2\u2022\u00c2\u00a2\u00c2\u00ae\u00e2\u00a2\u00c2\u00c6\u00d1\u00a4\u00cc\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00ba\u00e2\u00ae\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00a4\u00e2\ufffd\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u0153\u00e2\u00a2\u00ae\u00c2\u00b3\u00c2\u00a4\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffdi\u00ee\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\u2022\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c3\u2030\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c3\u2030\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c3\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.\u00c2\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2\ufffd\u00c2", "At the beginning of FY2019, several annual appropriations bills remained unresolved. Five regular appropriations bills and one continuing resolution were enacted to end the partial government shutdown at the start of the 116 th Congress, but no measure was enacted to fund disaster supplemental assistance. H.R. 268, introduced by House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, was offered for consideration on January 8, 2019. The House passed it by unanimous consent that day, but it was not ultimately enacted. The shutdown was ended by a compromise and a partial government shutdown that day. On January 16, the House took up H.R. 268, which provided $9.2 billion for disaster supplemental assistance through February 8. H.R. 268 was ultimately adopted and sent to the Senate, where it passed by unanimous consent later that day. There was no further action on disaster supplemental assistance in the Congressional lame-duck session. On December 21, Congress ended with a $19.19 billion supplemental appropriation bill that included disaster assistance. Congress and the Trump Administration reached a deal to provide $19.19 billion in disaster supplemental funding through December 7. The Congressional Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey introduced additional measures, including a temporary resolution providing the same as the act ( H.R. 268 ), which ultimately lapsed. $9.2 billion was appropriated in H.R. 268 as emergency supplemental disaster disaster assistance through February 8 to address the disaster assistance emergency. A series of disaster supplemental bills were brought to the House on March 14, but none had been enacted before the shutdown ended on March 21. A total of $19.19 billion ( H.J.Res. 28 also enacted on March 14 to fund the federal government until June 22 ) was authorized for disaster supplemental funding and an additional bill providing the temporary extension ( H.R. 268 ) was not passed. Following an unsuccessful attempt to end the partial government shutdown in March 26, 90 percent of the federal workforce was back to work on April 15. Congress passed continuing spending and discretionary funding legislation ( S.Amdt. 5, S.Amdt. 6 ) during its April 15 session. In May 2019, Congress appropriated $19.19 billion emergency supplemental disaster assistance through July 22. However, no additional funds were provided for this assistance, which is included in the amount provided by H.R. 268 in the 116 th Congress. There were four disaster relief bills introduced in May 2019. Three of these bills were made out of pocket from the Treasury Department, with no further appropriations being taken and none being enacted by the 29th session of Congress. One bill, which established a temporary extension of federal disaster assistance, passed on May 22 at a $9.2 billion dollar price tag. The Congressional Appropriations Committee Chairmanwoman Nita Lowey offered an additional bill providing emergency disaster relief appropriating additional funds and ending on December 7. A second bill, making this amount available from June 1 to November 6. The Senate voted on May 23 to confirm the 90th director of the Office of Management and Budget and the 14th president of the Motion Picture Association of America. On May 27, the House also enacted this bill. On June 21, H.R. 268, emergency disaster supplemental disaster assistance ( $19.19 billion ) lapsed with no further measures being taken. On December 15, Congress provided disaster funding through December 7. The House and Senate passed an additional bill providing $20.4 billion in disaster assistance funds, which was included in the December 7 CR. The 22 th session of the 116th Congress passed in mid-December without making significant progress on disaster-related legislation. A conference committee reached a compromise of $4.1 billion in federal funds by December 7. The House passed the conference bill on December 15, ending in a large measure that included $20.4 billion in disaster assistance funding, $4.1 billion in federal disaster funds. Other information is found in H.R. 268. A 22 th Congress resolution, containing a temporary extension of federal disaster assistance through June 21, was enacted in the House on May 28. On May 24, the Senate passed one bill with a series of bills addressing disaster supplemental financing, disaster tax incentives, etc., etc. The 90th director of the Office of Management and Budget and the 14th president of the Motion Picture Association of America was confirmed. Several bills providing disaster relief passed through the end of the 116th Congress. On December 15, the House unanimously passed a measure providing $20.4 billion in disaster assistance funding, $4.1 billion in federal disaster funding, and a continuing resolution through December 8", "Scientists have long known that carbon moves through the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and the biosphere in complex ways. It's time to move on from our traditional \"fossil fuel\" view of energy by understanding that many other sources of green renewable energy are now available and becoming increasingly cost-competitive. By moving to \"green energy,\" U.S. citizens can reduce their contribution to climate change without sacrificing access to reliable electricity, job opportunities, and other important resources. To that end, Congress should not repeal the Clean Air Act, but instead use it as a framework to advance common-sense renewable energy resources. Key areas for consideration include a renewable portfolio standard to promote energy efficiency and growth of renewable energy resources. The 2002 Climate Act also established a large number of greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, and Congress should consider updating it to address the new realities of climate change. For example, it could provide regulatory clarity to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Finally, the cost-savings and job creation benefits of efficiency improvements should also be promoted. In doing so, Congress can protect U.S. citizens' access to clean, inexpensive green electricity while providing a safe and affordable place to live.", "- There has been a decrease in wage growth for hourly workers since the early 1980s at the lower end. - For those with a college degree, wages have been growing slightly faster than wages for those without a degree. - Wages have been growing slower in recent years despite continued technological advancement. - There has been a falling wage share due to a rising labor compensation and narrowing wage premium. - Effects on income equality are mixed depending on income group. - Historical patterns suggest wage growth at the lower half of the income distribution should increase faster than that of the upper half. TABLES: The wage growth for the lower 20% in the 1975-2015 decade (see table for graph) is an issue for current and future generations. It is time for employers and governments to come together on comprehensive solutions to ensure workers' income share from economic growth continues to rise. Wages have been rising slightly faster than wage growth for college graduates, but have been growing slower in the past few years because of trade and technological changes. The effect of economic change on hourly wage growth has been positive for college graduates and those with associate degrees, with wages in the upper bracket rising faster than the lower half in recent years. A widening gap in wage growth between the upper- and -middle-income quartiles since 2005 means college graduates have been gaining ground on wage growth in the upper half of the income distribution compared to non-college graduates. A longer examination of hourly wage growth in 30-year increments reveals a rising wage premium for workers with a college degree as compared with workers in the bottom half of the income distribution since the mid-1960s. In contrast, the ratio of wage growth for workers without a college degree to those with a college degree has been growing slightly faster than wage growth for these groups since 1919, but overall hourly wage growth is rising more slowly than college wage growth due to economic variables. Recent wage growth by college graduates of 3.4 percent since 2015 is almost double the 1.8 percent of wage growth for non-college graduates. Yet over the same time frame the wage growth of non-college graduates has been rising twice as fast as college graduates due to changes in labor market dynamics. Since 1979, the share of wage income for college graduates and those with lesser degrees has been growing at similar rates, with median weekly wages of college-educated workers growing faster in recent years. Since 2016, wage growth has been slightly slower for college graduates than those with a college degree, but overall growth in wages for both groups during the last decade was below the historical average. Overall wage growth has been slowly picking up since 2016, with growth occurring for college-educated and trade workers, but the gap in wage growth between college graduates and non-college graduates, although narrowing since 2015, is small compared to historical patterns. College-educated workers have the highest median weekly wage at $1,400, versus $1,156 for those with a college degree but only $1,069 for non-college graduates. Although the recent economic growth since 2016 has been slightly faster than wage growth for college graduates and non-college graduates, the long-term pattern of slower wage growth suggests the current economic trends might be turning against college graduates. In contrast, the gap in wage growth between college graduates and trades workers narrowed somewhat over - - the last 7 years. The overall trend in unemployment and jobless measures has remained fairly steady since 1980, and is still below the historical average, though the rate of jobless workers has been declining from 1955 to 1957. There seems to be a connection between jobless workers, college education and college graduate wages. College-educated workers currently are generally better wage earners than those without a college degree. There is the long-term trend that wages of those with college degrees are more volatile compared to wages of those without. College graduates have seen the slowest rise of weekly wages in recent years since 19182. Since 2000, wages for college graduates have risen at a slightly faster pace than wages for non-college graduates. Since 19593, wage growth for college graduates has risen in all demographic, economic and education categories. Wages of college employees were 1 percent slower to increase during this period compared to non-college workers, but since 2011 the differences in wage growth between the two groups has been declining. In the current decade, wages of both college-educated and non-college-educated workers have started to grow at similar levels, though wage growth has been less for college graduates than for non-college graduates during that time frame. Over the past half-century, average wages of college graduates have risen dramatically, whereas non-college graduates also have seen an increase in wage growth, but the growth rate for non-college graduates has slowed in recent years and their wages have been slower to recover after the recession. Overall, the", "Macroeconomic theory defines long-run economic progress through a modern monetary theory model as one where the economy's short-run outcome depends on the government's borrowing and expenditure. For instance, if IS-LM and MMT differ significantly, the government can fund it only if it borrows to a private entity when the economy is unstable. The government can fund it only if it borrows to entities willing to fund it through higher taxes, in other words, the government can become the economic agent. In case of recession, government expenditure is larger, and more government borrowing would increase public debt. In contrast, when market agents are the main agents, government expenditure is determined by taxes and fees, which means government revenue is fixed, but government expenditure can rise with or fall as it adjusts to new demand. Consequently, macroeconomic models and MMT in particular are used to examine fiscal and monetary policy, as well as the dynamics of the macroeconomy by which macroeconomic variables interact to produce growth. The primary macroeconomic variables are output by production and demand, aggregate supply, and the equilibrium price level.

Although early congressional practices focused on the proper functioning of a standing Treasury Committee, they also allowed for the creation of separate standing committees of Ways and Means and Appropriations. In general, supply bills without dollar amounts filled in on the floor were considered formality and were not extensively debated. The 1835 rule mandating separate consideration for such legislation was introduced in a separate section of House rules. However, the Constitution also established the power of Congress to appropriate funds by general rule, with no specific exception made for that purpose.

The CARES Act provides financial assistance to eligible businesses, states, and municipalities. Title IV provides funding for financial institutions and non-profit organizations through loans or loan guarantees. The act expires December 31, 2020, although Congress may retroactively extend the authority. The Treasury will use the remaining money in a new bill passed by Congress, which could provide additional funding if needed. CONTENTS IN THIS REPORT: 1.

BILLING CODE 3510-17-P\n\u00c2\u00a340", "Since its enactment, the Presidential Records Act has evolved into more complex requirements and responsibilities on how to maintain Presidential records. The act defines presidential records as documentary materials in the course of carrying out the President's constitutional, statutory, or other official duties, but excludes certain types of personal records. There have been extensive changes to the law, including updates to how to maintain and release Presidential information, and increased use of presidential records in recent years. Current practices and requirements are outlined. Key information is made available on the Web at:", "Child nutrition programs have traditionally been aimed at both safeguarding the health and well-being of children and increasing availability of healthy food in the U.S. Children's nutritional status was improved by 1.2%; by 2015, the national average was estimated to be 1.6%. In 2016, the rate of decline in children living in poverty was 5.9%; the number of children in SNAP, WIC, and FPNSFP rose. Children whose access to food was limited by their households' economic conditions, the number remained relatively flat; however, child nutritional eligibility requirements became more flexible (eg, the number of meals served per week). RECOGNITIONS Congress enacted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) that provides new benefits, funding, and administrative tools to all 3 child nutrition programs. HHFKA also provided new opportunities for children in SNAP and TNP. Other New Programs In 2010, HHFKA created new programs for summer and year-round child nutrition programs. These programs are known as CSP-Summer and CFPS-FY, and their current funding levels will be expanded by the HHFKA. Starting in the 2016 fiscal year, several new programs, including the School Breakfast Pilot Program (SBPP) and the Child and Adult Care Feeding Program (CACFP), can be funded by appropriated funds, which will be in addition to their current funding levels. New funding can be appropriated at the federal, state, or local level. New state funds can be used to fund new summer and year-round nutrition programs, and funding can be used to serve a greater number of children in a location. The Child Nutrition Division of the USDA estimates that 13.6% of all children in the U.S. participate in at least 1 meal or snack per week. The USDA is required to conduct nutritional assessments and make recommendations every 5 years about child nutrition programs to the USDA Secretary. In March 2019, the USDA published an NPRM to update its Nutrition Standards for Child Care Programs (NACCP) (which was developed under previous authorizing language, HFPKA), with the potential for new nutritional guidelines for child nutrition programs. The USDA also finalized changes in SNAP-SFSP, including an amendment to an existing administrative ruling that limits eligibility beyond a statewide entity if there is no state agency administering the SNAP-SFSP in a given locality. In July 2019, the USDA announced that school year-round child nutrition funding will be changed to a summer-only approach. This decision will result in all children receiving summer nutrition benefit, which is approximately 40-80% of the school year benefit compared with the school year. The USDA will be working to ensure that all children in the U.S. who are eligible for nutrition benefits are receiving them, and also that child nutrition programs and schools prepare themselves to meet the nutritional standards required by legislation.

The bill would continue funding for the HEA through FY2024 and order new payments to each institution to implement the CORE ACT. The College-GEPA Act would reauthorize the postsecondary education programs that make up major elements of student assistance, including financial assistance, work-study, student information, educational opportunities, child, and health\u00c2\u00accare services. The general objective to reauthorize these postsecondary education program is to provide institutions the ability to meet the changing needs of students and remain responsive to a changing economy. The Bill would extend the 2014 Higher Education Act (HASA)\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provisions on the Postsecondary Educational Resources (CORE Act. The bill would re-authorize CORE through FY 2024, with an additional component in the bill related to a pilot program for the creation of academic programs that are not typically offered at IHEs to help students in fields that are underrepresented by the student population. H.R. 4661 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153College for All\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Act authorizes the appropriation of $35 million to colleges in order to increase the availability of high-cost programs. This approach is meant to help students in their access to IHEs. H.R. 4648 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153School Counseling Act\u00e2\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 establishes a national advisory committee that directs the use and distribution of the funding. In total, H.R. 4648 would authorize $100 million for 2017-31 to carry out national initiatives (including new\u00c2\u00acs access counseling to student organizations at schools).

S. 216 was introduced after H.R. 6 and offered a pathway for some foreign nationals in certain types of cases to obtain permanent resident status by providing an opportunity for those to become LPRs who are the victim of a violent felony to be eligible to receive such permanent resident status and a pathway to become permanent residents. Both bills are reported in S, 7, 8 of the 115 th Congress and S. 1249 of the 116 th Congress. In the 109 th Congress, H.R. 6 and H.R. 3, (the DACA bill), both were introduced and have continued to become the primary proposals for providing immigration relief to some of the more stateless undocumented population.

The treaty superseded the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, which lapsed in 2012 after 15 years, and has provided a mechanism to avoid further lapses of the treaty limits. Press reports indicate that President Trump is seeking a new nuclear arms control agreement that captures all types of nuclear weapons, including China's. Current U.S. officials have stated that New START serves U.S. national security interests, as the treaty monitors Russian nuclear forces, and prevents new kinds of nuclear weapons from emerging.

Antidumping laws are used to provide some relief from the economic consequences of unfair trade practices, either to U.S. manufacturers or to foreign imports into the US. The antidumping laws are controversial because of the impact they can have on U.S. manufacturers. A trade remedy (antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard duties) is used to control certain exports for less than their normal market price. AD laws give U.S. goods and services the same treatment it gives foreign products. However, antidumping laws are not equally effective: AD laws have been applied only a relatively small fraction of all (non-administrative) American trade. AD laws are much less popular and useful for foreign producers, particularly those developing a market niche in their own product range. For some goods, antidumping was an important instrument of economic growth, particularly in the case of American goods subject to a trade remedy. But they were not used to prevent foreign firms from moving in or out of a market. Moreover, they have not always had the desired effect, but instead have been utilized to block foreign entry. For many years, the practice of using foreign courts to determine the effects of AD laws has been of questionable relevance. AD laws are a matter of U.S. trade policy and therefore of congressional concern, but there is less to learn from it than might seem. In its own case, the U. S. courts were not concerned with the economic impact that the trade remedy was having on American exporters. One of the few times the courts decided an AD law case of American goods was the case of Bementhould v. United States.

The federal government provided land or grants of funds for land to the states to enable them to establish state-supported colleges of agriculture. Congress enacted the Morrill Act in 1862 and related legislation to establish institutions of higher learning across the nation. The modern land-grant university system in the United States was implemented through a range of federal legislation and grants, culminating in the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862. This legislation facilitated the establishment of numerous state-supported land-grant universities across the country. A series of subsequent legislation and grants further expanded the federal land-grant university system, with the signing of the Morrill Act into law in 1890. The legislation passed to promote these institutions and eliminate racial discrimination in admissions processes. A range of colleges and universities, including historically black colleges and universities, have been established under this system.", "The Act requires the Secretary to develop a recovery plan for listed species. FWS provides ESA services in order to support FWS, FWS develops a recovery plan in every case in which a species is listed, but FWS does not have to provide all the species conservation-related services. Once FWS determines a species is listed, FWS will develop a recovery plan. The ESA requires FWS develop a recovery plan in 5 years (unless the species is a marine species, then 10 years) and in 5 years (10 years) to support the species conservation-related services FWS will provide for any listed species. In addition to FWS providing species conservation-related services to listed species, FWS also provides additional tools for conservation to the other species listed under the ESA that do not qualify to receive services, but can still be listed as endangered or threatened species. ESA does not require FWS to provide for all service provided under the ESA, but FWS is required to provide them. Figure 2 Listing. Listing a species or DPS requires three key steps: A status review: The Secretary of Agriculture evaluates the status of either a species or DPS in order to determine whether it satisfies some or all of the five ESA-specified conditions. The ESA provides some scientific and commercial data must be based on species-specific biological and other scientific data or peer review and professional review and/or invertebrates under the ESA). If a species or DPS does not satisfy the five ESA-specified conditions, FWS may determine on an individual-species basis that the species is not qualified for listing (i.e., FWS may not list endangered or threatened species) or list a group of species or subspecies or DPSs, if appropriate, in the ESA. The ESA also includes a rebuttable presumption that listing should be issued for those species that cannot be found during each period (e.g., within a certain time frame) when certain conditions are present in any species. All ESA-specified biological data must be shared, documented, and subject to FWS's review. Listing an endemic species. With respect to a distinct population segment (DPS) of a species, in species that is listed or recovered under the ESA, FWS generally determines whether a population of a species is a member of a DPS that is listed or recovered under the ESA. At the time of listing recovery is a separate ESA biological classification (under ESA a DPS can have many subpopulations) and can be used if FWS determines that a population is a member of a DPS that has been listed for conservation under the ESA and/or that has undergone recovery. Once FWS determines a population is a member of a DPS that is listed, listed DPSs will have the conservation-related services FWS provides to listed species that have been documented that they have undergone recovery. ESA does not require FWS to provide services to other population of a species that does not qualify \"species\" in the ESA to become list but instead, only to species where FWS provides the ESA-required \"services\" are species are listed or recoverable. FWS is required to provide services to all listed \"species\" under the ESA based on five ESA standards. Species will be listed or recovered only by FWS at the Secretary's discretion. FWS will determine the ESA biological classification, recovery condition, species' threats to survival, population's size and the ESA recovery plan's duration prior to beginning the biological data program. A FWS species conservation-related services: FWS also provides ESA's species management strategies or biological classification are needed to support other species listed and recoverable under the Act. For species listed or recovery a species' biological characterizations are based on the ESA Recovery Plan. FWS will designate different categories of species and develop species-specific biological data. In addition to FWS's actions, ESA required FWS to identify distinct population segments (DPS) of the species, their population size and recovery status. In addition to FWS's determination and ESA's biological classification or specific data on certain species, the ESA requires FWS develop a species conservation-related services, such as rearing facilities, propagation centers, and captive breeding programs, prior to starting a biological data program which is needed for a survival-of-the-fittest program or for ESA-listing recovery efforts. Other ESA services for species listed in or that have undergone the ESA biological analysis include biological monitoring (with the ESA biological analysis required by FWS of all species listed), species' conservation-related activities in FWS recovery plan (e.g., biological or animal safety of wildlife rehabilitation or species rearing in FWS's facility). ESA required FWS to develop a recovery plan in every case in which FWS determines that a species is listed.

If enacted, this would likely affect some DOD military personnel accounts for both their salary and health care costs. DOD agencies are experiencing difficulty with current FY appropriations bills due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic-related costs are a large part of these pandemic funds, and DOD is facing increased demands for emergency health care and testing efforts to manage this pandemic. The coronavirus cost is a large part of DOD's total FY20 ($3.7 billion) and FY21 ($3.65 billion) pandemic-related cost, which is in addition to the $6.4 billion total COVID-19 related cost of DOD in FY19. This number significantly increased from $1 billion in FY18 (FY19.10.1) and is almost triple its FY18 level. According to a July 13, 2020 report from the Inspector General for the Office of Management and Budget, by April 7, 2020, $4.37 billion has been spent on COVID-19 related costs across the federal government and, as of October 7, 2020, $4.1 billion had been transferred by the Office of Thrift Savings Plan to the Treasury to pay for the pandemic costs. The Coronavirus Response Authorization Act (H.R. 6201) also provides $8.2 billion to DOD to help pay the COVID-19 costs. DOD has also been faced with increased costs for COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) equipment, travel, and remote worksite and service provider costs among other expenses. While DOD has received significant PPE funding from Congress to date, the COVID relief funds are likely an additional source of funding for FY23 that can be anticipated. Additionally, there is an expectation that more funding for COVID-19 costs will be provided to DOD through the FY20 or FY21 CARES Act, which have been enacted. Additionally, COVID-19 costs are likely to affect DOD agencies with the largest share of their operations and expenses located in on-site military facilities and personnel costs in these facilities. Additionally, the number of DOD staff working remotely due to COVID-19 has also increased the costs associated with teleworking and remote working expenses. For COVID-19-related costs, DOD is likely to continue requesting that Congress approve its ability to receive relief funds, similar to what was approved in H.R. 6201. Some potential sources of relief funding for future COVID-19 costs could be provided through additional CARES Act funding or other COVID relief acts pending before Congress. To address COVID-19 costs, DOD agencies are likely facing significantly reduced non-COVID-19 costs for medical and public health services. As a result, COVID-19 costs within DOD may likely be a larger proportion of overall DOD's health care cost per capita than the percentage of overall total health care costs. It is likely that DOD will have to deal with similar types of costs with each FY23 bill.

"Although the federal government has taken a range of actions to address PFAS exposure, stakeholders have urged the government to act more quickly and broadly by enacting enforceable drinking water standards. There are multiple bills introduced in the 116th Congress with various PFAS provisions that could be incorporated into legislation. However, no legislation has yet been introduced that would address PFAS exposure in broad terms. TABLES SUMMARY OF FEDERAL ACTIONS RELATED TO PFOA AND PFOS Summary of Recent Congressional Bills Related to PFAS Exposure The Report: PFAS - A Fact Sheet for the 116th Congress PAGE 2 DOD PFAS Action PFAS Action IN ADDITION: \u2022 H.R. 1074: PFAS Disclosure Act of 2018 \u2022 H.R. 2500: Military PFAS Water Accountability Act of 2020 \u2022 S. 1732: PFAS Exposure Prevention Act of 2020 SUMMARY The PFAS problem is complex. Several federal agencies have been involved in different aspects of the PFAS dilemma. In addition to a number of civilian government organizations and environmental groups that have long been involved in PFAS matters, the Marine Corps has also recently issued an order limiting PFAS use in its military installations. Since the beginning of the PFAS crisis in the 1950s and since the National Institute of Health\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (NIH) discovery of PFAS exposures among military personnel at Camp Greylock, Illinois, in 1962, the U.S. Army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toxic Exposure Indemnity Program (TFEP) Program has provided compensation to individuals who have \u00e2\"inherited\u00e2\" PFAS exposure through their military service. These injuries can be physical, chemical, and neurological, and symptoms can include kidney damage, heart problems, brain damage, and other types of harm and health complications. Military personnel who do not serve actively in the armed forces, but who retired or were discharged from service more than 2 \u00e2\u00b3 long prior to the advent of PFAS awareness and regulation can participate in the program if they meet eligibility requirements. In 2003, the PFAS problem in military installations was again spotlighted by the Military Toxins Database (MTD) Program \u00e2\" which tracks exposure \u00e2\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00a6 of chemical substances and pollutants to those who serve both in the armed forces and civilian communities.

The report, National Acquisition and Procurement Policy (NAP), recommended expanding the government's use of purchase cards to small-dollar transactions in an effort to streamline the procurement process. To put this into context, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) was passed in 1994 and included reforms that encouraged small purchases. FASA also established an exclusion from certain procurement laws, which made it easier for agencies to acquire micro-purchases. Consequently, the number of purchase card transactions grew significantly from 1988 to 2012.", "Senate has the ability to streamline the federal confirmation process though a House/ Senate document. There are 285 nominations that are designated private and a citizen must go through an interview and background check process for any one-time nomination. Senate process, which includes the collection of pertinent information from nominees, begins in the office of the majority leader. A 10-day requirement exists for any senator with information to be presented to the Senate and a citizen. This document was published in March 2012 in an effort to inform Senators about a new process that has evolved since S. RES 116 was signed into law in the 112th Congress.", "DOD is currently procuring ground EW systems for nearly every ground vehicle in the U.S. Army.

These developments raise questions about the extent to which portfolio standards, such as minimum annual amounts for some of these sources, can help to meet the changing U.S. demand for renewable electricity and the changing U.S. domestic and global investment landscapes. In particular, some stakeholders argue for an overall reduction in the U.S. reliance on fossil fuels, so those sources may be of less concern than others in the portfolio standards. To the extent that renewable sources are increasingly cost-competitive, some might favor a portfolio-based approach that increases them. Other considerations for policymakers include market trends for coal, natural gas, and the overall energy marketplace, how various state policies are affecting or could affect state-by-state electric markets, and the implications of growing competition in the domestic electric power sector. Congressional interest in a national portfolio standard has occurred in 2011 through 2018. Some view the current U.S. investment landscape as supporting a gradual shift from coal to larger renewables, while others think that this trend is likely to continue. By considering the various factors driving this evolution, policymakers could decide the appropriate approach for implementing portfolio standards without overburdening the electric power sector. The report is based on a 2019 Congressional Staff report addressing the implementation of portfolio standards. The report is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of the General Counsel.", "The BCA set discretionary spending caps each year through FY2021, using an automatic spending reduction process of across-the-board cuts in mandatory spending. These required savings were between $109.3 billion in FY2013 and $54 billion in FY 2021, subject to exemption and special rules for particular programs. A total of $1.2 trillion in automatic across-the-board cuts are specified for a 10-year period to save the deficit reduction amount enacted into law by Congress on December 10, 2015, by expanding the BCA's sequester provisions.

With these updates in energy storage, Congress has held hearings on a number of topics including climate change mitigation, electric power system resilience, incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Given that electricity is predominantly produced and transported in 60 Hertz cycles, and that the supply of energy must always be enough to meet the demand, efficiency improvements may occur. Some of the challenges facing Congress in making these efficiency improvements are further consideration as to how to reconcile the intermittent generation of wind/solar power that is becoming increasingly commonplace in the electric grid, and how to integrate energy storage into the grid, if desired.

The POWER+ PLAN also provided grant and loan funding to businesses affected by the closing of coal mines, as well as funding to address social, economic, and environmental challenges facing communities transitioning from fossil fuels to modern energy sources.

The Annual Report to Congress (ARC) will not meet the definition of a \"strategy\" as set forth in the National Defense Strategy (NDS); however, the Report will give Congress a broad look at the Army's modernization program. Each year, the Army will submit a Report to Congress detailing the Army's progress and current challenges in implementing Army modernization. The Report itself will be available to Members of Congress in the classified annex that is provided as well in the unclassified annex on the Department of Defense's (DOD) Website. The Report will also include a comprehensive assessment of the Army's modernization program and the status of the Army's modernization strategy including an element of Army Modernization Review. The ARC will be available in the classified annex. The unclassified annex, however, could not be shared with the public. Additionally, Congress could also request that further information about specific Army systems and capabilities be included in 2020 ARC. To better understand the Army's modernization program and its future priorities, the 2019 ARN will also provide Congress with an overview of the Army's research areas, including research opportunities that the Army believes will support their future modernization priorities. Further, the ARN will also provide Congress with an overview of the Army's operational-specific modernization priorities for which the Army is requesting funding. The Report will give Members of Congress information on the Army's plans to further develop, deploy and sustain Army modernization and modernization of Army technologies, and Army technology priorities including the Army's plan to create a force structure. The Report will be the Army's means of meeting congressional challenges when it comes to Army-specific and Army modernization goals (see ARC).\nThe Army has a long list of future force structure, modernization and operational objectives within the National Army Strategy. To meet these challenges, Congress is provided with the Army's FY2021 budget request which lists several objectives as well as initiatives such as re-establishing the Army Corps Engineers, and developing the Army's MDO program. The Army's FY21 budget request is available on the DOD's website at in addition to the unclassified annex on the website.

Although opioid-related deaths overall have declined in the United States, overdose deaths continued to rise in both 2017 and 2018. Many deaths are potentially preventable with medication-assisted treatment. However, fentanyl-related overdoses have grown rapidly in recent years, driving much of the recent increase in opioid overdose deaths overall. Over the past 25 years, opioid overdose deaths have continued to rise in almost every state in the United States; in 2016, the total number of deaths among persons ages 15-24 was four times higher than the fatalities for those age 35-54. The overdose deaths among men are on the rise, while deaths among women have increased more slowly. In 2016, deaths are still concentrated among nonelderly, racial/ethnic minorities. While opioid deaths declined in 2020, deaths may have risen again in 2021, and early reports for 2021 suggest that deaths among all age groups will rise. In 2021, there are indications that drug overdose rates will begin to rise in 2022.\nOverdose deaths among children \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 the highest among children ages 2-11.

Finally, the text encourages policymakers to make aviation safety a priority.", "In the current system of executive branch revolving door conflict-of-interest regulations, highlevel, executive branch personnel who remain \"hired in\" for as short as one year have been required to keep a \"cooling-off period\" of two years; however, current regulations do not extend these postemployment restriction laws to the private sector. One-year restrictions, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (PGD), and three-year limits to certain financial activities, among other regulations are designed either to prevent conflicts of interest after government service, or to establish a time period in which government employees cannot seek employment or compensation from a private company for which they previously served. The current conflict-of-interest rule generally bars high-level, executive branch employees who are \"hired in\" after one year from lobbying Congress, or from making financial and business arrangements with corporations that are the subject of federal contracts, investigations, and hearings. Most executive branch provisions, including internal rules and laws, are governed by the Ethics in Government Act (EGO) and the Federal Conflict of Interest Act (FCOIA) governing federal employees and information systems used in their work. Government employees cannot receive any form of payments or benefits from companies in which they were employed in performing governmental functions before they are \"hired in.\" Current guidelines include a two-week rest from work to participate in public actions. Current regulations are designed to prevent any time period in which private, nongovernmental individuals are able to hire an executive branch individual, whether in business or directly in a private setting. An individual may not directly or indirectly serve as a personal or temporary consultant or agent for such individual's existing or potential employer in a single year. The Ethics Act was amended again in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and a subcommittee was specifically set up to examine ethics regulations in the federal system (Boehner, H.R. 3223 Press Release, August 31, 2002; USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, S.1 Press Release, Sept. 12, 2001). Some highlevel executive branch personnel are not required to register for the EGO. Current regulations in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 make the OGE's duties to supervise, enforce, and monitor the financial and business affairs of high-level officials under that act. The current regulations governing conflict-of-interest are under the purview of the FCOIA, which took effect in 2002, and requires that employees report information regarding \"receipt of gifts, extortion interests or other interest or thing which is specifically prohibited by the ethics in government rule or the Ethics in government financial interest rules\" and that they are prohibited, unless an exception is made, form submitting any financial interest in a business entity in which they have a controlling financial interest or in which they are a temporary consultant or agent for an entity in which they or an employer have an interest. A new provision under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, section 15B(5)B, amended by the FCOIA regulations issued on Sept. 27, 2001 is required to report to OGE any financial interest in a company the OGE has been notified will receive $500,000 or more from government contracts during 2013 (E.O. 12928-EH, Aug. 29, 2001). The current regulations of 2001 require that employees report to their agencies the value of any and all financial gifts they have received from individuals or entities that perform financial business with their agencies. The Ethics in Government Act of 1987 (EGO) was amended by the Ethics Act of 2001 (E.O.-13131-EH). The EGO generally governs ethics within the federal government, including the standards pertaining to certain personal conduct of government employees and the actions they have to perform and those they cannot perform on behalf of the agencies at which they are assigned. These regulations and procedures apply to high-level and executive-level civil servants throughout the executive branch, including those working for U.S. corporations with government contracts. The Ethics in Government Act took place at the beginning of the 2001 congressional session. Under current EGO regulations, federal employees cannot become involved in any business arrangement or receive non-public information that adversely reflects upon the person. For federal employees who have received these items, a public-records request could be used by their respective agencies. Agencies should be required to establish guidelines and procedures dealing with the use of government time and resources by high-level executive branch officials during the recess period, which took place between December 2, 2019, and January 3, 2020.

The IRS may also waive certain penalties and collection actions, including extensions of time to file and pay taxes. A.M. No. 15-2, 51st meeting, September 24, 2019", "Driver fatigue is a widespread issue in highway transportation, especially in tractor-trailer drivers, who are on the road for well over a week in some cases and often commute long distances. Driving fatigue can impair performance and increase crash risk. Although not always easy to identify, some crashes involving commercial motor vehicle drivers are related to fatigue behind the wheel. Common factors can include long hours of work in addition to long travel distances for drivers of cargo- and passenger-rail, intercity and long-distance motor carrier trucks. Driver fatigue can also be an increased risk for truckers, who drive more miles in a year than any other profession. The U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration estimated in 2018 that the annual death rate for truck drivers, defined as drivers, is 10-12 per 100,000 population, similar to that other professions. The 2018 annual death rate for on-the-job deaths in truck drivers in 2018 was 16 per 100,000 employment hours, with the most common type of crash being due to vehicle departure control. Driver fatigue can be increased during peak times for freight transportation, particularly during the holiday season as holiday loads typically demand more hours. In addition, on-the-job stress and physical exhaustion (as reported by drivers) can impair cognitive capabilities, resulting in poorer driving and potentially deadly crash outcomes.\nCommercial motor vehicle drivers face dangers when it comes to managing fatigue, leading to more crashes and higher fatality rates. Although not always easy to identify, fatigue among these workers is primarily related to sleep apnea, long hours, intercity or long-distance driving, and stress.", "Medicaid is an important source of LTSS for older adults and individuals with disabilities that provides significant health care services, LTSS benefits, resources, and care coordination at the state level. Medicaid eligibility varies across states and is often determined by individual minimum requirements, with each state determining the minimum financial level required for eligibility to Medicaid. Eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities can be different depending on the eligibility of their state, however, these older adults and individuals with disabilities can be covered by Medicaid. Specific eligibility pathways are further discussed in the report, including LTSS eligibility among older adults and individuals with disabilities, as well as eligibility for health-related medical services in outpatient settings.", "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a manufacturing process that enables custom parts for a variety of applications. This report includes the current materials and capabilities of 3D printers. KEY HOLDING that 3D printing offers a cost-effective means of custom parts manufacture. Three-dimensional printing is an additive manufacturing technology that makes it possible to create complex 2D designs at low cost. The technology can produce the simplest or most elaborate of objects, to the point of even replicating the parts commonly found in mass production. 3D printing is one of the most rapidly developing fields in manufacturing, and the technology can be used for a wide array of products. When it comes to the most difficult parts, 3D printers can be used as an additive manufacturing tool, which can be done on relatively small quantities. A range of materials is available for 3D printing, ranging from ABS and PLA plastics to glass, metal, and carbon fiber reinforced plastics. 3D printing is an interesting and exciting manufacturing technology. Because this technology is still relatively new, there are fewer traditional types of manufacturers that have added 3D printing to their production lines. The result is that 3D technology can be adapted to a wide variety of manufacturing operations. Additionally, the range of 3D technology is now growing rapidly. At the same time, there are a handful of 3D printing manufacturers competing for 3D services on the Internet. Several are competing to offer low-cost 3D printing services (see Figure 1 ). The size of the 3D printing market was estimated at about $1.9 billion in 2001, and the market is expected to reach $41.7 billion by 2031. Figure 1: 3D Printing Market Description.

Youths in foster care are generally disadvantaged compared to those in the general population, and the negative outcomes persist into adulthood. Outcomes in early adulthood are influenced by individual traits such as resilience. They are more likely to attain a high school diploma than those growing up in biological families. However, the challenges and outcomes can be improved in many youth. These challenges vary by foster system and state. These are the findings of the Congressional Budget Office. They were derived primarily by analysis of the John H. Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood and the Families and Childrens Research Unit of the National Institute of Aging.

On March 11, 2019, the Trump Administration proposed a total of $4.2 billion in FY2020 and FY21 SFOPS funding, which funds the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts (including $2 billion in COVID-19 emergency funding) in addition to $13 billion in COVID-19 funding; $158.9 million in mandatory retirement funding. In March 2020, Congress enacted the FY2020 Department of Defense (DOD) budget, which includes $1.3 billion for OCO ($8.7 billion in FY2019) to finance temporary contingency operations abroad. In recent years, Congress has enacted numerous funding bills for these requests, including in FY16 and FY17 to provide OCO funding, and in FY17 and FY18 to provide COVID-19 funding. Congress enacted the FY2020 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) budget ($4.2 billion in FY2020 and $13 billion in COVID-19 funding) in March. This includes the $1.27 billion request for urgent security funding for Afghanistan ($10.1 billion in COVID-19 funding) to enable U.S. forces to reinforce the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. On March 17, 2020, the Trump Administration asked Congress for $100 million in COVID-19 emergency funding authorized through the CARES Act. Congress enacted emergency funding for the World Health Organization for COVID-19 testing and treatment funding ($1.1 billion in FY2020). Congressional committees have consistently requested annual FY2019-FY21 SFOPS funding requests for the administration, with significant amounts available for FY 20, with additional COVID-19 funding of about $13 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Since the Trump Administration's proposal for a total of $4.2 trillion SFOPS funding in FY\u20192020 and FY\u201921, Congress continues to prioritize international \u2026\nFederal Discretionary Funding and Spending, Federal Discretionary Spending\nGeographic Scope:\nGlobal\nKeywords:\nBudget/Appropriations - NonDiscretionary\nSustainable Funding Sources\nPerformance & Efficiency\nFinancial Reporting Type Code:\nCARES Act\nAuthoring Agency Code:\nDepartment of Defense\nFiscal Year:\n2019\nDocument number:\nS & M 2020 Report PFI-I (101Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Performance Information Initiative\nS & M 2020 Report PFI-III (127Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services-III\nS & M 2020 Report PFI-IV (99Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services-IV\nS & M 2019 Report PFI-I (117Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Performance Information Initiative - Financial Information\nS & M 2020 Report PFI-III (126Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - III\nS & M 2019 Report PFI-V (136Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - IV\nS & M 2019 Report PFI-XI (123Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - XI\nS & M 2018 Report PFI-V (126Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - V\nS & M 2018 Report PFI-IV (136Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - III\nS & M 2018 Report PFI-III (129Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services (PFI) - II\nS & M 2018 Report PFI (134Kb PDF file)\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services (PFI) - I\nAuthoring agency code:\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\nAuthoring date:\n2019/03/11\nDocument number:\nPFI-XI\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - XI\nDocument code:\nPFI-V\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - V\nDocument code:\nPFI-IX\nDocument title:\nFederal Acquisition Information Services - IX\nAuthoring date:", "The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was charged with helping improve the administration of federal elections.

Although China currently held a monopoly position in the world rare earth supply market, the U.S. government was implementing measures to reduce dependence on a Chinese monopoly and provide for a domestically-based REE supply chain. The REE crisis of 2010 led to legislative action; and the Department of Defense (DOD) was contemplating its long-term REE strategy in early 2012. The REE market landscape is rapidly changing in the years since the 2012 Congressional session, with new REE producers beginning construction and with Chinese REE prices starting to fall, but there are still many issues to address before an overall secure supply chain is established.

There are two ways for Congress to attempt to override a veto. Failure by either chamber to override a veto in one or both chambers ends its fate and results in the bill becoming law. Regular or return veto may be cast if Congress adjourns during the 10-day period. Unlike pocket veto, written messages to Congress from the President can indicate a strong commitment to veto a bill, but the President's word on veto is not an absolute power. Congressional leaders must consider their responsibility to honor Presidential vetoes, but in practice, the decision to pass legislation over a veto is a political call, and Congress should decide the issue on a case-by-case basis. In conclusion, Congress must exercise its freedom of judgment as to whether to override Presidential vetoes. A veto is a tool that Congress uses to block legislation, and it must be balanced by Congress\u2019s use of an override for a bill that it thinks is unconstitutional. The President should be treated with reverence and respect, but should also be kept in check. CONCLUSIONS: The constitutional principles governing checks and balances with the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government must be respected. Congressional leaders should avoid issuing vetoes that the President is bound to execute, which could create a dangerous presidential precedent by making the process unconstitutional. The President himself will need to decide if he should exercise a veto, and Congressional leaders should also be willing to accept such decision, even if they disagree with it, to remain constitutionally permitted to execute a bill for which a veto might not be appropriate. The decision to override the President's veto then rests with Congress. If an override vote is successful, the President should be legally obligated to cooperate with Congress. The President also should be permitted to exercise veto authority as a way to uphold the separation of powers for which a constitutional role was constructed. It is difficult to imagine a separation of powers in a Constitutional republic like the United States without a check available to the President. A constitutional check is not perfect but it is better than no constitutional check in the federal courts, which were established to provide a way to check on the powers of the President's administration.", "Approximately 27 million trips are taken on public transportation on an average day in the United States. Federal annual funding authorization in FY2016 for the public transportation program in the FAST Act is $12.2 billion, slightly less than the average of $12.6 billion provided since FY2016 (1st quarter). Other major programs for public transportation include State of Good Repair and Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The average increase in funding authorized ($12.2 billion per year) exceeds the average inflation rate in recent years (3% per year) and is a much higher amount than that provided before the FAST Act. Funding for public transportation programs may be shifted to (or \"flexed\" to) highway funds.", "Paid family leave is a benefit to workers on a range of family caregiving needs generally offered after a period of qualifying leave. These benefits are in direct contrast to...", "The report discusses widow beneficiaries of Social Security, the current rules for widow benefits, a review of the impact of widowhood on benefits for widows, which is not yet clear in most previous research, and the possible effects of widow benefits on program solvency and on distributions between widows, males, and females. The report provides policy proposals and their effects (positive and negative) on widow benefit access. The widow benefits are relatively small compared to the other Social Security benefits, yet a higher proportion of noninsured widows than of those eligible for benefits participate in the program. Widows contribute a significant portion of Social Security payroll taxes. Although not a significant source for Social Security revenue, widow benefits are large parts of its spending. A benefit for widows, or spousal benefits and survivor benefits, can help provide a foundation for a widow to provide for herself. When widowhood occurs, widows are generally the sole breadwinners in their households, leading to potential hardship for their children. Without spousal coverage, widowhood can result in reduced or lower Social Security benefits for those widows who rely on it. Moreover, without spousal benefits, widows likely face a higher cost for health care and can incur significant expenses for their children, depending on state child support systems. Widows are relatively little represented among Social Security recipients (and even less among the recipients of its benefits). However widowhood is a significant portion of a worker's experience, who may contribute payroll taxes at a young age. The report provides information about widow populations (e.g., employment during widowhood), widow beneficiary trends, and social security programs for widow beneficiaries. The purpose of the report is to update the Social Insurance Reform Agenda (SINA). The report is based primarily on data for 2019. The report discusses the widow population in both the childbearing and postreproductive years. The report then focuses on widow beneficiary trends, widow benefits, widow disability statistics, widow-headed households, widow employment histories, widow benefits paid during widowhood, and widow program costs. The research provides important insights into widow financial needs, access to benefits, and financial needs. Table and chart presentations, along with tabulated analyses of widow financial needs and widow program costs are presented. The widow benefit is a complex program, requiring the attention of policymakers, as well as health and financial professionals for their assistance. There have been numerous proposals for simplifying the program, and many are based on research and analysis. More research is needed on a variety of topics, such as the effects of the widow benefit on program costs, the impact of spousal benefits on the recipient's benefits, the widow's current financial condition and the widow's access to health insurance. Widows of childbearing age are not well researched, and their particular employment and finances are not well studied in the research, despite their critical role in caregiving. For example, widows of childbearing age have been shown to face more health issues than those women with biological children (Walsh et al., 2016; Hecker, et al., 2008), and those widows are more likely to live in poverty (Walsh et al., 2016). The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been collecting extensive widow data since 1980. The widow data are especially difficult to find because the data were first collected from the Survey of Current and Former Federal Employees, the Health and Retirement Transition Cost Survey (HRS-III), and the American Community Survey. With these three surveys, the SSA has been collecting data on various aspects of widowhood, including age, education, employment, health, and economic security. The most recent data, the Health and Retirement Transitions Cost Survey\u00e2\u00a2 (HRET\u00e2\u00a2 ) collected data in 2018 and was completed in 2013. The HRET\u00c2\u00a2 survey collected much detailed data that is not often researched regarding widows. According to research based upon the HRET\u00c2\u00a2 data (Walsh et al., 2016), the prevalence of (current) female heads of households varies from 17\u00e2\u00a2 to 21\u00c2\u00a2 of the widowed. Older widowed women tend to be poorer, more dependent on spousal benefits of deceased spouse, and are less likely to have a paycheck income. In general, there is less information available about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment status than about the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial status. Most widows, both childbearing and nongrowing, are employed workers. Social Security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefits, called the survivor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefit, are the smallest of the Social Security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefits, which explains why only 7\u00c2\u00a2 of Social\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income comes from widow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefits (Walsh et al., 2016). One reason may be that widow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefit recipients are less likely to enroll in private health insurance coverage, which can result in more limited benefits for their health care and", "The Small Business Finance Access to Capital Act would amend the U.S. Air Force Assistance Act to allow for-profit small business owners from LMI communities to access SBA funding. Additionally, H.R. 2158 and", "This text describes the text: Congress plays an overarching role in shaping outdoor recreation throughout the nation through legislation and oversight, as well as support for recreation on nonfederal lands through several programs. BEA has developed the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) from various data and methods to report the size of outdoor recreation and its contribution to the economy. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Department of Commerce, in coordination with the agencies of the Federal Recreation Council, to continue to refine the account and to report on the feasibility of identifying amounts allocated by the federal government to recreation efforts. BEA prepares the ORSA statistics as required by the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act, measuring outdoor recreation and the broader economy. Activities that generate a broad view of outdoor recreation can be combined to generate a BROAD view of the ORSA.", "The federal government supports the charitable sector through tax deductions and tax exemptions to provide organizations with financial support. However, a tax revision in late 2017 made certain adjustments that will diminish support for charitable organizations, even though nonreligious organizations continued to receive the tax benefits. As charitable organizations rely on the tax benefits, they must account for possible changes in law when their tax-exempt status could change. The report provides a discussion of tax SUMMARY tax deductions and tax exemptions, how the tax benefits can be changed, the effects of the changes on charitable organizations, and ways for charitable organizations to anticipate these changes. Tax-exempt organizations have several ways to be considered tax-exempt organizations, and the report describes these categories in detail. Each tax -exempt organization must file at least an annual Form 990. The report describes when tax-exempt organizations can expect to be requested for tax filing obligations, as well as the benefits for tax-exempt organizations to report certain details to Congress. Certain types of information that cannot be disclosed are listed, and the effects of these limitations on the organization's information are described in detail. Tax-exempt organizations must report their sources of income and deductions from income, such as the source of their property revenues. Property can include or be associated with the organizations' mission, including their land, buildings, and equipment (including vehicles). Property tax deductions are allowed for public purposes. Even with proper reporting, 501(c)(3) organizations could face substantial tax on their source tax deductions. This is possible to avoid in some tax cases, but tax-exempt organizations may have to take additional steps to achieve tax deductibility due to certain events, such as expenses of maintaining property during periods no rentals have been income (i.e., the period between the first year a property starts to lease and the first year that property actually starts rental collection). Charitable organizations file Form 990 at the end of the year. In the summary below, Form 990-PF is used. Charitable organizations must provide a copy of the filing. The Form 990 report also refers to the Form 990-T, required filing of organizations that are part of the organization of other tax-exempt organizations, such as hospitals and colleges. Forms 1099, 1099-A, and W-2 all are used for nonprofit organizations, and W- 9 also must be reported if a non-tax entity is involved. In addition, the report addresses the reporting requirements and changes enacted in late 2017 with the tax bill known as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA))....

Access to a range of financial products and services, such as banking accounts, credit reporting services, and short-term credit can help consumers build \u00e2\u00ac\u0080\u00ac\u008b financial well-being. In particular, consumers may benefit from access to fast and convenient payment mechanisms. Different barriers exist for some consumers, such as a lack of a co-signer or poor credit histories, which hinder their ability to build a credit profile and access affordable products and services. A lack of bank accounts and personal knowledge can also hinder financial inclusion.", "The rapid growth in digital technologies in recent years has created new opportunities for U.S. consumers and businesses, but also raised challenges and trade policy objectives. To assess the value added to real GDP by the digital economy, the BEA estimates the digital economy represented 21% of U.S. GDP and its real GDP growth as 2.8%. For 2017, the real value added growth of the digital economy accounted for 25% of the overall economy. The world's population of internet users now exceeds 3.2 billion people. Wireless access, mobile access, and home access all have grown. One study projects this growth continuing, indicating approximately 75% of U.S. households use wired internet, 71% use mobile access, and 57% of adults in 2018 ownership of a smartphone. According to one BEA estimate, the digital economy, not just e-commerce or content, but its overall value-added growth contributed $1.9 trillion to real GDP in 2017 and $3.47 trillion in 2017, accounting for 25% of the overall economy. In 2017 there were 5.1 million jobs related to the digital economy, creating 3.3% of the U.S. workforce. From the inception of the internet in the late 1990s, global cross-border data flows have continued to evolve into a platform for new digitally-originated services in areas such as finance, advertising, and communications. The rise of the platform economy is transforming trade as businesses rely more on digital transactions, leading to new trade considerations, including data security, intellectual property enforcement, and trade policy. With a global emphasis on new technologies and business practices, the digital economy has contributed to an almost $10 trillion increase in global GDP from 1992, compared with GDP growth of 2.8% for the U.S. economy from 2009-2017. As cross-border data flows have increased worldwide, businesses are relying more on the global data transmission to conduct operations. Since 2000 data and intellectual property flows via cross-border transactions have grown from $1 trillion to $2.47 trillion in 2017. Trade policy objectives and rules for the digital economy have become intertwined. In recent years, countries have been increasingly negotiating on cross-border data flows as well as on access to certain intellectual property rights, leading to a rise in cross-border technology trade agreements. The USMCA, which President Trump is proposing to replace NAFTA, includes cross-border data flows among the categories of data that would be impacted by the new agreements. The text of this report may be accessed in the USGFO website. Figure 1 shows, in graph form, the digital economy, real-world GDP (excluding e-commerce), and e-commerce GDP (e-commerce transactions) from 2000-2017. In 2017, the real world U.S. GDP was $3.47 trillion compared with GDP of $2.08 trillion in 2000, and $1.6 trillion (excluding purchases of e-commerce items and $10.07 trillion) compared with GDP of $300 billion in 2000 (2000 data from BEA). In 2017, there were $1.4 billion in U.S. e-commerce transactions (excluding purchases on credit cards) compared with $2.6 billion in 2000. (See Figure 1 for details). In 2017, the real world U.S. GDP was $3.3 trillion compared with $2.1 trillion in 2000, and $1.3 trillion (excluding purchases of e-commerce items) compared with U.S. GDP in 2000. In 2000, the USGFO published a study titled The New Digital Economy: Measuring the Impact of the Internet on Employment in the United States. The study found that, the first decade of the twentieth century, productivity gains were attributed to new technologies and process streamlining resulting in lower costs. The U.S. Trade Commission, International Trade Commission and Bureau of Labor Statistics all report on new technology trade categories, most commonly, non-software trade in 2016, accounting for a little over 19% of all U.S. exports. The International Trade Commission reports on new technology exports in 2017, accounting for around 13.6% of U.S. exports in 2017. Most recently, in 2017, new technology exports made up less than 1% of U.S. exports. Over the last decade, the trade with China has tripled as trade with China in 2016 surpassed exports from Canada and Brazil. With a surge in goods made in China and China-made goods exported to the U.S., U.S. exports to China totaled $140", "In August 2019, there was one new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 3,100 cases and over 2,100 deaths had been reported as of September 24, 2019. Cases were concentrated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where long-standing conflicts had already caused a protracted humanitarian crisis and are complicating Ebola control efforts. The current outbreak coincided with a fraught political transition process in DRC. More than two-dozen Ebola cases were reported in Tanzania, leading to a scramble for resources between health authorities in Africa and in Geneva. Vaccination supplies were provided, but testing and treatment were not yet available as of September 21. KEYWORDS: World Health Organization; Democratic Republic of Congo; Ebola.", "The Small Business Administration administered several programs to support small businesses, including direct disaster loan programs to assist in recovery from natural disasters; loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist in business formation and expansion; and contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting. Congressional attention on the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program was initiated after Congress passed the CARES Act, providing $349 billion in loan guarantees and subsidies to assist businesses in affected areas and $3.4 million in loan advance disbursements to assist small businesses. The CARES Act also established an Office of Inspector General (OIG) in the SBA and provided $25 million to the SBA's Office of Small Business Information (OSBI). Small businesses adversely affected by COVID-19 received an additional $20 million for SBA disaster assistance administrative expenses and were deemed eligible for SBA disaster loans administered through private banks, credit union, or community development financial institutions (CDFIs). In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, 5,000 lenders were authorized to provide SBA disaster loans. SBA disaster loans were disbursed at a pace of $150.8 million per week. Within two months, the SBA administered over $1.9 billion in loans to nearly 1.5 million small businesses. A summary of the CARES Act's small business provisions is presented in Appendix A. Most of the loans were for less than $150,000, with grants for businesses that experienced catastrophic economic impacts totaling $9.5 billion. The SBA, which stopped accepting new applications for EIDLs on April 15, reported that more than 1.66 million grants totaling $2.92 billion had been dispersed. Of those grants, business loans totaling more than $3.4 billion were approved for small businesses, sole proprietors, and self-employed individuals. SBA disaster loans also were disbursed to non-profit organizations, small businesses, and private businesses. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided an additional $17 billion for SBA disaster loans, administered through private non-bank CDFIs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SBA was authorized to waive payroll costs for small business employers and expand their ability to offer loans for business expenses. During the pandemic to date, banks administered more than $1 billion in payroll costs loans to small, mostly small-employer clients (typically less than 100 employees). Loan repayment would be repaid over a 30-year period at 2.75% with a 10-year deferred repayment feature. Loan interest and fees have been deferred up to three months, subject to repayment after 10 years. SBA is also waiving payroll costs payroll costs for small business employer-employee pairings. Borrowers repay the payroll costs in installments for up to 12 months. Business expenses and other current liabilities can be provided for up to $25,000 per borrower, as well  as up to $10 million loan forgiveness for payroll costs. SBA was authorized under the CARES Act to expand their ability to offer loans to entrepreneurs who may not qualify using traditional SBA lending practices. New SBA loans are available to small, sole proprietors, self-employed individuals, and small businesses that are experiencing catastrophic economic hardship resulting from COVID-19-related losses. The loans carry an interest rate of 1% to a loan repayment term of 30 years. Interest is waived up to 3 months of deferred payment. SBA is also authorizing up to $25 million to the SBA's Office of Inspector General (OSBI) (previously known as the Office of Small Business Information (OSBI)). The loans are administered through SBA's Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA). The ODA is administering loans for costs for the SBA disaster assistance and loans-for-working capital to 6,000 small businesses in all 50 states. No other loan or credit assistance is available during the pandemic, except for loans to support working inventory or payroll for businesses that qualify for relief under the federal disaster loan program. The SBA loan program is expected to be provided to over 100,000 businesses in response to COVID-19. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency relief package passed by Congress, business interruption loans, which are SBA guaranteed loans, are available to help businesses that have been affected by COVID-19. Loans up to $2 million are available to businesses on a \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d basis. The maximum loan amount is based on the borrower's total debt, and loans are covered up to 90 percent. Payments are deferred from 10 months to 4 years. Nonprofits are eligible to participate in the emergency loan program. The SBA declared the coronavirus pandemic as a natural disaster on March 13, 2020, and the $50 billion Coronavirus Relief Act", "The flag code regulates the display, misuse, and handling of the flag with respect to all public and private property of the United States; the text details the guidelines for display, misuse, and handling. These include prohibitions of flag use after sunset or on polling days, flag display at public libraries, proper handling of flagstaffs, and more specific regulations based on locations, times, and occasions for flag use. While the Flag Protection Act was struck down as unconstitutional on free speech grounds, all other state and federal laws governing flag display or abuse have been constitutionally upheld. KEY ISSUES: Free speech, flag codes, flag misuse, flag display, flag protest, flagpole misuse. LEGAL ANALYSIS: First Amendment right to express a genuine belief that the U.S. flag is improper, even with no physical acts. Flag misuse (\"a flag may be displayed at night when it would be visible to passer-bys\"). Flag display on polling days may violate the establishment clause. Flagpole misuse is also a free speech issue. No federal laws prohibit displaying the U.S. flag at night for ceremonial or expressive purposes. No federal U.S. flag misuse law can override the state laws that pertain to specific aspects of flag display. FLAGS IN THE NEWS: In Spence v. Washington, a student faced felony and misdemeanor charges. She was convicted despite arguing that her speech constituted free speech. A flag was involved in the case of Stree v. New York. STUPID QUIP: The Flag Code is a federal law that governs the public display, misuse, and handling of the flag that has been around for three centuries. In Stree v. New York, the Supreme Court found laws similar to the Flag Code in several state and local laws (and on some Web sites).", "The 1868 rules regarding trial procedures by a set of U.S. Senate impeachment rules were created in 1868 and are in place today (even though impeachment has ceased to be the norm since 1973). The House Rules Committee reported to Congress in its view that the Senate trial process is an archaic way to bring a judicial branch judge to civil trial. It appears that Senators at each end of the spectrum of modern judicial proceedings and its place in their work and in the Constitution itself, have reached a consensus. The Senate trial does not require a juror or jury; the Senate, composed of all 100 Senators, acts as prosecutors, judging and removing federal officials at the federal level above those (like State Governors and mayors). The Senate Judiciary Committee, however, conducts its own inquiry of every impeachment trial in an effort to provide that the process of impeachment should be timely, clear, and in the interest of justice for the people, especially when it has been absent from civil trial practice for over 200 years.\nDate of Report October 18, 2013", "The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, fiscal year 2020 (P.L. 116-7) provides a reportable amount of about $6.4 billion.

TANF also provides funds to states for a variety of work-focused assistance and family services. The major TANF issues discussed in this report include the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which established a block grant of $1.45 billion to each state to use over a year to provide additional TANF/ADC-like benefits to eligible families to meet basic needs; the TANF goals of reducing dependency, providing adequate child care and health care benefits to ensure stability in the home unit, and promoting self-reliance and goal-setting; and uses of TANF funds on child services and family-based programs. Funding legislation for the 2011 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) included a provision, beginning in FY12, to provide additional funding to states to be used for TANF/ADC-like benefits and other work initiatives. Current use of TANF funds in each state, how many families have received assistance, assistance as a share of state government spending, and state TANF budgets have been discussed, in addition to changes in the TANF/ADC budget since the signing of ARRA. Funding, the duration of state grants, and funding of the Child Development Accounts (CDA) program, which is included in ARRA, continue to be part of TANF discussions. The 109th Congress also has considered ARRA and, in addition, a proposal to raise TANF benefits, such topics are debated.\nPermanent link on this page\nRead this report offline and with a PDF viewer from these\nreliable sources.\n...", "-- Congress-- and--the federal agency making the grant-in-aid---to categorize.

Hypersonic weapons pose potential threats to countries that are developing or have hypersonic weapons. 1. Hypersonic Weapon System Overview a. Definition of Hypersonic Weapons: The term \"hypersonic\" was coined in 1959 by British aeronautical engineer J. H. Chapman. It describes a missile that flies above Mach 5. The missile can then glide to a target, and sometimes use its high-speed engines to maneuver in the air after launch. The missile is guided using GPS, and sometimes radar, and it is designed to be very fast to reach its target before it falls back onto Earth. An \"open source\" approach means that the information is publicly available, but if an adversary knows where a system is located, a person can be killed before the missiles can be destroyed. (1) Hypersonic Missile Definition b. Hypersonic System Definition: Hypersonic programs include the development of glide vehicles, propulsion vehicles (solid fuel or hybrid designs), and launcher systems. These are used to transport heavy payloads into highly-specific trajectories for tactical military operations. Hypersonic missiles are designed to fly at hypersonic speeds and are highly classified. (2) Hypersonic Missile Definition c. HGV Classification: A hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) is a rocket-launched \"booster\" that launches a pre-loaded glide vehicle. A \"booster\" adds fuel and weight to the missile, and is necessary to lift the pre-loaded glide vehicle to cruising altitudes before gliding to their target. The booster rocket also provides a means of guiding the glide vehicle to the target during flight. (3) Hypersonic Missile Definition d. Solid Fueled Propulsion: Hypersonic Missiles are built of several types of material including solid fueled rockets. This type of missile is one that will be used in future hypersonic missions. These missile systems are designed \"on-the-fly\" using computers to calculate trajectory and course corrections. (4) Hypersonic Missile Definition e. Ballistic Missile Definition: A ballistic rocket is an object which is launched from a ground base or from a ship. When the rocket hits the target (high-density altitude and high-speed \"freefall\"), the rocket begins to disassemble or burn with a tremendous explosion. (5) Ballistic Missile Definition f. Air Launched Ballistic Missile Definition f. Slingshot Missile Definition g. Scud Missiles: The Scud missile family is based on a solid fuel engine used to create a powerful, explosive warhead. The ballistic trajectory of the missile is a single, shorted trajectory through the atmosphere to target that of the impact location (ease of targeting). (6) Air Launched Ballistic Missile Defense g. HGV Definition h. HGV/CXV Definition and Requirements: Some hypersonic technologies are still early stage. While a HGV is not used in combat until its system design is complete based on an operational capability, a developmental HGV can be used in combat to simulate a full-scale launch of a larger missile. The HGV system is considered a \"booster-plus\" approach because it requires more than one type of rocket or system to actually land and launch a warhead. The resulting complexity must be balanced against the capability and cost of such a system. A missile, like a cruise missile, can be a \"stand-alone\" system launched from a ground-based launcher or launched from an airborne platform (heavier, more expensive to transport). (7) CXV Definition c. JAGAR Missile Definition: A JAGAR (YAG/CXV) missile is one that is used as a booster to high-speed glide vehicles (HGPVs) in order to launch a larger missile. The upper stage rocket has its own propulsion system in order to ensure its safe launch without any risk to the HGPV. JAGAR missile definition is the name applied to missile systems containing a propulsion-carrying rocket in the upper section and also a rocket motor in the lower section of its guidance system. (8) JAGAR Missile Definition d. JAGAR System: The JAGAR system developed for the Air Force in order to replace the existing MIG 24 (A-10) gunship or fighter aircraft is the JAGAR Family of Weapon Systems. Based on an HGPV system (as shown), JAGAR systems include a hypersonic missile, ballistic rocket, rocket motor and launcher to launch the missile. Although JAGAR systems are now classified, the USAF conducted a live firing of an unclassified \u00e2\u02dc\u00b0", "There have been concerns about the prescription of prescription drugs to individuals without known conditions to treat. A survey to find the number of prescriptions by state and by state population reported that the proportion ranged from 10% in Arkansas to 80% in Rhode Island. The study analyzed the 9,000 prescriptions of the prescription drug Levopepone for the treatment of chronic pain caused by spasticity. Levopepone is typically prescribed to treat the conditions spasticity, pain, and muscle spasms caused by ALS. Levopepone has been prescribed to \u00e2\u0080\u00a2%\u00e2\u00ca of the population.

A variety of sizes and types of solar systems are suitable to fit a range of needs. The systems' capacity ranges from tens of meawatts (MW) to hundreds of megawatts (MW), typically installed for commercial or industrial purposes. System components have evolved to include modules, inverters, storage units, BOS, and more types of equipment as a result of falling costs. With the increasing efficiency of solar power systems, electricity generated by solar installations has become a significant alternative to electricity from conventional fossil fuel-powered sources, leading to a drop in the cost of installation. This growth has created new segments, including residential-scale systems that are easy to own and operate, while utility-scale solutions are more common for larger electricity generation needs. As solar panels technology advances and costs drop, renewable power systems will become even more ubiquitous in the future. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), solar energy generation has grown by more than 100 percent in the year 2018 and is expected to continue growing, accounting for a 5.8 percent share of the country's electric power generation in In addition, the solar industry is also expected to create jobs and produce economic outputs in local communities as solar energy projects are developed. The solar power market is expected to grow at a slightly negative rate of -0.8 percent per year from 2018-2022, mostly driven by declining prices of solar modules and systems, according to the DOE. The market size could approach a U.S. Department of Education estimate that U.S. solar installations (excluding the military) will generate nearly 6 million megawatt hours (MWh) by 2022, compared to 0.5 MWh as of the end of 2016. The report forecasts that there will be approximately 25.88 GW of new solar power capacity installed globally by the end of 2022, a number that 30 + 10 = is equivalent to five percent of the United States' power grid. The U.S. is one of the top countries with this fast- growing renewable energy market, which is expected to be worth $1.8 trillion by the end of 2022. In line with the rapidly expanding solar power market, the solar industry is expected to create direct payroll, business revenues, and indirect taxes and investment. The solar industry will have U.S. military support and solar power technology will be used on several military bases, further boosting its growth. The solar industry also expects to create 800,000 new jobs in the U.S. by 2030. The government benefits through reduced energy bills, and households in solar neighborhoods contribute to the decline in non-renewable energy costs. In countries such as Germany, solar PV systems are also becoming a popular solution for home energy and smaller businesses. The largest market for 2007 PV technology, still by far the most expensive, is Germany. In its 2018 International Energy Roadmap to 2030 report, the World Resources Institute (WRI), notes that solar power costs (capital costs per watt) have decreased in most countries, especially in China and India, but are still relatively high in Western Europe compared to some developing-country markets. The WRI's International Solar Photovoltaic Price Declining Index (the \"IPPV Index\") fell in 2018, following a slow-down in solar power growth, with the total index declining by 1.7 percent.

In February, the agency submits to Congress a detailed annual work plan for the current fiscal year (typically in 7 months, from October through the end of September). The plan details the agency's projects and funding for the fiscal year. These projects are often considered \"out\" of the annual appropriation process until either the President's request or congressional action on a supplemental appropriation bill resolves them. The actual date on which the fiscal request is transmitted to Congress varies based on the fiscal cycle, the President's budget submission, and congressional action. Most projects, including military construction and water resources projects, require both Presidential and congressional authorization, and Congress and the Army Corps also coordinate a wide range of project designs, construction milestones, and monitoring and management procedures.

"The Supreme Court explained the \u201cpresumption against preemption\u201d as a general principle that can be derived from various aspects of the Court's preemption jurisprudence, including its text, structure, and purpose. A key factor in the preemption analysis is the \u201csavings clause\u201d provision, as this language must be balanced against the intent clause. A key factor in the preemption analysis is the \u201csavings clause\u201d provision, as this language must be balanced against the intent clause. When a federal statute contains conflicting provisions, the Court may apply a presumption against preemption that is designed to protect federal agencies while still allowing the law to preempt state law. Although Congress has expressed an intent to supplant some state law, federal preemption law also requires judicial to consider various other factors to determine whether this intent is consistent with federal law. A key factor in the preemption analysis is the \u201c\u201csavings clause\u201d provision, which creates an exception or \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain express preemption cases that allow state law to take effect even in the face of federally imposed regulations. The Court has traditionally interpreted the \u201csavings clause\u201d language as meaning that a particular category of state law must be \u201cunobstructed,\u201d but that the statute can nonetheless regulate an additional category of state law. In one case, the preemption issue was resolved by a simple textual analysis; another was resolved in a case involving preemption analysis on the \u201csaving clause\u201d provision itself. Another case considered judicial interpretations of terms commonly used in a type of preemption analysis now called \u201c\u201cfield\u201d preemption. Finally, one case featured a discussion of an often-overlooked factor in federal preemption, the \u201c\"practical effects\" test. Other factors in the preemption analysis include the type of government regulation involved, the nature of the case before the Court (commercial or administrative), and differing levels of state autonomy among the two levels of government. The Court's preemption jurisprudence is one in which preemption law can seem complicated and even contradictory. The central debate over federal preemption is whether federal law should have a more or less robust role in state law based on whether this law preempts or does not preempt state law. A central concern in the Court's preemption jurisprudence is whether government agencies or \u201cother\u201d federal entities can pursue their own goals independent of Congress and whether Congress intended such conduct as permitted or forbidden. For example, the Court has held that federal agencies must be \"generally\" or \"constitutionally\" obligated to follow court decision. The Court has also found that federal courts can review the specific regulatory decisions of federal agencies to determine whether they preempt state law or not. In one case, the Court held Congress \"unconstrued\" when it failed to respond to petitioners' argument that state law should not be preempted even after several state courts had held otherwise. The Court also held that a separate preemption analysis with respect to state law (\u201c field preemption\u201d) is a useful way for courts to determine whether state courts have read too much or too little into their preemption findings. Finally, in one case, the Court held that Congress \"intentional error\" in its statutory language when it enacted a provision limiting preemption. Although there is a basic presumption that federal law should preempt state law in specific areas, the Court has found that this presumption is not \"explicit\" in every particular situation. The Court also found a lack of clarity whether or not federal agencies and \"other\" federal entities could still conduct independent nonconstitutional, nonpreemptively-related projects under state law. Several cases have involved language in which the Court held that federal law might be preempted and the Court did not yet know whether it can be implemented, or whether an agency would act in an impermissible manner until an agency has an opportunity to review a particular state law. Although the court holds that federal courts can have the ultimate power to review federal agencies and other federal entities, the Court has traditionally expressed caution in doing so because of the likelihood that Congress will be offended. In this regard, the Court has found several times that Congress intended to permit states to create a private cause of action even in the face of a federal law prohibiting a suit. The report discusses how the federal courts have dealt with such questions, including the \u201cstatutory presumption and \"field preemption\u201d analysis. Finally, the report discusses what the legal landscape looks like in the current regulatory regime in which state law plays a much more prominent role than had traditionally been the case. Field preemption - this is preemption against state law while there clearly is a federal law at stake. This is an easier test for courts to be applied in a regulatory analysis. 12/07/09 Page 2\nPreemption has a \"long history in the United States,\" with early cases dating back to the", ". 1,000 HHS operating divisions.. $158 billion in mandatory funding for the Social Security Administration administered by HHS.. $56 billion for Title X family planning program administered by HHS.. $38 billion provided by HHS for Community Health Center Fund administered by Congress.

It also provides a review of the history of fiscal policy, and a summary of recent evidence of current fiscal policies. In this analysis, the report presents a discussion of what options may be available when countercyclical fiscal policies are implemented, how their potential impact can be estimated, and a description of some of the options that Congress may have during an economic recession. The report concludes with a brief discussion of what the country's long-run budget outlook is, where the economy should be headed in response to fiscal policy, and what fiscal action can take place in a downturn.\nThe countercyclical fiscal policy options available to Congress can be summarized as follows: [1] short-term tax and spending adjustments to stimulate the economy, [2] targeted, temporary assistance to income-sensitive households, [3] direct spending or investments in infrastructure, energy, or other sectors, [4] immediate temporary tax relief or refundable tax credits, [5] accelerated depreciation on business and certain types of property, [6] increased business tax incentives, [7] and [8] targeted tax relief. The appropriate tool for consideration depends on two factors - the size and type of fiscal action Congress may choose to undertake, and the time frame required. Most fiscal actions can be considered in the short term (\\less than three years) or the medium term (\"five to ten years\"), although a few longer-term actions for long-term fiscal sustainability purposes may be necessary.\nThe report also summarized recent economic research on the effects of fiscal policies. On the revenue side, fiscal policies can help stabilize demand and stimulate the economy through investment in infrastructure. There are a few fiscal actions that economists feel are more tax friendly for short term purposes. However, on the spending side, no fiscal actions are typically tax-friendly. Rather, spending can be short-term targeted and tax-subsidized or long-term tax-driven. Short-term fiscal actions usually take the form of temporary tax relief, such as the expiration of certain specific tax cuts, accelerated depreciation tax cuts, or increased business tax incentives. Long-term fiscal actions typically involve tax revenues or spending obligations, in that the government borrows money to finance its activities. The report concluded by stating that the nation's long-term budget outlook is generally positive, although policymakers have to face possible challenges in balancing the deficit and the economy's fiscal growth, as well as challenges in addressing the long-term effects of a slowing economy.\nCongress could decide to enact specific fiscal actions to counteract current economic growth. Short-term fiscal actions typically take the form of temporary tax relief or accelerated depreciation on businesses' assets. Longer-term fiscal actions could arise from initiatives on infrastructure, energy, or other sectors. The most efficient tool for Congress to consider for this purpose depends on one of two factors - short or long-term effects. Most fiscal actions should be considered in the short term (under three years), while long-term fiscal actions may be necessary for the United States' long-term fiscal sustainability.\nThe nation's long-term fiscal budget outlook would be positive if policymakers were able to enact short-term tax and spending adjustments to stimulate economic growth and offset the declining tax base from a shrinking labor base. The fiscal actions taken most frequently by the government to counteract negative economic growth would include short-term tax and spending adjustments. Long-term fiscal actions for the country's long-term fiscal budget outlook would be needed to stabilize the economy. Congress would consider such options as accelerated depreciation on business and certain types of property and immediate tax relief on certain income-sensitive households, short-term tax and spending adjustments, and other options such as increased business tax relief.\nIn addition to long-term tax and fiscal options, Congress could consider \"near term\" fiscal policies, such as infrastructure spending, energy tax incentives, and tax benefits for business investment. Short-term spending may also take the form of emergency funding.\nThe current near term fiscal outlook is favorable, but policymakers face challenges as well in the long-term. The nation has become increasingly debt-heavy during the post-World War II period, and policymakers will continue to be challenged in finding ways to balance their budget in the wake of this. In addition\nCongress would consider whether their tax and spending policies could be used to encourage the nation's long-term economic expansion. The report also identified three potential economic benefits of the 1993 Taxpayer Relief Act (TEA) that Congress could apply to the upcoming crisis, provided that the \"fiscal cliff\" and related fiscal actions could be avoided.\nThe fiscal outlook, which is subject to significant uncertainties, may be favorable. In particular, the United States' long-term budget outlook is generally positive when the public debt is compared to their economic output", "The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) authorizes various options for qualifying individuals including repayment flexibilities and administrative actions. Several pre-existing options including periods of deferment, income-driven repayment plans offer temporary relief. Specific administrative measures include the COVID/HELP program and automatic payment deferral offered in the CARES Act. The HEA authorizes certain administrative actions and repayment flexibilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in some previous natural disasters. Table and data tables provide more detailed information on these options. This report is a follow-up to the 2016 Report on the Higher Education Financial Condition of U.S. Families. This report was produced by the Economic Research Service (ER-11) to address a specific need identified by the Committee on Economic and Social Affairs (CESA) of the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Response and Economic Recovery as part of a request by the Chairman of the House Committee of Education and Labor. This report provides information that was presented to the House Committee of Education and Labor on April 29, 2020, as well as relevant information from prior reports. The updated and additional information includes the student loan repayment flexibilities and administrative actions for which the report was prepared. This report also provides data to which the current COVID-19 relief payments are applicable. As of December 31, 2019, there are approximately 42.8 million individuals, including 7.2 million students, who were borrowers of student loans under the higher education (HEA) under the HEA; as ofDecember 31, 2020, there is approximately 4.1 million student loan borrowers under title VII-E. ED has more than $1.3 trillion in outstanding loans, making federal student loans the largest category of outstanding consumer debt in the U.S. In FY 2020, ED processed 6.2 million borrower financial statements, which is slightly less than the prior year. By year, the number of student loans declined from 2019. The number of loans has reached the peak in the FY since 2015 after a sustained and relatively stable decrease. Student loan issuance increased from FY 2017-18, but for the third year in a row, the number of loans decreased somewhat. In FY 2020, the Department of Education processed approximately 6.5 million applications; and, the total number of applications increased from previous years. Total loan applications declined in FY 2020. In FY 2020, the total number of student loan applications decreased slightly, but there were still 1.2 million applications. There were fewer applications overall, but more applications in FY 2020 than in FY 2019. Student loan repayments have been declining in recent years, which is consistent with the trend of declining student loan issuance. By FY 2020, the average student loan balance has decreased from FY 2019 levels and there has been an overall decrease in the number of loan repayment months (FY 2020 is less than prior years). Total loan repayments in FY 2022 increased by $13.6 billion when compared to FY 2021. 13,000 direct loans that could receive these pandemic-based actions through a borrower request using the Student Aid App.", "This report summarizes Division A of the appropriations bill H.R. 116-123. Funds appropriated in that division are used to assist countries at the beginning and/or the middle of a pandemic, with resources directed toward prevention, preparation for, and response activities. Funds are provided through multiple federal agencies, including HHS. For additional detailed information on these appropriations and several others of interest (including ones related to the pandemic response), see the \"Coronavirus Appropriations\" section of this report.\nFunds appropriated in Division A of the Coronavirus Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-123 ) are disbursed to a number of federal agencies, with funds further broken down by account, program, or activity. Additionally, the table displays which program accounts are further broken down into U.S. government (U.S.), state or local (state or local), national, and global. For purposes of this report, in the section for a federal funding program or activity (\"USG\"), it also displays whether it is a domestic (U.S.) or worldwide purpose. Funding totals $12 billion in Division B of P.L. 116-123 for health emergency response activities related to COVID-19. Division B is organized with funds further broken down into categories for COVID-19 pandemic-related funding, including $5.9 billion in funding for telehealth services, $1.5 billion in emergency funding for U.S.-based testing and treatment facilities, $2 billion in funding to promote research on and domestic development of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, and $7 billion for global pandemic response activities. Division B also includes funding for a program that will provide technical assistance on COVID-19 pandemic response and global pandemic response. Additionally, Division B includes funding for the HHS's global pandemic pandemic response program, which provides global pandemic pandemic response funding, global pandemic laboratory infrastructure and clinical testing laboratories funding to improve domestic health supply chain capacities, and global pandemic pandemic vaccine clinical trials.\nDivision A of P.L. 116-123 provides a total of $61 million to FDA for domestic and international efforts (\"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus\") to be used for a number of medical countermeasures (including development of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics), development of advanced manufacturing processes and capabilities for medical product supply chain continuity, and related administrative activities. This includes funding for the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Antimicrobial Use and Epidemiology (OAUE) and the medical product supplier preparedness program. Funding for the Office of Antimicrobial Use and Epidemiology ($10.4 million) is a component of a $22.7 million program to support domestic and international influenza pandemic control strategies. The program also includes $10 million from P.L. 116-123 for FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Use and Epidemiology to \"Develop, evaluate, and implement strategies on antimicrobial resistance and use as a national policy.\" Funding for the Office of Antimicrobial Use and Epidemiology is further broken down, with $11.7 million for research with a U.S. supplier network. This includes $5 million for the Office of Antimicrobial Use and Epidemiology to assess U.S. suppliers of medical countermeasures for COVID-19 on supply shortfalls. Funding also includes $5.4 million to support FDA's \"Strategic Program Management Platform for Antimicrobial Resistance and Product Stewardship.\" In addition, $8 million in P.L. 116-123 is allocated to the National Pandemic Influenza Response Fund to support the development of COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic drugs (e.g., antivirals or antibiotics) and diagnostic tools. Of the $61.1 billion appropriated in P.L. 116-123, a small portion of which can be obligated without congressional authorization in the case of emergency pandemic pandemics, a total of $7 billion could be obligated for COVID-19 preparedness and response measures, including COVID-19 public health emergency activities and research. The funding is also further broken down, with over half of it directed toward public health and laboratory-based testing. The funding for COVID-19 public health and laboratory-based testing is further broken down into sub-categories by funding line and administrative account. For COVID-19 public health activities, $8.7 billion is authorized for FDA's pandemic pandemic health laboratory infrastructure and clinical trials program. FDA is also authorized to spend up to $100 million each year from 2021-2025 under authority for that division from P.L. 116-123. In addition, $6.5 billion in P.L. 116-123 is allotted for COVID-19 pandemic medical products and services (COVID-19 MPS), including a total $50 million within that appropriation for COVID", "The FBI and CDC face significant hurdles implementing virtual-based request processing as COVID-19 prompts agencies to rapidly adapt to provide responsive information, FOIA requesters see little relief. Some agencies and their FOIA contacts have embraced telework arrangements and virtual-based communication, while the FOIA process also allows for remote access to records. Agencies are generally finding ways to cope with unprecedented requests and processing backlog, with some opting to prioritize their processing efforts based on the urgency of requests and which requesters are more critical. In light of the pandemic, some agencies have made modifications to their FOIA practices, focusing on information that can most easily be produced electronically. Still, challenges remain, as agencies face limitations in operating with a significant proportion of employees working remotely and access issues arising when electronic technology systems are relied heavily due to these circumstances. In addition, due to the complex nature of the FOIA, many agencies are finding that the process of identifying a person's or entity's eligibility for certain documents or records, including the request for a disclosure log, must now be considered in greater depth, particularly as agencies face challenges implementing virtual procedures. This report concludes that the FOIA continues to experience a variety of challenges, including remote access to records and the limitations posed by large numbers of requests made during a pandemic. Most agencies are actively assessing ways to better adapt to this situation. As agencies confront significant requests, processes for locating records, assessing the requests' exigent circumstances, and determining which records can be released are each complex and need to be reevaluated. This report concludes that the FOIA continues to experience a variety of challenges, particularly remote access to records and limitations posed by large numbers of requests, during the pandemic. Most agencies are actively assessing ways to adapt to this situation. Agencies need to reevaluate the FOIA processes and procedures, identify gaps in the law, and decide which records can be released as technology has evolved. FOIA continues to experience significant hurdles, including remote access to records, large numbers of requests, and challenges adapting to this situation. Agencies need to evaluate the FOIA processes and procedures, identify gaps in the law, and decide which records can be released as technology has evolved. The FOIA has undergone significant changes, with agencies now focusing on information that can be produced electronically. Still, challenges remain, particularly due to the complexity of the process of identifying eligibility requesters, as well as the unprecedented number of requests in light of the pandemic. Most agencies are reassessing FOIA processes and procedures during this unprecedented time. Agencies may need to adapt policies and processes to better operate during the pandemic. FOIA does not guarantee a timely response to requesters. Agencies need to provide appropriate time frames and reasons for denailing FOIA requests. In light of pandemic impact and the challenges of remote processing, agencies may need to temporarily provide a limited set of work duties. Still, agencies should strive to maintain good relations with requesters. Agencies' processes for locating documents have become streamlined, particularly with the rise of technology and electronic records. Agencies continue to update their policies to adapt to the current pandemic. Many agencies are adapting to remote work in order to process multiple requesters more quickly. Agencies should identify potential pitfalls in their FOIA processes and procedures. Agencies may need to provide guidance regarding the FOIA if requesters fail to identify themselves. Agencies have seen an increased number of FOIA requests, particularly during COVID-19. Agencies should analyze their FOIA processes to identify improvements and address gaps. The FOIA is still essential to federal agency functionality and processes for the majority of requesters remain straightforward. Agencies need to review their FOIA processes and communicate improvements to requesters. Agencies need to adapt their FOIA processes in light of changing circumstances. Agencies need to provide timeframes on work duties that they are not able to provide to requesters. Still, agencies need to continue to adapt in light of COVID-19-related tele-work and remote processing challenges to their FOIA processes. Agencies must provide guidance to requesters on how to identify themselves when they have a legitimate claim to protected records. Agencies in many federal agencies must update their FOIA processes to be able to properly process a new and unprecedented level of remote requests that they have encountered. Agencies' processing delays have become faster and more efficient due to the implementation of electronic technologies, but still do not meet the FOIA time standards. Agencies can better meet FOIA requests submitted by telephone or electronic format, although the implementation of phone or electronic response systems needs to be done more and more frequently. Agencies should adapt their processes to allow requesters to access information remotely on their own devices. Agencies need to continue to adapt their FOIA processes to meet challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to provide efficient access to records for requesters. Agencies must continue to communicate with requesters as quickly as possible, so that requesters may reasonably assume that requesters are receiving information timely. Agencies can expand their public outreach to assist requesters in navigating a pandemic. Agencies need to provide guidance to requesters on their rights in the pandemic. Agencies must communicate with", "The mission of HHS is to enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing effective health and human services and \u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a2 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6- \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 HHS Operating Divisions Two of the HHS operating divisions, specifically FDA (-$0B) and ATSDR (-$1B), did not receive their respective FY2019 funding requests \u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 \u00e2\u00a6 HHS will undergo a significant reduction in its FY2020 appropriation in terms of both mandatory funding (by about $10B) and discretionary funding (by about $16B).

The report provides a detailed analysis and includes numerous tables for the FY2020 budget request, its detailed shipbuilding plan, and the Navy's overall shipbuilding/procurement strategy. The Navy's current shipbuilding strategy requires that a proportion of the ships procured by the Navy under the FFG cost-option (1 ship out of the first 13) for which work for initial FFG(X) has been done. The Navy's 30-year ship force plan includes fewer than 10 ships that are specifically dedicated to serving in these ships; in contrast, the FFG(X) system is expected to be approximately 25 percent of the Navy's ship count in 2049, based on Navy documents. According to the report and Navy (LCS) that will be deployed with the LCS class. In the FFG(X) program, the Navy would contract at least two shipbuilding/procurement milestones, including the delivery of the first EF-TTD ship in FY22 and the delivery of the first (but not all) ship in the FFG(X) FY2036 shipbuilding schedule to be announced in FY22. The Navy has also taken steps to prepare the shipbuilding/procurement strategy. In December 2016, the Navy released a goal to achieve and maintain a Navy of 355 ships, where the SS (in contrast to the FFG) and LC (in contrast to the FFG) fleets would reach the same size. The Navy's 30-year ship force plan calls for 1) constructing 90 shipbuilding/procurement milestones in the Navy's FFG FY2020-FY2049 shipbuilding schedule; 2) constructing at least 25 ships to join the Navy's EF-TTD fleet (which replaces the 12 ships now in the Navy) by FY2049, after construction of an initial FFG(X) class; and 3) constructing an EF-TTD at times to supplant FFG to/from EF-TTD, through the entire shipbuilding/procurement schedule. The report summarizes the FFG(X) program's status as well as related Navy shipbuilding strategies, while focusing on broader Navy strategy and ship class management issues for Congress. The report includes a detailed Navy shipbuilding/procurement strategy for LCSs, the LCS program, the EF-UTF, and EF-FTF ship construction milestones. The report also includes a detailed Navy shipbuilding/procurement strategy for EF-TTDs. This report will also consider a broader Navy shipbuilding strategy, including the role of the SS and LC fleets, the LCR (long-range) LCS design, and the LSOF/WSOF ship. In its FY2020 request, the Navy estimates that 4-17 ships will still be \"EF-FTF\" (EFFCT) and 5-15 ships will be \"EF-UTF\" (EFFUT) due to the LCS design and the EF-FTF/LCA-FFG program schedule. The Navy's goal for EF-UTF is set at 13, and the Navy's goal for EF-FFT is set at 7. The Navy's goal for EF-FTF is 15. Finally, the Navy has set an objective of 17 EF-FTF ships in the Navy shipbuilding plan that was released in December 2016, which is based on the Navy's current EF-UTF design. The actual number of ships that ultimately will be EF-UTF will now be based on the number of EF-UTF ships that are procured. The Navy has expressed its desire to have at least four EF-UTFS enter the Navy's EF-UK class in the 2040s. Navy shipbuilding strategies include ship replacement for the SS, LCR, EF-UTF, and EF-FTF (LCC ) ship classes, FFG and EFFT classes, DDG (DDX) class, OTF ship in a joint effort with LCS and EFT, OLY (S) ship in a joint effort with LCS, and TCS ships.

UXO poses a danger to both combatants and civilians. Military munitions are used in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and it is difficult for users to tell the device was a dud, or it is firing as intended, or it is intended for use outside combat. The UXO challenge was first raised by Congress in 1954 and has never been satisfactorily addressed, but Congress has appropriated more than $415 million to the Department of State for international UXO clearance efforts over the past 63 years at both U.S. Agency for International Development and USAID 7 (USAID 4 is no longer a US federal entity). While this program had been curtailed from 2008 to 2015 and the number of injuries per year increased significantly, in 2016 Congress has provided $90 million over a three-year period ( 2017-2019) to the Department of State to use for UXO removal and clearance programs.

Each ESEA Title I-A program is listed below and the introductory text for each program in the annual report. 2019, $1.7 billion. This was the largest appropriation level for ESES.2 A total of 5,200 schools applied for the ESSSA and 14,000 students participated. The number of students was nearly double from those who applied for the ESSSA in 2015. In comparison, FY2016 appropriations for Title I, Part A included about $1 billion, compared to about $100 million in FY2016. In the ESSSA there is funding for 14,000 students. In FY2016 there is funding for 12,000 students. In the 2020 ESSSA, there has been funding for nearly double the number of students. There were about 6,000 students for the ESSSA in FY2016. In the 2020 ESSSA there are approximately 13,600 students enrolled. In FY2021 there would be funding for up to 25,000 students if the funding is authorized by Congress. Schools can apply for this program and students can participate. As long as schools are using the federal grant, this can provide a supplement to the state share of instructional costs, helping to provide access to a higher level of instruction. States can apply for grant funds for students with disabilities beginning in FY 2016. The state share can be used to supplement tuition and fees for colleges and universities attending students with disabilities. This is also applicable to postsecondary students. The grant amount per student is $6,200, for each high school student. In this report, the number of students included are based on the 2013-2014 school year data. This is an equivalent amount for each school year that the ESEA provided under \"Title I-A, Part A.\" In general, each state ESEA program has its own name, but they all fall under Title I-A, the only source or funding that was necessary for ESEA schools to fund most state program.

The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse and makes no specific reference to how long-term budgeting should be established. Recent concerns about the budget deficits and debt have called attention to the urgent need for Congress to consider long-term budgeting. While the current annual budget process and fixed mandatory spending and revenues are the law in most parts of the world, there can be challenges associated with the adoption of a long-term budget focus. Long-term budgeting would require significant restructuring of current mandatory spending and taxation rules; and any such required long-term focus would need to incorporate both the annual budget process and mid-term budget decisions. LONG-TERM BUDGETING CHALLENGE A potential challenge associated with any long-term budgeting proposal is the ability to communicate and sell the idea to the public. Members of Congress often complain that voters pay minimal attention to the text of the bills before they vote or are convinced of their lack of understanding of the bill's provisions. Members also express frustration with the lack of public awareness of current tax rules affecting mandatory revenue, which is needed for long-term planning. Many members have suggested that the current tax, spending, and revenue rules would need to be revamped in order to consider long-term budgeting. A number of members have expressed concern that the current annual budget process would limit long-term budgetary focus. In addition, there can be challenges associated with setting long-term goals and priorities so that they are consistent with the yearly budget process. Finally, long-term budgeting might require greater public communication about long-term planning, perhaps to be incorporated into future annual budgets and mid-term decisions. BENEFICIARY OF THIS REPORT A number of policymakers and lawmakers have expressed concern about rising federal debt. (Federal debt held by the public is 78% of GDP, while federal debt held by the public increased over 400% from 1948 to 2018. It is 3 times greater than during World War I.) The increase in federal debt will have long-term consequences for tax rates, economic prosperity, and social services. A few members of Congress have suggested that they want mandatory budget caps, similar to the caps that were enacted with the 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, on the annual appropriations bill if lawmakers decide to increase discretionary spending more than they have included in mandatory limits. At least a few lawmakers are expected to push a separate budget resolution to establish more caps. While the tax cuts bill reduced the revenue projected by the current budget bill by a few percentage points, the tax bill does NOT include the offsets for mandatory spending. Without additional caps or limits on spending, the bill may not reduce federal debt. While the tax cuts bill allowed for a few short-term tax cuts for tax relief, it does not include the offset or caps for mandatory spending that would be necessary for even more long-term tax relief. The amount of the mandatory spending increase proposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bill of $200 billion is significantly less than the amount of mandatory spending required to balance the current budget. That could create the need for other mandatory spending cuts over a long period of time, or for tax relief to continue to achieve the desired budget balance. The Congressional Budget Office found that the annual increase in U.S. deficits over the next 30 years (in 2049) would be $500 billion, based only on mandatory spending provisions and existing law. There is great concern that future mandatory spending growth might be more than the maximum $500 billion projected by the CBO. Some lawmakers have suggested that they want specific tax rate restrictions on the tax cuts bill to help balance the budget. This might result in a temporary drop in tax revenues so that in the long-run, federal tax revenues are expected to be similar to what they would be IF there were no tax cuts bill at all. Members may be asking for federal aid for any or all sorts of social services that are being addressed in this bill. With 13 million Americans receiving food stamp benefits, 14% of their income goes for food and 8.6 million of those Americans are served by SNAP-Ed. The number of members of Congress who support increasing the work requirement or income limits for SNAP to a minimum level of one in three or the maximum level allowed for SNAP-Ed benefits (a level defined as $400 billion for the tax bill). The number may well be as high as 9 in 10. Members are expected to push for greater benefits such as job training, financial aid for the home and childcare for children to keep the federal funds at bay. If Congress were to implement new and recurring Social Security payroll taxes, the mandatory budget adjustments required in federal law after 2022-2030 would be 8 times their maximum level. Members will be interested to know the precise amount. Those seeking benefits such as job training or financial assistance could end", "The Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause has three main objectives: to prevent corruption and limit foreign influence on federal officers, to preserve the President's independence from Congress, and to fix his salary at a fixed rate throughout his term to prevent Congress from using his salary to exert influence over him. The Foreign Emoluments Clause's language from the Articles of Confederation reflects an intention to limit the scope of foreign influence on federal officers and to maintain their independence from Congress. This report examines the history and purpose behind the Clauses, as well as their scope, the Foreign Emoluments Clause's constitutionality, and whether President Trump's emoluments would pass Constitutional muster.", "The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 established mandatory reporting requirements and cost estimates for certain federal government programs and regulations on states and local governments.

The National Critical Infrastructure Protection Program, designed by DHS to support the efforts made by states, municipalities, and other infrastructure entities to strengthen their CI systems, was introduced in 2007. The program assists communities in protecting infrastructure on critical topics like power and water systems from power outages or natural disasters. DHS has been working with state and local authorities to strengthen resilience against a wide range of hazards, including cybersecurity. DHS is using emerging technologies to address the threats posed by emerging criminal and foreign state threats on the nation's critical infrastructure. Several critical infrastructure fields, from health care facilities to transportation networks, are moving into the adoption of 5-G wireless technology, which is an important component of DHS' modern infrastructure protection priorities. As with all intelligence categories, DHS has seen an exponential growth in their threat intelligence capabilities. As DHS has expanded to protect multiple sectors of critical infrastructure in a variety of contexts \u2013 including physical, information, and logistics/manufacturing sectors \u2013 the number of DHS entities working with CI-oriented information is also expanding exponentially. DHS is working with partners across the Nation to develop best practices for protecting CI systems and their information from cyber threats. DHS' growing CI program is focused on promoting awareness of cybersecurity threats, mitigating risk to critical infrastructure, and providing resources to support those efforts. DHS is also assisting communities in the development of new technology and techniques to aid in protecting critical infrastructure from cyber threats. DHS is also increasing its efforts in providing comprehensive knowledge-based training courses to support information sharing across DHS, and DHS is moving to leverage a variety of new tools to assist DHS in sharing information quickly and securely throughout CI systems and networks. In response to DHS' efforts to provide security knowledge and services to America's critical communities, DHS is working with the public, private, and academic communities to develop new methods and tools to protect critical infrastructure. DHS has been working with state and local jurisdictions to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats through technology development, education, and other community outreach efforts. For example, DHS has worked with the City of Baltimore to develop an $8.6 million strategy for securing its 911-calling systems from the effects of targeted cyber threats. DHS is also providing communities with enhanced and more effective information sharing that would allow local jurisdictions to share and utilize a wealth of relevant infrastructure knowledge. DHS has also been working with community organizations and critical infrastructure owners to develop a comprehensive approach to critical infrastructure protection. DHS developed a Critical Infrastructure Protection Center to assist communities and state and local governments in protecting their critical infrastructure systems that span several sectors, including communication infrastructure and physical infrastructure. DHS has provided critical infrastructure protection training to private, critical infrastructure system owners and operators. The training is given on a periodic basis by DHS, at a federal level, to states and territories that DHS may coordinate with. DHS now provides the Nation a critical infrastructure protection community, with access to critical information regarding critical infrastructure, infrastructure types, and a list of DHS offices that can help protect critical infrastructure. DHS will continue to work with all its federal partners to provide comprehensive security to the Nation's critical infrastructure systems. Finally, DHS has been working with its Intelligence Community partners to address emerging threats to critical infrastructure, specifically cyber threats. DHS continues to build and leverage intelligence and emerging technologies to mitigate these cyber threats, and DHS is working to enhance the Nation's capacity to counter cyber threats and ensure CI system resilience. 4 -- Summary DHS - Overview 4 ---------- ---------- DHS - Summary DHS - Intelligence Community DHS - Summary DHS - DHS National Protection Clearinghouse DHS - DHS Intelligence Community DHS - Summary DHS - DHS Intelligence Community DHS - Summary DHS - DHS National Protection Clearinghouse DHS - DHS - Summary DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS DHS - Homeland Intelligence DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS DHS - DHS - DHS - Homeland Intelligence DHS - Homeland Intelligence DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS DHS - DHS - DHS DHS - DHS - DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS - DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS DHS", "Congress is presented trade agreements with Japan that include limited tariff and quota negotiations as part of a stage-one, the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement. Most Members of Congress and other stakeholders support potential future stage two trade talks, though some raise questions about coverage, future political support, and other issues. The Trump Administration's decision to leave TPP has allowed Japan and the remaining 11 TPP participants to proceed with the CPTPP in December 2018. TPP-11 encompasses tariffs, rules, and trade-related disciplines among the parties, but suspended U.S. nontariff demands, including for market access for soybeans in Japan. The U.S. and Japanese governments reached a number of side agreements and have both ratified their respective commitments, with the majority of TPP rules and U.S.-Japan trade agreements now in effect. In November 2018, Japan released its negotiating objectives and its interest in a U.S. TPP-style trade agreement. The U.S. agreed to negotiate such an agreement subject to Congress' consent, but has yet to do so due to Congressional opposition to TPP and concerns over political fallout.", "In 2018, approximately 38.1 million people (12.6% of the population) lived below the poverty line (the poverty rate was 11.8%). This was down from 39.3 million (12.4%) in 2017, down from 43.8 million (13.5%) in 2016, and down from 45.7 million (15.1%) in 2015. While this U.S. poverty measure uses the Census Bureau's 2018 thresholds ($25,701 for a family of four, $19,985 for a family of three, $16,247 for an individual not in a family, $12,784 for those 65 and older), a variety of poverty measures can be found in the \"Sources\" section, including the median income and the number of people in poverty. It is worth noting that poverty rates also decreased at a comparable 1.7 percentage point between 2010 and 2017 and there was no significant change in 2016 either. The official poverty measure does not capture the severity or number of income-contingent public assistance or how it compares to the number of people in poverty. Although there were more people in poverty in 2018, less than 13.6 (51%) of those people were receiving cash benefits or other income from government programs while 30.7% (99%) received SNAP benefits (not to be confused with the SPM).", "The Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act of 2000 authorizes the Compensation Trust Fund Commission, within 10 years after the act's enactment, to: 1) authorize an attorney or representatives to receive medical, psychotherapy, and psychiatric examination bills for the VCF's health-care-related benefits during the period of a victim's physical illness, 2) authorize the VCF to make cash benefits to certain persons who suffered physical injury or illnesses at or near the September 11 th victim-related buildings, and 3) authorize the VCF to make an appropriation by tax levy, for such sums as are at present necessary, the sum of which shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $20.5 billion. - - - - -- - - - -\nThere are more New York City residents and other persons whose individual cases the VCF has to consider.

The act (1) established a new type of river in the United States\u00e2\"wild ones\u00e2\"that are not subject to prior river studies; the act also designated those nonfederal areas that may have the state-designated WSR and state-administered WSRR, but may not include WSRs subject to state administration. The act further specified administrative categories for river classification, classification criteria for each classification, and agency roles. The act also established certain administrative categories concerning which federal lands or activities (such as dams/diversions) would be authorized. The act further (directly or in legislation) authorized WSRSS segments to be designated as \u00e2high priority,\u00e2 allowing rapid management that minimized future administrative studies, or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6wild\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u201e\u00a2,\u00e2 which allowed the rivers to be free from impoundment for recreational uses. The Administration has the right to nominate WSRs either through legislation or under the President\u00e2\u00a2s executive authority, subject to a congressional review. The Administrative Procedure Act furthers these designations to ensure federal courts can provide reviews of the WSRSS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions. The act further allowed states to receive federal funds for study and river recreation purposes, although the act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passage of the 1980 WSRSS Act amended these regulations. The Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in WSRSS management requires it (1) to develop administrative and management plans/reporting plans for each individual WSR, (2) to manage a study of one WSR per state per fiscal year, (3) to develop a cost-effective classification system for river classification, and (4) to implement the designated WSRSS/WRARS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administrative roles and authorities with the exception of the River Planning Act. The WSR act also established and amended several other river-related laws, including the Recreation and Public Land Sales Enhancement Extension Act of 7/30/1996, the Wild and Free-Range Animals Act of 1997, and Water Resource Recovery Act of 23/7/1980. This act also further encouraged each state to designate its own individual WSR and required the Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consideration of local watersheds (such a minimum watershed width of 350\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 per foot of river width) in managing WSRs. The act further designated WSRSS and WRSR management as a federal-private partnership, with a role to government and a role to local government with rights in certain areas for the Federal lands. The Act further provided administrative procedures and remedies for violations of river rights. The act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passage also authorized state authorities in certain areas to designate additional WSRs within certain portions of the NWSRS boundaries that are deemed \u00e2\u0088\u00a6high priority\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, while still allowing state or local authority over land use operations and recreational uses while in \u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u00a6\u00e2\u0153\u20ac of ownership; these boundaries also allow the states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 authority over construction of roads and structures (bridges and landslides); and (f) the management of streamside property by a WSOB or other federal agency, which allows federal lands within the WSOB boundaries.

Recent uranium-bearing mineral rock formations have been mined for their U 3 O 8 uranium products. The waste disposal systems implemented were mostly inadequate and not designed to cope with decommissioning uranium mill sites. Recent uranium production in the United States and Kazakhstan, the top world producers after China, are limited to relatively small quantities of uranium ore, resulting mainly from the secondary production to power reactor fuel. Uranium enrichment is the process of separating fissile uranium isotope U-235 from the naturally occurring isotope of the same weight at low enrichment. Several isotopes of U can be used to enrich uranium, with different U isotopic enrichments varying from between 13 and 20 times. Uranium from centrifuges of enriched uranium oxide is loaded into the fuel rod and fuel rod is loaded inside the power reactor vessel, where it can maintain heat for up to nine hours. Uranium enrichment is typically of such high levels of U that it is too expensive to mine it rather than extract it from existing U ore bodies. For example, the low U enrichment of the recently shuttered U.S. commercial nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon in California, has left it economically unviable. In 2017, approximately 15% of primary uranium production in the United States occurred in California, down from its peak of ca. 2000. Approximately 75% of the country's primary uranium production occurs in the uranium mining regions of South Africa, Kazakhstan, and Australia. After enrichment, the uranium fuel in nuclear power reactors must either be loaded in or surrounded by a physical fuel rod with greater U purity or with the fuel rod in front of the natural uranium-rich clathrates of fissionable nuclei, so that the uranium isotopes can be used as neutrons to sustain the chain reaction. One common application method is to load fuel into a single or multiple fuel rods, usually surrounded in cladding. Nuclear fuel rods can be in the form of tubes or spools. In order to manufacture the fuel, the U in the enriched uranium is extracted from the earth. In 1989, the U.S. Congress passed legislation to create a National Uranium Corporation to supply uranium to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). (DOE) stockpile during the Cold War. In 2006, U.S. law was repealed to open the door for commercial U extraction to start-up a U-OX power plant, which would use a commercial U ore body in Kansas. UUFE would not need a license but would create a commercial U production plant at the site for the construction and operation of an enrichment facility. UUKS, the U.S. subsidiary of the Russian Urengo company, produces enriched uranium and is the sole U enrichment company of Urengo's worldwide enterprise, which is in operation in 25 countries. Several U enrichment facilities are located in Kazakhstan, but the Kazakhstan enrichment complex is the leading U enrichment plant world-wide, producing some 6% of global U production. Uranium enrichment is typically high in concentration, and is normally performed in the United States, China, and India, which are the world's top three enrichment countries. Although uranium is abundant in nature, it undergoes complex geological processes to produce uranium ore. The major environmental impact results from the disposal of tailings, waste material from uranium processing. Uranium oxide and uranium isotopes are considered toxic when ingested and/or inhaled by humans and their environment. UOX ore can generate toxic radioactive uranium isotopes such as 222Rn and 210Po. These isotopes contain high levels of radiation and can emit beta particles from the Earth. They can cause serious harm if released into the atmosphere. In November 2018, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) updated its radiation protection standards that apply to uranium-processing facilities. Some of those regulations address radiation containment and control of the handling and disposal of toxic wastewater materials resulting from uranium or process byproducts. The NRC's requirements, along with the DOE's best practice program (which is not yet finalized), has created a set of design and safety regulations that reflect the NRC's current view of the threat posed by the release of large doses of radiation and/or a small chance of the release of radioactive material into the environment. The NRC's best practice guidelines for the design, construction, and operation of uranium ore processing facilities are based on uranium isotope production activities by NukePower, Kazakhstan. Several U enrichment facilities worldwide also have incorporated U isotope enrichment, which relies on a natural isotope in the Earth's crust. U enrichment is a nuclear reactor fuel that contains U-235 isotope. The U-235 enrichment process involves separating U-235 from U decay products in a neutron-splitting chain. The U-235 enriched fuel, uranium oxide (UO2), is further processed into uranium (U) ingots", "In 2018, Amtrak generated some 37.37 billion passenger-miles across all lines of service, slightly down from the previous year.

An annual report to Congress was mandatory and detailed the payments to all Palestinian institutions.", "(1) Some CSE employment programs may be more effective in serving NCPs who struggle to find employment and face economic challenges during a recession compared to states whose funds are limited. (2) NCP employment may improve child support payments by giving a larger share of wage or salary to parents, helping parents find part-time jobs, reducing unemployment, and addressing workforce gaps. (3) Some CSE employment programs are limited in scope (in some cases to child support only). (4) In light of the pandemic, remote work opportunities may present greater employment opportunities, but states may still struggle with funding. (5) CSE employment can assist some NCPs who are underemployed. Children in the care of a custodial father are more likely to access employment services. (6) CSE may provide parents with part-time employment and child care services (with some exceptions for work authorization). (7) CSE employment may be helpful when NCPs have significant wage or salary barriers to entering the labor market. (8) NCP unemployment data may offer insights on the employment outcomes (or lack thereof) of noncustodial parents.", "A 14-year-long history of government activities related to space weather and manmade electromagnetic hazards has included the establishment of a national space weather strategy in 1995, the implementation of the 2015 Plan, and the 2019 Plan's focus on resilience and planning of space weather events.

U.S. aid has been provided since the 1980s, as well as MCC compact signed in 2014, with a focus on areas like electric power and regional peacekeeping. The United States continues to be a critical partner in Ghana's democracy, security, and economic growth. Key points: Ghanaians have been involved in regional and multilateral organizations since 1957; Ghanaians contribute to peace in W. Africa while also seeking Western investment; Ghanaian exports are key to U.S. GDP; U.S. aid to Africa totals some $10 billion in FY 2017, with most going to West Africa. The most recent General Elections, held on December 7, 2016, were generally regarded as free and fair, yet tensions have persisted since. As the world's second-largest democracy, Ghana typically plays a stabilizing role for Africa's political development. Africa continues to be a strategic focus for U.S. aid, which is a boon given some of the financial challenges facing U.S. policymakers and institutions. The Obama Administration's signature MCC compact will help Ghana build stronger democratic institutions, including the electoral commission, and also will work on some pressing issues.

Their economy was primarily based on trade, with significant amounts of time and resources spent on manufacturing items and exporting goods. In addition, due to colonial restrictions on colonial trade, the islands found themselves in economic competition for export with Cuba. Following industrialization in Cuba, the U.S. Virgin Islands' population declined. However, with a new industry in post-WWII manufacturing and trade in the pharmaceutical and aerospace sectors, the islands are now enjoying economic growth. The islands have a population of 105,000, with a population density of roughly 19 persons per square mile. In 2015, the GDP per capita in the U.S. Virgin Islands was $21,700.

The Program was established in 1986 as a pilot project. All VWP countries must provide biometric, electronic passports. VWP countries are subject to an updated country-specific risk analysis every 18 months and are required to adhere to their respective country's entry requirements, including travel restrictions. All visitors must provide an electronic, machine-readable passport and apply for a nonimmigrant visa at the consulate of the United States, which then verifies the application. Since September 2000, VWP has been applied to approximately 38 million visitors from their 39 countries. The VWP countries account for an increasing share of both inbound business and tourism into U.S. The number of VWP visitors from China is increasing. By FY2008, 22.8 million visitors admitted under the program in the 39 VWP countries. China's share of VWP visits in this year is over 10 million, representing a 50% increase from the 10 million Chinese visitors admitted in FY2010 and a 38% increase from 5.5 million in FY2001.

It requires offsets, in equal amount to the legislative or mandatory spending or revenues. Exception has been made for certain emergency clause legislation that must comply as long as the authorizer also complies. Direct spending may increase, causing a PAYGO deficit, when certain circumstances result in or are likely to result in an increase in direct spending or the extension or permanence of mandatory funding measures previously authorized under PAYGO. PAYGO legislation may affect the effect of mandatory spending or revenue measures previously authored by the House and not yet enacted. A minimum amount of the deficit increases needed from PAYGO legislation is $500 billion and can be applied immediately. PAYGO requires offsets, for PAYGO purposes, to new legislative and mandatory spending or revenue measures passed by the House. PAYGO applies to direct spending or revenue of the federal government; to certain amounts of mandatory and non-emergency legislation; and, under a rule created prior to the PAYGO rule.

There are three types of health plans classified as either fully-insured, point-of-service, or other arrangements: Fully-insured, Small-Group, and Large Group. Plans in the individual market or for small groups are regulated by their individual states, but a small number of states apply a uniform approach and require minimum limits of coverage. States have the power to enforce certain requirements on insurance plans sold by state-licensed insurers. Consumers may pay for insurance through a variety of arrangements, but health coverage is often provided in groups that include employees and their dependents. State requirements relating to a core package of essential health benefits do not apply to self-insured health plans. 6.6.3 Summary of health coverage arrangements. This section of the report summarizes several types of health coverage arrangements that have become widespread in the United States.

Two major areas of Iranian transactions -- 1979-2045 FMS compensation case judgements and 2013-2015 sanctions - are analyzed in this report, with case studies of the Iranian FMS payments for 1991-2015 settlements.\nIran's nuclear program and sanctions have spanned more than a quarter century, beginning during the 1979-1981 hostage crisis and continuing through the 2015 JCPOA. Significant areas affected by sanctions - 1979-2015 - include the FMS program with Iran, 1991-2015 payments, 2013-2015 sanctions (i.e., 2008 SSEP), and the recent JCPOA. KEY FACTS: Iran has sought the elimination of U.S. sanctions, beginning in 2014 when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was implemented. 2019: $1.7 trillions in aggregate transactions with Iran in 2019 decreased 22% from 2018. U.S. companies' share of trade with Iran shrank down to 18% of total Iran-U.S. product value in 2019 compared to 25% in 2018. U.S. imports to Iran fell 3% last year compared to 2018. U.S. exports to Iran shrank down to its lowest (0.5%) level in 2019 compared to 2018. 2020: Iran is experiencing a decline in its overall economic fortunes. Its trade with the United States decreased to $12.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2017. U.S. trade with Iran fell 10 percent ($8.9 billion) in 2020 compared to 2019. Despite a sharp increase of 10 percent in bilateral trade during the first half of 2020, trade dropped to $11.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The U.S. trade with Iran is projected for an annual decline of $6.1 billion for 2021 compared to 2020. Iran's trade with the United States is projected for a 10 percent increase in 2021 compared to 2020 due to its re-emerging economic fortunes. U.S. trade with Iran is projected for an increase in 2021 after declining in 2019. Iran's trade with U.S. exports rose by nearly $2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, and the rise in Iran's exports of goods to the United States accelerated from 7 percent in 2018 to 16 percent in 2019. In 2020, trading activity between U.S. companies and Iran and the United Arab Emirates (U. A. E.) increased compared to 2019. With a $2.9 billion increase in bilateral trade with the United Arab Emirates from 2018 to 2019, the United Arab Emirates, along with the State of Israel, are Iran's major trading partners outside Iran, with each accounting for approximately 10 percent of Iran's non-governmental trade. In 2019, the United Arab Emirates and China, along with Turkey and Pakistan, accounted for almost 41 percent of Iran's total non-governmental trade. In 2019, $24.7 billion in merchandise trade is projected from the United Arab Emirates with Iran, compared with $16.1 billion in 2018, and a $13.4 billion increase in trade in 2020. The merchandise trade of United Arab Emirates with Iran has shrunk in 2019 and 2020 compared to 2018, from $24.7 billion to $8.4 billion. For the 2019-2021 period, trade in merchandise between the United Arab Emirates and Iran is projected to rise on an annual decrease of $16 billion. Iran's trade with the United Arab Emirates has declined from $23 billion in 2018 to $8.4 billion in 2020, with exports declining from almost $21 billion in 2018 to approximately $5 billion in 2020. Iranian trade with the United Arab Emirates in 2018 was $23.5 billion ($8 billion more than in 2017). In 2019 it was $8.1 billion ($1.3 billion more than in 2018). In 2020 Iran's trade with the United Arab Emirates decreased to $4. 2 billion. Iran's merchandise exports to the United Arab Emirates averaged $9.9 billion in 2019", "Although aquaculture appears to be a more feasible means for developing U.S. aquaculture compared to current methods, environmental and legal barriers present numerous challenges of establishing offshore aquaculture operations. Issues related to regulatory framework, environmental impacts, economic feasibility, and technical uncertainties all must be addressed for the nation to realize the potential of its ocean-based industry. While U.S. aquaculture production has generally stagnated, and the majority of U.S. aquaculture output is produced onshore to reduce environmental impacts, it is likely that advancements in aquaculture technologies and federal resources could expand this sector in the near future. Deterrence: Deterrenting \"Bad\" Habits (PDF)\nThe objective of this report was to inform congressional committees of the methods by which the NOAA Fisheries Service is enforcing the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Act, also commonly referred to as MSRA or the Marine Strategic Resources Act, requires NOAA to establish and enforce Magnuson management and conservation programs. The program's management component consists of two types of areas: areas where fishing is prohibited. This report includes the following: (i) definitions of the five geographic categories; (ii) status of the Magnuson-Stevens Act; (iii) a summary of the Magnuson strategy for the U.S. fishing industry. NOAA is conducting a survey to identify and address any management deficiencies. 14\nThe objectives of this report have been to: answer the House Committee on Appropriations as to how NOAA ensures marine product purity and quality control, report to Congress on NOAA's role in providing accurate seafood information to its consumers, review NOAA's efforts to expand their monitoring and inspection programs to enhance seafood safety, and identify NOAA's role in addressing issues of marine pollution. To assist Congress and NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA Fisheries' Fisheries Operations Division, and NOAA Environmental Services Division collaborated on the preparation of this report. The Report to Congress recommends that NOAA develop a comprehensive seafood surveillance plan that can help prevent seafood-borne illnesses and also address emerging issues related to seafood product quality. NOAA was encouraged to use science in an appropriate manner to ensure that the seafood products they test are accurate. The Report includes information on NOAA's efforts to develop a comprehensive seafood surveillance program. NOAA has also reviewed its testing techniques and the Report recommends that NOAA continue its efforts to incorporate new laboratory procedures and testing techniques. NOAA Fisheries has worked with independent sampling laboratories to develop a scientific sampling and laboratory network. Additionally, NOAA Fisheries will provide consumers with access to \"MyFishNet,\" an online tool which allows consumers to quickly identify seafood they are interested in. Additionally, NOAA has developed a test kit for seafood samples for testing. The Report includes information on the various laboratory locations that will use its testing procedures. This report encourages NOAA to keep a close eye on seafood products, because a major concern is that new products entering the marketplace may not be tested. The Report includes information on NOAA's surveillance, surveillance efforts, and testing procedures. The Report includes information that indicates NOAA will continue to use testing procedures like sampling, and that NOAA will continually be in search - at local, regional, and national levels - for ways to improve the seafood products it tests. NOAA Fisheries is also working with its aquaculture sampling contractor to test samples for pathogens and toxins that may be harmful to human contact. The Report also includes information on NOAA's work with NOAA Fisheries Seafood laboratories. The Report also encourages NOAA to develop a comprehensive Seafood Surveillance Program for all species of marine species - from crustable sea urchins to species that have been introduced to the environment within the past decade. The Report encourages NOAA to keep seafood products from the consumer. The Report includes information on NOAA's testing procedures, sampling techniques, and laboratory quality control methods. Also included is information on the \"MyFishNet\" program that is a web-based interactive tool that allows seafood consumers to identify certain species of seafood which interests - the first website in this domain that is created to allow consumers to learn about different seafood, their attributes, their processing methods, locations where they can find them in stores, and methods for preparing them.\nIn the 50th Congress (1960-1961), the Magnuson-Stevens Act was introduced as a bill to expand NOAA Fisheries' role in managing and conserving marine wildlife and habitats, and in assisting NOAA Fisheries with its management. This Report to Congress has been completed to provide information on the Magnuson-Stevens Act as well as the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), U.S. Marine Corps, and NOAA Fisheries Fisheries Technology Center. The Report describes NOAA's role as a research manager, the U.S. Coast Guard and NOAA Fisheries as regulatory bodies, and USCG as co-regulatory, but is also an example of NOAA's role as a partner to other federal agencies and a service provider of information to the public.\nThe Report to Congress provides information on NOAA", "The SALT deduction's impacts on federal revenues and tax payments relative to other federal tax issues increased due to P.L. 115-97's limitations on it. P.L. 115-97's SALT cap decreased the number of taxpayers itemizing deductions and the value of the tax savings from those deductions. Decreased itemizations have offset by an estimated $127 billion of P.L. 115-97 taxes for FY2017.", "Impeachment is a constitutional check on civil officers who abuse their power. This report discusses impeachment's origins in Parliament, examines the Framers' understanding of the power, and explains the basic elements in federal impeachment proceedings that apply to a Senate trial. Two recurring questions remain: What is the meaning of \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\"? How does the Constitution define political offenses that meet the standard of impeachment?

The act established a fund to raise the funding of grants, such as marketing, to fishermen and fishery managers. Since implementation, S-K funding has been allocated through grants, fishing industry-assistance, coastal habitat restoration, conservation, and management. The act has been reauthorized on a periodic basis. However, it is unclear whether all of the S-K funding is used efficiently and effectively.

Family planning programs generally focus on contraception, sterilization, and counseling for infertility, and these are the central components of the programs administered by USAID. While U.S. family planning assistance has increased considerably since its inception, there have been many restrictions to the programs, causing some critics to charge that some or all of the money goes to abortions or sterilizations provided by foreign entities. With this report, the U.S. Congress will be asked to reauthorize Section 104.", "Funding for new border barrier construction became the focal point of a partial government shutdown that began in late December 2018 and lasted for 34 days, the longest on record. Congress ultimately did not accept the administration's demand for $5.7 billion in new funding for a proposed border wall, resulting in a budget standoff. The President declared a national emergency at the southern border that required use of the Armed Forces. In March, the Administration announced a new budget budget request that included Army OCO military construction funding and $3.6 billion in supplemental appropriations for future border barrier construction. These actions represent a complex mixture of realigned DOD program savings and unobligated military construction funds from past years, as well as a request for new defensive military spending in FY2020.", "Domestic violence is prevalent in the military and there is ongoing need for increased vigilance. IPV prevalence is high among U.S. military families, affecting performance in work, interpersonal relationships, and well-being. There is a need to expand victim services, including access to legal and financial aid, to ensure military families are armed with resources and know how to seek justice. To combat violence, the number of screenings and investigations of both victim and offender should be increased by requiring a minimum number of hours. Domestic violence services are also needed for victims. Victims, their children, and nonincident family members have a significant need for specialized, direct, and confidential aid. Research is needed in understanding the prevalence of different types of domestic violence victimization in the military. Victims in active-duty status may be less likely to report a crime, but they may still utilize available victim assistance, counseling, and legal services. A variety of military treatment centers and victim assistance programs are available to military members. Congress can play a significant role in preventing and responding to IPV in the military. Domestic violence crime is often underreported, but IPV cases represent a relatively wide swath of nonviolent crimes (see [2] for review). Although there have been numerous calls to overhaul our criminal justice system to ensure justice is served, the response can be slow, especially where there is a lack of victim consent to criminal justice proceedings. The U.S. military, the largest police force in the world, is uniquely situated to be involved at multiple points on the IPV victim-perpetrator continuum (see [2] for review). For example, victim assistance is a critical component in cases when military members or their families are victimized (see [3]). In addition, the military justice system, while distinct from civilian judicial proceedings, can hold a victim (who is arguably a perpetrator in an IPV case) accountable, without recourse, once within that system, even in the face of a criminal proceeding pending at the civilian court level. Victims who have been victimized in the military may need additional specialized support such as psychological services, medical care, legal aid, and/or benefits counseling to assist with the transition back to civilian life. Intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in the military service is a large issue, with victims numbering approximately 10% of all IPV assault cases in the civilian population. The number of cases involving the military in an IPV case may be much less, but may also be relevant to veterans' health and the military justice system. Intimate partner violence and child abuse are also major problems in active military duty. Some sources estimate that up to 20% of civilian families may be affected by family IPV, and in the military, this number can be expected to exceed 30-40%. The military is unique in that we have a separate criminal justice system within the justice system, with its own courts, rules, and procedures (see [1] for a review of the military justice system). Victims requesting justice services in civilian courts, particularly if they are active-duty military, face challenges with victim intimidation, a lack of trust, a reluctance to testify, or other obstacles. The Military Criminal Justice Act (MCA) (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 80313 et seq.) authorizes civil actions for punitive damages against military members for specific instances of assault, assault and battery, or other actions they are permitted to do on active duty. Assault includes incidents in which someone actually attacks a victim but the victim does not become immediately (or even hours later) physically ill or injured as a result. Assault and battery have historically been the most common causes of victimization inside the military. Examples of victim intimidation and coercion, while perhaps a problem that can be addressed in appropriate military courts, are still in the realm of an active crime that requires investigation and resolution from civilian law enforcement and courts. Victims may still choose to pursue IPV complaints against military personnel, especially if they are seeking relief from a non-military spouse or family member who is not available to provide assistance. \"Victim assistance\" (VA) programs are often part of the victim resources available where victims of IPV are often forced to work with victim advocates who can help prepare them for a hearing. Victims who are victimized within military legal system should not be penalized. The same is true of civil victims. A victim should not be penalized if the court determines the victim of military IPV made a false, criminal report; if the victim is found not guilty by a jury; or if a victim is acquitted in criminal court. Victims also should not face employment penalties or have their children removed from his or her care unit for a victim. This type of sentence is a severe penalty to a person that has been victimized by an abuse of power who has done nothing wrong from their perspective. If a military perpetrator is acquitted in a criminal court, the MCA automatically applies", "This report covers a very broad range of Senate parliamentary authorities, including standing and special rules of the Senate to help Senate and House staff conduct their day-to-day duties. It also includes the Senate's procedures in dealing with questions of parliamentary authority, and the implications of certain Senate practices. EXTRACTS FROM THE TEXT: The Senate's procedures are not based solely on its standing rules. Rather, the Senate's numerous standing rules and precedents of the Senate also serve as a guide to how the business of the Senate shall be conducted. Although the formal Senate rules and precedents of the Senate are the most well-known of parliamentary sources, other sources are equally important. Many procedures relating to particular issues (such as presidential nominations) or particular problems (such as the Senate floor) rely heavily on Senate rules and official precedents. Similarly, an analysis of the Senate's standing rules (or precedents) would be incomplete without taking account of the body's rules of procedure and its official ways procedures. In general, all Senate sessions (including the summer) must be conducted on the floor and within certain time limits. The Senate's business is highly structured, with procedures and deadlines to enforce its business model of conducting itself a particular way. The most well-known precedents of Congress, often contained in the text of bills and the Congressional Calendar and other documents, establish a significant portion of the Senate's business and are required to comply with those standards. The Senate has two major procedures that are key to how it operates: that of raising and discussing points of order and that of offering and accepting motions, which are often used to delay, postpone, put off or change the business that the Senate must perform. Throughout its history, the Senate has changed its rules and has established new rules under which it operates. Both documents can easily be found and used in determining the standing rules and procedures of the Senate. These two documents can usually be found in a variety of official Senate publications. In addition to Senate rules, the Senate also provides manuals that reflect its procedures and its rules. The Senate's manual is \"Rules and Protocol of the United States Senate.\" Other documents, such as those produced by House committees and the Library of Congress regarding rules of the House, and those pertaining to House, Senate, and local county rules, are often helpful at identifying the scope of particular procedures. One type of tool that Senators can use to help them navigate the myriad procedures and precedents that the Senate observes is printed manuals. These printed manuals are available to Senators as long-term copies, and are generally free of charge. The Senate's procedures rely heavily on electronic processes. The Senate and House, for example, allow online viewing of bills, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, House bills, joint resolutions, and other documents. These documents are, of course, available in printed forms and in electronic formats. The Senate also uses various forms to establish and enforce its business rules, particularly for electronic documents that are part of the electronic record of the legislative branch. Rules and rules of the House are all subject to Senate oversight, because the Constitution assigns Senate responsibility for the rules and regulations of the United States, including all other legislative and executive courts. Senate rules and regulations change often, depending on Senate procedures and other developments. Each standing rule that Senate bills and resolutions or the Constitution implement mandates that there be a procedure when the Senate's business is altered, the number of Standing Rules and Ways Committees will increase to reflect the expanding business of the Senate. Similarly, standing rules and guidelines regarding standing order and the", "Honduran democracy has been under pressure, with political instability, violent crime, displacement, and emigration. U.S. policymakers have devoted increasing attention to Central American nations in recent years. In 2019, the Trump Administration announced its intention to end U.S. foreign aid to the \"Northern Triangle\" nations, including Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. CONCLUSIONS: Honduras' transition to democracy and its political, social, and economic stability depend on a range of U.S. policies, including foreign aid, security assistance, and trade collaborations. In particular, U.S. policymakers must work to support Honduras' security, stability, and economic growth and address challenges in each area, all with an eye on ensuring broader regional stability.

Employers are required to make annual contributions each year to ensure their DB plans reach a 100% funding goal, while plan assets are invested in equities. Employer contributions of up to 12.4% of pay for employees are needed according to ERISA. Pension plans generally invest in equities, debt, real estate, and private equity. The actuarial values are used to determine the 100% funding goal and any employer contributions necessary to achieve that goal. Source of Funding DB plans are required to set aside actuarial values of 1.5% - 2.5% of each participant's salary, depending on the plan's age and the formula it uses for payment. Plans are also required to carry 100% of the DB plan's funding for the 100% funding goal. If a plan's funding goal is less than 100%, employer contributions are not required. Participant contributions are also needed to achieve the coverage goal. Participants' contributions are paid back to them after tax as a lump refund payment, usually within 2 years or in equal monthly installments over a longer period. Lump payments are not subject to payroll tax. Lump payments after-tax cost increases are also paid back over a longer period (within 30 years). Participants who want to leave their plan mid-career can leave with only their own accrued benefits, 100% of their accrued benefit can be left in the plan, or, the balance can be taken out in installments. The 100% funding goal can be reached a number of ways. One is a multi-employer plan that spreads the coverage of older age-based DB plans between several employers. This is the most common approach to DB plans, and is described in full in the section below. This type of plan is often referred to as \"multiemployer plans\" and, in many cases, can be used by non-profit organizations as well, but not by for-profit hospitals. ERISA does not prohibit the investment of plan assets into DB plans other than those associated with 401(k)/403(b) plans, which are covered under ERISA. These investments can be short-term or long-term CDs, short-term or long-term bonds, or CDs. Investments in individual accounts can also be allowed if prescribed. Other types of investments not allowed in ERISA retirement plans include real estate, mutual funds, and hedge funds. In addition, investment income from these assets is limited under ERISA to 20% of plan assets. A participant's balance in a DB plan generally only decreases the contribution rate that he or she must pay, not the total balance in his or her account. These charges are subject to an annual funding allowance for each year ERISA requires 1.5% to be put into the DB plan for each year. For example, a plan might use the remaining balance in each contributor's account to invest 1.5% of the current funding requirement. Contributions and withdrawals in any amount are available without restrictions after 1 year. The funding provision may apply only to employees aged 50 and older (or other age groups) who had contributions deferred. Employers may have to pay a 100% funding requirement for a plan's coverage goal if there is not enough funding in the plan's assets for the number of participants in it. Employers may choose to make annual contributions to the plan to ensure 100% funding is maintained. A taxpayer's current 401(k) contribution, up to 100% of pay or $25,000, whichever is less, may reduce the investment income the taxpayer receives from the DB plan, resulting in a tax deferral. Pension plans are required to maintain records about retiree participation, such as the number who took lump sum withdrawals from retirement plans. Participants with lump sums may be subject to ERISA's pension withdrawal limitations, and could be hit with income taxes. Withdrawals from a DB plan that is considered a Defined Contribution (DC) plan are subject to immediate taxation without special tax treatment. Participants who leave jobs or employers can leave their pension plan intact if their employer extends one-time contributions of up to 100% of plan benefit per current employees. A 100% funding gap for a particular job could result if other employees did not make the 100% contributions. There are different types of DB plans, including Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) pensions. The most common type are Defined Benefit pensions, which are similar to the traditional DB plans. A plan's investment portfolio is generally managed by a professional money management company that, in turn, purchases various securities (stocks and bonds) for use by the plan's participants. A plan may also buy exchange listings of publicly traded stocks and other assets to keep them liquid and maintain a lower", "Reclamation projects were unique in a number of ways, as federal in nature and operated according to a beneficiary pays principle in which project beneficiaries must reimburse the government for their allocated share of project costs (some costs are considered federal in their nature, therefore no reimbursement is required). The Reclamation Act has evolved over time, and the Bureau currently participates in various federal programs. The Bureau works with local units of government to construct and maintain water storage, reclamation, and water and wastewater treatment systems for public service or for individual homeowners. For example, a \"water recycling\" system is being built in California near the San Joaquin River. The Reclamation Act has been instrumental in planning and developing water and wastewater systems in the Western United States. The Bureau can also serve as a consultant to communities that build their own water systems. In addition, through the Reclamation Land Act, the Bureau can provide lands to individual citizens or local governments to allow them to start their own communities, as part of a nation-wide goal of Native American land reclamation. Congress first established the Indian Reclamation Service, within which many large and long-term federal irrigation projects were developed, designed, and constructed. The Bureau still oversees water resource projects for American Indians. The act, in contrast to most government programs, is reauthorized by Congress every two years to continue its current funding as a \"self-sustaining\" organization by Reclamation's Reclamation Fund. The Department of the Interior's (DOEI) mission is to conduct scientific investigations of national environmental and resource concerns and to promote the use of environmental resources for the benefit of the American people. Within the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau), DOEI manages water resources related to both public and scientific purposes. These projects include the design, construction, and operation of existing water storage and reclamation systems, the reclamation of arid lands in many western states, and water management issues. The Bureau of Reclamation has a long history of involvement in water and power programs. Some of the most current efforts are hydroelectric power facilities in California. The Bureau also has a wide variety of smaller projects, including reclamation and water storage and water management systems at various locations throughout California. A water recycling system near the San Joaquin River is also being developed. (e). oo. -a.. o. o o CO- -~ - 8 CO.4 W CO CO A -~ o o.

Federal law requires servicing of all student loans, which are now administered by numerous contract servicers. In addition, the U.S. Department of Education has entered into multiple contracts with each of the major contract servicer. At least 2 congressional subcommittee hearings have been held on student loan servicing in the past few months, and several U.S. Attorneys General have brought consumer protection lawsuits against student loan servicers. Congressional lawmakers have recommended new regulations to help govern student loan servicing. The current set of laws governing student loan servicing needs to be tailored to properly address changes in the student loan servicing system. Congress should ensure that the provisions of any new regulatory bill do not impair states' existing regulatory roles in providing oversight and protecting consumer rights. Congress should also reconsider the scope of state regulatory power over student loan servicing. The 2007 National Student Loan Review Commission's Report to Congress, however, found that there was no evidence that states have implemented better student loan servicing practices than the federal government and that many states have inadequate regulations. In light of this report, Congress should not interfere with the current federal laws governing student loan servicing.

The CRT, which has no end date, regulates most water flow into the United States side of the river and mandates hydroelectric generation upstream in Canada. Other aspects of the CRT that are currently under review include its benefits and terms, as well as studies related to flood control, hydropower generation, transportation, and cross-boundary water use. The CRT has been a topic of debate with regard to Canada's share and certain aspects of U.S. control. Many stakeholders, including Canadian provinces and entities such as First Nation communities and the CRTC, have expressed a desire for greater decision-making authority. Regional Recommendation to Continue the CRT, signed by the head of the federal U.S. Department of State and Canada's Minister for the Environment in August 2016, seeks to retain these provisions. Negotiations on the CRT have been ongoing since it was signed in 1961, and these discussions have included modifications to the river treaty, including redefining it to allow hydropower to be shared equally among existing reservoirs.\nThe Columbia River Treaty review process may have to be modified in light of future circumstances, as some stakeholders have expressed a desire for greater decision-making authority from the International Joint Commission (IJC) and the Bureau of Reclamation. The CRT may still provide benefits to both countries' hydropower production. The CRT's benefits may now be better shared among Canadian and U.S. entities through mechanisms such as new hydropower benefits that would allow Canadian hydropower assets to receive 10-12 years' worth of hydropower benefits from U.S. reservoirs (for example, Lake Okeechobee) for both countries. While Canada, which signed the CRT before it was adopted, has been cooperative in this regard, the U.S. Department of State has indicated that a U.S. Entity, similar to Canada's CRTC, would be needed for flood control purposes. Canadian authorities have long supported hydropower production from existing reservoirs, which are a main source of base load power for U.S. reservoirs and hydropower production at the 39 reservoirs in Ontario alone. CRT review involves the International Joint Commission (IJC), which oversees water usage between the two nations. The IJC held five public meetings across three countries, and then finalized its Regional Recommendation to Continue the Treaty. U.S. authorities have been reviewing the Regional Recommendation to date. Negotiations on a CRT modification may not trigger a reapproval by the U.S.\u2013Canadian CRT Joint Entity, as IJC has a role in the treaty's approval. The U.S. House Oversight Committee convened a subcommittee entitled \"H2O: The Columbia River Treaty in Focus\" in May 2016. It was not clear if the CRT would be added to the subcommittee's priorities. The Canadian Senate Standing Committee on International Trade, Science, Technology, and Resources has been monitoring Canada's CRT, noting that it was last reviewed in 2000. It has been expressed that the Committee is interested in renewing the CRT to continue the process and provide clear legal provisions. Both governments anticipate that CRT renewal may still occur. Negotiations on the CRT may be difficult to complete in light of changing geopolitical circumstances. The CRT is the sole binding agreement between the two countries, including the parties' rights and obligations with respect to water usage, power generation, hydropower operations, and transportation. The CRT is reviewed annually by the U.S.\u2013Canadian CRT Joint Entity, which includes representatives from both governments. This review may be an avenue through which Canada requests certain modifications to the CRT in order to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of water among the IJC reservoir managers, their respective CRTCs, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). CRT negotiations and discussions on the CRT are on-going. Both U.S. and Canadian representatives have attended past IJC sessions in order to review and analyze the CRT. U.S. State Department's Regional Consultation Committee on the CRT (RCC) is responsible for identifying regional concerns about the treaty and evaluating whether modifications are necessary that have regional ramifications. Canada and the IJC review the CRT annually. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the U.S. Entity, unlike Canada's CRTC, that is responsible for hydropower operations in the U.S. side of the main Columbia River reservoir chain, Lake Okeechobee. While Canada has historically been involved in Lake Okeechobee hydropower operations directly with the Corps, it is now the State of Florida that handles hydropower", "The transatlantic relationship is an enduring pillar of U.S.-European policy and economic relations and a core element of European security, economic prosperity, and democratic governance. Since the end of World War II, successive administrations and Members of Congress have sought to construct a deep U.S. relationship with Europe which includes NATO (the Alliance's European component), a common external threat assessment, and close international economic integration through trade liberalization and the expansion of economic opportunities. Both the Trump Administration and European policymakers seek to maintain this enduring transatlantic partnership through continued collaboration and investment in future trade and policy arrangements.", "The Commemorative Works Act and the related monuments act for the construction and maintenance of memorials within the District of Columbia have resulted in 37 authorized commemorative works.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrologic Conditions in the Central Valley: Rainfall over the Central Valley is a relatively short-term occurrence--water availability in the valley for the dry summer months is limited. In many parts of the valley, precipitation is a mere fraction of that available for the wet season. There is also a high degree of variation from year to year in amount of precipitation, which is a feature of the Central Valley. The region has traditionally been thought of as the \"greenbelt\" of California--the Central Valley is home to more than 20 million agricultural acres. Hydrologic conditions in the Central Valley are relatively short-term and subject to change from year to year. In contrast to relatively short-term hydrologic fluctuations on the central part of Central Valley, precipitation remains a factor in precipitation forecasts over the rest of the central part. The CVP study area on the main stem of the San Joaquin River also enjoys a relatively consistent precipitation pattern, with more than 130 inches of precipitation per annum. The majority of the precipitation in the study area, occurring from June to September, has a component of soil moisture -- a phenomenon where soil moisture levels are replenished by rains with an interval of a year or more). During this interval soil moisture is greater than the median for the Central Valley. This phenomenon has created a soil moisture surplus in the region that can support year-round crop production for crops like cotton, wheat, almond, and sunflower. During 2003-2005, the study region had significant soil moisture deficits, with a large percentage of it occurring in July, August and September. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR), which operates a reservoir system in the Central Valley, reports that soil moisture across the region increased by about 50% during the past two years. Since 2005, soil moisture conditions have been wetter, allowing farmers to produce more corn and other crops. Climate data from a U.S. Geological Survey study shows that the Central Valley is an area of short summers and relatively long winters. The climate of the region is characterized by a Mediterranean climate. In some parts of the Central Valley there is significant rainfall during the summer months, which creates a soil moisture surplus so that production of grains like wheat, almond and sunflowers can be sustained year-round. These crops have significant economic implications for farmers in the region. The average annual precipitation in the study area is estimated to be some 50.1 inches, which has been about 1.7 inches higher than the previous 30 years (). CVP studies have identified both positive and negative impacts of hydrologic conditions in the Central Valley on agricultural activities. A number of studies have focused on the impacts on agricultural production, with 2.85 cfs/year (CFSY) of water released in the CVP to increase production from a baseline of 1200 to more than 2600 cfs/year. A more recent study showed that the water release from CVP reservoirs can also be used to maintain water levels in lakes and creeks and that it is needed to maintain a healthy reservoir system (). The reservoirs are also used to increase agricultural production and improve soil moisture in areas where rainfall is deficient, resulting in drought relief. They provide water in quantity proportioned to what can be taken away via pumping out. A large portion of California land surface contains significant portions of the San Joaquin River watershed. In parts of this watershed the CVP studies have indicated significant water availability. In parts of the watershed where rainfall is sparse, supplemental water storage through CVP reservoirs has been necessary to prevent water shortages to the community, industry, and agricultural production. Studies have shown that a major feature of the region is its significant variability in water availability over an annual period. During some years, significant precipitation events are typical, but only about 30% of the area receives any precipitation at all. In addition, as much as 70% of the annual CVP release is typically released (or 50 to 200 acre-feet/year) in a single day. These intermittent release periods have resulted from significant precipitation in just a day or several weeks. This precipitation has been described in the scientific literature as an \"acute deficit event\". During months of wet weather farmers can harvest their crops; however, the region's soil moisture surplus can create significant rainfall-starved areas that lead to planting-time drought. As a result, farmers, on both the private and public levels, have taken major", "Background, legal principles, and IP rights in medicines. a safety and efficacy evaluation.

Amendments to the act authorizing the federal response to COVID-19 include an extension of a Small Business Administration loan program, increased funding for HHS and the U.S. Postal Service, and expanded telehealth services. The bill also appropriates funding for the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, and provides grants and loans to state and local governments and private nonprofits. The bill sets a $100 billion ceiling for the Provider Relief Fund Program, to which health care facilities and other providers had to apply for funding. The bill appropriates funding for a number of other initiatives, including: \u00e2\u00a2 payments to Medicaid and CHIP providers for the cost of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and services, \u00e2\u00a2 increased funding to support health care facilities and providers, \u00e2\u00a2 increased funding for mental health and behavioral health care providers, \u00e2\u00a2 increased funding for the federal supply chain program, \u00e2\u00a2 expanded telehealth services to meet widespread needs. \u00e2\u00a2 increased funding for COVID-19 tests and vaccines \u00e2\u00a2 additional funding for COVID-19 research \u00e2\u00a2 a tax deferral for COVID-19 pandemic-related income \u00e2\u00a2 expanded and accelerated funding for veterans health care services.

The bill also authorizes the establishment, operation, or extension of programs, as well as any amount of funds not needed to meet emergency medical costs, for COVID-19 testing or treatment. The bill also authorizes funding to support patient-centered telemedicine. However, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions in cases where the funding would be in violation of state law. In addition to the provisions noted elsewhere in the bill, it specifically authorizes funding for research on treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. The bill also authorizes the HHS Secretary to temporarily waive certain restrictions on telehealth, and establishes a funding program.

Federal immigration law has plenary power over nonresident aliens, and the exclusion power must be distinguished from Article II's enforcement clause power, which has no power over nonresident aliens. This can be seen in Trump v. Hawaii, where Congress explicitly delegates exclusion power to the President, which in turn delegated this power to the Attorney General. The plenary power doctrine has been used most often in exclusion cases involving lawful permanent residents. In recent cases, Congress has been asked whether to limit the exclusion power in the interest of U.S. citizens. Recent events in the U.S. regarding exclusion of aliens from certain countries have generated discussion and proposals to curtail exclusion powers and subject them to more rigorous judicial review.", "The United States is a global leader in biotechnology and has used the extensive expertise gained through research and development to develop new tools to improve plants and animals.

Huang\nInternational Journal of Agricultural and Biological Sciences 14(1):1-24\nJanuary 2020", "Section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) grants the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) Administration broad authority to design, adopt, and enforce standards relating to workplace conditions. Through the general duty clause, (OSH Act General Duty Clause), employees are entitled to an unencumbered workplace free from established hazards causing serious personal injury or death. Additionally, employers are required to implement OSHA standards and to comply with their general duty clause obligations to ensure safe working conditions. An important feature of federal Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act 1970 (OSH Act) is Section 6, entitled Penalty Provisions. OSHA may impose penalty amounts on employers found in violation of a standard by exercising its power to modify the penalty structure based on the seriousness of a violation. Although the penalty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH Act) are in this book, OSHA is limited in Section 6 to the penalties they can assess using this penalty provision. Most employers are in small business, but OSHA may administer penalties to larger employers as well. OSHA uses penalty provisions for its smaller employer enforcement actions. OSHA also has the authority to modify the penalty and even close down an employer in serious cases. There are also OSHA penalties for willful violations that are significantly higher than penalties for negligence. In any case, OSHA may modify penalties at any time. The OSHA program also has provisions for employers to apply for a Certificate of Good Standing to have their OSHA citations removed from their record. Penalties are typically assessed based on an employee's length of service, their classification in the Federal Government, and the severity of the violation. For each of these offenses and the resulting penalty amount, you will need to check the OSHA OSHA Act in this book to determine their level of seriousness. Table 1-A lists OSHA penalty categories and allows you to compare the severity of penalty with the amount of the penalty. Table 1-B allows you to assess the penalties OSHA would allow under certain conditions. OSHA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to modify penalty amounts is set in the OSHA Act in Section 6(e). Employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to appeal OSHA citations and penalties is set in the OSHA Act under Section 10. However, if certain conditions be met, it is possible for OSHA to modify the penalty itself. OSHA may also modify its penalty amounts based on certain circumstances relating to the violation. The penalty structure is very complex, and you will need to refer to other sources to get the detailed information required. A review of the OSHA penalty manual with the OSHA Law Guide is a very good way to know the OSHA compliance requirements.

The TRICARE program provides enrollees with premium-based health plans that are similar to TRICARE Select but with limited enrollment based geographically in certain situations, or, in general, for enlisted and selected officers whose medical care is paid for using a military health care (MHC) contract. There are four TRICARE coverage options: TRS Reserve Enrollees, TRS Premium Enrollees, and TRS Supplemental Enrollees. All of the coverage options offer health care at network facilities, access to medications at lower cost at a mailorder pharmacy, and mental health services if a beneficiary is eligible. In 2005, Congress authorized TRICARE Retired Reserve for the reserve and retirees of all armed services. For the reserve component, TRICARE is provided through a private health company. Those who reside overseas can remain enrolled in the TRICARE worldwide network through TRS and TRR. DOD-operated medical facilities are required to provide health care to eligible beneficiaries, including TRICARE beneficiaries, at an increased cost (compensation for the cost of care) based on a defined benefit schedule determined by DOD every year. DOD estimates that of the $7 billion spent in fiscal year 2017 for TRICARE worldwide, 39%, or around $3 billion, represents the expenses of medical facilities. There are both cost-effective and fee-for-service medical care contracting models used under both TRICARE and TRR. Both medical care networks (MCOs) are also required to offer care for eligible beneficiaries.", "This document covers the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136).

Due to the current structure of the American health care system (e.g., it is still too costly; see Figure 3 ), Americans in this category are regularly paying for at least 10 percent of their health care costs (if not more). Out-of-network billing can result from, but is not limited to, inefficiencies in the current market system. The current system is inefficient in that (i) consumers are uncertain regarding their health care costs and/or bills and, therefore, are willing to pay for out-of-network services; (ii) providers are eager to find as many non-medical non-patient out-of-network customers as there are to make their financial situation more appealing and secure; and (iii) there are a small but growing number of non-insurance entities now entering the physician services market in a variety of ways (e.g., employers). One of the other major reasons that has increased the prevalence of out-of-network services is due to the fact that consumers (especially in-invisible-network consumers) are not willing to go through the necessary processes to determine their out-of-network health care costs up front, and/or they do not have the information and/or knowledge to make the payments they are charged for. As stated before, out-of-network billing is a result of inefficiencies and is happening in the system. The current system, however, is inefficient in that consumers are not able to determine the full costs, prices, or charges of their out-of-network health care services/products and/or payments. One of the major reasons for this problem is that out-of-network billing information is confidential to the providers and there have been no regulations to share information. Another major aspect, is that in spite of the fact that (i) medical care costs are often rising as the cost of providing out-of-network and in-network services are growing and/or not in a constant pace, and (ii) out-of-network health care costs and payments tend to be high, consumers have not been able to pay these costs on their current or future health insurance plans due to lack of information. As a result, consumers (in the current marketplace) are unable to easily determine their (i) bills, (ii) the extent of their out-of-network health insurance coverage, and (iii) the costs associated with an out-of-network health care provider. The current system is a lack of information/discipline between providers and costs. To date, no one has been able to determine how these costs are distributed between consumers and providers (e.g., consumers, providers, insurers, providers). Consumers do not understand where their health care costs are coming from or what they are being charged for the out-of-network services they receive. The charges from out-of-network health care providers can be costly for a range of reasons. It is a lack of accountability and transparency. One of the major reasons (i) for out-of-network information has to do with the current structure of the American marketplace and/or (ii) a lack of information regarding out-of-network billing. Additionally, some out-of-network suppliers may not have a centralized billing system or database and/or no standard way of listing out-of-network fees on their physician portal listing. Some patients have been forced to go out-of-network to seek the necessary treatment that they need due to inadequate payments that they had been receiving for their out-of-network care. Unfortunately, there is presently no federal or state law to establish or enforce standardized billing practices at the out-of-network level. The American public has been spending more of their time than ever on health care. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2016 and 2018 the national average medical expense expenditure rose 25 percent, or roughly $1,000 per person per year; in that same timeframe, average health care expenditure per person per year grew to $1,100, or $40,000 per person per year (from 1979-2018, which includes all inflation adjustments; note this would be $100-200-$300 per person per year). Furthermore, consumers today seem to be spending more time on health care than in the past, with that being the case in (i) both the private and public health sectors. This was a result of the recent Health and Human Services/Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "Historic preservation is the federal practice of protecting and preserving sites, structures, objects, landscapes, and other cultural resources of historical significance. Various federal, state, and local government programs, as well as privately funded activities, support historic preservation in the United States. The federal role in historic preservation dates back to 1906: the Antiquities Act and Historic Sites Act. There are two distinct federal Historic Preservation programs, the National Heritage Areas (NHPs) Program and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Funding is available under various programs, with the primary responsibility for administering federal historic preservation activities falling to the National Park Service (NPS). Key recommendations include increasing the federal funding for the NRHP by doubling the current appropriation level, reauthorizing the Historic Sites Act to increase the maximum funding amount to states, and allowing a local government to administer a national historic preservation district program.", "With significant unmet demand for broadband service in rural areas, despite relatively favorable geographic and demographic characteristics, broadband access may lag substantially.

Some critics argue FSA faces an insular system of accountability. In addition to Title I, Title V Title VI, FSA administers Title II Indian Health Education Funding (IHEF) programs and Title E/ESl - Disability Education and Rehabilitation Services Act. FSA has a unique organizational, accountability, and oversight structure and works closely with the Department of Education, Congress, and GAO. This report examines FSA's structure, its operations, and challenges over the past decade, including some from the 116th Congress, as well as its history under a Republican-led presidency. While FSA's operations under the Trump administration may change, FSA will still work closely with Congress regarding the legislation and regulations that oversee its operations. Current FSA leadership includes President Daryl Kimball and COO Michael Grant during this decade\u00e2\u0080\u0192\u00a6 and past president/CEO Daniel M. Hungre. The Office of the Inspector General's findings on FSA are in the 2019 and 2020 reports, which are available publicly at the time of writing. FSA is one of the 26 Cabinet-level Department of Education subunits, along with GAO, OIG, and others. FSA operates with a variety of unique roles, which FSO (Chief Operating Officer) is responsible for overseeing. In recent years, several investigations from this subunit raised questions concerning possible mismanagement. This is discussed, as well as financial management.

"Afghanistan apparently faced a variety of problems or developmental disadvantages, which SIGAR interviewees attributed to two main factors: poor Afghan \"institutions\" (especially the central government but, also the provinces, tribes, and local councils that oversee them) and corruption at their all levels. \"Afghanistani (translators from Dari, the Afghan language, to Russian) institutions generally lack capacity when it comes to both the management and the implementation of services to their populations\" observed SIGAR. Corruption was particularly widespread, ranging from the embezzlement of reconstruction funds (see also \"Reactions to \"the Afghanistan Papers\") by Afghan officials, contractors, or U.S. (\"non-temporary\") personnel, to the rampant drug trafficking that, (allegedly) could be traced to the tribal areas bordering U.S. bases in Afghanistan along with those in Pakistan, which SIGAR views as facilitating the drug trade between the two countries. SIGAR has been critical of a significant amount of the U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, noting that \"Afghanistan has benefited little from the $250 billion in reconstruction funds that Congress has appropriated since 2001, largely because corruption and inefficiency have hindered the government's ability to make use of many of these funds.\" SIGAR cited several instances where the U.S. military provided infrastructure or construction that later proved to be \"largely unnecessary and inefficient.\" Some of these costs were related to security, for example, to the building of high security detention centers for terrorists who posed a continuing threat to Afghan and U.S. forces. SIGAR also raised questions about the U.S. Department of Defense's \"innovation\" program in Afghanistan, with one interviewee being critical that the program, which was set up in 2018, had yet to make any tangible results, and that not even the United Nations Development Programme or USAID, which together had spent millions of dollars in Afghanistan prior to 2014, had tried to create a \"product\" that could be sold on the market. Afghanistan is the last country in the world where a large proportion of the population (over 100 percent) lives in some form of poverty, where approximately half of the adults lack the knowledge to read or even the ability to speak Dari. This \"innovation\" program began after Congress required the Secretary of Defense to develop a set of rules for U.S. forces in Afghanistan that would replace the long-defunct \"Blanket of Rules\" (which had been applied in the war against Iraq). Although the program has yet to deliver a \"product\" as SIGAR and a number of U.S. Congresspersons had hoped, one interviewee with direct knowledge agreed that Afghanistan may yet benefit from its $350 million spent to date on the innovation program.

The country has a natural interest in the U.S. economy, and it's spent a lot of effort on trade in the past decades. Now, with a change of administration in Washington, Brazil is ready to try again. Although relations with President Trump started coldly prior to and during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, both countries soon moved toward a more conciliatory posture. Although both governments have expressed concerns about the other's actions, Brazil's Bolsonaro administration has been willing to pursue expanded bilateral economic and security cooperation. In addition, the political pendulum in this country is being redirected toward the center. During the first presidential term of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002), the governing PSDB promoted a sweeping reform program that included the establishment of two new, separate-constitution political parties, splitting the traditional governing and opposition parties in this country. In President Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez' time (2003-2010), economic and political power continued to consolidate in the country's federal structure, prompting efforts for greater decentralization. Cardoso's successor, Lula da Silva (2003-2010), was impeached because of corruption charges in 2016, following a decade in which Brazil experienced economic instability that culminated in the financial crisis at the end of 2015 and a subsequent decline in consumer spending that impacted economic growth. As Brazil has become a global financial center, the country has been making efforts in recent years to develop its legal system and its ability to participate in international business. Although Brazil's financial system was stable before the pandemic, it has been increasingly volatile since the crisis that began in 2020. The president of Brazil's largest bank, Banco do Brasil, declared in February 2021 that the country has only a small window of time to bolster its infrastructure and economy in order to avoid a sharp downturn. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to prolong Brazil\u00e2s economic and political struggles to some degree, and the country of over 200 million citizens has been forced to implement significant new sanitary measures to contain the spread of the virus. For much of its history, Brazil fought off other nations along its western border, which was a hotbed for guerrilla activities and the recruitment of Latin American terrorist groups. The southern region, mainly in the Amazon, has traditionally been more remote and difficult to defend. Brazil also had a long-standing reputation of being a country where corruption is high, and there have been allegations of influence peddling during the past ten years. The Lula da Silva government took significant steps to reform the country and combat the widespread problems through Brazil's judicial system, which had to be replaced by a court of law that operates separately from Congress and the other branches of government. Brazil's current judicial system is not dissimilar to that in Brazil in 1989, a system that has been considered by many to be antiquated. The current system is hierarchical, with judges often chosen for life and subject to few disciplinary procedures. Some in Brazil have called for sweeping reforms of this system, especially in certain states in the border region with Colombia. Brazil is also currently experiencing a number of challenges that have arisen since the 2016 impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff. Although the country's democratic and capitalist foundations remain strong, challenges from political polarization within the Brazilian Democratic Party ( BPD  or PTb ) as well as increasing threats by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been accused of corruption, have cast a shadow over Brazil's future. Despite his many critics, Bolsonaro has been a surprisingly successful leader in many respects; the first-term former banker and senator gained the presidency in 2018 on a platform of opposing corruption and tax cuts, and has been able to increase Brazil\u00e2s public-sector workforce and its economic growth during his tenure. Many Brazilians hold high hopes for the country's future, even though economic inequality remains one of the country's most significant challenges, as well as a difficult relationship with the United States, which is currently strained by a variety of issues, from trade disputes to the departure of troops from an military base in Okinawa, Japan. \"Brazil is on the ascendancy,\" remarked a Wall Street Journal commentator in December 2020. \"Now is the time for companies to focus on Brazil to gain market share, diversify, and grow sustainably.\" The BNDES, Brazil's development bank, has a projected 2011 net deficit of $21 billion, but should continue to see improving results in the coming years. In a country where foreign economic growth outperforms domestic growth, \"Brazilian companies will likely continue to be an important source of capital for foreign investment over the coming years,\" according to Brazilian business publication Rev", "The VA faces challenges in providing accessible, high-quality, and technologically advanced health care services to approximately 20.7 million veterans who reside in the United States. Rural veterans are more geographically restricted in their access to VA in-person care services, resulting in barriers to timely health care services. The VA has implemented various strategies, including the VA MISSION Act of 2018, to address access challenges to and promote seamless delivery of healthcare in collaboration with private sector vendors, such as Philips Healthcare, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile), and Walmart, Inc. (Walmart). These partnerships are intended to expand veterans' access to modern, technologically advanced health care services that can be used at any time or from any location. AUTHORIZATION In FY2019, Congress authorized P.L. 115-182, VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act, increasing the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to expand access to the VAMC-based Health Care Networks (VANs) to serve certain Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) within the communities of their members. This will further enhance the connectivity to other health care resources from the VA's network of facilities that can be used to meet the needs of their members. In addition, Congress provided funding for VA MISSION Act, enabling the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to implement a 14-year, $43 billion Health Care Technology-Modernization and Technology Transformation Fund Program. The Secretary may use these funds to integrate IT systems in support of care-related activities, as well as implementing enterprise and program level solutions. These provisions will enhance the performance and modernized structure of VA-run medical facilities to fulfill the needs of their beneficiaries. FUTURE PROJECTIONS VA MISSION Act of 2018 enables the VA to work more closely than in the past with public and private organizations to create opportunities to implement the latest IT and technology techniques for the benefit of veterans and their families. These partnerships would serve many benefit to the members of their respective organizations in meeting their health care need to access the VA care system. VA MISSION Act of 2018 enabled the VA to enhance their access to IT services, telemetry in telehealth and the use of telehealth in general. Other current and emerging opportunities for implementation of IT and technology would be best served to meet members' interests. The VA is adapting their services to the changing health care demands, such as using technology to reduce wait times for patients and using telemedicine and telehealth to expand access to health care. Additionally, the VA has adopted other adaptive solutions to support veterans using telehealth, such as launching the Advanced Diagnostic Research Initiative (ADR) to identify and assess eligible veterans, such as veteran patients (P - 40 and P). In 2017 and 2018, the Department established a Joint Commissioning and Oversight Task Force (JPOT) as part of their Adaptive War Fighter Program (AWFP ) to develop an adaptive and integrated clinical care delivery systems for a - wide range of clinical services across a diverse continuum of care. Since 2001, VA programs have used a variety of modalities, such as telemedicine and telehealth, to meet the health care needs of their members. During that time, the VA has integrated 1 - year old innovative technologies to support and enhance the clinical care of their Veterans. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) estimates that 38.8% of Vets residing in the U.S. population suffer from PTSD. VHA's 9th Annual Survey of Health Care Access to Veterans and their Families (VA's, n.d.) in FY2019 revealed that 63% of Veterans and their families have been served by a Veterans Health Care Provider. In the past decade, a 6 million decrease or a 14.8% decrease occurred in the number of new Veterans coming to work at the VA, such as civilian positions in the Health Care System or Physician Corps. The Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAG) is comprised of four medical centers that provide the necessary medical and related services to their enrolled Veterans: a) the Central California VA Health Care System of Salinas, CA (Salinas, CA) b) the VA Southeast Louisiana Health Care System of Hammond, LA (Hammond, LA) c) Central California VA Hospital of Fresno, CA (Fresno, CA) and d) the VA Connecticut Health Care System of West Haven, CT (West Haven, CT). The Health Care Service of the Armed Forces (HSAF) program was established on February 10, 1946, and the program has undergone a variety of changes over time. The program provides free, comprehensive, primary and preventive health care coverage for Veterans, their dependents, and other eligible persons. HSAF offers Veterans in-person primary health care services and access to health care care by phone that are designed", "The COVID-19 pandemic is now pervasive within USMS. The vast range of authorities BOP has to handle prisoners suggests the organization has experience responding to a wide variety of communicable diseases. When BOP had COVID-19, the agency initiated various measures to prevent a massive spread of the virus among USMS' prisoners. For this reason, defendants in the USMS custody are required to adhere to BOP's directives for preventing the spread of COVID-19 that are set out below. Those in BOP custody who are at risk of serious complications if they contract the virus would have access to medical care under the BOP COVID-19 action plan. The CDC advises that prisoners should be provided with access to medication to relieve the symptoms of COVID-19 if they are exposed to an infection; the BOP COVID-19 action plan ensures that federal prisoners \u00e2\u0090\u008bare given access to such treatment. The action plan also takes measures to ensure the COVID-19 outbreak is limited and quarantines are conducted in accordance with the CDC\u00e2s guidelines \u00e2\u00a2 Implementing hygiene protocols throughout all prisoner facilities, including the screening of prisoners for symptoms of COVID-19; \u00e2\u00a2 Instituting widespread screenings to detect early signs of COVID-19; \u00e2\u00a2 Decontaminating prisoner housing units and cells to minimize the spread of COVID-19;\u00e2\u00a2 Enlisting prisoners in the manufacture, distribution, or delivery of critical supplies for medical, healthcare, and prison services;\u00e2\u00a2 Establishing procedures to monitor inmates in isolation without the use of prison\u00e2\u00a2 Implementing CDC guidelines throughout all USGS facilities at the National Park Service sites and other federal agencies that contract with USGS; and \u00e2\u00a2 Implementing CDC guidelines throughout all prisons and correctional facilities in jurisdictions under federal oversight at the Department of Justice.

ED also needs to know that each district has procedures in place for collecting, tracking, and evaluating funds from a school district for major renovation, repair, or restoration of public school infrastructure. ED wants districts that will require federal assistance to know its commitment to cooperate in any areas where the federal government determines that ED must play a role in the process. ED also needs to learn how many districts typically use federal building maintenance funding, in addition to the size of federal building maintenance funding each district intends to dedicate. There appears from ED\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis that only a limited number of district leaders have been informed in writing of their responsibility to make funding decisions that would require ED to play a role, in the event of a major renovation or re-construction project. A large number of districts will have to undertake these responsibilities. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) writes to each district in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153", "The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, P.L. 115-97 provided significant changes to the federal income tax system, including lowering rates, expanding deductions, and reducing tax liability for individuals without children. In 2017, the individual income tax deduction was lowered from $7,500 to $5,000, and the corporate income tax rate dropped from 35% (before the introduction of the income tax deduction) to 15%. There was also a reduced business tax rate from 28% to 25%, and individual income tax deductions were eliminated for medical expenses. There was no change in Social Security taxes, but the maximum income tax rate was lowered from 39.6% to 35%. Additionally, an increase in the child tax credit made the child tax credit available to a larger range of taxpayers, as well as an increase in the standard deduction amount. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will result in a reduction of federal income tax rates, a corporate tax rate reduction, an individual income tax deduction increase, and a $25 billion cut in other taxes over a 10-year period. While a few private analysts predicted the tax cut would result in an increase in economic growth, they were overwhelmed by numerous predictions to the contrary. Economic effects of the Act depend on multiple variables, such as the economy's capacity to absorb the demand for investment and output of businesses, which is likely to be less than estimates; the speed at which businesses change their investment patterns; and possible tax changes in the future. It may require many years before an accurate prediction is possible. In the short-term, certain effects of the Act, such as a surge in consumer spending, were widely discussed, while others such as the effects on business investment and short-term job opportunities are less likely to be seen. Some effects, such as deficits, are also likely to grow in the near future (unless the economy strengthens in the medium-term), while long-term effects remain possible, and a large fraction of the Act will come to fruition in approximately 10 years.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered individual and corporate income tax rates, while increasing the child tax credit and standard deduction amount. The Act's timing had effects on economic growth rates, with a short-term rise in consumer spending followed by a long-term decline if the economy strengthens. The Act could result in a surge in consumer spending and reduced deficits.\nSource: House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means", "This report was prepared for the Department of the Interior by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The act of Congress that first authorized tax payments for eligible local governments (Section 6902) was first implemented in 1976 and amended in 2008 with provisions for Section 6906- Funding. PILT payments, primarily made in installments each year, are computed and disbursed by OMB. The Department of the Interior (DOI) is responsible for the payment under PILT. There has been a debate in Congress regarding what \"necessary sums\" are to fund PILT. The House and Senate Budget Committees disagree on how PILT should be amended; the House Budget Committee favors the current format whereby funds are disbursed annually by the Department of the Interior, while the Senate Budget Committee proposes amendments that would provide an annual appropriation for the amount needed. Members of Congress who share the DOI's concerns regarding PILT have introduced legislation that would amend PILT annually to avoid confusion on a continuing basis. PILT has been an important economic development tool in areas where the tax base is small and resources limited. It is also used when tax revenues from a population that is relatively rural are small. Members of Congress have discussed several issues related to PILT, such as questions regarding how to fund the program, which types of federal lands should be eligible, how to calculate payments under PILT on lands used as grazing, hunting, or wilderness areas, the minimum population threshold for eligibility, which types of units of local government are eligible for PILT, whether tax payments to the government were allowed under PILT, (1) and the amount of PILT payments. Other questions discussed in this report include how an assessment of the cost of PILT would inform the amount of funds appropriated for the program, as well as whether new legislation will address the PILT payments' current duration of 50 years. Although Members of Congress have historically considered PILT reform, it appears likely that the authorization for annual appropriations will continue to be the primary mechanism of payments under this program. Several recommendations are provided below that are intended to help Members of Congress and agencies in planning their annual budgets pertaining to PILT. The first suggestion to members involved in a discussion regarding PILT payments pertains to what the legislation provides to the amount of PILT payments for a county or other eligible unit of local government. The current legislation allows annual payments, a total of $9 million in FY2019, as is current. The second suggestion addressed the amount of each payment made annually to PILT. Members discussed a possible need for a $3 million reduction in the amount annually provided to eligible local governments. Members of Congress also discussed the effect of tax changes proposed by a recent Congressional tax reform bill affecting the amount of PILT payments in various scenarios. Members of Congress have expressed the desire for a more streamlined and standardized payment program that takes into account differences between the payments made by different states. They have also talked about changes in the process of calculating the amount of PILT payments. Members of Congress also have discussed an increase in the size of PILT payments to 250 percent (i.e., a $25,000 annual payment). Members of Congress were concerned about the administrative burden that is placed upon all local governments that receive PILT payments from OMB to ensure these payments are correctly distributed. Members discussed whether the payments should continue for 50 years or just a further 10 years as currently proposed by OMB. Several Members of Congress also discussed issues regarding the \"necessary sums\" to fund the PILT program, the role of OMB/DOI in the PILT payments and \"PIPT\" (1) a proposal to displace PILT. Another issue addressed in this report was whether members of Congress and the various agencies involved would be able to provide assistance to their constituents or communities with their own PILT payments, as was requested by one Member. For example, an amendment was introduced in the House that would make the PILT payments from OMB for eligible units of local government an option that could be used by members of Congress. Members of Congress discussed making changes in PILT that would impact their local government jurisdictions in several areas, such as the number of payments that can be made annually by each city, municipality, or county. Several topics were also discussed that occurred in the 2005 reauthorization of PILT, including a review of OMB's review of PILT (e.g., number of units of financial accounting or tax return required), the effects on property or land values, and the geographic location across which PILT payments are generally required to be made. Several Members of Congress mentioned concerns about the size and complexity of their own local government organizations in which they were responsible for the administration of PILT payments. Members who are responsible for the administration of federal benefits", "ARRA funding for infrastructure spending was $48.1 billion. The main recipient was the Army Corps of Engineers, which received $4 billion. The funding was mostly used on: 1. Road infrastructure, 2. Federal transit, 3. State and local roads, bridges, and transit systems, and 4. Airport and commercial port infrastructure. ARRA was the largest federal stimulus package at $787 billion, with more than half going to highways. Economic stimulus funding through ARRA ranged from transportation networks to renewable energy and other projects. DOT-administered ARRA funds were used to complete 14 infrastructure project types totaling $36 billion.

The bill also establishes the Administrative Capital Trust Fund, which is established and will be available for use until September 30, 2025, or until the date of enactment of a GSA reauthorization, whichever occurs first. The bill also provides funding for the Internal Revenue Service Taxpayer Advocate Service to continue operations until September 30, 2025. The bill also includes several other legislative provisions. AUTHORIZATION: The bill also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to borrow up to $7 billion in FY2019, which can be used to finance federal investments, including among others housing, and related activities. The bill also authorizes federal funds through GSA or Treasury to be used to maintain certain facilities that are required to be operated during normal business hours by employees of the Federal Executive Branch. The bill also authorizes these federal funds to be used to make certain payments owed to persons and entities, including among others vendors. The bill also authorizes the Federal Financial Services Commission (FFFIE) to use GSA administrative funds to support the operations of the FFBI, of which the President has been the Secretary. This includes hiring personnel. The bill also authorizes the Financial Services and Markets Advisory Council (FS/MA) and the Council on Financial Broadcasting (CFBF) to use OMB administrative funds, which was modified, making that the $10.4 million ( FY2016) that each of these organizations were authorized to borrow is reduced to $7.5 million for FY2019, and $7.5 million for FY2020, with the funding capped at $10 million per fiscal year between FY2006 and FY2020, respectively. The bill also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to carry out GSA functions until September 30, 2025, when the administrative functions are moved over to GSA. The bill also clarifies that the President may authorize further payments of GSA funds, which are not subject to any reporting requirements under the Financial Services and Markets Commission Act of 1936 ( FSMC ). REPORTING: The bill also removes existing reporting requirements pertaining to non-federal employees and makes it possible for the Commission to review the salaries and expenses of the employees at each federal agency. The bill also amends the GSA Mission Report to provide the public with additional details about the agencies that are subject to the Act and with respect to which OMB is authorized to submit an Annual Performance Report and Information Technology Report. The report also amends the FSMC to authorize Treasury to reimburse the Federal Executive Service for the costs of administering FSMA. The bill also authorizes a new Federal Executive Pay/Leave Report and a Federal Employees Health Care Flex Spending/Linking Account Amendment, which will be established and modified accordingly. An Annual Performance Report will be required of the Secretary of the Treasury on behalf of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council by December 1, 2019 for each of the federal financial regulatory agencies. The Annual Report also authorizes Treasury to coordinate and provide Federal agencies with the assistance to implement systems for capturing data relating to employee retention, time and attendance, leave, performance, and misconduct. The report also authorizes Treasury to require all federal agencies to develop a plan to increase the percentage of federal employees receiving pay based on the 12-hour day and work less than full-time, to implement GSA policies and practices relating to the hiring and retention of non-federal employees, and in general. Additionally, the bill amends the Federal Executive Pay Act (FEPA) to allow federal employees and contractors to receive and report FEPA medical benefits benefits and leave benefits. The FEPA provisions apply FEPA-covered federal employees under the Age Discrimination Act ( ADA ). H.Res. 1106 S.Res. 1046 and 1072 AUTHORIZATION: Several agencies and subdivisions receive funding and mandates in FY2019. One of the largest provisions of FSGG appropriations also authorizes funding for GSA. Several sections of the bill also authorize certain agencies to authorize payments to the general government, including GSA. BANK SECURITY SYSTEM: The bill also provides to Treasury for deposit insurance for the Bank Insurance Regulatory Authority (BINRA) in accordance with the Treasury Act of 1933. There are 4 Treasury bills in this package of FSGG appropriations. The first two, H.Res. 1144 and H.R. 6231, were reported at FSFG in September, 2018. There is no GSA Act or funding for GSA reauthorization, either of which would provide the basis for any Treasury bill. ( H.Res", "The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, P.L. 116-139, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Act, P.L. 116-143, both increased the authorization limit, the direct appropriation in Section A of P.L. 116-639 to the CARES Act, and provided emergency EIDL grants. The Paycheck Protection Program, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, and Small Business Grant Applications Act, S. 3721 H.R. 1665, E.L. L. 2020, S.R. 2566, P.L. 116-152 H.R. 532, E.L. 2020, P.L. 115-271, and P.L. 116-420 H.R. 636, E.L. L. 2020, made the Small Business Administration's emergency disaster relief loans available for economic injury disaster loans, but only available to small business concerns. The Act also repealed the moratorium provisions contained in its text. It further appropriated $30 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ($10B for the program's direct lender subsidy program and $20B for Small Business Administration EIDL loans), EIDL application fee ($800), and small business loans in the form of SBA loans ($750 million per week of the CARES Act's provisions). H.R. 4533, P.L. 116-163, and S.R. L. 2020, made various changes to the CARES Act's provisions, including appropriating $3 billion for small business loans. The CARES Act extended through 2020 the application window to apply for the SBA's $1-billion loan programs in connection with COVID-19. The application deadline for the Small Business Administration's loans for economic injury disaster loans, small business loans not exceeding $2 million, and loans for small business lines of credit was increased to $750 million per week from April 25, 2020, through December 31, 2020. The act also extended the CARES Act's unemployment payments provision through August 2020, and $15/week to make up for it for certain employees whose weekly wages were reduced or otherwise reduced ($45,000 per year). A previous measure contained in P.L. 116-639, but not enacted into law, is to extend the CARES Act payroll tax suspension amount for an additional four weeks beginning August 4, 2020. If enacted, the new amount would remain until the Treasury publishes its monthly revenue estimates starting May 2021. The Treasury secretary and the head of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) were able to make a joint commitment to offer small business guidance and lending, as the COVID-19 pandemic had unprecedented effects on such businesses. In making that commitment, many lenders have reported they would continue to provide loans to small businesses that were not able to access traditional business loans from commercial banks due to the lending freeze triggered by the pandemic. The Treasury Department was able to report to Congress in April 2020 on how quickly its loan application process could be scaled up, noting that loans of up to $5 billion of each year will be processed each week and that the small business lending programs will be made available beginning May 2020. The Treasury Secretary and Commissioner of the Small Business Administration both stated that the Treasury Department was available to help small businesses get access to loans from lenders on the PPP application website. When the CARES Act was enacted, the Treasury, SBA, and the Federal Reserve announced that lenders would now be able to provide loans to small businesses up to $3 billion per application. The lending is made available through the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loan program of up to $5 million. The loan authorization for the EIDL program has been extended from previous limit of $1 billion. The H.R. 3643 stimulus measure (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) established a $300 billion fund for the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (P.L. 116-638). H.R. 4523, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Economic Relief Act (P.L. 116-453), established a $3 billion fund for SBA loans in Section 402 of the EIDL Act (P.L. 116-433). Two additional stimulus H.R. 4642, the Coronavirus Supplemental Appropriations Act (C.R.S. #H.R.4403), established additional resources within the Small Business Administration to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic. H.R. 2301, The Emergency Economic Injury Disclosure Act (P.L. 116-131), established new requirements for loan application approvals. The bill", "Economic sanctions are one foreign policy tool that can be used to theoretically influence the behavior and actions of political leadership in other countries. Currently, only economic sanctions applied by the United States to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have a definitive impact on oil production, supply, and trade. To date, there have been indications of declining global oil production in Iran and significant increases in U.S. production in both 2018 and 2019, despite trade sanctions. Iranian oil production has been an estimated approximately 2.7 million bar", "Consumer finance encompasses various products and markets in which households finance their lives.

The judges are initially nominated by the President to be considered by Congress for a \"life\" term \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 and are to be compensated. The size of the judiciary is determined by Congress. In 1790, Article III of the Constitution authorized 22 district court judgeships, but Congress made the number later rise and eventually pass the Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized 13 judgeships for U.S. district courts. Today, there are 82 Article III U.S. district judge positions. Each of the 82 is authorized by Congress for a life term. Since Article III is one of the most comprehensive provisions in the U.S. Constitution, the courts provide a critical check on Congress. They check federal actions by the executive branch for which they are created and for which Congress has the power to make them. Courts serve as the ultimate check on Congress during election years, and the courts can block laws that violate the Constitution. In addition, the courts provide a level of protection by the threat of judicial review to federal actions by the executive branch. The courts also serve as a check on the power of the other branches of government by creating and enforcing limits on judicial power. For example, plaintiffs in civil actions must prove their case by presenting evidence, whereas, in criminal actions, the accused must be proven guilty by a higher degree of proof than that required in civil cases. Thus, the courts have created a system of law to ensure a fair trial for each individual in society, in addition to being a check on the power of Congress (the U.S. courts\u00e2\u00a2 role in the separation of power between the executive and legislative branch).", "This report provides some historical context to the illicit supply chain for drugs destined for the opioid crisis in the United States. The authors present the illicit drug supply chain diagram, showing how drugs begin in natural sources. They discuss drug trade data and the opioid epidemic. To illustrate the opioid epidemic, data on drug flows are shown with statistics. They also discuss how drug use in China's Hong Kong and Macau are affecting the country, as well as the country's strategy for countering drug use.\nThe illicit drug supply chain begins with the natural production of drugs in source countries. As a consequence, the production and supply of illicit drugs destined for the United States begin in the illegal supply chains of production, cultivation, and trafficking. As these...\nWhat follows is a brief illustration of the drug cultivation supply chain, from source production to the United States. The article will illustrate drug production data, as well as the opioid data that appears to be driving much of the recent discussion surrounding the national opioid epidemic. With respect to the opioid epidemic, historical data shows that heroin production in Asia, once the largest market for illicit drugs in the world, peaked in the late 2000s, and that production has been dropping since 2015, largely due to Western demand. These historical decreases show that in East Asia, opioid addiction has been rising significantly since the mid-2000s. Since 2015, there have been an estimated 13,200 deaths in South Korea, and 7,400 deaths in Taiwan. These trends have been mirrored in East Europe and the United States. Data has also shown that since 2013, there has been a 13% decrease in opioid deaths in Great Britain and Canada. However, in the United States, the opioid death rate per one million population has remained stable since 2011, and has declined or stagnated since 2017. The US-China bilateral meeting on opium production was held online July 15 to discuss a new initiative to reduce the illicit opioid use within the Guangdong province in Southern China. China already has a well-established process for the authentication of drugs, and is exporting opioid drugs to the Middle East. Despite this, China faces a challenge because opioid abuse among opioid products are increasing. The Chinese drug trade operates through three levels, with each higher level taking a percentage of overall revenues from drug sales. With China's booming drug industry, it is no surprise that they are also facing significant challenges to illicit drug supply. To illustrate the current state of illicit drug supply in China, data has been compiled of the most trafficked drugs in Guangdong province in 2020 including: methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, and hydrocodone. Due to their relatively recent inclusion on the list of known opioid compounds entering China's markets since 2015. According to the National Law Enforcement Initiative (NLEI), opioid shipments that originated in China increased two-fold from 2015 to 2020, even though China has exported thousands of millions of ounces of opioids to the US over that same period. Since 2019, seizures of drugs being shipped to the U.S. have taken place in multiple locations along the East China Sea, including Guangzhou and Hong Kong. In 2020, the NLEI found that opioid drug shipments from China...\nThe illicit drug supply chain begins in the illegal supply chains of production, cultivation, and trafficking. As a result, current drug production data, and opioid data in particular, can be seen as the opioid epidemic is beginning to rise. Historically, Japan had been the leading global consumer market for pharmaceuticals, with the supply of drugs and...\nIn this article, the illicit drug supply chain is beginning at the point of its production, in particular focusing on the origin of Asian production of heroin, the supply chain from Asian production to the United States, and where opioid use is declining. Additionally, opioid death rates and opioid use are also declining...", "In the wake of a government collapse in March 2020, Kosovo has seen its share of political instability and has faced deep economic challenges in the wake of COVID-19.

One of the biggest topics for discussion in U.S. relations with Poland in recent years is non-European migrant issues. The country has a population of just under 38 million citizens, of which over 90% are native-Polish. Law and Justice leader has been a divisive figure in Poland.

A wide range of EVs and PHEV models are now in service, and annual sales have accelerated by over 80%. Even though PHEV range is now around that of the average light vehicle, these vehicles' sales share is below 2%, while electric vehicles collectively make up a share of around 2%. New electric vehicles are still expensive, with prices comparable to those of traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. \"Motor vehicles are moving inexorably towards a new electric future, as the cost of batteries as well as their range has improved and as global consumers' desire for clean air and renewable energy has been awakened.\" -- 2020 EV Sales Forecast by Navigators EV Sales Forecast, 2020", "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a U.S. tool designed to provide a dependable supply during emergency situations. When established in the 1970s, the SPR was the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, but has been superseded. A focus on supply disruptions during the 2000s and the need to provide limited protection against the consequences of power outages led to the creation of the SPR and continued expansion to 2019. However, as the SPR's role evolves, Congress's motivation behind its creation shifts to that of providing access to crude oil within the U.S. to specific, designated users, such as the military, to stabilize markets, help offset the effects of supply shortages, and lessen the likelihood of high oil prices due to geopolitical factors. Several events including OPEC supply interruptions, price-driven shale oil booms, and the COVID-related demand for U.S. crude oil have led to an over-supply market and SPR's role in managing the potential risks. The SPR continues to serve a unique purpose in providing a secure supply of limited quantities of U.S. crude oil during a disruption during an emergency. The text is divided into categories: historical setup, supply, demand, product types and markets, SPR creation, SPR size, SPR actions, SPR obligations, and SPR's impact on markets and energy security. In summary, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) serves multiple purposes in managing a potential crisis for consumers and industries by offering secure access to a U.S. supply of limited quantities of crucial, non-renewable natural resources during a crisis or emergency.", "table as opposed to 15%, which is the WEP formula for general- or active-component military personnel). For military personnel in 2020 as well, the second replacement factor (32%) is also applicable. The WEP reduction for people with 11 to 23 years of YOCs (referred to as the WEP reduction factor) is 13% (or 5% per YOC) in 2020. After 2020, the WEP reduction factor is determined each year based on projected economic growth, so the WEP reduction is a percentage of the PIA. The WEP\u00e2\u0080\u0089 reduction formula is applied after adjusting earnings AIME. At 2020 ages of 25 to 50, the two replacement factors have equivalent percentages (90% and 48% as opposed to 49%). The WEP reduction formula is applied after calculating the PIA for a worker in 2020, with COLAs continuing after the age of 50. Starting in 2020, the WEP reduction formula applied to people with less YOCs decreases to a minimum at age 50. Starting in 2025, the WEP reduction formula applies to people starting by 60 years of age regardless of the number of years covered of WEP AIME (a minimum of the PIA in that year) until age 65, but the formula is still applied after adjusting the earnings AIME. By age 65, the WEP reduction formula applies regardless of the number of years covered of WEP AIME. Since 2022, the WEP reduction factors have (not yet) been reduced, unlike the past 26 years. The WEP reduction factor, 13%, was reduced on December 31, 2018, when the 5% percent increase in economic growth was applied in 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u201d2025, causing the maximum reduction of 5 years that can be applied at age 65. The WEP reduction formula applies (with COLAs) to people in 2024\u00e2\u20ac\u201d2025 but after the age of 50 in 2023. To apply the WEP reduction formula after the 2.5% economic growth rate applied in 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2025, the calculation should change from the formula used for 2020, 2021, and 2022 to the new formula described below beginning 2023.

The inquiry, which is conducted at times in front of a standing committee or a special committee, is under the direct authority and control of the House. Once the investigation (the standing investigation) is initiated, the House can appoint a committee by resolution to investigate other alleged offenses against the Constitution. While these committee investigations may be done on a standing schedule, the House must schedule the impeachment investigation within 15 legislative days if the Member initiating the inquiry requests such. The Judiciary Committee typically will review the petition and conduct the standing investigation. As part of Article II of the Constitution, impeaching the \"PRESIDENT\" is 10th Amendment issue as it is Congress' decision to impeach and not under the Judiciary. The Constitution gives the H.Clinton administration the right to review lower court Judge's decision using a standard process. While the Judiciary Committee has its own procedures, it is subject to House authority to resolve the point. If impeached by the House and convicted, the President's sentence is only one year or the duration of the Senate's tenure or the shorter of the two, whichever shall expire first. A person impeached while a Member in Congress or within 120 years after the U.S. Constitution was adopted has in the past been referred to Congress to protect its Members. The U.S..\" Members may refer Articles of impeachment to the jury or a grand jury. If the majority of jurors or a grand jury return a guilty verdict, the Member would then be authorized to call impeachment. To avoid confusion over this step and Article III, the author has used the legal term \"prosecutor pro quo\" to make the term understandable in everyday terms. The term used to describe the act of filing a criminal offense \"in exchange for a benefit like a large contract or to protect other guilty parties.\" Under the Constitution, the House may call witnesses directly in the impeachment proceedings. During the investigation and of the impeachment trial, the Member offering the motion may make an announcement that Congress will consider impeachment; however, there is no time limit on resolving the impeachment process. Once Article III is reached by the full House, Articles I and II are in effect and will follow. If there is a valid impeachment, then only a court trial would remain to be decided, and the House would have an hour to make up its own case. Article III must be reached in the impeachment process before the trial; otherwise, Congress will have to wait, and go to court. If the impeachment process is brought without the consent of the person being impeached, the person shall receive on the floor of the House of Representatives or in the House gallery the same protections as other Members present in the House for trial. In any case, a Member of the House offering the impeachment can withdraw the motion, and the U.S. House resolves the issue. An impeachable or removable high office official would be suspended until a conviction is overturned by the appropriate judicial process. Article III of Article I also applies to impeachment proceedings. The impeachment can proceed even in the absence of the President, if Congress agrees. The impeachment process (Article XXIII) and the conviction (Article III) shall apply to members of Congress only until the 1.5% rate established in Article I can be challenged. If the process is not carried through at the rate of at least one-and-a-half percent, then no member subject to impeachment will be subjected to this process. When the Senate reaches its second-largest jury to 2% of Senate members, it calls the person it has convicted of the crime being tried, the \"prosecutor pro quo\" to determine if trial should be conducted or in a courtroom. In a majority jury or jury of two-thirds, the Senate must determine if a person has committed an offense, and if that person can be prosecuted. The Senate is not permitted by law to determine if a person's actions were within the confines of the constitution, Article II or article I. In a unanimous vote, the Senate will take its action to either remove the person from office or acquit a person found guilty thereof. Both impeachment and trial rights shall be preserved for each House member.\nB Y S M A W C U T H A J A P O U L A I U M E T H P O V V E T H D N P S R R ST S T A P L E WTH IN B O A D TO CONSTRUCT TR", "An independent, not-for-profit organization offering the latest research on federal health care and education coverage.", "Technological convergence is a complex and evolving concept involving increasingly closer integration and transformation of independent technologies.

However, the complexity, cost, and reliability of these services depend on the specific model of cloud service being used, and sometimes on the user's specific needs. A wide range of providers of cloud computing services is offered, but it is often unclear who owns and provides the underlying hardware resources. NIST has identified four characteristics of cloud computing. On-demand self-service: Users can directly access desired cloud computing resources from service providers with very minimal set-up or operational actions. This enables users to access cloud services they do not need on a regular basis, thus avoiding a per-unit charge for the services. Access to resources no matter where in the world a user resides. Broad network access: Using the Internet, a user may access computing resources from any location. Users can use their home PC and Internet service in a cafe or hotspot location. Data storage on physical servers is expensive. Cloud-based applications and services need to be regularly and reliably updated. Cloud Computing: Agencies Are Taking Up Cloud, Including IT Infrastructure Services. Agencies have been moving applications and services onto the cloud for several years. The more extensive a cloud, the more complex and the cost the migration. Most agencies have adopted the cloud for data storage, but have needed guidance from the Department of Defense on how to adopt the cloud. While the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has been assisting agencies in the cloud, the Office of Information Security (OIS) has not been involved. The report found that agencies could benefit from DISA and its Security Information Operations Support Team for Cloud-based assessments. A number of agencies have also been moving their mission-related applications, including financial and HR-related systems, onto the cloud. But this has been hindered by the lack of cloud-based security in place in federal IT environments that are more than likely to be the government's next big cloud-based implementation. Even as agencies continue to move towards the cloud infrastructure, there's still the question as to how agencies are ensuring their data is secure by moving data onto a cloud-based network. NIST has identified four models of cloud computing, each with their pros and cons depending on the user, the IT environment, and the amount of flexibility and control required by the user or their clients. The four types of cloud computing systems are as follows: Public clouds: Users do not have the responsibility or control over the infrastructure resources; resources are managed by the cloud providers. A user can access these cloud resources on an on-demand basis, at any location in the world. Examples of public cloud providers are Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Services, and Microsoft Azure. Personal clouds: A user has access to and manages their own resources, although they also access and use the provider's services. A user can directly access certain resources at a time and other users or clients can access them depending on the user's needs. Example of personal cloud products, such as Dropbox, are available. Personal clouds also offer a personal-only cloud solution. Hybrid clouds: Personal and public clouds in one system. Each user or tenant can make their own resource requests. The government can then decide whether to outsource its resources and manage the provider or use its own compute and storage capabilities. Data migration is a potential option and the government can decide to outsource the migration. Examples of hybrid cloud providers are Google Cloud and Adobe's Creative Cloud. The hybrid cloud concept is still evolving and cloud providers are attempting to find how to deliver data from their customer's cloud while still using their physical infrastructure. According to NIST, some of the largest risks to cloud adoption are the need for cloud-based IT and infrastructure and services management. The report also highlights other issues, including the lack of clarity and the difficulty in determining the actual costs of cloud adoption. NIST also provided guidance on what federal IT leaders should do when implementing a cloud-based system, including selecting a cloud provider that meets their requirements, defining a secure storage environment for data, and defining a strategy for cloud-based data and application migration. In addition, NIST made recommendations on where applications were appropriate in each cloud scenario and how security risk management should be conducted. This report is designed to help federal cloud managers understand the current state of cloud computing and what areas they should focus on when moving to the cloud, such as data migration. It is also designed for IT leaders and CIOs who are planning to move the government's systems", "After three large crises 9/11, the Great Recession, and more recent the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has created multiple commissions to gain broader expert perspectives on policy-making response. While there may be disagreement on whether a commission structure, its composition, or its time frame is optimal, there appears to be no doubt about the commission's benefit in facilitating Congressional oversight in emergency situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. While H.R. 5945's provisions regarding commission membership, compensation, and its ability to serve \"in an advisory capacity\" differ substantially from the five proposed commissions -- H.R. 6429, H.R. 6431, H.R. 6440, H.R. 6431, and H.R. 6548 -- H.R. 5945 remains a very broad measure in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the pandemic, it seems to be a better fit for H.R. 6431 (the Made in America Emergency Preparedness Act), H.R. 6432 (the Pandemic Rapid Response Act of 2020), H.R. 6455 (the Nation and COVID-19 Pandemic Response Act of 2020), H.R. 662 (the COVID-19 Relief and Economic Security Act, HR 6435, the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Accountability Act, HR 6395, HR 6427 (the COVID Pandemic Business Relief Act), HR 6438 (the Emergency Health and Care Provider Response and Recovery Act, HR 6431 (the Pandemic Treatment and Prevention Act), and HR 6432 ((the COVID-19 Response Authorization and Provider Relief Act), H.B. 2769 (COVID-19 Recovery Bill) and H.R. 6370 (COVID-19 Emergency Funding Act). A more recent version of H.R. 6431, introduced by Representative Bennie Thompson, has only one remaining Republican member (Representative Elise Stefanik) along with five Democrats. Another variation of the five proposed commissions is that H.R. 6428's time-line of three months to complete its findings and recommendations and the three-year time frame of H.R. 6429 are both less than the three-year time frame of the COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Financial Relief Act, as originally introduced. Finally, while H.R. 5945 will provide the flexibility for the commission to operate with greater public assistance and transparency than the current COVID-19 Pandemic Unit, it is possible that future legislation may expand the scope of an existing advisory entity like H.R. 6458 or H.R. 6500, the Health Care Advisory Commission, which is part of H.R 662 (COVID-19 Relief and Economic Security Act), without additional Commission legislation. In either event, H.R. 5945, H.R. 6103, or H.R. 662 will only be effective (under the law) for a short-term time period, such as only one-year. Each of the five recommended proposals would expire from the final enactment through the Congressional year ending in December 2021 at the latest. Because these commissions are temporary, they would expire after they either complete their work or finish their respective term of office. Each of the five recommended proposals has a wide range of time frames from one to two years, indicating that they are not permanent. The commissions may expire after each year if no other legislative process is in the works during that year. The commissions are limited to a limited number of commissioners and a limited scope of investigation. In the last century, Congress has established and used independent commissions to provide insight into both the policy and operational aspects of government affairs. H.R. 5945 (HR6005) has significant similarities to most of these commissions, including 9/11 Commission, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission)[2], Health Care Advisory Commission, HR 662 (COVID-19 Relief and Economic Security Act)[3] (not enacted), Health Care Advisory Commission, HR 6431 - Pandemic Relief and Response Act (P.R.A.P.R. Act)[4] (signed into law in March 2020), and HR 6612 (The Economic Relief Package)[5] (also signed as P.R.A.R). The COVID-19 Pandemic Response Act of 2020 (HR 641 (Omnibus Appropriations bill)[6] allows Congress to establish a variety of Commission-style bodies to perform certain duties. These include the Commission on Civil Rights (HR 3261)[7], the International Trade Commission (HR 600) [3] (not enacted), the Tax Education", "In 2019, USDA announced a revised $16 billion trade aid package to assist farmers in response to specific trade damage (tariffs).

"Intercity passenger rail in America dates to rail industry's origins in the 19th century. After railroads faced financial turmoil from the early 1900s, the government intervened to preserve and improve passenger rail service. Nonetheless, railroads faced declining ridership during the 1950s to the present, and the 1980s Transportation Act created Amtrak. Additionally, the 4R Act and NEEPRA required travel times of 3 hours and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 40 minutes in 1981, but 2001's SAFRA Act was unable to meet these goals. In 2010, Congress passed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (RRA), which enabled Amtrak to acquire railroads, infrastructure, and rolling stock to improve service. While RRA helped renew rail infrastructure in certain areas, the financial situation facing railroads remains shaky. Federal support for railroads has come in various forms since their inception, and continues with tax-preferred contributions from municipalities and states, but railroads continue to face financial challenges. (\u00c2\u00812) \u00c2\u00812 PLS \u00c2\u00a2\u00c2\u00b3 12/17/2018\nIntercity passenger rail in America dates to rail industry's origins in the 19th century. As common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, railroad companies built hundreds of miles of track across the country offering both freight and passenger transportation, making the distinction between a freight railroad and a passenger railroad a relatively recent one.

Due to the 2014 Russian sanctions, however, there have been recent congressional calls for an EELV program to ensure U.S. access to space launch services at a lower cost. The NSSL program consists of launch vehicles, a comprehensive facility for preparation of launch vehicles and rockets, and various support tools and services. These support tools and services are produced by a variety of companies both in and outside the U.S., including key national space launch system developers: Aerojet Rocketdyne, Boeing, ULA, SpaceX, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), and more.", "Congress maintains an ongoing interest in the pace of U.S. innovation and technological advancement due to its influence on the economy, national security, public health, and other national goals. Historically, Congress established a number of research and development (R&D) institutions to implement federal R&D policies during the mid-20 th century. Most fall into a \u201cquasi-governmental\u201d category. Various government agencies, such as the NIH and NSF, provide research funding with federal dollars. A federal entity structure, such as the National Institutes of Health, is used in a number of cases. Some existing mechanisms, such as an agency-related nonprofit research foundation, have seen use from Congress in recent decades. These organizations have been utilized for years, to varying degrees across various federal agencies. Although the creation of \u201cpower centers\u201d (like the National Security Technology Office) to promote science and technological advancements can help drive innovation, they can also be compared to \u201cquagmires.\u201d These organizations can be difficult to manage due to their breadth and number of responsibilities, while their impact may be limited. Some of their powers may extend beyond existing laws for the purpose of providing a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d If these government entities expand their mandates beyond existing law, they could be subject to the provisions of Title 5, Chapter 5, which regulates executive employees. Congress may need to adjust these provisions to ensure they can more effectively govern these quasi-governmental organizations. Additionally, Congress may be concerned about conflicts of interests among employees and contractors. One potential issue is if the government has a financial relationship with a research foundation. Congress likely would want to prevent an agency-or-company-level conflict of interest. Although conflicts between contractors and subcontractors are not unusual, Congress should make every effort to prevent them. If conflicts arise in areas, such as the advancement of a project, Congress could try to resolve them by creating a new entity to handle the issues. However, the risk of a costly lawsuit would lead to a potential concern about whether the cost can be justified. The potential for conflict of interest also raises questions about the oversight of a research foundation. Congressional action on a proposal for increased executive power over a research entity may lead to additional governance. The National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, and other major research institutions are overseen by an established government of scientists, each with distinct scientific mandates. Congress may need to create a separate entity for these organizations in order to prevent them from being part of its regular legislative process. A benefit of a quasi-governmental organization is its ability to hire researchers and contractors to carry out research. This process was set up based on a \u201cpublic, private, or nonprofit\u201d model. The idea is that the government regulates the funding but allows the recipient freedom to choose their contractors. In this context, all employees (or contractors) may be subject to federal laws of the sort that apply in a company or contractor. Unlike contracting, non-governmental agencies are subject to Title 5, Chapter 5 (which pertains to executive employees), but typically their funding goes outside the scope of federal contracting. An issue, though, is that contracting could be subject to a different set of federal laws than Title 5, 5C, 5A, or others, which could lead to conflicting regulations. Congress must protect contracting authorities by ensuring that federal agencies do not face contracting interference, unless Congress has deemed it necessary, or unless the contract is in compliance with federal law. The National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, and other public entities have a number of employees that handle contracting and financial management. Congress might want to create a subunit within the NIH or NIH-related private businesses that provides this support. However, the NIH has been able to do this since its passage in 1980 (NIH Rev. Act of 1980) since the NIH does not administer funds. In short, while the National Institutes of Health has been able to use the government in this way, other \u201cpublic non-profit private\u201d organizations have not received Title 5-like laws that might govern the government within. The NIH, NIH Rev. Act of 1980, and more, are discussed in the Appendix section of this report. Congress has created several quasi-governmental entities for the purpose of scientific R&D. One example is the National Institute of Information and Scientific Technology, or NIIST, within the Department of Defense () which is modeled to some degree on the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (). NIIST serves as a central clearing house or \"sinkhole\" for classified scientific R&D. Congress might need to more closely track and govern these institutions, especially in the light of ongoing intelligence-oriented research that must be regulated. The R&D tax credit also comes from Title 40 of the U.S. Code\u00e2\u00a5\u00b8\u00c2\u00a7 29B. However, it is still only one option to promote R&D. In fiscal year (FY) 201", "The U.S. Congress and Trump Administration have been debating enhanced and expanded barriers along the southwest border. The history of US border enforcement, as well as funding for border barriers, has been addressed. Border security efforts have been limited to certain regions of the border which has sparked debates over the necessity of the physical barrier construction. In-depth contextualization on recent immigration policies and the Border Patrol's strategic plan to enforce immigration laws along the US border has been provided.\nThroughout its history, the U.S. has constructed barriers and walls along its southwest border in order to enforce immigration laws and deter illegal crossing. The extent of these barriers, as well as funding methods for border security and debate surrounding the necessity of such construction, are significant components to the ongoing U.S.-Mexico border discussion. An overview of the current immigration policies, such as legal options for those without appropriate documentation, and past controversies surrounding these issues are critical elements to understanding the current discussions. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) was enacted, and Section 102(a) authorized the Attorney General to install additional physical barriers and roads in areas nearby the U.S. border. This has caused debates about the necessity of these structures and their effectiveness in deterring illegal crossing. However, the U.S. Congress has continued to allocate funds for construction of physical barriers along the border, while differing opinions have been expressed about how to efficiently enforce immigration laws on the border.", "Farm sector net farm income is projected at $96.7 billion in 20", "FY... 21.
