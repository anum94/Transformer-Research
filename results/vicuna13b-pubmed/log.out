["* Anxiety affects quality of life in people living with Parkinson's disease more than other factors such as cognitive status, motor impairment, apathy, and depression.\n* Although recent research suggests that anxiety is more common than depression in Parkinson's patients, our understanding of the relationship between anxiety and cognition, as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices, is limited and behind that of depression.\n* There are limited and inconsistent findings on the relationship between anxiety and cognition in Parkinson's disease and how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning.\n* A study aimed to examine the influence of anxiety on cognition in Parkinson's disease by directly comparing groups of patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression.\n* The study included 17 patients with anxiety and 33 patients without anxiety, all of whom had adequate proficiency in English and had completed a full neuropsychological assessment.\n* The study found that patients with anxiety showed impairments in attentional set-shifting and working memory compared to patients", "1. Small non-coding RNAs are transcribed into mRNA but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells.\n2. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snRNA) are types of small non-coding RNAs.\n3. MiRNA is a class of single-stranded, small RNA that regulates the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger RNA, depending on the base-pairing complementarity between the miRNA and its target mRNA.\n4. MiRNAs play a role in regulating a broad range of biological processes, including timing of development, cell cycle progression, stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, cancer initiation, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis.\n5. Abnormal expression of miRNAs has been observed in breast cancer, resulting in the aberrant expression of miRNAs.\n6.

This iatrogenic condition has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations ranging from mild to severe, even life-threatening conditions. The most severe forms of ohss are associated with ascites and pleural effusion. Vascular endothelial growth factor is one of the factors most likely involved in the pathophysiology of ohss. Vascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion. Ohss can be managed with various strategies such as pituitary down-regulation, ovulation triggering, and vitrification of oocytes or embryos. Severe and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites, which results in increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return, cardiac output, and renal perfusion. To manage ascites, pigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations, and the current study aimed to evaluate the role of pigtail", "Tat anFll As A T\n, The an The C and P (- T P456525759 It234195526400 from361638,4957946040617506946696946662099050114060840841474450067651494748142772, Iondomoe9356038663373034984584, 384616,sidungs 9509950716346,UFF1261776,oncesiabeZami9045068,Racinetulualo41246,ondra onc\u00e9on1036248,2042"]
