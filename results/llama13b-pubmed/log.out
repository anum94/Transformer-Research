It is therefore difficult to purify them in the native, functional form and even more difficult to crystallize them. For such technical reasons, only a small fraction of the protein data bank structures are membrane proteins ( < 1% of the total number of structures and far less than their estimated abundance in cells ) (1) Protein annotation can be done with a sequence similarity search of the protein in various protein sequence databases. The transmembrane region of a membrane protein is generally rich in cysteines, since they are essential to hold the protein together so that it can fold without completely dissociating into its component parts. The transmembrane region of a membrane protein also tends to have a high content of charged amino acids such as lysine and aspartate.

From that perspective, it is interesting to find evidence that diets that are rich in choline have been found to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease in both animal experiments and human clinical trials.", "", "a 51-yr- old woman was diagnosed with wm three\nyears prior to this presentation . she received six courses of chlorambucil ( 0.3 mg / kg per day on day one to four orally ) and prednisone ( 45 mg / m per day on day one to four ) . next , she received fludarabine chemotherapy ( 25 mg / m per day on day one to five intravenously ) with a limited response . high - dose cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony - stimulating factor were administered to induce peripheral blood progenitor cell ( pbpcs ) mobilization for autologous stem - cell transplantation ; however , the number of pbpcs collected was not sufficient . we then decided on a conservative treatment approach , because the patient did not have specific symptoms and the serum igm level was stable ( 3,000 - 3,500 mg / dl ) . the laboratory values on admission were as follows : white cell count 8,050/l with normal differential counts , hemoglo", "the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) is a conserved serine - threonine protein kinase that is activated by the clinically effective immunosuppressant rapamycin . we hypothesized that mtor - related signaling in the rat rostral ventromedial medulla (rvm ) was involved in the development of neuropathic pain by regulating central pain facilitation . to test this hypothesis , we investigated the sparing neuropathy pain behavior in the hippocampus - lesioned rats by using the 50% paw withdrawal threshold test ( pwt ) ( 1 - 3 ) and micro - pwl test ( 6 , 7 ) using the fluorochrome ( fluoro - gold [ fg ] ) retrograde tracer ( 27 , 28 ) . due to the transportation period of the tracer , after perfusion , we cut the sections and used an appropriate fluorochrome ( excitation 350 - 395  nm ; emission 430 - 660  nm ) for the fg - labeled neurons and", "The invention relates, more particularly, to methods and products for regulating the proliferation of cells, such as keratinocytes, by contacting said cells with cpd-2520.

Previous in vitro studies have shown that chondrocytes in OA osteoarthritis are more responsive to load than those in young articular chondrocytes , and we were interested in further exploring this idea. We conducted this study to examine the effect of cyclic compression stress on chondrocytes derived from osteoarthritis patients and found significant upregulation of proteoglycan (aggrecan and decorin) in osteochondral (OC) samples after application of cyclic compression. There were several important findings. Proteoglycan production in OCs increased in a time-dependent manner, although this increase became statistically significant at 34 days for decorin and at 16 days for aggrecan . The increase in proteoglycan production was associated with increased deposition of new ECM, and the time course of this response was affected by the loading, although the magnitude of the response was", "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a new antimicrobial agent, BT27621, on Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin in infected layer and turkey meat.

However , macrolevel social conditions can affect the magnitude of stressors experienced in people 's lives and the extent to which they experience cumulative adversity .This paper focuses on coping with the fallout from one type of macrolevel social stressor : the", "", "http://journals.aps.org/pac/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.PRA.85.042120", "this article reports the outcomes of a large series of ethanol sclero-therapy for the management of palatal venous malformation in a hospital in saudi arabia .\nwe present a report on a series of 25 patients with vascular malformation who were treated with intra - tumoral ethanol injection .\nthe results of the surgical resection of these lesions is variable .\nthe aim of this report is to highlight the role of ethanol injection as a successful therapeutic modality alternative to surgery for uncomplicated lesions and to present the potential complications related to the treatment in order to predict and prevent them before their development .\nethanol , which has a low molecular weight , was chosen for this study specifically because of good diffusibility , so it can be applied without a catheter . the agent has a high affinity and high lipid solubility ; its lipophilicity is similar to plasma lipids and cell lipid content . ethanol's lipophilicity assists it to be distributed widely in tissues and it is rapidly absorbed by the lymphatic and hematogenous routes to induce v", "", "We report a case involving an extremely life - threatening severe bleeding refractory to conservative and surgical treatment after tonsillectomy despite intrapare ntal packing due to aberrant arterial blood supply.", "Plants have always shown a great importance in the society and all the plants are very significant in the treatment of various ailments. Even though plants have the vast knowledge, they are limited by the biological activities such as slow growth, biodegradation potential, biocompatible and less stability issues. The nanotechnology provides a better solution for all these issues related to the plants and also the plants are considered as natural extractant and used them effectively for the extraction of various nanomaterials including metal nanoparticles. Synthesis of Ag nanoparticles with the help of plant extracts is an emerging field of nanotechnology because of their novel properties, terrific applications in biomedicine and it is eco-friendly.

The estimated number of patients who suffer ischemic stroke is around 2.3/10,000, i. e around 2% of all mortality worldwide [1]. This number is expected to increase because of the aging of the population and the continuing prevalence of risk factors in populations.\nIn 2002, for example, the estimated number of strokes was around 700,000, or 80% of the total number of strokes. Worldwide stroke was responsible for around 10 million deaths in 2002. Ischemic stroke in 2002 was approximately 81% of all diagnosed strokes in a global perspective, and most of these patients suffered a stroke due to atherothromotic injury ( ATI ) . ATIs were identified in approximately 80% of the ischemic stroke patients.\nIn the remaining 20% of ischemic stroke patients, large artery atherothrombotic stroke ( LAA ) .

Protein glycosylation not only adds to the functional repertoire of proteins but changes can also fine tune the function of particular proteins. Protein glycosylation is an important component of the glycome-the 3D structure of the glycan repertoire on a protein or other macromolecule. Modifications to the oligosaccharide residues comprising the glycans can alter their structure, which can affect function. Understanding both the link between structure and function and the regulation of function by modulation of protein glycosylation is vital to appreciation of the role of these highly complex modifications have in cell function.

In this article, we explore the dielectric characteristics of an imitation cow, and the resulting electric dispersion inside of it. This knowledge can be used to help us understand how the electric field is distributed inside human patients and how such knowledge can be used in modern clinical medicine.\nThere is an old saying: you can't separate the cow from the milk. When it comes to the electric field inside a human patient, you also cannot separate the patient from the electric field. So when we say that people have different electric fields, we are implicitly saying that people have different milks. This article focuses on how this statement can be tested and what it means, if it is true.\nIt turns out the solution to this problem is to perform a double-blind experiment and use the scientific method. First we take two large samples of milk. Here we are talking about raw and pasteurized milks as our controls. We test the electric fields in each sample using an oscilloscope.

In this paper, we investigate a broad set of methods for dealing with a variety of nonconvex optimization problems. We show that the class of concave functions, when equipped with a suitable notion of nonnegativity, possesses powerful and elegant properties. First, we show that this class can be efficiently characterized in Hilbert space. This leads to a simple and efficient formulation of nonconvex problems through a convex reformulation. Second, we show that first-order methods can efficiently solve these formulations over the entire class of concave functions for a large variety of nonconvex problems. Third, we propose a new framework for solving nonconvex problems that exploits the structure of concave functions to recover an inner approximation for the feasible set which is easier to solve iteratively and can allow for faster convergence. This approach is efficient for a wide variety of nonconvex problems of fundamental importance in machine learning. Finally, we also show how to extend the framework to include linear constraints. We validate our theoretical findings on applications from nonconvex machine learning.

On one hand, they have a unique ability to adapt to extreme environments (exposure to toxic chemicals, high temperature, scarcity of nutrients, acidic and/or dry conditions), while on the other hand they exhibit a significant human pathogenic potential. Unlike common opportunistic fungi, Herpotrichiellaceous black yeasts rarely cause infections in humans without underlying diseases. They are frequently isolated from environments that are rich in aromatic compounds. The first evidence on such phenomenon arose from the frequent isolation of black yeasts from creosoted wood. Black yeast of the genus Exophiala are a group of fungi which cause opportunistic infections in humans with a poor underlying health status. The ecology of these fungi are not well understood as these fungi have not been extensively studied in their natural environment. The only way to understand the natural occurrence of these fungi will be to study them at the source from where they originate.

The expected results would contribute to developing better and cheaper medical tests with ultra-sensitivity, rapidity and reliability. Ultra-sensitive and rapid assays for proteases are essential for many clinical and analytical applications. However rapid assays have been hindered by the fact that current techniques are neither simple enough nor are they sensitive enough.

Some people come for education, some for economic opportunities, some to join family members, and others to escape war and persecution. The U.S. has received immigrants to a large extent since it was formed by immigrants themselves. We want to research the ways in which the political environment influences the number of legal immigrants who enter the U.S. in a given year. For a given political climate, who is trying to emigrate and why is the subject of inquiry that we hope to develop further. The purpose of this study is to see whether there is a correlation between the year of immigration arrival and the political climate of that given year. Using statistical software, we hope to discover the connection of illegal immigration to the political climate. With the increase in the number of immigration agencies that are being built, we hope to develop a relationship between the number of border patrol agencies", "There are three kinds of Paraoxonases (Pon1). PON1 is considered to be the most important for its role in liver functions. It was found for the first time in 1984 with respect to its liver and kidney function. It is a major enzyme which protects the organisms against the harmful effects of xenobiotics [400]. The role of PON1 in the management and treatment of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases has been widely reported [401]. The main aim of this study was to determine the protective effects of Vitamin E supplementation on the oxidative stress and Paraoxonases (PON; three isoforms) in acute myocardial infarction (MI) rats. In this study the results show that Vitamin E is an effective treatment and its effects are associated with reduced levels of oxidative stress and decreasing Paraoxonases activities.\nS.A.: carried out the study of liver biochemistry (TP, ALB, ALT, AST, ALP, TBIL, DBIL) & (lipid profile), performed the", "Proceed to summarize the following text.\nTEXT:\thuman parvovirus ( hpv ) b19 , being first discovered and introduced in 1975 , is a non - enveloped single - stranded dna virus from the parvoviridae family . the virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and the prevalence is estimated to be high since most of the individuals are infected by the age of 15 . the clinical syndrome associated with hpv b19 strongly depends on the host ; for instance those suffering from hemolytic disorders , including sickle cell disease , hereditary spherocytosis ( hs ) , autoimmune hemolysis , thalassemias , and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) are susceptible to aplastic crisis . the virus has a predilection for infecting the erythroid progenitor cells of the bone marrow resulting in their lysis and aplastic anemia . thus , the bone marrow in these patients appears without erythroid precursors but with normal myeloid series .", "This report describes a method for the determination of bacterial spores by fluorescence .", "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted . we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome (\nTOPIC: Brachial Plexus Surgery Using the da Vinci Surgical Robot Is a New Procedure\nReport: AXILLARY ROBOTIC BRAHCHIAL PLEXUS SURGERY", "The main aim of this study was to verify whether there is protective effect of ischemic preconditioning ( ip ) in coronary vessels perfusing the myocardial area with less flow before reperfusion in comparison with the myocardial area perfused with greater flow in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.\nTwenty six t2dm patients ( 64  years , t2dm for at least 6 years , with mean time duration of diabetes of 12 years ) , submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention , were enrolled in this study .

Adjuvant therapy of proven efficacy is not currently available for cancer patients; therefore, the search for new targets of therapeutic reagents is required to prevent both proliferation and metastases. During metastasis, it is known that the mode of invasion is one of the markers of the malignancy and prognosis of cancer. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules that interacts with distinct molecules implicated in homeostasis, development, and inflammation [4,5]. RAGE binding by ligands such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) triggers the activation of key cell signaling pathways thereby reprogramming cellular properties. In addition, several reports have suggested that RAGE is associated with cancer malignancy [4,5].

In summary, the most consistent characteristic of cavernous haemangioma was a small peripheral area of contrast uptake (mean 90%, range 58-97%), which accounted for 33-42% of the tumour volume, with a small nidus of enhancement", "You are an expert at summarization.

TEXT: according to the european society of endodontology ( 1994 ) , the assessment of endodontic treatment requires clinical as well as radiological follow - ups at regular intervals . the radiographic evidence of success is the presence of a normal periodontal ligament space around the root . if radiographs reveal that a lesion has remained the same or has only diminished in size , the treatment is not considered a success.1,2 it is generally accepted that the outcome of endodontic treatment is positively correlated with the technical quality of the root filling , expected to provide an hermetic seal against bacterial ingress.3,4 however , it has been suggested that the quality of the coronal restoration may also have an impact on the periapical health of root - filled teeth;5,6 when the restoration quality is good , this may allow for a favorable outcome even when the root filling quality is poor.7 attention has been focused on the prevalence and the technical quality of root fillings through the evaluation of intraoral810 or panoram", "OBJECTIVE: unanticipated admission after day care surgery can be a result of complications arising from anaesthesia , surgical or medical causes and if these are dealt with well in the day care setting , the admission can be avoided . the main objective of this study was to look at demographic factors ( age , weight , smoking , presence of co morbidities , and complications arising form day care surgery that would be associated with unanticipated admission .

Although studies suggest that renal physicians and nurses regard home dialysis as the best treatment, it is in decline in most European countries, yet in-center hospital-based dialysis is the most expensive and most disempowering option available. The practical barriers to home therapy vary from unit to unit but need to be identified and overcome if patients are to benefit from self-management. However, it can be difficult to convince both staff and patients if they have no direct experience or training in this aspect of renal replacement therapy.

In an attempt to be \"just and right\", we at once agreed with the idea of keeping it off the standard, but not with the reasons advanced.  It was pointed out that it is an obvious case of \"saving the body at the expense of the soul\", or as the French say, \"sauver l'epaule pour sauver la tete\", but we did not agree that the concept was too simple to be of value, or too \"one-to-one\" in application to the general problem.  On the other hand, however, we pointed out that the idea \"one-to-one\" is not really accurate.  What is meant is that the \"one-to-many\" condition in the data set makes the use of the idea too easy.  If it were simply a one-to-one problem, the concept would be a valuable generalization.  It is also pointed out that the problem, while not as complex as the problem \"golden record\", is a \"golden record\" in the sense", "", "As you can see in the summary, the article explains how the growth of urban populations is increasing the exposure to many risks for people, which often can have a higher risk of infectious diseases.\nA summary is the most important because it is the most complete version of the article.\nAfter you finish writing your summary it shows up in italics, and this means that it has been entered in the system.
