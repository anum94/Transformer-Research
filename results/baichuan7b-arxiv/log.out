[". . . function with interval @xmath80 @xmath81 have the same sign . The sets @xmath41 correspond to the values of @xmath59 . It is known , that the largest values of the estimator @xmath20 are obtained for small values of @xmath72 which are not equal to zero . for the positive and the negative contributions of the echo - effect the estimator @xmath20 assumes different sign . thus , by checking the statistical significance of the @xmath72-th peak of a periodogram ( de method ) one can be certain that it is caused by the echo - effect because of that fact that at large @xmath72 large positive or negative contributions of the echo - effect do not appear in the periodogram . in the next stage of the de method a test is performed which is supposed to describe the probability of the result of the  @xmath72-th peak. however , when the echo - effect is not present the main contribution to the @xmath21-th peak is not the negative part of the third term of the sum ( 1 )", "In this paper , we study the direct detection of a gravitational wave from an anisotropic circular polarized sgwb using punta arrays . On the one hand , we consider the sgwb detectability as defined by the cross coeficient of the sgwb on the sky on the other hand , we calculate generalized overlap reduction functions ( orfs ) for circular polarizations of the sgwb . For isotropic and unpolarized sgwbs , we derive previous works , using the ptas detectability . When deriving cross coefficients of the sgwb , using the anisotropic patterns with spherical harmonics , we derived the dimensionless density parameter which has the relation with pulsar timing frequencies ( such as the timing residuals for pta) . Next , we studied the sgwb detectability , based on the detectability in the ptas cases as well as the pulsar timing frequencies derived in [ sec : stokes parameters for a plane gravitational wave ] . We find the gw power spectral density is factorized as two parts for", "", "The present paper tests novel numerical integrators for two - dimensional q2g , q2d quantum electrodynamics simulations."]
