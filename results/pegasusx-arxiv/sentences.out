outer accretion disk ( radius @xmath54, where @xmath55 is the gravitational radius of the black hole with mass @xmath56 ), but to account for the very extended red tail displayed by the line ( extending down to 4 kev ) a very concentrated emission at much lower radii is required. the x - ray emission of the sss, which is a type 1 agn, is dominated by a very broad emission line at @xmath18258, which is interpreted as a cyclotron feature caused by electrons moving in the magnetic field of the black hole, and is therefore interpreted as a type 2 agn, which is a type 1 agn with a

because they provide genuine examples for testing models that are less tractable in higher dimensions.@xcite for example, spin chains with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions display a

important if the dissipation process is markovian, the fluctuation process may not be, because it must satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem.@xcite the time convolution - less ( tcl ) master equation has a wider range of applicability than the quantum master equations and redfield equation, because it allows the system - bath interaction to be non - perturbative and fluctuation and dissipation to be non - markovian.@xcite in order for a non - perturbative treatment to be possible, however, the system hamiltonian and the bath interactions of the tcl equation must commute.@xcite thus, the tcl equation can not be used to treat many important problems involving molecules, atoms, and spins driven by a time - dependent laser or magnetic field. the system - bath coherence becomes particularly important if the dissipation process is markovian, the fluctuation process may not be, because it must satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem.@xcite the heom approach has been used to study such problems, which include multi - dimensional spectroscopy.@xcite recently, it was shown that system - bath coherence also plays an important role in calculations of", "given any triple of

such topology - dependent degenerate ground states suggest that the low energy theories describing the fqh states are topological gauge field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions, called chern - simons theories.@xcite so one possibility is that we may try to classify the different fqh phases by classifying all of the different possible chern - simons theories. in an attempt to obtain a systematic classification of fqh states, it was shown recently that a wide class of single - component fqh states and their topological excitations can be classified by their pattern of zeros, which describe the way ideal fqh wavefunctions go to zero when various clusters of particles are brought together.@xcite this analysis led to the discovery of some new non - abelian fqh states whose corresponding cft has not yet been identified. in the following section, we will discuss the following two examples of non - abelian bilayer states : the interlayer pfaffian state @xmath347 and", "Remarks on the use of

et al. there are evidently four distinct physical effects that have to be explained by a theory of the imf : + ( 1 ) the power - law slope at intermediate to high stellar mass, with a value close to that found by salpeter ( 1955 ) ; + ( 2 ) the flattening at low mass for clusters and star - forming regions in our galaxy ; + ( 3 ) the increase in the transition mass between power - law and flat regions of the imf in starburst galaxies, + ( 4 ) the preferential birth of high mass stars close to cluster centers. the wind - regulated imf model seems to have difficulty explaining the nearly

driven exchange coupling in magnetic tunnel junctions in 1989 @xcite, the two papers in 1996 predicted that a current flowing perpendicularly to the plane of a magnetic metal multilayer should be able to reorient the magnetization direction in one of the layers. from a technological standpoint, the two most important consequences of stt are _ i _ ) the possibility of programming a magnetic memory, such as magnetoresistive random - access memory ( mram ) @xcite, using a small direct current through the bit, rather than larger currents through adjacent programming lines, and _ ii _ ) the possibility of creating nanoscopic and ultratunable microwave signal generators without the need for any semiconductor materials. in nanocontact stnos, with their far -
